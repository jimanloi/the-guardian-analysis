She made a series of collages by cutting it up, including one in which rolls of brown packing paper are arranged in a star-like symmetrical pattern. And that\u2019s it. The Hayward\u2019s retrospective of this 53-year-old South Korean is full of stuff like this. It is immense, crowded and completely unrewarding. None of it adds up and none of it is moving \u2013 unless you are the kind of person who tears up over a venetian blind. \u201cVenetian blinds are a prominent feature,\u201d says a wall text, explaining Yang\u2019s work. \u201cShe is particularly drawn to their tilted slats.\u201d</p>    <p>In one installation, these tilted slats cover the sides of illuminated boxes. It comes as a shock when you read that this neutral-looking work is entitled 5, Rue Saint-Benoit and is meant to suggest the Paris home of the novelist Marguerite Duras where she lived as a member of the resistance in the second world war. Looking again, you see that one of the blinded crates is painted like a tricolour. Otherwise, the heavy cultural reference hangs irrelevantly in the void \u2013 and it\u2019s not the only one.</p> <p>In a new commission, lights play on an array of venetian blinds that recede like scenery in a toy theatre, choreographed to the Korean composer Isang Yun\u2019s Double Concerto for Oboe and Harp With Small Orchestra. Elsewhere, notes on metal boards muse on Primo Levi and the Holocaust, George Orwell shooting an elephant and Edward Said on Palestine, but chopped up and moved about until any meaning is lost.</p> <p>Presumably that\u2019s the point: that big ideas, grand narratives, any kind of sense at all can\u2019t stand up to the onrush of information and global complexity of our world right now. You come into the show and it\u2019s as crazy as a megacity. Traditional bells are dingling, sculptures rushing about \u2013 or at least rolling around as they are pushed on casters by specialist sculpture-pushers. These sculptures are colourful, complicated blobs of matting that sprout pointy nodes, tendrils and flowers, moving over a precisely marked-out, abstract floor drawing. What\u2019s this all about? Search me.</p> <p>Or rather, at one level, it\u2019s very easy to say what it\u2019s all about: the Crazy Complexity of Our World. Or, as the Hayward has it, the \u201chybridity\u201d and \u201cinterconnectivity\u201d of contemporary life. The trouble is, to say we live in a richly layered interconnected reality is just a fact. We all know this. Yang\u2019s art doesn\u2019t evoke much beyond the chaos and fun we experience when we go down the shops.</p>    <p>She makes a lot of use of collage, the technique invented by Picasso and developed by the dadaists to suggest the fragmentation of modern life. But there\u2019s no dirt in her collages, no wildness or randomness to shock you or make you anxious. They are neatly stylish. One series uses cut-up envelopes to create shapes that are rounded at one end and sharp at the other. They\u2019re shown over a wall-sized, black and white photograph of a sunny suburban landscape snappily called Poetics of Displacement.</p> <p>With such a grand, important title it\u2019s easy to interpret, yet hard to be bothered about. The cutout comets of course represent peoples\u2019 global mobility, the photo speaks (or rather its title does \u2013 the picture itself says nothing) of \u201cDisplacement\u201d, just as the sculptures on wheels suggest our many migrations. In another gallery, there\u2019s an installation called Storage Piece, in which her belongings are packed away in boxes. It\u2019s not an emotive story of modern life, just a dull-as-dishwater image of something universal today. When you depict the modern world this coolly and conceptually, who cares?</p>    <p>Yang does give hints of her own life. Much is made of her first exhibition, which she staged in her grandparents\u2019 empty old home. Perhaps you had to be there. But as commemorated here, it just looks like some nice lights in a decayed house. The curators clearly think they are telling the story of a great artist, but I can see nothing to justify that reverence.</p> <p>A lot of Yang\u2019s work, in fact, is pretty. So the best way to enjoy the show is probably as cool ideas for decoration. Under all the guff about interconnectivity, all the quotes from Levi and Orwell, a very gentle artist is struggling to get out. You realise this when you reach the vegetable prints. When she is at her least pretentious, Yang enjoys making pale-coloured patterns of imprinted leaves and everyday veg. They look nice, if a bit bland. She also makes bright paper cutouts that she calls Mesmerising Mesh, with intersecting patterns of triangles, masks and biomorphic shapes. Again they are attractive, but lack weight or depth.</p> <p>This art says nothing to me. Not once does it express human pain or longing, or touch on the mystery of existence, or make you look a reality in the face \u2013 it\u2019s just playing games with itself, ironically juxtaposing Korean tradition and modern banality without a shred of poetry.

As the mathematical brains that so many have relied on, and a professor who has inspired generations of designers, Kara\u2019s contribution to architecture is eminently worthy of recognition. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that, without him, many of the most daring buildings of the last two decades wouldn\u2019t exist. Or at least their columns wouldn\u2019t be as slender, their spans as dramatic, their curves as sleek.</p> <p>\u201cI see my role as making architects\u2019 dreams come true,\u201d says Kara. A prodigious enabler, he also describes his job as akin to a therapist, teasing out his collaborators\u2019 intentions and making sense of their ambitions. \u201cBut, rather than putting them on the couch, I lie on the couch with them.\u201d He is as much of a co-designer as an engineer, less of a conventional problem-solver than a question re-framer and provocateur. He asks architects why, rather than telling them how.</p>    <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.akt-uk.com/projects/peckham-library/\">Peckham Library</a> in London, which won the Stirling prize in 2000, architect Will Alsop was dead set against having columns of any kind. He wanted a massive, impossible cantilever instead. Kara convinced him that a row of slender steel poles was essential to making the reading room stand up, their jaunty angles not just adding delight, but also serving the crucial purpose of cross-bracing the structure. And so Alsop\u2019s trademark feature \u2013 the \u201cdancing\u201d column \u2013 was born.</p> <p>Similarly, Kara provided the fiendishly complex computational analysis for many of Zaha Hadid\u2019s most extreme creations, building more projects with her than any other architect. She came to him to help her realise the <a href=\"https://www.akt-uk.com/projects/phaeno-science-centre/\">Phaeno science centre</a> in Wolfsburg, Germany. Built in 2005, it is a gigantic concrete spaceship of a building, where columns flow into slabs, which in turn melt into walls, in a continuous, sinuous shell. It was one of the world\u2019s first \u201csingle surface\u201d structures with no joints, and the largest use of self-compacting concrete in Europe. Nothing like it had been attempted before. \u201cThat project almost killed us,\u201d says Kara. \u201cIt took two years of computational modelling with German weapons-grade software to make it work.\u201d</p> <p>Few others were willing to take on such gruelling tasks. But, with the attitude of an outsider with nothing to lose, Kara has always been happy to tread where others are not. \u201cThe migrant is never afraid,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause he has come with nothing, and he\u2019s willing to invest in others and push them, to a point where he benefits as well.\u201d</p> <p>Kara arrived in Cheshire aged 14, after his family was expelled from Uganda by the brutal regime of Idi Amin. He didn\u2019t speak much English and failed all his O-levels. He got a job as a welder in a fabrication yard, where he learned how to draw steel templates on the floor. \u201cI got really hooked on that drawing stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI loved the process of communicating how you make something.\u201d He attended night school while working, and ultimately landed a spot at Salford University to study civil engineering. After graduating, he spent time doing \u201chardcore engineering\u201d, first in Aberdeen, working on oil rigs, before moving into rollercoasters, relishing the challenge of gravity-defying loops. Time spent working with engineer <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/leading-architects-remember-high-tech-engineer-tony-hunt\">Anthony Hunt</a> at YRM gave him a taste for experimental fabric structures and the emerging field of computational geometry, \u201cwhich really became my thing\u201d, he says.</p> <p>When the recession hit in the 1990s, he considered giving up engineering, and had opened a couple of dry-cleaning shops to make ends meet. But his wife encouraged him to start his own practice, AKT, which he founded with two former YRM colleagues, Robin Adams and Albert Williamson-Taylor, in 1996. \u201cWe started out by reducing the steel tonnages on other people\u2019s projects,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then quickly realised that we had to chat up some architects.\u201d Kara had caught the architecture bug while working on (aborted) <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/battersea-power-station-theme-park/\">plans to turn Battersea Power Station into an Alton Towers-style theme park</a>. \u201cAfter oil rigs and rollercoasters,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cbuildings seemed dead simple.\u201d</p> <p>He started teaching at the Architectural Association, then a hotbed of the avant-garde, and, with his easy outsider charm, soon befriended the likes of Hadid, Alsop and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/16/obituary-jan-kaplick\">Jan Kaplick\u00fd</a>, of Future Systems. \u201cI felt empathy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all had a lot of difficulty building anything, but I could see the value in what they were drawing. And I enjoyed their company.\u201d</p>    <p>Kara doesn\u2019t drink, but he would happily sit and debate with Alsop, as he drained a bottle of wine, and he clearly enjoyed the glitzy camaraderie of the emerging \u201cstarchitects\u201d scene, gaining a reputation as one of the few engineers with the patience to make their madcap schemes buildable. He went on to collaborate with numerous Pritzker prize-winners, and has worked on four Stirling prize-winning buildings, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/15/sainsbury-laboratory-deserved-stirling-prize\">Sainsbury Laboratory</a> in Cambridge, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/25/bloomberg-london-hq-norman-foster-architecture-review\">Bloomberg HQ</a> in London, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/28/kingston-university-town-house-library-review-oliver-wainwright-grafton-architects-riba-gold\">Kingston University\u2019s Town House</a>.

      "bodyText": "The risk of winter blackouts in Great Britain has tumbled to its lowest in four years even after the shutdown of the UK\u2019s last coal plant, thanks to investments in low-carbon electricity sources. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) expects Britain\u2019s winter power supplies to outstrip demand by almost 9% this year in its base case scenario, the greatest margin since the winter of 2019 to 2020. The company responsible for keeping the lights on, which was bought by the government from National Grid at the start of this month, said the power supply margin for this winter was higher because Great Britain has more battery storage projects, small-scale renewables and imported electricity. The UK is expected to rely on record levels of imported electricity this winter, the first since the world\u2019s longest high-voltage power cable began importing enough clean electricity from Denmark to power 2.5m British homes. The Viking power link, which can also export British electricity to Denmark, is a vital part of the UK\u2019s strategy to wean itself off fossil fuel power by creating a flexible, low-carbon electricity grid. These steps towards Britain\u2019s legally binding 2050 climate targets are expected to more than offset the impact of retiring power plants, including the closure of the UK\u2019s last coal-fired power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, which was called on to supply 2.3% of the UK\u2019s electricity during a cold snap in January. During the Europe-wide gas crisis caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Britain kept its old coal plants on standby to keep the lights on if it was short of gas to run its power plants. However, for the winter ahead concerns have been eased by the abundant gas stores across the EU, which are 95% full. In addition, Britain expects to import gas from Norway\u2019s pipelines and via tanker from the US or Qatar through the winter months to meet the demand of power plants, factories and homes. The conflict is not considered a threat to the UK\u2019s gas supplies, according to Neso. Craig Dyke, a director at the publicly owned company, said: \u201cWhile our margin assessment has improved from previous winters, we are continuing to monitor risks and uncertainties and, if necessary, will take steps to build resilience.\u201d Neso said it was working with the government, the energy regulator and National Gas, which runs the gas system in Great Britain, to assess any emerging risks to the stability of supplies. The system operator expects to use its demand flexibility service that will result in businesses and consumers paying to reduce their energy usage at peak times. About 2.6m households and businesses received payments to help reduce the pressure on the National Grid last winter. \u201cWe and the rest of the energy industry will as always continue to prepare for a range of potential eventualities, so that we are fully prepared for this coming winter,\u201d Dyke said.",

Sources close to the Treasury said the chancellor would need to make a decision before submitting the \u201cmajor measures\u201d for her tax and spending event on 30 October to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The Treasury has set a Wednesday internal deadline to update the OBR on the chancellor\u2019s plans. The independent watchdog will then use these policies to forecast their impact on the economy and the public finances, before privately sharing its findings with Reeves on Monday next week. In a new report, the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank, which carries significant influence in the Treasury, urged Reeves to target \u201cpublic sector net worth\u201d as her debt measure to unlock as much as \u00a357bn in additional headroom for investment. One of the most flattering measurements of the government finances, which is already tracked by the OBR, the gauge takes into account the value of public assets \u2013 such as roads, schools and hospitals \u2013 as well as debts and other liabilities. Although a decision is required this week, the chancellor has until 25 October to submit her final resolution to the OBR. Reeves\u2019 budget will be the first by a Labour chancellor in a decade and a half. It is widely expected to include changes to the fiscal rules to pave the way for an increase in public investment, after hints made by the chancellor in her party conference speech in Liverpool late last month. In an apparent confirmation when asked by the Guardian last week if she was planning changes, Reeves said: \u201cWe\u2019ll set out details of the fiscal rules at the budget, but we have got to make sure we unlock that space for capital investment.\u201d Labour committed in its manifesto to two fiscal rules: balancing day-to-day expenditure with tax receipts, and getting debt falling as a share of the economy in the fifth year of forecasts.

She\u2019d been nailbitingly close to passing up the opportunity altogether: guilt-tripped by her self-pitying heroin addict mother and almost charmed back into submission by her arse of an ex-boyfriend, Alma was on the verge of staying put in her Bolton flat, complete with Julie Walters shrine and felt-tip-rendered plan for Hollywood domination. That didn\u2019t happen, thankfully. Due to a combination of her traumatic upbringing and whimsical nature, there are few characters easier to root for than this sweetly garrulous wannabe.</p> <p>As the sitcom returns, fingers remain tightly crossed. Alma is an obvious proxy for her creator, the Boltonian comedian Sophie Willan, who also spent time in care due to her mother\u2019s heroin addiction, and has also been an escort. Yet Willan no longer need fantasise about making it. Since Alma\u2019s Not Normal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/20/almas-not-normal-review-tv-comedy-at-its-rudest-and-most-fabulous\">first aired in 2021</a>, she has won Baftas, also appeared in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/oct/29/time-series-two-review-bbc-jodie-whittaker-shines-a-light-on-the-idiocy-behind-our-legal-system\">Time</a> and, Ludwig, and proved to be a delightfully daffy addition to the Taskmaster lineup. It\u2019s testament to how vividly Willan has established Alma\u2019s world \u2013 and to the likability of the 36-year-old herself \u2013 that I was desperately hoping our protagonist might enjoy a similar trajectory.</p> <p>Sadly for our hero \u2013 but fortunately for the stasis that underpins the sitcom form at its finest \u2013 she\u2019s had no such luck. Lumped with the role of a tree, Alma failed to attract the attention of a hot-shot agent and makes a bathetic return to Bolton, where her imperious grandmother Joan (Lorraine Ashbourne) is holding her mother\u2019s schizophrenic boyfriend semi-captive in her house and her best friend Leanne (Jayde Adams) is now empress of a happening bar. Blacklisted from escorting and getting nowhere with an agent who operates out the back of a chippy, she convinces Leanne to take her on.</p> <p>In another sense, however, Alma\u2019s life does mirror Willan\u2019s. The latter dedicated her Bafta to her grandmother Denise, always her biggest cheerleader, who died during the filming of the show\u2019s first series. Now we learn that Joan \u2013 a leopard print-ensconced sex machine who can be deliriously self-involved, but who is a haven of stability for Alma \u2013 has lung cancer. She\u2019s given up smoking, extolling the virtues of party blowers as a cig-substitute (\u201cyou get the same catharsis as a fag, with no harm and a fun little noise!\u201d), but otherwise is reluctant to discuss the details. In any case, she feels \u201cfine\u201d \u2013 and proves it by maniacally high-kicking in front of the dishy consultant.</p> <p>In its first series, Alma\u2019s Not Normal pulled off quite a feat: it made the tale of a neglected child who becomes a perennially disappointed woman into a comedy of unbridled joy and hilarity. That was largely the result of its effervescent dialogue, studded with mildly outrageous, genuinely funny jokes. But it was also due to the show\u2019s female-centric celebration of run-of-the-mill British life: Willan draws warmth and comfort from non-events such as Joan insisting on presenting Alma with the spam sandwich she\u2019s just refused, or her ex-boyfriend\u2019s mum plonked on a sofa drinking tea, eating biscuits and slagging off daytime TV.</p> <p>Can the show maintain the same life-affirming vibe in light of such a heartbreaking development? Broadly, yes \u2013 although series two also radiates rage and devastation; every laugh a hair\u2019s breadth from tears. The rage relates to the plight of Alma\u2019s mother Lin (Siobhan Finneran), who is back on a badly run psychiatric ward having broken her hospital order. Lin \u2013 who Happy Valley\u2019s Finneran instils with gruff childishness in a mesmerically odd and totally convincing performance \u2013 is twitchy with prominent false teeth and prone to long-winded rants about the authorities. Yet for Alma, the real villain is a Tory-decimated welfare state. As for devastation, that\u2019s reserved for her grandmother\u2019s fate. Ashbourne (who was also exceptional in the recent series of Sherwood) is inordinately hilarious and weirdly aspirational as Joan. This time she\u2019s imbued with more depth as she\u2019s reunited with her siblings (Julie Hesmondhalgh and Steve Pemberton guest star) to highly amusing but emotionally shattering effect.</p> <p>This is the final series of Alma\u2019s Not Normal \u2013 although Willan has said there is a Christmas special in the works. I\u2019m not sure what the latter would achieve, considering this run ends on such a powerfully bittersweet and satisfyingly meta note. As an elegy to her real grandmother, Alma\u2019s Not Normal is eloquent, radiantly beautiful and \u2013 in the Nuttall vernacular \u2013 totally fabulous. And as a furiously real yet incorrigibly hilarious sitcom, it\u2019s pretty much perfect.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alma\u2019s Not Normal is on BBC Two and iPlayer in the UK and Prime Video in Australia.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Mayors should be given major new powers, according to a report by the Starmerite thinktank Labour Together, which comes as officials put the finishing touches to a devolution paper due in the coming weeks. The report recommends using city and regional mayors to road-test new public sector schemes before they are rolled out nationally, and giving them more control over their budgets and allowing them to commission more local public services. If adopted, it would put elected city leaders, most of whom represent Labour, at the forefront of delivering public sector improvements across a range of areas including health, social services and welfare. It would further cement the status of mayors such as Sadiq Khan in London and Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester as some of the most powerful politicians in the country. The former Michael Gove adviser Sam Freedman, who wrote the report, said: \u201cBritain is one of the most centralised countries in the world, and by trying to manage everything, Whitehall is struggling everywhere. The mayors are the best way to build new capacity, while also increasing understanding of local needs in the way services are delivered.\u201d The report recommends giving mayors more power over health, education and employment by allowing them to commission local services directly. In regard to health, Freedman recommends allowing mayors or their deputies to chair commissioning boards, which are currently run by a mix of doctors, academics and former politicians. In several areas of government, Freedman suggests letting mayors run one-off programmes or pilot schemes, which are often commissioned by central government and run by outsourcing companies. In 2021, for example, the Department for Education contracted the Dutch recruitment agency Randstad to run its programme to extend tutoring to pupils who had fallen behind during the Covid pandemic. The scheme was beset by failures however, including low participation rates, and the company was axed from the programme. Freedman also suggests giving mayors more power over budgets, including giving them pots of money to use for whichever local public services they think most need it. Keir Starmer has endured an occasionally fractious relationship with Labour\u2019s most high-profile mayors, including Burnham and Khan. Since coming to power, however, he has made devolution one of his first priorities, with the white paper expected in the coming weeks. Officials say Labour Together\u2019s report will inform their approach, although the white paper is more likely to focus on how regional leaders can deliver growth than how they can commission public services. Starmer will meet mayors and devolved leaders from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Friday for the first meeting of his \u201ccouncil of the nations and regions\u201d. He will be accompanied by Sue Gray, whom he ousted as chief of staff over the weekend but who has been given a new role as envoy for regions and nations. Oliver Coppard, the Labour mayor of South Yorkshire, said: \u201cIf you believe that decisions are best taken by those closest to the people affected by them, then you need to give them the power to make those decisions. There is an opportunity for us to show the national government how it can reform the delivery of frontline services.\u201d",

Upon entering the room I was greeted by a sweet young cat, which appeared healthy apart from his skin condition.</p> <p>\u201cI had already done back-to-back euthanasias that morning \u2026 and upon seeing a happy young cat, I just could not face another euthanasia.\u201d</p> <p>Parody added that despite having been a vet for 10 years, \u201ceuthanasias are never easy\u201d.</p> <p>A Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons tribunal reprimanded the vet for \u201cdisgraceful\u201d professional conduct.</p> <p>It ruled she had made a \u201cseries of very poor decisions\u201d, although it recognised that at the time the vet was working under \u201cextraordinarily stressful circumstances\u201d because of the pandemic.</p> <p>Parody, who has subsequently moved to a practice in Hereford, was described by colleagues at Castle Veterinary Group as an \u201cexceptional vet\u201d who was \u201cvery fair\u201d.</p> <p>In December 2021, a woman who regularly rescued cats and who was referred to at the tribunal only as SM took ownership of Shadow.</p> <p>The owner decided to have him put down as he was \u201cvery sick\u201d with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacteria which causes lesions on the skin.</p> <p>SM consulted other vets and Shadow was scheduled to be put down by Parody five days before Christmas.</p> <p>Parody consulted a dermatologist after a colleague raised a question over whether cats with MRSA could be treated. Two days later, she shaved Shadow, castrated him and directed a colleague to remove his microchip.</p> <p>The owner was eventually told Shadow had not been put down and was \u201cshocked and elated\u201d. SM was told she would have to pay \u00a3480 to have it returned and she accepted.</p> <p>Two months later, Shadow\u2019s condition deteriorated and he was put down. Parody resigned and an investigation was launched.</p> <p>The panel noted that owing to confused communications the vet had wrongly believed the cat did not have an owner, but it said in its ruling that she \u201cshould be under no illusion of how serious it is to have a finding of disgraceful conduct in a professional respect made against her\u201d.</p>",

Parody, who worked at a surgery in Framlingham, Suffolk, said she had deemed the pet to be \u201chappy\u201d and curable. She sedated the male cat and castrated it without obtaining consent from the owner, before replacing its microchip and taking it home, the tribunal heard. The owner told the hearing that she \u201cgrieved for his little soul\u201d before she was eventually told the truth and was asked to pay \u00a3480 for the treatment. Referring to Shadow, Parody told the tribunal: \u201cThe drug Pentoject had already been drawn up. Upon entering the room I was greeted by a sweet young cat, which appeared healthy apart from his skin condition. \u201cI had already done back-to-back euthanasias that morning \u2026 and upon seeing a happy young cat, I just could not face another euthanasia.\u201d Parody added that despite having been a vet for 10 years, \u201ceuthanasias are never easy\u201d. A Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons tribunal reprimanded the vet for \u201cdisgraceful\u201d professional conduct. It ruled she had made a \u201cseries of very poor decisions\u201d, although it recognised that at the time the vet was working under \u201cextraordinarily stressful circumstances\u201d because of the pandemic. Parody, who has subsequently moved to a practice in Hereford, was described by colleagues at Castle Veterinary Group as an \u201cexceptional vet\u201d who was \u201cvery fair\u201d. In December 2021, a woman who regularly rescued cats and who was referred to at the tribunal only as SM took ownership of Shadow. The owner decided to have him put down as he was \u201cvery sick\u201d with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacteria which causes lesions on the skin. SM consulted other vets and Shadow was scheduled to be put down by Parody five days before Christmas. Parody consulted a dermatologist after a colleague raised a question over whether cats with MRSA could be treated. Two days later, she shaved Shadow, castrated him and directed a colleague to remove his microchip. The owner was eventually told Shadow had not been put down and was \u201cshocked and elated\u201d. SM was told she would have to pay \u00a3480 to have it returned and she accepted. Two months later, Shadow\u2019s condition deteriorated and he was put down. Parody resigned and an investigation was launched. The panel noted that owing to confused communications the vet had wrongly believed the cat did not have an owner, but it said in its ruling that she \u201cshould be under no illusion of how serious it is to have a finding of disgraceful conduct in a professional respect made against her\u201d.",

Establishments that feature their owners\u2019 names, with signs like \u201cRosi\u2019s Bar\u201d or \u201cKati\u2019s Kiosk\u201d are a common sight around German towns and cities, but strictly speaking they are wrong: unlike English, German does not traditionally use apostrophes to indicate the genitive case or possession. The correct spelling, therefore, would be \u201cRosis Bar\u201d, \u201cKatis Kiosk\u201d, or, as in the title of a recent viral hit, Barbaras Rhabarberbar. However, guidelines issued by the body regulating the use of Standard High German orthography have clarified that the use of the punctuation mark colloquially known as the Deppenapostroph (\u201cidiot\u2019s apostrophe\u201d) has become so widespread that it is permissible \u2013 as long as it separates the genitive \u2018s\u2019 within a proper name. The new edition of the Council for German Orthography\u2019s style guide, which prescribes grammar use at schools and public bodies in Germany, Austria and German-speaking Switzerland, lists \u201cEva\u2019s Blumenladen\u201d (Eva\u2019s Flower Shop) and \u201cPeter\u2019s Taverne\u201d (Peter\u2019s Tavern) as usable alternatives, though \u201cEva\u2019s Brille\u201d (\u201cEva\u2019s glasses\u201d) remains incorrect. The Deppenapostroph is not to be confused with the English greengrocer\u2019s apostrophe, when an apostrophe before an \u2018s\u2019 is mistakenly used to form the plural of a noun (\u201ca kilo of potato\u2019s\u201d). The new set of rules came into effect in July, and the council said a loosening of the rules in 1996 meant that \u201cRosi\u2019s Bar\u201d had strictly speaking not been incorrect for almost three decades. Yet over the past few days, German newspapers and social media networks have seen a pedants\u2019 revolt against the loosening of grammar rules. A commentator in the tabloid Bild said seeing signs like \u201cHarald\u2019s Eck\u201d (\u201cHarald\u2019s Corner\u201d) made his \u201chair stand on end\u201d, and that the proper use of the genitive form would be bemoaned by lovers of the German language. A columnist in the venerable broadsheet the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung decried the council\u2019s decision as further proof of the English language\u2019s \u201cvictory march\u201d, while one newspaper editor on LinkedIn complained that legalising the \u201cidiot\u2019s apostrophe\u201d amounted to \u201cgenuflecting to English\u201d. Some linguists question whether the rise of the possessive apostrophe has much to do with the influence of English at all, however. \u201cThe familiarity of English names may be a factor, but it could just as well stem from a desire to avoid confusion,\u201d said Anatol Stefanowitsch, a linguist at Berlin\u2019s Freie Universit\u00e4t. \u201cWhat we tend to see when a language interacts with another prestige language is that it incorporates its vocabulary, and not grammar.\u201d Even before the rule clarification, the German orthographic council permitted the use of the possessive apostrophe for the sake of clarity, such as \u201cAndrea\u2019s Bar\u201d to make clear that the owner is called Andrea and not Andreas. \u201cThere is a long tradition of conservative circles fretting about international influences on the German languages,\u201d said Stefanowitsch. \u201cIt used to be French, and now it\u2019s mainly English\u201d.

It is unclear whether, and how much, she will be paid for her advisory role, although she is understood to have agreed a severance package.</p> <p>John Healey, the defence secretary, denied that Gray leaving her post fewer than 100 days into the new administration meant the government was at crisis point. \u201cNo, I\u2019d characterise this as a new government getting on with the job,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that \u201csadly, it\u2019s nothing new\u201d to see a senior No 10 aide become \u201ca lightning rod for criticism\u201d, echoing comments made by the party\u2019s former deputy leader Harriet Harman, who said \u201cmissteps\u201d and \u201cclunkiness\u201d were to be expected when a party first returned to office after a long period in opposition.</p> <p>Senior Labour figures welcomed the changes, which they suggested were overdue.

He can\u2019t even run his own No 10 Downing Street operation, let alone run the country. This has all fallen apart a lot faster than I was expecting.\u201d</p>",

The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said he was now \u201ccompletely focused\u201d on delivery. \u201cHe\u2019s made the right changes to ensure that we have strengthened the No 10 operation to deliver the change the country voted for.\u201d But he appeared to accept that Gray\u2019s departure meant Starmer recognised the internal problems in Downing Street. \u201cI think it\u2019s right to reflect on the first weeks and months in office to ensure that you do have the right structures in place going forward to deliver change for the country.\u201d Asked whether the prime minister viewed his first 100 days in office, which have been beset by rows and infighting, as a success, he responded: \u201cIt\u2019s up to the public to determine what is success for them.\u201d The prime minister was first warned he needed to \u201cget a grip\u201d on his Downing Street operation by senior advisers some weeks ago, and has spent the intervening period drawing up a plan. \u201cWhen he acts, he acts decisively, but he won\u2019t have made the decision without thinking through the implications,\u201d one aide said. Senior officials believed that he would get just one opportunity for a reset, so had to get it right. McSweeney\u2019s early focus will be on major events including Starmer\u2019s first summit of the nations and regions on Friday, a big investment summit on Monday and \u2013 a key milestone in the future direction of the government \u2013 the budget. He will try to speedily resolve the dispute over special advisers\u2019 pay, which pitched Gray against political aides across government, their furious response to finding out she was paid more than Starmer helping to hasten her departure. Some cabinet ministers have responded nervously to McSweeney\u2019s appointment because, despite his political skills, he has little experience of Whitehall. However, his allies said he was \u201calive to the gaps\u201d and aware of the loss of Gray\u2019s institutional knowledge. The appointment of a new principal private secretary, Ninjeri Pandit, as well as the start of the process to replace the outgoing cabinet secretary, Simon Case, should, they believe, help bolster the civil service side of the operation. Gray has been appointed the prime minister\u2019s envoy to the nations and regions, a civil service post based in the Cabinet Office, her old department. It is unclear whether, and how much, she will be paid for her advisory role, although she is understood to have agreed a severance package. John Healey, the defence secretary, denied that Gray leaving her post fewer than 100 days into the new administration meant the government was at crisis point. \u201cNo, I\u2019d characterise this as a new government getting on with the job,\u201d he said. He added that \u201csadly, it\u2019s nothing new\u201d to see a senior No 10 aide become \u201ca lightning rod for criticism\u201d, echoing comments made by the party\u2019s former deputy leader Harriet Harman, who said \u201cmissteps\u201d and \u201cclunkiness\u201d were to be expected when a party first returned to office after a long period in opposition. Senior Labour figures welcomed the changes, which they suggested were overdue. John McTernan, a former political director under Tony Blair, said No 10 had been \u201cpolitically underpowered\u201d with \u201cno grip\u201d on the narrative. Blair\u2019s former spin chief, Alastair Campbell, warned Starmer against taking \u201ctoo many missteps\u201d and allowing a \u201csense of vacuum\u201d to develop. The shadow Commons leader, Chris Philp, said: \u201cWhat this shows us is that Keir Starmer\u2019s government has collapsed into chaos after just 93 days. He can\u2019t even run his own No 10 Downing Street operation, let alone run the country. This has all fallen apart a lot faster than I was expecting.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI think the 50m sprint is a great opportunity for me,\u201d Adam Peaty says with a glint in his steely gaze as he reveals that, after winning two golds and a silver medal in the 100m breaststroke at three successive Olympic Games, he is ready to keep swimming until 2028. After a bid from World Aquatics, the sport\u2019s governing body, to persuade the IOC to <a href=\"https://swimswam.com/smh-world-aquatics-has-formally-requested-addition-of-50m-stroke-events-for-the-olympics\">include more sprint events</a> at the Los Angeles Olympics, the greatest breaststroke swimmer in history could resist retirement.</p> <p>\u201cIf the 50 metre is part of that I will 100% dedicate myself to getting there,\u201d Peaty continues. \u201cIf the 50 metre isn\u2019t part of that then it\u2019s a big question mark. It\u2019s a 50-50 decision.\u201d</p> <p>Peaty, who will turn 30 in December, looks intently at me as he pauses. \u201cYou\u2019ve documented my journey for a very long time, almost 10 years, and I remember our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/13/adam-peaty-interview-swimming\">first interview in 2015</a> in Salford. I\u2019ve changed so much since then and I\u2019ve also got so much more responsibility now. It\u2019s no longer a question of: \u2018Do I want to do it?\u2019 It\u2019s whether my family wants me to do it, like [his fiancee] Holly, [his son] George and hopefully other kids we have. It\u2019s no longer a selfish decision and we have to take that into consideration as it is incredibly hard.\u201d</p> <p>But the lure of the 50m sprint is addictive for Peaty. \u201cI\u2019m a very powerful sprinter. I can do that all day long,\u201d he says with the old relish which drove him to such heights in the 100m discipline. Peaty was unbeaten in that event for eight years and his shock defeat at the 2022 Commonwealth Games culminated in a distressing mental breakdown which made him think he might never swim again. But Peaty, with his characteristic grit allied to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/24/adam-peaty-it-takes-huge-wisdom-to-feel-grateful-for-what-we-have\">newfound equanimity</a>, found a way back.</p> <p>This summer, at the Paris Olympics, he won silver in the 100m breaststroke. He swam with Covid, which was confirmed the next morning, and lost his third consecutive gold medal by just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/28/adam-peaty-falls-agonisingly-short-in-bid-for-third-100m-breaststroke-title\">two-hundredths of a second</a>. Peaty cried when interviewed after the race but his changed philosophy shone through. \u201cI am not crying because I have come second,\u201d Peaty said. \u201cI am crying because of how much it took to get here. In my heart I have won. These are happy tears.\u201d</p>    <p>But it seemed as if Peaty could have swum his last race in the 4x100m medley. He and the British relay team just missed a medal in a race won by China. The result left a bitter taste for Peaty because Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, two of the victorious quartet, had previously tested positive for traces of banned performance-enhancing drugs. Neither were sanctioned as the results were accepted as food contamination.</p> <p>Peaty said that he \u201cmight have to step away from the sport\u201d because \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/04/adam-peaty-if-you-touch-and-you-know-youre-cheating-youre-not-really-winning\">it hurts too much</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Back home, on a quiet October morning, a new energy courses through him when I ask if he might even race in both the 50m and the 100m breaststroke in 2028. \u201cI could, yeah,\u201d he says with a sparky grin. \u201cI\u2019m a happy-go-lucky guy but that decision relies 100% on the 50m. If the 50m sprints for breaststroke, fly and backstroke, for both genders, are included I think they\u2019ll compromise by maybe taking out some of the distance events.\u201d</p> <p>Peaty has already considered how he might prepare for a return to competition. He is engaged to Holly, the daughter of Gordon Ramsay, and his son was born four years ago when he was in a relationship with Eirianedd Munro. His life is now not really suited to the kind of grinding commitment that meant he swam between 10,000m to 12,000m in training every day.</p> <p>Would he train differently for the 50m? \u201cThe 100 requires a lot more training and aerobic fitness. That is more punishing. But it\u2019s not impossible to do both. If I know there\u2019s a 50m in 2028, that\u2019s one I\u2019m going to target. But I will also train for the 100 and see what we do there. For the 100 I would need to swim at least 9,000m a day. But if I just went for the 50m, I could drop my training to 5,000m or potentially even 4,000m a day.\u201d</p> <p>After all our talk of future possibilities it feels right to return to his tumultuous summer. Peaty once said that \u201csecond, for me, is losing.\u201d Does he still feel as positive and philosophical about winning silver in Paris? \u201cAbsolutely. As time passes, more wisdom comes. I did everything I could with the cards I was dealt. But of course you have moments of: \u2018What if I did this or that? \u2018You\u2019re a little disappointed because it\u2019s 0.02 of a second [between silver and gold].\u201d</p>    <p>Peaty laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking ridiculous. But I couldn\u2019t have delivered a better result with what I had. You can\u2019t do much when your body is fighting illness. I really suffered because of that. But when I got my medal it was for Holly and George and I was like: \u2018There\u2019s nothing that could have replaced this feeling, ever.\u2019 Forget all the medals and world records. That doesn\u2019t define me. Being a father defines me. Being a husband, hopefully next year, defines me. Being a good person and having good relationships with people defines me.\u201d</p> <p>He is keen to mentor young swimmers and people from underprivileged backgrounds and it is typical of Peaty\u2019s enhanced empathy that he should express his happiness for Nicol\u00f2 Martinenghi, the new Olympic champion whom he had beaten countless times before. \u201cI\u2019ve raced Nicol\u00f2 for a very long time and he\u2019s a great guy, and great for the sport. Out of all the others in the field I wanted him to win it. So it was great to share the joy with him.\u201d</p> <p>The race was won in a slow time \u2013 59.03 compared to Peaty\u2019s world record 56.88. Peaty also swam quicker in the semi-final and at the British trials. \u201cI\u2019ve been faster a huge amount of times, even when I haven\u2019t been rested. I don\u2019t want to say it was a slow pool, because there was a lot of fast swimming. But that was such a slow time for me because of the circumstances that I was in. Normally I could do 50m easily underwater to warm up my lungs. Because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/adam-peaty-olympic-games-relay-hopes-in-doubt-after-covid-positive\">I had Covid</a>, which I didn\u2019t know at the time, I got to 15m on the morning of the final, and I was like: \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 I was down to about 30% of what I am normally capable of. So once you put it in that context then you say: \u2018Wow, actually I\u2019m very blessed to have done what I did.\u2019 I\u2019m a man of my faith that God has put me in this place for a reason. A silver medal may change my thinking and the rest of my life in a better way.\u201d</p> <p>Did his heart sink when he woke up feeling poorly on the morning of the final? \u201cNo. I\u2019ve been trained by Mel Marshall and worked with some incredible people like [the sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters. So it was like: \u2018Oh, OK. I\u2019ve got a headache, a bit of a fever and sore throat\u2019. But in my mind I was soon saying: \u2018I don\u2019t care, let\u2019s just go.\u2019 Me and Mel would always say: \u2018Get over the trench and just charge.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve got a broken ankle or a sore throat. I could have easily gone: \u2018I\u2019m going to pull out because I\u2019m ill.\u2019 But how would that define me for the rest of my life? I was like: \u2018No, we\u2019re going to give our absolute best here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Peaty returns to the pool he will initially have to train without the guidance of Marshall. She is an outstanding coach who has been with him since he was a teenager. But, having said that sport in the UK left her and other coaches, especially women, feeling disempowered, Marshall has moved to Australia to start a new job. Did she talk to Peaty, with whom she remains so close, about that disempowerment?</p> <p>\u201cYes, she did. From my perspective she is an incredible coach that has been undervalued, under-supported and sometimes even [stopped from making] decisions which would have made her an even better coach. But like any high-performance job, you have people who will try and bring you down. People reading this will know who they are.</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just sport in this country. It will not change until someone goes: \u2018This is not good enough.\u2019 Mel has taken the decision to go to Australia because she\u2019s finding that value from them. Why would you work somewhere where you didn\u2019t feel valued? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p>    <p>Peaty also questions the undercurrent of doping which swirls around elite swimming. When asked what he thought of the fact that 11 swimmers were allowed to compete in Paris after previously testing positive for PEDs he says: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. I think we would all say that you want people competing fairly and with honour. I don\u2019t think Wada [the World Anti-Doping Authority] have been stern enough and hard enough. That has to change.</p> <p>\u201cThe ITA, the international testing agency, has a formula going forward where only one governing body around the world controls the testing procedure with no bias. That\u2019s going to be the challenge for sport now. How can we shift to this system? I have absolutely no quarrels with having all my testing results online for anyone to view from any country. Why isn\u2019t that something that\u2019s implemented? We need 100% transparency because testing should not be hidden. For me, it was the lack of transparency and most of it was very suspicious and only came out three years later after a leak reported by journalists.\u201d</p> <p>In April a New York Times investigation reported that 23 Chinese swimmers at the Tokyo Olympics had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/22/wada-defends-its-actions-over-chinese-swimmers-doping-allegations\">tested positive for trimetazidine</a>, a banned substance, at a training camp just months before those Games began. The swimmers were cleared to compete because Wada determined it was<strong> \u201c</strong>not in a position to disprove the possibility that contamination was the source\u201d after a<strong> </strong>Chinese anti-doping investigation attributed the contamination to a hotel kitchen.<strong> </strong>An outcry following the NYT article prompted Wada to commission an independent prosecutor which supported their handling of the case. Peaty, though, stresses that \u201cwe need a system that gives fans 100% trust [in the testing procedure and the swimmers].\u201d</p> <p>Peaty is an <a href=\"https://castore.com/\">ambassador for Castore</a> , the sportswear brand he has worked with for many years, and he has been too busy to feel the post-Olympic blues. But does he miss the strict routine of training while talking about so many wider issues?</p> <p>\u201cYes and no. Sometimes I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow, I wish I was just swimming now as it\u2019s my safe zone.\u2019 But I wouldn\u2019t be learning and growing if I didn\u2019t put myself into these uncomfortable situations that are very important for me to be the person I want to be for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>But, as Peaty is so driven to race, he could soon be ready to start the next Olympic cycle. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says with a determined smile. \u201cIt\u2019s like people climb Everest every season, and not everyone, including some of the best climbers in the world, will make it. The climbing mentality is that losing is still an experience. Sometimes it\u2019s even more important than making the summit because it really pushes you to find out who you are. It\u2019s the same with sport \u2013 and with me.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI think the 50m sprint is a great opportunity for me,\u201d Adam Peaty says with a glint in his steely gaze as he reveals that, after winning two golds and a silver medal in the 100m breaststroke at three successive Olympic Games, he is ready to keep swimming until 2028. After a bid from World Aquatics, the sport\u2019s governing body, to persuade the IOC to include more sprint events at the Los Angeles Olympics, the greatest breaststroke swimmer in history could resist retirement. \u201cIf the 50 metre is part of that I will 100% dedicate myself to getting there,\u201d Peaty continues. \u201cIf the 50 metre isn\u2019t part of that then it\u2019s a big question mark. It\u2019s a 50-50 decision.\u201d Peaty, who will turn 30 in December, looks intently at me as he pauses. \u201cYou\u2019ve documented my journey for a very long time, almost 10 years, and I remember our first interview in 2015 in Salford. I\u2019ve changed so much since then and I\u2019ve also got so much more responsibility now. It\u2019s no longer a question of: \u2018Do I want to do it?\u2019 It\u2019s whether my family wants me to do it, like [his fiancee] Holly, [his son] George and hopefully other kids we have. It\u2019s no longer a selfish decision and we have to take that into consideration as it is incredibly hard.\u201d But the lure of the 50m sprint is addictive for Peaty. \u201cI\u2019m a very powerful sprinter. I can do that all day long,\u201d he says with the old relish which drove him to such heights in the 100m discipline. Peaty was unbeaten in that event for eight years and his shock defeat at the 2022 Commonwealth Games culminated in a distressing mental breakdown which made him think he might never swim again. But Peaty, with his characteristic grit allied to a newfound equanimity, found a way back. This summer, at the Paris Olympics, he won silver in the 100m breaststroke. He swam with Covid, which was confirmed the next morning, and lost his third consecutive gold medal by just two-hundredths of a second. Peaty cried when interviewed after the race but his changed philosophy shone through. \u201cI am not crying because I have come second,\u201d Peaty said. \u201cI am crying because of how much it took to get here. In my heart I have won. These are happy tears.\u201d But it seemed as if Peaty could have swum his last race in the 4x100m medley. He and the British relay team just missed a medal in a race won by China. The result left a bitter taste for Peaty because Qin Haiyang and Sun Jiajun, two of the victorious quartet, had previously tested positive for traces of banned performance-enhancing drugs. Neither were sanctioned as the results were accepted as food contamination. Peaty said that he \u201cmight have to step away from the sport\u201d because \u201cit hurts too much\u201d. Back home, on a quiet October morning, a new energy courses through him when I ask if he might even race in both the 50m and the 100m breaststroke in 2028. \u201cI could, yeah,\u201d he says with a sparky grin. \u201cI\u2019m a happy-go-lucky guy but that decision relies 100% on the 50m.

His life is now not really suited to the kind of grinding commitment that meant he swam between 10,000m to 12,000m in training every day.

The registrar, who can only be named as Dr U, said he had supported the nurse because she was \u201cstruggling with her mental health\u201d but that he now believed he had been \u201cmisled and maybe manipulated\u201d. Giving evidence to the Thirlwall inquiry on Monday, Dr U said he \u201cwasn\u2019t aware of the full clinical picture\u201d when he began messaging the nurse in June 2016 \u2013 a year after she murdered her first newborn victim at the Countess of Chester hospital. By this time senior doctors openly suspected that Letby, now 34, was harming babies and had demanded that she be removed from the hospital\u2019s neonatal unit. Rachel Langdale KC, counsel to the inquiry, said Dr U had exchanged 1,355 Facebook messages with Letby from June 2016, spanning from \u201cquite frivolous casual conversation\u201d to \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d discussions about newborn patients. Asked to explain the messages, the registrar said: \u201cLetby was struggling with her mental health and I think I picked up on that and I offered some support and that support, it grew, and I understand that she slept very poorly because of worry and anxiety. \u201cThere were often messages that were passed throughout the day and sometimes late at night [and] earlier in the morning.\u201d In one message after Letby was removed from the neonatal unit in July 2016, Dr U told her: \u201cYou\u2019re still the best [neonatal unit] nurse I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d In another he wrote: \u201cIf anyone says anything to you about not being good enough or performing adequately I want you to promise me that you give me details to provide a statement.\u201d The public inquiry was told that Dr U provided Letby with confidential information about the efforts to investigate the cause of unusual and unexpected deaths on the neonatal unit after she was removed from it in July 2016. Dr U said he wanted to \u201creassure her\u201d at the time but that he now believed this was a \u201cmassive mistake\u201d. He said \u201cin hindsight\u201d he did not believe the messages were appropriate and that the parents of the babies involved would find them \u201cvery upsetting\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve reflected on this daily since \u2013 and certainly since my first police interviews in January 2018 \u2013 and I think I\u2019ve become more aware that I wasn\u2019t aware of the full clinical picture and I provided support by being misled and maybe manipulated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for that I am really sorry that things have come to end as they have. I have a lot of regrets about how that period of time took place.\u201d The Thirlwall inquiry was also told that Dr U had secured Letby a placement at another hospital in January 2017 \u2013 six months after she had been moved from frontline nursing to a clerical role due to concerns about her harming babies. The inquiry heard a statement on behalf of the hospital \u2013 which cannot be identified for legal reasons \u2013 confirming that Letby attended on various dates between January and April 2017 under Dr U\u2019s supervision. In the statement, a hospital executive said Dr U\u2019s request on Letby\u2019s behalf was \u201cinformal in nature\u201d and that senior managers had been unaware, \u201ctherefore no inquiries had been made about her role or background\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Green groups have reacted with fury to reports that BP has dropped a target to cut its oil output in the next five years, saying the company was prioritising profits over the health of the planet.</p> <p>Campaign groups including Greenpeace and Reclaim Finance slammed the move that would potentially result in the oil company scrapping its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/03/bps-green-agenda-all-at-sea-as-sinking-profits-forecast-renews-fossil-fuel-call\">plan to reduce oil and gas output by 25% by 2030</a> under a strategy reset by the company.</p> <p>The move, reported by Reuters, would be further evidence of the chief executive Murray Auchincloss\u2019s plan to scale back some of the company\u2019s green aims in an attempt to gain investor confidence and grow returns, through its more profitable oil and gas operations.</p> <p>The company is also targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico to boost output, the news agency said.</p> <p>BP and rival Shell were among the top risers on the FTSE 100 on Monday, as the price of oil rose above the $80-a-barrel mark for the first time since August. Brent crude was up about 3.5% at $80.85 a barrel.</p> <p>A BP spokesperson said: \u201cAs Murray said at the start of the year in our fourth-quarter results, the direction is the same \u2013 but we are going to deliver as a simpler, more focused, and higher value company.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the reports, Philip Evans, the Greenpeace UK senior climate campaigner, said the move was further proof that the future of the planet could not be left in the hands of fossil fuel bosses.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Auchincloss is hell-bent on prioritising company profits and shareholder wealth above all else as extreme floods and wildfires rack up billions of dollars in damages, destroying homes and lives all over the world,\u201d Evans said.</p> <p>The Reclaim Finance stewardship campaigner Agathe Masson said BP was \u201cthrowing any pretence of climate action out of the window in pursuit of increased production\u201d and urged investors to vote against directors at the next annual shareholder meeting.</p> <p>She said: \u201cBP might be happy to see the planet burn in the name of profits, but investors must take a longer view and reject this climate-wrecking strategy.\u201d</p> <p>The latest move would be a further step back by BP from its previously more ambitious green targets after it pledged under the former chief executive Bernard Looney in 2020 to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, and rapidly grow investment in renewables.</p> <p>This was scaled back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/07/bp-profits-windfall-tax-gas-prices-ukraine-war\">25% in February 2023 under Looney</a>, meaning that its oil and gas production would be about 2m barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2030. That announcement came as the company posted record profits of $28bn in 2022.</p> <p>Looney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/12/bp-boss-bernard-looney-to-resign-after-failing-to-reveal-ties-with-colleagues\">left in September</a> last year after admitting he failed to fully disclose a series of personal relationships with his colleagues to the board.</p> <p>He was replaced permanently by the former finance chief Auchincloss in January, who has pivoted away from the renewables focus and back towards oil and gas.</p> <p>BP spent $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) on renewables, hydrogen, EV charging and biofuels in 2023. It has also invested in 6GW of offshore wind in the UK and has also received backing from the government for its \u00a34bn carbon capture scheme in on Teesside.</p> <p>However, in recent months it has scaled back its investment in renewables, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/27/bp-imposes-hiring-freeze-and-halts-new-offshore-wind-projects\">including halting all new offshore wind projects</a> in June to placate investors unhappy with the company\u2019s green targets.</p> <p>It has also signed investment deals for three new oil projects in Iraq recently, as well as the development of Kaskida and Tiber oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Auchincloss is expected to reveal the full details of his strategy, including the removal of the target, in February, but sources have told Reuters that this had already been scrapped. The company continues to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>James Alexander, the chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association said: \u201cMost oil and gas majors have consistently failed to invest enough into transition technologies, setting targets and making claims that have often been abandoned or debunked.</p> <p>\u201cThe transition will not wait for them. The gap they have left is already being filled by renewables companies.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday BP\u2019s rival Shell said that refining profit margins had dropped by almost a third in the three months to the end of September, blaming slowing global demand for the fall.</p> <p>It said that indicative refining margins dropped to $5.5 a barrel in quarter three from $7.7 a barrel in the previous period.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Green groups have reacted with fury to reports that BP has dropped a target to cut its oil output in the next five years, saying the company was prioritising profits over the health of the planet. Campaign groups including Greenpeace and Reclaim Finance slammed the move that would potentially result in the oil company scrapping its plan to reduce oil and gas output by 25% by 2030 under a strategy reset by the company. The move, reported by Reuters, would be further evidence of the chief executive Murray Auchincloss\u2019s plan to scale back some of the company\u2019s green aims in an attempt to gain investor confidence and grow returns, through its more profitable oil and gas operations. The company is also targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico to boost output, the news agency said. BP and rival Shell were among the top risers on the FTSE 100 on Monday, as the price of oil rose above the $80-a-barrel mark for the first time since August. Brent crude was up about 3.5% at $80.85 a barrel. A BP spokesperson said: \u201cAs Murray said at the start of the year in our fourth-quarter results, the direction is the same \u2013 but we are going to deliver as a simpler, more focused, and higher value company.\u201d Responding to the reports, Philip Evans, the Greenpeace UK senior climate campaigner, said the move was further proof that the future of the planet could not be left in the hands of fossil fuel bosses. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Auchincloss is hell-bent on prioritising company profits and shareholder wealth above all else as extreme floods and wildfires rack up billions of dollars in damages, destroying homes and lives all over the world,\u201d Evans said. The Reclaim Finance stewardship campaigner Agathe Masson said BP was \u201cthrowing any pretence of climate action out of the window in pursuit of increased production\u201d and urged investors to vote against directors at the next annual shareholder meeting. She said: \u201cBP might be happy to see the planet burn in the name of profits, but investors must take a longer view and reject this climate-wrecking strategy.\u201d The latest move would be a further step back by BP from its previously more ambitious green targets after it pledged under the former chief executive Bernard Looney in 2020 to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, and rapidly grow investment in renewables. This was scaled back to 25% in February 2023 under Looney, meaning that its oil and gas production would be about 2m barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2030. That announcement came as the company posted record profits of $28bn in 2022. Looney left in September last year after admitting he failed to fully disclose a series of personal relationships with his colleagues to the board. He was replaced permanently by the former finance chief Auchincloss in January, who has pivoted away from the renewables focus and back towards oil and gas. BP spent $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) on renewables, hydrogen, EV charging and biofuels in 2023. It has also invested in 6GW of offshore wind in the UK and has also received backing from the government for its \u00a34bn carbon capture scheme in on Teesside. However, in recent months it has scaled back its investment in renewables, including halting all new offshore wind projects in June to placate investors unhappy with the company\u2019s green targets. It has also signed investment deals for three new oil projects in Iraq recently, as well as the development of Kaskida and Tiber oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico. Auchincloss is expected to reveal the full details of his strategy, including the removal of the target, in February, but sources have told Reuters that this had already been scrapped. The company continues to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. James Alexander, the chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association said: \u201cMost oil and gas majors have consistently failed to invest enough into transition technologies, setting targets and making claims that have often been abandoned or debunked. \u201cThe transition will not wait for them. The gap they have left is already being filled by renewables companies.\u201d On Monday BP\u2019s rival Shell said that refining profit margins had dropped by almost a third in the three months to the end of September, blaming slowing global demand for the fall. It said that indicative refining margins dropped to $5.5 a barrel in quarter three from $7.7 a barrel in the previous period.",

A Trump administration, Vance warned, \u201cwould stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals\u201d \u2013 a threat to withhold federal funds to universities. Campus administrations and police departments have come under scrutiny for a heavy-handed response to the protests, and, in the case of universities, a clampdown on pro-Palestinian speech, in part in response to pressure from politicians. In an effort to neutralize tensions leading up to the anniversary, the University of Maryland revoked its permit for an SJP vigil planned for Monday, announcing that only university-sanctioned events would be permitted on the day. A federal judge reinstated the permit after the group filed a lawsuit alleging its first amendment rights had been violated. At Wake Forest University in North Carolina, a talk planned for Monday by Rabab Abdulhadi, a Palestinian American scholar, was cancelled after students circulated a petition against it, drawing criticism from the free expression group Pen America. The university said it was not confident it could ensure security at the event. Abdulhadi called the cancellation \u201ca new McCarthyist attack intended to silence Palestinian voices and criminalize Palestine in the academy\u201d. Elsewhere, synagogues and other Jewish institutions held vigils throughout the day. The progressive group If Not Now planned memorials in a handful of US cities to \u201cmourn every Israeli, Palestinian, and Lebanese life taken \u2013 every universe destroyed\u201d. The anniversary comes amid rising tensions, as Israel has vowed retaliation for an Iranian missile strike that itself was a retaliation for a series of high-profile assassinations attributed to Israel. The escalating tit-for-tat has led to fears that a wider regional war could quickly spin out of control.

Civilians on all sides have suffered too much. All sides must now step back from the brink and find the courage of restraint.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer described the firing of 180 missiles at Israel as \u201cnot a defensive action by Iran, it was an act of aggression \u2026 in response to the death of a terrorist leader\u201d. Iran\u2019s attack was prompted by the Israeli killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut 10 days ago.</p> \n<p>He said Hezbollah had fired a year-long barrage of attacks at Israel, forcing 60,000 people to flee from their homes, and said UN resolutions required Hezbollah to move back to north of the Litani River.</p> \n<p>Starmer also indicated the UK would take no part in any retaliation by Israel against Iran.</p> \n<p>Referring to the 7 October attack, he told MPs: \u201cNobody in this house can truly imagine what it feels like to cower under the bodies of your friends hoping a terrorist won\u2019t find you, mere minutes after dancing at a music festival.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody in this house can truly imagine seeing your city, your homes, your schools, your hospitals, your businesses obliterated, with your neighbours and family buried underneath. It is beyond our comprehension, and with that should come a humility.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the first anniversary of the 7 October attack was also a \u201cday of grief\u201d for the wider Middle East.</p> \n<p>\u201cOver 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, tens of thousands orphaned, almost 2 million displaced, facing disease, starvation, desperation, without proper healthcare or shelter,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cIt is a living nightmare and it must end.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although he admitted the chances of a ceasefire seemed remote, let alone a two-state solution, Starmer said diplomacy was slow and required the UK to work in unity with international partners. He added that Palestine deserved recognition as a state but said this should happen at the point of maximum impact.</p> \n<p>Starmer denied suggestions that there had been any stepping back in the government\u2019s support for Israel, and rejected repeated calls for a complete ban on UK arms exports to the country. He said \u201cto do so would include a ban on arms for defensive purposes\u201d, something he opposed. However, he issued stern words over the Israeli government\u2019s approach to aid in Gaza.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are ongoing restrictions in aid that are impossible to justify. Israel must open more crossings,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cCrucially, they must provide a safe haven for aid workers. Too many have been killed, including three British citizens. Israel must act now so that, together with our allies, we can surge humanitarian support ahead of the winter.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the statement progressed, more MPs broke the call for unity, either demanding tougher action on Iran or decrying the death toll of children and calling for a ban on arms sales.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has urged all sides to pull back from the brink in the Middle East as he addressed the House of Commons on the anniversary of the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. With Israel yet to decide how to respond to Iran\u2019s unprecedented missile strike last week, the prime minister said he supported \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to defend herself against Iran\u2019s aggression, in line with international law\u201d. But he added: \u201cThe region cannot endure another year of this. Civilians on all sides have suffered too much. All sides must now step back from the brink and find the courage of restraint.\u201d Starmer described the firing of 180 missiles at Israel as \u201cnot a defensive action by Iran, it was an act of aggression \u2026 in response to the death of a terrorist leader\u201d. Iran\u2019s attack was prompted by the Israeli killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut 10 days ago. He said Hezbollah had fired a year-long barrage of attacks at Israel, forcing 60,000 people to flee from their homes, and said UN resolutions required Hezbollah to move back to north of the Litani River. Starmer also indicated the UK would take no part in any retaliation by Israel against Iran. Referring to the 7 October attack, he told MPs: \u201cNobody in this house can truly imagine what it feels like to cower under the bodies of your friends hoping a terrorist won\u2019t find you, mere minutes after dancing at a music festival. \u201cNobody in this house can truly imagine seeing your city, your homes, your schools, your hospitals, your businesses obliterated, with your neighbours and family buried underneath. It is beyond our comprehension, and with that should come a humility.\u201d He said the first anniversary of the 7 October attack was also a \u201cday of grief\u201d for the wider Middle East. \u201cOver 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, tens of thousands orphaned, almost 2 million displaced, facing disease, starvation, desperation, without proper healthcare or shelter,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cIt is a living nightmare and it must end.\u201d Although he admitted the chances of a ceasefire seemed remote, let alone a two-state solution, Starmer said diplomacy was slow and required the UK to work in unity with international partners. He added that Palestine deserved recognition as a state but said this should happen at the point of maximum impact. Starmer denied suggestions that there had been any stepping back in the government\u2019s support for Israel, and rejected repeated calls for a complete ban on UK arms exports to the country. He said \u201cto do so would include a ban on arms for defensive purposes\u201d, something he opposed. However, he issued stern words over the Israeli government\u2019s approach to aid in Gaza. \u201cThere are ongoing restrictions in aid that are impossible to justify. Israel must open more crossings,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cCrucially, they must provide a safe haven for aid workers. Too many have been killed, including three British citizens. Israel must act now so that, together with our allies, we can surge humanitarian support ahead of the winter.\u201d As the statement progressed, more MPs broke the call for unity, either demanding tougher action on Iran or decrying the death toll of children and calling for a ban on arms sales.",

On Friday, he was upbeat as he spoke about shelter availability and repair trucks a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene\">Hurricane Helene</a> mowed down trees and ripped roofs off of houses, leaving half the city without power.

I could do a lot of things. But I couldn\u2019t get a crane to get it off of her husband, and for them to see him actually take his last breath while he\u2019s laying in bed.\u201d</p> <p>Daverio Carter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.echovita.com/us/obituaries/ga/augusta/daverio-carter-18691011\">funeral</a> was Saturday. Johnson made that much time to grieve.</p> <p>\u201cI literally don\u2019t have power in my home. No water,\u201d Johnson said. Debris still blocks his personal vehicles, he said. \u201cOn Friday, I had to literally climb old trees and power lines just to get out of the neighborhood to get down to the emergency operations center. So, we have so many dedicated city employees that have been working tirelessly, sometimes 16, 20 hours a day just to try to get this city back running around. I think we\u2019re close.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has been burying himself in work while his family buries its dead. He did talk to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> about it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/kamala-harris-augusta-georgia-hurricane-helene\">when she came</a> for an emergency management briefing Tuesday, he said. Harris also spoke to Melissa Carter.</p> <p>\u201cMayor, I want to thank you for your leadership, in particular,\u201d the US vice-president said in Augusta on Wednesday during a visit to access damage and console families. \u201cI was just talking with one of the members of the community and her daughter who lost her husband. And there is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane and what has happened in terms of the aftermath of it.\u201d</p> <p>Thanking first responders and local leadership, she said: \u201cThe local folks are folks who have personally \u2013 and their families have personally \u2013 experienced loss and devastation. And yet they leave their home, leave their family to go to centers like where I was earlier to do the work of helping perfect strangers. And it really does highlight the nobility of the kind of work that these public servants have dedicated themselves to, which can be, in moments of crisis like this, so selfless in the way that they do that work.\u201d</p> <p>Harris pointedly toned down her presence in Augusta, giving little advance notice of her arrival last week. She toured some of the poorest parts of the city, where the downed trees on roofs and in yards from the storm compete with rotten siding and missing windows after decades of decay.</p> <p>People living in these neighborhoods who turned out for the fresh produce said they understood why Harris would play things quietly, even five weeks before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">election day</a>. At the time, people were still struggling to find a gas station with the lights on, dodging price gougers selling gas in five-gallon jugs for $40 on the side of the street.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows concern, and shows that she cares,\u201d said Annie Gardner. At 95, she\u2019s the oldest member of Augusta\u2019s Good Samaritan Missionary Baptist church, where people were redistributing food from nearby DeKalb county to local residents. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed already, I was liking her already, and I even like her even more now.\u201d</p>    <p>She\u2019s a skeptic of political theater right now, though. \u201cTrump\u2019s not coming here in this neighborhood. He\u2019s out with the rich white folks. If he does, I\u2019d be really surprised. I don\u2019t think nobody cares if he doesn\u2019t come, either.\u201d</p> <p>Both Harris and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> have a delicate dance to perform. Visibility matters.</p> <p>Michael Thurmond, DeKalb county\u2019s CEO, arranged for the delivery of hundreds of thousands of dollars in produce to Augusta after seeing the reports of devastation in Augusta. \u201cPeople are looking to see that their leaders are doing something,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But photo-op politics in a crisis leads to images like Trump tossing paper towels at hurricane victims. The former president and Republican presidential nominee seemed somewhat more aware of that in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/trump-visits-georgia-after-hurricane-helene-false-biden-claims\">appearances in Georgia</a> over the last week.</p> <p>\u201cIf [Trump] brought a thousand trucks like this, he would still not get my vote,\u201d said April Terry, an Augustan waiting for a box of produce Friday morning. \u201cAll that is showing that he\u2019s got money, showing that all he wants is your vote.\u201d</p> <p>Trump spoke to reporters in Evans, Georgia, just north-east of Augusta, on Thursday. There was no attempt to stage a massive rally, though about 100 supporters staked out the road near the venue to wave flags. But he did appear side by side with Governor Brian Kemp, whom the former president has pointedly attacked as unsupportive of his election claims.</p> <p>On Thursday, Trump said Kemp \u201cis doing a fantastic job\u201d.</p> <p>Kemp in turn praised the former president for \u201ckeeping the national focus on our state as we recover\u201d, then recited the litany of destruction, noting that major Georgia crops had been all but wiped out. The Georgia governor noted that that the federal government is quickly approving his requests for federal disaster declarations, which will help move relief funding and federal reimbursement.</p>    <p>Ahead of those comments, the state insurance commissioner John King took issue with the political implications of Harris\u2019s promise of 100% federal reimbursement. Doing so would require an appropriation that hasn\u2019t yet been made, essentially daring the House speaker Mike Johnson to refuse. \u201cIt\u2019s political blackmail,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Evans, in Columbia county, Georgia, is comparatively affluent. But it also sustained catastrophic damage, and its mostly conservative voters are digging out of much the same hole as everyone else in the region.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see, if you go in there, at least our street, all the yards along the road are lined with cut-up logs,\u201d said Gage Gabriel, a 19-year-old Trump supporter watching for the motorcade. Public reaction to the storm could change the way people vote, he said. \u201cDepending on the concern showed from the federal government. If the federal government doesn\u2019t seem to show concern to a large section of the country \u2026 it should at least sway some results, depending on how caring politicians seem to the plight of especially North Carolina.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel wants to see leaders with a chain saw in their hands cutting down trees. \u201cNot just shaking the hands of people putting up some power lines.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan Johnson, a Richmond county commissioner, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to really focus on politics in this very moment, because folks are trying to find power and folks are trying to find food.\u201d But the contrast between the two candidates is stark, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at where Kamala Harris went, she went to a very hard struck part of town in south Augusta. She went to a shelter. She spoke to people, she gave food. Donald Trump is going to one of the most affluent parts of the [Augusta area]. I don\u2019t know what impact their business will have. I\u2019m not really interested in the campaign aspect. He has no purpose here in Augusta other than as a campaign stop. Kamala Harris came as vice-president of the United States announcing that help and aid is on the way. I mean, it tells you a lot about the two candidates are and what their missions are. He\u2019s here to get votes, and she\u2019s here to help.\u201d</p>",

Johnson made that much time to grieve. \u201cI literally don\u2019t have power in my home. No water,\u201d Johnson said. Debris still blocks his personal vehicles, he said. \u201cOn Friday, I had to literally climb old trees and power lines just to get out of the neighborhood to get down to the emergency operations center. So, we have so many dedicated city employees that have been working tirelessly, sometimes 16, 20 hours a day just to try to get this city back running around. I think we\u2019re close.\u201d Johnson has been burying himself in work while his family buries its dead. He did talk to Kamala Harris about it when she came for an emergency management briefing Tuesday, he said. Harris also spoke to Melissa Carter. \u201cMayor, I want to thank you for your leadership, in particular,\u201d the US vice-president said in Augusta on Wednesday during a visit to access damage and console families. \u201cI was just talking with one of the members of the community and her daughter who lost her husband. And there is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane and what has happened in terms of the aftermath of it.\u201d Thanking first responders and local leadership, she said: \u201cThe local folks are folks who have personally \u2013 and their families have personally \u2013 experienced loss and devastation. And yet they leave their home, leave their family to go to centers like where I was earlier to do the work of helping perfect strangers. And it really does highlight the nobility of the kind of work that these public servants have dedicated themselves to, which can be, in moments of crisis like this, so selfless in the way that they do that work.\u201d Harris pointedly toned down her presence in Augusta, giving little advance notice of her arrival last week. She toured some of the poorest parts of the city, where the downed trees on roofs and in yards from the storm compete with rotten siding and missing windows after decades of decay. People living in these neighborhoods who turned out for the fresh produce said they understood why Harris would play things quietly, even five weeks before election day. At the time, people were still struggling to find a gas station with the lights on, dodging price gougers selling gas in five-gallon jugs for $40 on the side of the street. \u201cIt shows concern, and shows that she cares,\u201d said Annie Gardner. At 95, she\u2019s the oldest member of Augusta\u2019s Good Samaritan Missionary Baptist church, where people were redistributing food from nearby DeKalb county to local residents. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed already, I was liking her already, and I even like her even more now.\u201d She\u2019s a skeptic of political theater right now, though. \u201cTrump\u2019s not coming here in this neighborhood. He\u2019s out with the rich white folks. If he does, I\u2019d be really surprised. I don\u2019t think nobody cares if he doesn\u2019t come, either.\u201d Both Harris and Donald Trump have a delicate dance to perform. Visibility matters. Michael Thurmond, DeKalb county\u2019s CEO, arranged for the delivery of hundreds of thousands of dollars in produce to Augusta after seeing the reports of devastation in Augusta. \u201cPeople are looking to see that their leaders are doing something,\u201d he said. But photo-op politics in a crisis leads to images like Trump tossing paper towels at hurricane victims. The former president and Republican presidential nominee seemed somewhat more aware of that in his appearances in Georgia over the last week. \u201cIf [Trump] brought a thousand trucks like this, he would still not get my vote,\u201d said April Terry, an Augustan waiting for a box of produce Friday morning. \u201cAll that is showing that he\u2019s got money, showing that all he wants is your vote.\u201d Trump spoke to reporters in Evans, Georgia, just north-east of Augusta, on Thursday. There was no attempt to stage a massive rally, though about 100 supporters staked out the road near the venue to wave flags. But he did appear side by side with Governor Brian Kemp, whom the former president has pointedly attacked as unsupportive of his election claims. On Thursday, Trump said Kemp \u201cis doing a fantastic job\u201d. Kemp in turn praised the former president for \u201ckeeping the national focus on our state as we recover\u201d, then recited the litany of destruction, noting that major Georgia crops had been all but wiped out. The Georgia governor noted that that the federal government is quickly approving his requests for federal disaster declarations, which will help move relief funding and federal reimbursement. Ahead of those comments, the state insurance commissioner John King took issue with the political implications of Harris\u2019s promise of 100% federal reimbursement. Doing so would require an appropriation that hasn\u2019t yet been made, essentially daring the House speaker Mike Johnson to refuse. \u201cIt\u2019s political blackmail,\u201d he said. Evans, in Columbia county, Georgia, is comparatively affluent. But it also sustained catastrophic damage, and its mostly conservative voters are digging out of much the same hole as everyone else in the region. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, if you go in there, at least our street, all the yards along the road are lined with cut-up logs,\u201d said Gage Gabriel, a 19-year-old Trump supporter watching for the motorcade. Public reaction to the storm could change the way people vote, he said. \u201cDepending on the concern showed from the federal government. If the federal government doesn\u2019t seem to show concern to a large section of the country \u2026 it should at least sway some results, depending on how caring politicians seem to the plight of especially North Carolina.\u201d Gabriel wants to see leaders with a chain saw in their hands cutting down trees. \u201cNot just shaking the hands of people putting up some power lines.\u201d Jordan Johnson, a Richmond county commissioner, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to really focus on politics in this very moment, because folks are trying to find power and folks are trying to find food.\u201d But the contrast between the two candidates is stark, he added. \u201cIf you look at where Kamala Harris went, she went to a very hard struck part of town in south Augusta. She went to a shelter. She spoke to people, she gave food. Donald Trump is going to one of the most affluent parts of the [Augusta area]. I don\u2019t know what impact their business will have. I\u2019m not really interested in the campaign aspect. He has no purpose here in Augusta other than as a campaign stop. Kamala Harris came as vice-president of the United States announcing that help and aid is on the way. I mean, it tells you a lot about the two candidates are and what their missions are. He\u2019s here to get votes, and she\u2019s here to help.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Israel launched an intense wave of air raids on southern Lebanon on Monday, with 100 aircraft targeting about 120 sites in the space of an hour, according to the country\u2019s military. An IDF Arabic spokesperson issued an urgent warning to Lebanese civilians to avoid being on the beach or on boats on the coast from the Awali River southward until further notice. The wave of strikes came as Israelis marked the anniversary of last year\u2019s 7 October attacks by Hamas, the trigger for a year of escalating war in the region. The IDF also announced on Monday that it had designated a new closed military zone in northern Israel, the fourth closed area since the ground invasion started, running eastward from the Mediterranean coast. \u201cThese targets belonged to various units of the Hezbollah terrorist organisation, including regional units of Hezbollah\u2019s southern front, the Radwan Forces, the Missiles and Rockets Force, and the Intelligence Directorate,\u201d the IDF said in a statement. \u201cThis operation follows a series of strikes aimed at degrading Hezbollah\u2019s command, control, and firing capabilities, as well as assisting ground forces in achieving their operational goals.\u201d As memorial events took place across Israel, violence continued to rage on multiple fronts, with Israel also expanding its ground operation into Lebanon with elements of a third division joining the fighting. Amid clear evidence that Israel is rapidly ramping up its military operations against multiple Iran-allied proxies, Hamas fired rockets out of Gaza to coincide with memorial events, vowing to continue with a \u201clong and painful war of attrition\u201d against Israel. Hamas\u2019s ability to fire rockets, although massively constrained by 12 months of a devastating Israeli offensive that has claimed more than 41,000 Palestinian lives, comes despite periodic statements from the IDF declaring the group effectively beaten. Despite the quickly increasing tempo of Israeli military operations, Hezbollah also fired scores of missiles at Israel throughout the day on Monday, while a ballistic missile fired by Yemen\u2019s Houthis was shot down as evening fell. On Monday evening, sirens sounded in central Israel after several projectile launches were identified crossing from Lebanon. The Israeli military said some projectiles were intercepted, while the rest fell in open areas. Fears of a wider regional escalation, not least from the anticipated \u201csignificant\u201d retaliation that Israel has promised for Iran\u2019s large-scale missile attack last week, were underlined by the UK\u2019s announcement that it had withdrawn family members of diplomats in the country. \u201cAs a precautionary measure following escalation in the region, family members of British embassy staff have been temporarily withdrawn,\u201d the Foreign Office travel advice webpage for Israel reads. \u201cOur staff members remain.\u201d With expectation high that Israel could launch a major retaliation against Iran at any moment, Tehran repeated its own insistence that it would respond to any Israeli attack on its soil. In Lebanon, where Israel insisted its week-long ground operation was to be \u201climited\u201d and \u201ctargeted\u201d, elements of three divisions are now involved in the fighting, after the IDF said in a statement that its 91st division had joined the ground incursion overnight. Night-vision images released on Monday showed a column of infantry moving into Lebanon with heavy rucksacks and sleeping pads, suggesting it was more than a short raid. According to the statement, the division\u2019s forces were redeployed to northern Israel over the last two weeks, joining units from the 36th and 83rd divisions already involved in the fighting in Lebanon. The widening conflict risks further drawing in the US, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel. A fresh round of airstrikes hit Beirut\u2019s suburbs late on Sunday as Israel also intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza, calling for evacuations of the north of the territory amid renewed military operations. In southern Lebanon an Israeli strike killed at least 10 firefighters, the latest in a series of strikes that have killed dozens of first responders, according to Lebanon\u2019s health ministry. It said they were in a municipality building in the southern town of Baraachit that was hit as they prepared for a mission. Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported more than 30 strikes overnight into Sunday, while Israel\u2019s military said about 130 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after it killed the longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his top commanders in a series of attacks. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006. At least 1,400 Lebanese people, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group from the blue line boundary between the two countries so tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return home.

She was in effect sacked, but technically she chose to resign, and she is taking up another government role, and so a lot of the news coverage has avoided that word because it implies the process was marginally more brutal than it was.</p> \n  <p>But it was very harsh. Last week Gray was one of the half a dozen or so most powerful people in government. Now she has an obscure role liasing with mayors and the devolved governments.</p> \n  <p>Here are extracts from some of the comment on her departure that has appeared on other news websites.</p> \n  <p><strong>Stephen Bush</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/808eab25-0d09-432b-a5dd-36d66cd887b6\">in the Financial Times</a> says replacing Gray with Morgan McSweeney should clarify who\u2019s in charge in No 10. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of Michael Gove\u2019s habits as a minister, when told in a memo that \u201cDowning Street wants this\u201d, was to scribble back a note saying \u201cDowning Street is a building. WHO wants it?\u201d</p> \n   <p>And the big problem that has plagued Keir Starmer\u2019s new government is that a lot of the time, that answer has not been clear even to people <em>inside</em> the building. Ministers and aides outside of it have frequently complained that getting clarity on what Downing Street actually wants is like pulling teeth. That lack of a clear steer is part of why the government has struggled to get past things such as the rows over freebies.</p> \n   <p>One reason for that is that Starmer opted to make his Downing Street a duopoly: a political lead in the shape of Morgan McSweeney and an administrative one in the shape of Sue Gray. That largely worked well in opposition, with the odd eruption into public view of how one <a href=\"https://email.newsletters.ft.com/c/eJyMkc9u2zAMh5_GvjGQKFqmDjoUGAL0vO0BJJFsjSVOZ8sL9vZDgw699kjwD_j7vla6vty2v3nV-37R3nUbJVulZDhq9jMycmKiUa9luTxLZuTWNAg01QTkk0JC50GEfXM2ucB-fM3GUoOSCU4W0U_znKrOntjX1mTSccnokLxzs-PgHJ1mK1qIWmJVFygN5D6f2k_WT-12HS_5tfe3fQhPA54HPN_v94_WgOd2W7uufcCzJKPaJgI3JQPyNUGpnkG1RBNsJA2HcP4INYRvX4k1YNz15aprf6ygkbOkDI1lgmLUQJsIzFzE1RQSxjpelr0_S55idbWENnmtPLngnNZJKIxv202O1vP-VrZf45bLKpveT-_ldrsP5Pqrvhxlk6WsDwCb_j70cVMiRkasUGdvQCozVDYDR1iKj20uJv_HVb7rKj-W66dTF8aej2ORITx9SWrfyrqX1pfb-ixZsUVhNIjFHJCPDLUGBXYcOcU4p6Tjsev281gke1N7BwJ-RgMib8ATEwQfUErxzbSMfzL-CwAA___78MSY\">half of Starmer\u2019s office was a \u201cboys club\u201d</a> or the other half comprised of ex-civil servants lacking a political sense.

He \u2014 more than Starmer \u2014 is someone who would be instantly recognisable to any figure from the old Labour Right, from Ernest Bevin to John Reid but is a rarer sight in Westminster of late. He did not learn his politics at Oxford and the bar, but on council estates working for local government. This experience has given him an instinctive loathing for the kind of badge-wearing politics of virtue the Labour Right has long associated with the middle-class Left.</p> \n   <p>McSweeney sees the purpose of Labour in straightforward, class terms: to represent in government the interests of ordinary people who are not otherwise looked after by their employers, landlords \u2014 or, indeed, politicians.

Opposition parties are fond of accusing a prime minister in difficulties of attempting a relaunch, and sometimes you hear the claim every time there is a big speech after a single bad week. But what we are seeing from Keir Starmer this week is a genuine relaunch, triggered by a recognition that things were going wrong. It is a big moment for the government \u2013 although how much difference it will make will not be clear for a while.</p> \n  <p>Here is our overnight story.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/sniping-and-criticism-what-led-to-sue-grays-resignation-and-what-happens-now\">Keir Starmer reshuffles top team after Sue Gray ousted</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And here is <strong>Pippa Crerar</strong>\u2019s analysis.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/once-sue-gray-became-the-story-it-was-clear-she-had-to-go\">Once Sue Gray became the story, it was clear she had to go</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p><strong>John Healey</strong>, the defence secretary, was the cabinet minister doing the morning interview round and he tried to play down the significance of Sue Gray outlasting Liz Truss in her time as the most powerful woman in No 10, but not by a huge amount. Asked on LBC if the government was at crisis point, Healey replied: \u201cI\u2019d characterise this as a new government getting on with the job.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Thankfully, other veterans from the New Labour era have been much more frank, honest and interesting when asked for their take in interviews this morning. They have been arguing that, while this crisis is not terminal, Starmer needs to get much better at communicating what his government stands for and is doing.</p> \n  <p>(One of the appointments yesterday was James Lyons, an ex-Daily Mirror journalist, as head of strategic communications, and this may make a difference. As a lobby journalist, he excelled at hard-hitting knocking copy. If he had been in No 10 over the summer, it is difficult to imagine the freebies story running as long as it did without firmer rebuttal.)</p> \n  <p>But two of Tony Blair\u2019s key advisers have also said that one of Starmer\u2019s big mistake was to wait so long until having a budget. <strong>Alastair Campbell</strong>, who was Blair\u2019s communications chief in No 10 and who now co-hosts the Rest is Politics podcast, told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The most important thing is to understand that in the modern age, when it comes to strategy and strategic communications, you have to develop, execute and narrate strategy all at once.</p> \n   <p>And I think the point about the budget is really important.</p> \n   <p>When Margaret Thatcher won in 1979, Geoffrey Howe delivered the budget five weeks after the election. Gordon Brown in 1997 he delivered the budget eight weeks after the election. David Cameron and [George] Osborne in 2010 \u2013 six weeks.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re having to wait almost 16 weeks since the election. And I think that is what creates this sense of people not quite sure what the government\u2019s about.</p> \n   <p>The key strategic pillars when a new government comes in, you have the king\u2019s speech, you have the party conference \u2026 and you also have the budget. And the budget is probably the most important of those.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Campbell said there had definitely been \u201cmissteps\u201d that had led to what happened yesterday. But, in response to a question from the presenter Mishal Husain he said: \u201cYou say it comes to this as though the whole thing is a complete irrecoverable shambles, which I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d Better communication was essential, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Government is harder than opposition. And government is not just about the technocratic delivery of policy and change. It\u2019s about the relentless, endless, never-ending conversation that you\u2019re having with the country about what you are trying to do for the country. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that that bit has been largely missing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a separate interview on Times Radio, <strong>John McTernan</strong>, who was Blair\u2019s political secretary in No 10, said delaying the budget so long was \u201ca terrible miscalculation\u201d. He said as a result the government had been defined, in the public mind, by the decision to cut winter fuel payments. The government was not controlling the narrative, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government has completely lost grip, a grip on their operations, a grip on the media grid, and they don\u2019t dominate communications.</p> \n   <p>And that has been because they have lacked a political narrative and the political drive and the momentum that drove them through the election to a great victory. That seemed to run out after the sitting weeks ended in July and we got into the recess of August.</p> \n   <p>It just went from the country demanding change to a government delivering drift.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Stewart Wood</strong>, another New Labour veteran, who worked as an adviser for Gordon Brown in No 10, told the Today programme that he hoped the government would now get back on track. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Parliament\u2019s only been sitting for, I think, less than 20 days so far in the first 100 days of the government. So the space for the new policy agenda has been limited.</p> \n   <p>But [the No 10 reshuffle] hopefully is going to enable a focus to be on the policy agenda, on GB Energy, on GB Railways, on planning reform, all the things the government wanted to set out, a workers\u2019 rights package. </p> \n   <p>I think this has got to be a drawing a line moment for the internal stories that have come to take the place of the policy-focused stories.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There will be more comment on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and the party\u2019s four other MPs hold a press conference on \u201ctwo tier policing in Britain, with a special announcement and focus on the policing incident at Manchester Airport on 23 July 2024\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> Keir Starmer is expected to make a Commons statement on his visit to the UN general assembly.

      "bodyText": "David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has said that the deal giving the Chagos Island to Mauritius will protect relations with the US. Speaking in the Commons, he said: Inaction posed several acute risks to the United Kingdom. First, it threatened the UK-US base from countering malign Iranian activity in the Middle East to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. It\u2019s critical for our national security. Without surety of tenure, no base can operate effectively nor truly deter our enemies. Critical investment decisions were already being delayed. Second, it impacted on our relationship with the United States who neither wanted nor welcomed the legal uncertainty and strongly encouraged us to strike a deal. I am a trans-Atlanticist. We had to protect this important relationship. And third, it undermined our international standing where showing what we mean is what we say on international law and our desire for partnerships with the Global South. This strengthens our arguments when it comes to issues like Ukraine or the South China Sea. Keir Starmer has told MPs that stopping all arms sales to Israel will \u201cnever\u201d be his position. Speaking in the Commons, he said: If sale of weapons for defensive use by Israel were banned, that is a position that I could not countenance a year after October the 7th. It is not a position I could countenance in the face of attacks by Iran. The whole House saw the number of missiles coming over into Israel only the other day, and the idea that we could say we support Israel\u2019s right to defend herself, and at the same time deprive her of the means to do so, is so wholly inconsistent that it will never be my position. John Healey, the defence secretary, has denied that No 10 is at a crisis point despite the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff leaving her post less than 100 days into the new Labour government. Rachel Reeves has decided not to raise tax on pensions contributions in this month\u2019s budget, after public sector unions warned that doing so would hurt their members. Mark Francois (Con) asks how much the UK will pay in rent to lease back something \u201calready ours\u201d. Lammy says, when the treaty is published, there will be a discussion of the cost. It is not having a deal that would damage national security, he says. Mel Stride, the former work and pensions secretary, who was knocked out of the Tory leadership contest in the last round of voting by MPs, is backing James Cleverly, Lucy Fisher from the Financial Times reports. Robert Jenrick, another Tory leadership candidate, says the UK has handed a sovereign island to an ally of China, just so Lammy can feel good at London dinner parties. Lammy says he hopes that has secured Jenrick a few more votes in the Tory leadership contest. But the US president and the US secretary of state are in favour. He suggests they know more about foreign policy than Jenrick. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory leadership candidate, says Lammy has made this deal even though it is not based on the views of Chagossians, and because he is elevating the views of an international court over the national interest. He says both of those features set a bad precedent for people on the Falkland Islands. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, accuses Lammy of caring more about the judgment of a foreign court than about national sovereignty. And he says, althought President Biden may approve of this deal, Donald Trump might not. Lammy says the UK has taken views across the US political establishment. But he says the president, the secretary of state and the US defence secretary have all welcomed this. That should assure Farage that this will not help the Chinese, he says. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said the government agreed this deal to help a \u201cdisgusting\u201d Mauritian government ahead of an election. He also accuses Mauritius of being pro-China. Lammy said he did not agree with what Duncan Smith said about a fellow Commonwealth country. Andrew Rosindell (Con) said this was a dark day for British democracy. He said the government should allow the Chagossians the right to self-determination. Calum Miller, a Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson, says he is concerned that the Chagossians were not consulted over this deal. He says there is no equivalence between the Chagos Islands and other overseas territories. And he says the Tories who have suggested there is play into the hands of Britain\u2019s enemies. Lammy says Miller is right to raise the interest of Chagossians. They were they were treated in the 1960s was wrong. This was a negotiation between two sovereign governments, he says. But he says they were kept informed as to what was happening. Lammy is responding to Mitchell. He accuses him of having some \u201cbrass neck\u201d in opposing a deal sought by the last Tory government. He says, if the security concerns Mitchell raised were well-founded, Washington would not have welcomed it. The future of Diego Garcia has been secured, he says. Referring to the Tories, he says: They posture, we lead. And he says of course the Chagossians were kept informed about how the negotiations were going. Andrew Mitchell, the shadow foreign secretary, says it is astonishing the government is giving away a military asset to a country than never had it before. He quotes approvingly what the Times said about the deal in an editorial. It said: In a dangerous world Britain\u2019s security is being risked by ministers and departmental lawyers who believe appeasing faux anti-colonialist sentiment in the UN matters more than the national interest. He says James Cleverly and Lord Cameron would never have agreed this deal. If they had been willing to strike this deal, it would have been agreed years ago. He says he has five questions. 1) What are the implications for the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar? 2) What are the implications for sovereign military bases on Cyprus? 3) What are the assurances about China not deploying armed forces on the islands? He says Lammy\u2019s words today are welcome, but he points out that the treaty has not been published. 4) How much is being paid? 5) What consultation has there been with Chagossians? Lammy says the Diego Garcia base now has an uncontested legal basis long into the future. It will have delegated sovereignty for at least 99 years, with an option to extend. And he says the deal will stop foreign armed forces [he means China, but does not name it] basing themselves on the other Chagos Islands, which are currently unoccupied. Lammy says there is also a financial settlement acceptable to both sides. He says this deal does not affect Gibraltar or the Falkland Islands, which are very different. He says the government hopes to ratify this treaty in 2025. Lammy says it took two years of negotiations to reach the agreement with Mauritius on the Chagos Islands. He says the status quo was not sustainable. The UK was likely to lose a binding option. It would have then had to abandon the military base at Diego Garcia, or break international law. Doing the deal on UK terms will allow the operation of the base to continue, he says. He says James Cleverly, the former foreign secretary, initiated these talks. And Lord Cameron, Cleverly\u2019s successor, ultimately allowed those talks to go ahead. Inaction posed a threat to the Diego Garcia military base, which is \u201ccritical\u201d for national security, he says. Second, inaction would have impacted on relations with the US. They did not like uncertainty, and wanted a deal. And, third, inaction undermined the UK\u2019s international standing. This deal shows the UK respects international law, he says. That backs its position on issues like Ukraine, he says. Keir Starmer\u2019s statement is over. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, is now making a statement about the decision to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says while government business continues during recess, it is frustrating when government announcements are made towards the end of recess. He says it would have been better if Lammy had delayed this announcement, made on Thursday last week, until today. Then they could have learned about it in the Commons. He says the argument that announcements have to be made in recess because of elections in other parts of the world is irrelevant to him. (The UK government wanted to to finalise the deal before the forthcoming Mauritian elections.) Hoyle says he is concerned about the interests of MPs in Britain. Back in the Commons, the independent MP Ayoub Khan, who was elected largely because of his pro-Palestinian stance, asked Keir Starmer if he was telling MPs that the UK would not be selling arms to Israel that could be used offensively. He was referring to Starmer telling Richard Burgon he would not support an arms embargo that deprived Israel of weapons it needed to protect itself (see 4.18am), a line he subsequently repeated to Zarah Sultana. In response, Starmer avoided the thrust of the question. Instead he said that the government was following the process set down in law, and that it had published the reasons for its recent decision. Michelle O\u2019Neill, the Sinn F\u00e9in first minister of Northern Ireland, has said she was \u201cabsolutely appalled and horrified\u201d that two press officers in her party gave work references to a former colleague who was being investigated over child sex offences. She described Michael McMonagle, who is now awaiting sentencing, as a \u201cmonster\u201d whose actions were \u201cutterly reprehensible\u201d. But she insisted she had not been made aware until 24 September that two press officers had given employment references to the British Heart Foundation where McMonagle worked as a press official after being suspended from Sinn F\u00e9in. She said: I am absolutely appalled and horrified that that occurred. These references were given without the knowledge or authorisation of the party, and under no circumstances would the party have provided a reference for work or for otherwise for McMonagle. Apologising for the hurt and distress caused by the affair, O\u2019Neill set out the timeline in a bid to draw a line under the scandal which has dogged the party for the past week. Matthew O\u2019Toole, the SDLP leader in the Northern Ireland assembly, said the party did not show the \u201ccandour and transparency\u201d expected of all politicians. Under universal credit (UC), a new benefit originally introduced by the coalition government, people have to wait around five weeks to get their first payment. In response to claims that people would be without money for more than a month, the government allowed claimaints to get an advance payment, repaid interest-free through monthly deducations when proper payments start. A DWP report published today by Liz Kendall says that the most vulnerable claimants are most likely not to understand the support available. The report, which is based on in-depth interviews with claimants, says: Those with a disability or long-term health condition or who had difficult personal circumstances, such as being a refugee or leaving an abusive relationship were likely to need support to understand the transition to UC, the advance payment and to manage their finances but were unlikely to seek this out themselves. And some of the claimants did not get this information from jobcentres, it says. There were claimants who did not remember being told about the advance payment until after they had made their claim or reached the end of their first assessment period. This may have been because of poor recall or there may be inconsistencies in the information being provided at jobcentres. The report suggests it would be better if claimants attending a jobcentre were given written, personalised information about how much they would get from an advance payment, and how they would pay it back. In the Commons Robert Jenrick, a Tory leadership candidate, said that at the pro-Palestinian march in London at the weekend there were people showing support for Hezbollah. He asked what the government was doing to \u201croot out those who despise our country and our values\u201d, suggesting that foreign visitors who support terrorist groups should have their visas revoked. In response, Keir Starmer said the right to protest was important, but that the police should also be enforcing the law when it is broken. Asked by Richard Burgon, who was elected as a Labour MP but who has currently had the whip suspended, if he would back the end of all arms sales to Israel, Keir Starmer told MPs he was not in favour of that because it would deprive Israel of weapons that could be used for defensive purposes. Back in the Commons there is a mood of near-consensus as MPs have been responding to Keir Starmer\u2019s statement about the Middle East and the 7 October attack. Members from all sides have backed the thrust of what he said. But the Labour MP Clive Betts asked Starmer how he responded to comments from Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, saying he does not accept the two-state solution as a goal. In response, Starmer said it was important to be \u2018\u201cvery clear\u201d that the two-state solution was \u201cthe only viable long-term route through this conflict\u201d. The government is considering the rollout of a text message service to stop carers breaking overpayment rules on carer\u2019s allowance, MPs have been told. The carer\u2019s allowance crisis has led to more than 100,000 carers having to repay large sums because, often inadvertently, they breached the earnings limit. Under DWP rules, people who do this have to repay all the allowance they received, not just a portion representing overpayment. Asked about this in the Commons, Stephen Timms, a welfare minister, said: We want to get to the bottom of what\u2019s gone wrong with these overpayments, why so many people have been caught out. We have been piloting the introduction of a text message service, that involves texting 3,500 claimants to alert them when they HMRC informs DWP that the claimant has breached the current earnings limit. Starmer says the the 7 October attack was the bloodiest day for the people of Israel since the Holocaust. He says 15 Britons were \u201cbrutally slain\u201d that day, and another has died since in captivity. For many people, the pain of that day is as acute as it was a year ago. Last week he met the families of people killed and held hostage, he says. He says he will never forget what they said. The families of hostages are going through \u201cagony\u201d day after day. They must be returned, he says. He says it is also \u201ca day of grief for the wider region\u201d. The human toll amongst innocent civilians in Gaza is \u201ctruly devastating\u201d, he says. What is happening there is \u201ca living nightmare\u201d and it must end, he says. He says last week the Iranian regime chose to strike Israel. All MPs will join him in condemnding this attack, he says. It was not a defensive action. It was a major escalation, in response to the death of a terrorist leader, he says. He urges all sides to step back from the brink, and find the courage of restraint. Working with other world leaders, he will focus on three areas, he says. First, he is focusing on Lebanon. Some Britons have already been evacuated, and further evacuations are planned. He says he is continuting to call for an immediate ceasefire, and for a political solution. Hezbollah must withdraw, and stop firing rockets. Second, they must renew efforts for a ceasefire in Gaza. And more relief must be provided for civilians. He says the ongoing restrictions on age are \u201cimpossible to justifiy\u201d. Israel must open more crossings, and provide a safe haven for aid workers. And, third, there must be solutions for the long term, he says. The two-state solution must be the ultimate goal. There is no other option offering security. So they must build a political route towards it, he says. The key to this is a ceasefire in Gaza now, he says. He says the power of diplomacy should be used to find long-term solutions. That is what MPs have done, and what the government will continue to do, he says. Keir Starmer is now making a statment to MPs about the Middle East and the anniversary of the 7 October attack on Israel. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by saying this is a solemn day. In the Commons Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, has just announced that her department has just published 31 reports that were commissioned when the Tories were in power but that were \u201csat on\u201d because the last government did not want to make them public. While good for transparency, this approach is not very convenient for journalists. There is a list of all the reports out today here, and you can find them all here. It may take a while how many of them, if any, contain much news. Campaigners have attended a rally organised by the Unite union at Westminster today to protest against the government\u2019s winter fuel payments cut. Government ministers have spent a lot of time recently condemning the inheritance they were left by the Conservatives, and today Emma Hardy, the minister for water, has denounced their record on flood defences. In a written ministerial statement, she said: The condition of flood defences has declined in recent years through a lack of investment. This was compounded when no more funding was made available by the previous government to repair damage from last winter. Asset condition is now at 92%, its lowest point since 2010, with approximately 60,000 properties at higher risk. The Environment Agency has allocated \u00a336m this year to do the most urgent repairs from last winter\u2019s flood events. A coroner has urged the UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, to urgently address the \u201cnon-existent\u201d care available to people with severe ME or risk further deaths like that of 27-year-old Maeve Boothby O\u2019Neill, Steven Morris reports. More than 150 Conservative councillors have signed a statement urging MPs to vote for Kemi Badenoch so that she is one of the final two candidates on the ballot for party members. The fact that her campaign has released this now is an implicit acceptance of the fact she is struggling to make the final two. Although most surveys and polls have shown that Badenoch is the most popular candidate amongst members, only 28 Tory MPs voted for her in the last round and by Thursday she needs at least 41 MPs voting for her to be sure of a place in the final two. When MPs vote on Wednesday, the 16 Mel Stride votes are up for grabs, and they are expected to go for a more centrist candidate, either James Cleverly or Tom Tugendhat. If, as expected, Tugendhat comes last, another tranche of more centrist votes will get redistributed on Thursday. No one can be sure where those votes will go (voting in these contests is often determined by friendship more than ideology), but Cleverly made a good impression at Tory conference and it is assumed he is likely to do well with Stride/Tugendhat supporters. Robert Jenrick came top in the first two ballots, and until recently he was the clear bookmakers\u2019 favourite (because people placing bets assumed that Badenoch would not make the final two). But yesterday a ConservativeHome survey of party members said that, if Jenrick and Cleverly were in the final two, Cleverly would win. Previous ConHome surveys said Jenrick would win a head-to-head with Cleverly. Badenoch may be hoping that rightwing Tories who were backing Jenrick confident that, as a rightwinger, he would win the final ballot might reassess and instead back her as the rightwinger most likely to win the final round. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has rowed back on claims he was advised by Commons authorities not to hold in-person constituency surgeries on security grounds. As PA Media reports, last month Farage claimed he would hold surgeries \u201cwhen parliament allows me\u201d, saying he had been given guidance not to hold in-person surgeries by \u201cthe Speaker\u2019s office\u201d and the parliamentary security team. His claims were disputed by parliamentary sources, who said no such advice had been given as it would interfere with Farage\u2019s democratic duties. Asked about the row at a press conference this morning, Farage replied: \u201cThe Speaker\u2019s office is always right.\u201d Downing Street has rejected suggestions that the government\u2019s decision to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius means Britain might also give up the Falkland Islands or Gibraltar. This is a suggestion that has been raised by some Tories, and some rightwing papers, since the Chagos Islands deal was announced on Thursday last week. Asked if handing over the Chagos Islands did set a precedent, the PM\u2019s spokesperson replied: It\u2019s a unique situation based on its unique history and circumstances, and has no bearing on other overseas territories \u2026 British sovereignty of the Falkland Islands or Gibraltar is not up for negotiation. All four Tory leadership candidates have condemned the government\u2019s decision to give up sovereignty of the Chagos Islands. But the spokesperson said the current government was just concluding negotiations that opened when the last government was in office. He said: The government inherited a situation where the long-term secure operation of the military base at Diego Garcia was under threat with contested sovereignty and legal challenges, including through various international courts and tribunals. You will be aware that the previous government initiated sovereignty negotiations in 2022 and conducted a number of rounds of negotiations. This government picked up those negotiations and has reached an agreement, which means that for the first time in over 50 years, the base will be undisputed, legally secure, with full Mauritian backing. In the Observer yesterday Toby Helm said government plans to impose VAT on private schools from 1 January next year may have to be delayed because of warnings from unions, tax experts and school leaders that meeting the deadline will cause administrative chaos and teacher job losses. But at the lobby briefing this morning the PM\u2019s spokesperson said VAT on private school fees would come into force in January. Asked if the government was still committed to that timetable, he replied: Yes, ending tax breaks on private schools will come into force on 1 January, as planned, as set out in the manifesto. The government wants to ensure all children have the best chance in life to succeed, and ending these tax breaks will help to raise the revenue needed to fund our education priorities for the next year, such as recruiting 6,500 new teachers. The Commons authorities have confirmed that there will be three ministerial statments in the Commons this afternoon. 3.30pm: Keir Starmer on the 7 October anniversary and the Middle East After 4.30pm: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, on the Chagos Islands After 5.30pm: Sarah Jones, the industry minister, on the recent carbon capture, usage and storage investment At the No 10 lobby briefing the PM\u2019s spokesperson also rejected claims that Keir Starmer has a problem working with women. Asked whether Rosie Duffield was right to make this claim, the day after she resigned the Labour whip, the spokesperson said: I wouldn\u2019t accept that characterisation at all. Downing Street has defended the decision to replace Sue Gray as the PM\u2019s chief of staff, saying Keir Starmer wants the \u201cright structures\u201d in place. At the morning lobby briefing, asked if Gray was sacked or if she resigned, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: I think you saw from the statement yesterday the prime minister is focused on delivering the change that he was elected to, and taking decisions to ensure that we have the structures in place to best deliver for the country. [He has made] a number of appointments to strengthen the Downing Street operation and demonstrate his determination to deliver the change the country voted for. In relation to the individual you refer to, you\u2019ve got the PM\u2019s words thanking his former chief of staff for all of her support, both in opposition and in government, and her work to prepare the government [for taking office] \u2026 I think it\u2019s right to reflect on the first weeks and months in office to ensure that you do have the right structures in place going forward to deliver change for the country. The spokesperson would not answer questions about how much Gray will be paid in her new job as the PM\u2019s envoy to the nations and regions, whether it will be full-time or part-time, and whether she will receive a peerage. Asked if the PM was worried Gray might clash in her new role with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland secretaries, the spokesperson replied: No, no, not at all. They will work constructively and collaboratively within the existing set-up. You can read all the Guardian\u2019s coverage and commentary on the departure of Sue Gray as Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff here. She was in effect sacked, but technically she chose to resign, and she is taking up another government role, and so a lot of the news coverage has avoided that word because it implies the process was marginally more brutal than it was. But it was very harsh. Last week Gray was one of the half a dozen or so most powerful people in government. Now she has an obscure role liasing with mayors and the devolved governments. Here are extracts from some of the comment on her departure that has appeared on other news websites. Stephen Bush in the Financial Times says replacing Gray with Morgan McSweeney should clarify who\u2019s in charge in No 10. He says: One of Michael Gove\u2019s habits as a minister, when told in a memo that \u201cDowning Street wants this\u201d, was to scribble back a note saying \u201cDowning Street is a building. WHO wants it?\u201d And the big problem that has plagued Keir Starmer\u2019s new government is that a lot of the time, that answer has not been clear even to people inside the building. Ministers and aides outside of it have frequently complained that getting clarity on what Downing Street actually wants is like pulling teeth. That lack of a clear steer is part of why the government has struggled to get past things such as the rows over freebies. One reason for that is that Starmer opted to make his Downing Street a duopoly: a political lead in the shape of Morgan McSweeney and an administrative one in the shape of Sue Gray. That largely worked well in opposition, with the odd eruption into public view of how one half of Starmer\u2019s office was a \u201cboys club\u201d or the other half comprised of ex-civil servants lacking a political sense. But it was not working in government. He has now fixed that mistake, though it is not clear if McSweeney can do the administrative half of the role. Tom McTague in an article for UnHerd says giving McSweeney more power has ideological consequences. What McSweeney really offers is a hard-headed, unromantic clarity about Labour\u2019s purpose that is more reminiscent of the party\u2019s tougher social democratic past than its softer liberal present. He \u2014 more than Starmer \u2014 is someone who would be instantly recognisable to any figure from the old Labour Right, from Ernest Bevin to John Reid but is a rarer sight in Westminster of late. He did not learn his politics at Oxford and the bar, but on council estates working for local government. This experience has given him an instinctive loathing for the kind of badge-wearing politics of virtue the Labour Right has long associated with the middle-class Left. McSweeney sees the purpose of Labour in straightforward, class terms: to represent in government the interests of ordinary people who are not otherwise looked after by their employers, landlords \u2014 or, indeed, politicians. He holds those officials who failed to protect the working-class girls of Rochdale in particular contempt. Unlike many in the party, this idea of purpose also combines with an instinctive sympathy for the attitudes and instincts of their voters and those McSweeney believes should be Labour voters. Oliver Wright, Patrick Maguire and Chris Smyth say in the Times that Gray herself was to blame for the government\u2019s communications problems. A senior adviser to Starmer involved in forcing Gray\u2019s departure said that the prime minister had also come to the view that she, rather than his communications team, was the person ultimately to blame for weeks of negative headlines over donations, freebies and the influence of the Labour donor Lord Alli over the government. \u201cThere was no grid for the first 100 days,\u201d a senior government source said. \u201cAnd that was the one thing she was expected to be working on while everyone else was busy on the campaign. There was barely a single story about how the culture of government was being changed. And, of course, there was a total lack of foresight or awareness about the criticism that would be coming down the pipe about crony appointments, wealthy donors, freebies \u2026 all the stuff she assumed would be OK because the Tories had done the same thing.\u201d Robert Peston, ITV\u2019s political editor, says on social media that this is a display of Starmer\u2019s ruthlessness. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Keir Starmer\u2019s ruthlessness and unsentimentality is like nothing I\u2019ve encountered in decades of reporting on the brutal world of British politics. It was transparently obvious that the centre of his government had been dysfunctional since the general election on 4 July. But to replace a chief of staff, Sue Gray, who endured considerable opprobrium from former colleagues and the media for choosing to work for him in the first place, and so soon after the election, is quite something. Cathy Newman from Channel 4 News says some in the Labour party do not think the appointments will quash claims that a \u201cboy\u2019s club\u201d is in charge. (This is an accusation made strongly by the former Labour MP Rosie Duffield.) Quite a bit of consternation among Labour women about Sue Gray\u2019s ousting &amp; new Morgan McSweeney \u201cfiefdom\u201d. Vidhya Alakeson &amp; Jill Cuthbertson installed as his deputies but some disgruntled sources suggest they\u2019re \u201cwindow dressing\u201d to dispel reports of a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d. John Rentoul in the Independent says the reshuffle will prevent the Tories being able to claim there is a power vacuum in Downing Street. Suddenly, the Tory press \u201cline to take\u201d about a vacuum in No 10 has disintegrated. There is no PPS and no cabinet secretary, they said; the No 10 operation is weak. Now there is a powerful chief of staff, with two deputies, and a PPS. A new cabinet secretary will be appointed in time and after a due process. At a press conference this morning Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, said his party would launch a private prosecution against the men suspected of being involved in a disturbance at Manchester Airport in July if they are not charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). As PA Media reports an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation is under way into the incident and nobody has been charged. In a letter to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, Farage and the other four Reform UK MPs said: We have genuine reason to be concerned that in fact the CPS is awaiting for the IOPC to find some fault with the police officers, which will then give them a reason not to progress charges against the assailants. This is totally unacceptable. As PA reports, the MPs said that if necessary they would try to crowdfund a private criminal prosecution. Sophie Linden, London\u2019s deputy mayor for policing and crime, is stepping down after eight years working with Sadiq Khan to take a job as an adviser to Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, Khan has announced. In a statement Linden claimed that policing in the capital was \u201cfar more diverse, transparent and accountable\u201d than when she started. Matt Chorley from Radio 5 Live posted this on social media yesterday to provide some context about the departure of Sue Gray. Brown\u2019s chief of staff left after 6months. Labour lost the election. Cameron\u2019s director of comms, left after 8months &amp; went to jail. Tories won. Johnson\u2019s chief aide left after 16months. PM was later ousted. Not everything has to be \u201cunprecedented\u201d. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has described Sue Gray as a \u201csuperb public servant\u201d. Speaking to reporters this morning, he said: I thank Sue Gray for all that she did as a superb public servant. I congratulate her as she heads into this new role, working with Labour, connecting us, the Government, with the regions, particularly across our country. According to the Telegraph, Robert Jenrick, who until very recently was the clear bookmakers\u2019 favourite in the Tory leadership contest, has called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into Sue Gray. Jenrick said: Sue Gray\u2019s tenure in Downing Street was one of the unhappiest in the long history of that building. It\u2019s clear that she has left dozens of junior staff hurt and upset. But there were serious allegations made that warrant full investigation. In particular, the reports that Ms Gray - a political appointee - blocked sensitive intelligence briefings from being given to the Prime Minister. These are incredibly serious claims that come at a dangerous time for the world. Ms Gray should be blocked from taking up her new role until the Propriety and Ethics team at the Cabinet Office - a unit she once ran - have carried out a full investigation. Jenrick is referring to a story in the Mail on Sunday over the summer that quoted a \u201csource\u201d saying that, sometimes when they said they wanted to brief Keir Starmer on a sensitive national security issue, Gray asked them to tell her instead so she could pass it on. Given that deciding how the PM managed his time was a big part of her job, the report was not widely seen as evidence of Gray being a security liability. Andy Street, the Tory former West Midlands mayor, has issued a statement on social media endorsing Tom Tugendhat for the Tory leadership. He says: The past week at #CPC24 I spent my time championing a moderate, inclusive brand of Conservatism. One that focuses on real societal issues, not ideology. To me @TomTugendhat embodies that best, &amp; I hope MPs give members a proper choice on the different versions of Conservatism. In response, Tugendhat posted a message saying Street represents \u201cthe best of our party\u201d. Andy represents the best of our party. I\u2019m honoured to have his endorsement. Tugendhat came joint last of the four candidates still in the race in the last ballot of Tory MPs. He had the same number of votes as James Cleverly, who is widely seen as the winner of the Tory conference beauty parade, and Tugendhat is expected to be voted out on Wednesday afternoon. Keir Starmer has issued a statement to mark the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. Describing it as \u201cthe darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust\u201d, he calls for the hostages to be returned, for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, for Britons to \u201cunequivocally stand with the Jewish community\u201d, but also for them to \u201cnot look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East\u201d. According to YouGov polling released this morning, 59% of voters regard the Labour government as sleazy. Commenting on this in his write-up for YouGov says: Just three months since taking power, six in ten Britons (59%) already describe the Labour government as at least fairly \u2018sleazy\u2019 \u2013 double the 28% who would describe it as not very sleazy or not sleazy at all. Although this is not as high as the three-quarters of the public (77%) who see either the previous Conservative government or British governments in general as sleazy, it is hardly a positive result. The polling also suggests that Keir Starmer personally is seen as more sleazy than Rishi Sunak. But he still has a long way to go to catch up with Boris Johnson. And the polling suggests that almost four in 10 voters feel let down by the government\u2019s approach to standards. You might expect any minister who served in government under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss to think twice about denouncing \u201cunserious politicians\u201d. But that is how Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leadership candidate, has commenced an article in the Daily Mail about the Sue Gray affair. She says: It\u2019s time to get serious. We are being governed by unserious politicians and Sue Gray\u2019s departure yesterday is part of the pattern. In the article Badenoch says Gray, who was a civil servant when she was equalities minister, tried to stop her using a never-before-used power in the Scotland Act to block the Scottish government\u2019s gender recognition reform bill. She says: When I worked with Sue Gray (who, by the way, I quite like), she tried to pressure me into dropping my opposition to the SNP\u2018s crazy Gender Recognition Bill. This was the very bill that, if not blocked by Westminster, would have allowed 16-year-olds to \u2018self-identify\u2019 as the opposite sex \u2013 no medical diagnosis required. Many ministers might have bowed to such pressure from a senior mandarin. But I stood firm. For me, this was a matter of principle, not politics. There is a strong chance that Badenoch\u2019s bid for the Tory leadership will come to an end this week, when Tory MPs vote on Wednesday and Thursday to eliminate two candidates, leaving just two on the ballot paper for members, and Badenoch\u2019s article is mainly about herself, and her leadership credentials, not Gray. She claims that her comment at the Tory conference last week about up to 10% of civil servants being \u201cshould be in prison bad\u201d was just a \u201clight-hearted gag\u201d, and that the fact it was not taken this way shows she scares the left. At Tory conference, I made a light-hearted gag that some civil servants are so bad at their jobs they should be jailed, but of course, some humourless headlines couldn\u2019t see the joke. But these kinds of misrepresentations will happen to anyone who has convictions that scare the left. That\u2019s why we need a straight-talking leader who is cool under pressure and has a clear vision and direction for our party and our country. In an interview with the Today programme, John Healey, the defence secretary, rejected the claim by Alastair Campbell and John McTernan that it was a mistake to delay the budget. (See 9.21am.) When this was put to him, he replied: We saw with Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng what happens when you try and rush a budget. So this needs to be done properly. Good morning. Opposition parties are fond of accusing a prime minister in difficulties of attempting a relaunch, and sometimes you hear the claim every time there is a big speech after a single bad week. But what we are seeing from Keir Starmer this week is a genuine relaunch, triggered by a recognition that things were going wrong. It is a big moment for the government \u2013 although how much difference it will make will not be clear for a while. Here is our overnight story. And here is Pippa Crerar\u2019s analysis. John Healey, the defence secretary, was the cabinet minister doing the morning interview round and he tried to play down the significance of Sue Gray outlasting Liz Truss in her time as the most powerful woman in No 10, but not by a huge amount. Asked on LBC if the government was at crisis point, Healey replied: \u201cI\u2019d characterise this as a new government getting on with the job.\u201d Thankfully, other veterans from the New Labour era have been much more frank, honest and interesting when asked for their take in interviews this morning. They have been arguing that, while this crisis is not terminal, Starmer needs to get much better at communicating what his government stands for and is doing. (One of the appointments yesterday was James Lyons, an ex-Daily Mirror journalist, as head of strategic communications, and this may make a difference. As a lobby journalist, he excelled at hard-hitting knocking copy. If he had been in No 10 over the summer, it is difficult to imagine the freebies story running as long as it did without firmer rebuttal.) But two of Tony Blair\u2019s key advisers have also said that one of Starmer\u2019s big mistake was to wait so long until having a budget. Alastair Campbell, who was Blair\u2019s communications chief in No 10 and who now co-hosts the Rest is Politics podcast, told the Today programme: The most important thing is to understand that in the modern age, when it comes to strategy and strategic communications, you have to develop, execute and narrate strategy all at once. And I think the point about the budget is really important. When Margaret Thatcher won in 1979, Geoffrey Howe delivered the budget five weeks after the election. Gordon Brown in 1997 he delivered the budget eight weeks after the election. David Cameron and [George] Osborne in 2010 \u2013 six weeks. We\u2019re having to wait almost 16 weeks since the election. And I think that is what creates this sense of people not quite sure what the government\u2019s about. The key strategic pillars when a new government comes in, you have the king\u2019s speech, you have the party conference \u2026 and you also have the budget. And the budget is probably the most important of those. Campbell said there had definitely been \u201cmissteps\u201d that had led to what happened yesterday. But, in response to a question from the presenter Mishal Husain he said: \u201cYou say it comes to this as though the whole thing is a complete irrecoverable shambles, which I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d Better communication was essential, he said: Government is harder than opposition. And government is not just about the technocratic delivery of policy and change. It\u2019s about the relentless, endless, never-ending conversation that you\u2019re having with the country about what you are trying to do for the country. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that that bit has been largely missing. In a separate interview on Times Radio, John McTernan, who was Blair\u2019s political secretary in No 10, said delaying the budget so long was \u201ca terrible miscalculation\u201d. He said as a result the government had been defined, in the public mind, by the decision to cut winter fuel payments. The government was not controlling the narrative, he said: The government has completely lost grip, a grip on their operations, a grip on the media grid, and they don\u2019t dominate communications. And that has been because they have lacked a political narrative and the political drive and the momentum that drove them through the election to a great victory. That seemed to run out after the sitting weeks ended in July and we got into the recess of August. It just went from the country demanding change to a government delivering drift. Stewart Wood, another New Labour veteran, who worked as an adviser for Gordon Brown in No 10, told the Today programme that he hoped the government would now get back on track. He said: Parliament\u2019s only been sitting for, I think, less than 20 days so far in the first 100 days of the government. So the space for the new policy agenda has been limited. But [the No 10 reshuffle] hopefully is going to enable a focus to be on the policy agenda, on GB Energy, on GB Railways, on planning reform, all the things the government wanted to set out, a workers\u2019 rights package. I think this has got to be a drawing a line moment for the internal stories that have come to take the place of the policy-focused stories. There will be more comment on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and the party\u2019s four other MPs hold a press conference on \u201ctwo tier policing in Britain, with a special announcement and focus on the policing incident at Manchester Airport on 23 July 2024\u201d. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Keir Starmer is expected to make a Commons statement on his visit to the UN general assembly. After that there may also be a statement from David Lammy, the foreign secretary, on the handover of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.

      "bodyText": "A large French Alpine ski resort has announced it is to close, citing a lack of funds to become a year-round destination, as low- and medium-altitude mountain areas around Europe struggle with a truncated season due to global heating and declining snowfalls. Local councillors voted not to reopen Alpe du Grand Serre in the Is\u00e8re this winter, saying they could no longer pay for the mountain lifts or pay to complete a programme to diversify as an all-year tourist destination. The move will wipe out 200 jobs and hit businesses in the nearby village of La Morte, whose economy and population of 150 people depend on winter sports. A local sports shop owner, Lauranne Vincent, told France 3 television: \u201cWe are devastated and shocked. It\u2019s a brutal decision coming two months before we were due to open. We were hoping the opposite would happen. We said all lights were green to go.\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Laurence, the owner of a grocery shop in La Morte, added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been left completely in the lurch. We still have loans to pay as we\u2019ve only been here four years. Who will pay them? Our lives have been ruined. That\u2019s what is going to happen to us.\u201d A lack of snow in the past two years has meant slopes opening later and being forced to close during the season, keeping skiers away. The loss-making Alpe du Grand Serre has also suffered from ageing infrastructure and a lack of investment over the past 40 years. The local authority has spent nearly \u20ac3m since 2021 on a project that would keep the resort open all year round, attracting visitors with hiking and bike paths, but said it did not have the money to continue with it for the final two years before completion. Coraline Saurat, president of the local authority, said it had come to the \u201cunfortunate conclusion\u201d that it could not afford to renew its contract with the company that operates the lifts or continue with the diversification plan. The closure decision has sparked calls for the state to invest in threatened ski stations. \u201cThe state is not giving us any concrete support for the future of the resort or for a transitional operation,\u201d said Saurat, who had warned in January the resort was facing a \u20ac7m hole in its budget. \u201cIs it up to local authorities to run the stations? That\u2019s a real question today.

The fielder did well to get to the contest diving forward but wasn\u2019t able to keep it off the turf \u2013 that\u2019s the second half-chance England have had from the opener. Later in the over at Wolvaardt, Dean pushes past her outside edge with extra pace, <em>just</em> missing the off-stump.

Super accurate and able to alter her pace from ball to ball, she\u2019s going to be a handful on these surfaces. Three dots are followed by a cut for a couple by Brits.

Over number two will be Linsey Smith. England\u2019s left-arm spinner was great against Bangladesh, especially early. But Wolvaardt makes room first ball, enough to crunch her through cover for four \u2013 top shot. Smith finds her range soon enough. As Lydia Greenway notes on telly, Smith\u2019s story is an important one, forcing her way back into this side in her late 20s after spending the last five years in the wilderness after initially playing at the T20 World Cup back in 2018. It speaks volumes about how strong the England domestic system has become that she\u2019s had the chance to bounce back into the side at this stage of her career, now at the peak of her powers. She sneaks past Brits\u2019 inside edge later in the over, prompting a leg before shout, but it\u2019s sliding past the leg stump and they elect not to review.

      "bodyText": "Tougher than it looked. South Africa were right on top with Kapp bowling beautifully in the power play but it just drifted in the middle overs, to the point where Nat Sciver-Brunt was able to do as she does so well with the pressure on. And Danni Wyatt-Hodge was just as important when the going was tough. So, England are two from two with Scotland and the West Indies to go, their next game against the former on Sunday. As for the Proteas, they will need to keep winning, their next outing in two days from now, also against Scotland. Alright, that\u2019s me done \u2013 thanks for your company. Bye! Over extra cover for four! Nat Sciver-Brunt finishes the job. 19.2 overs: England 125-3 (Sciver-Brunt 48, Knight 0). Target 125. 19th over: England 121-3 (Sciver-Brunt 44, Knight 0). Target 125. de Klerk is bowling all back-of-the-hand now and NSB is equal to the task, across her stumps to sweep a boundary just to make sure of England\u2019s position early in this penultimate over. She keeps the strike too, pulling from way outside the off-stump down to midwicket, which will mean she is at the business end with four runs needed from six balls. One last chance to put the pressure on? Wyatt, who has done so much right \u2013 including a square drive for four earlier in this over 0- went dancing to finish and missed a delivery that had some extra pace taken off it, well gloved by Jafta. 11 off 12 needed. 18th over: England 114-3 (Sciver-Brunt 38). Target 125. 17th over: England 107-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 38, Sciver-Brunt 36). Target 125. Another dropped catch! It\u2019s the captain at cover, Wyatt-Hodge giving her a chance up and over her right shoulder after lifting a back-of-the-hand slower ball from the bottom of the bat. Wolvaardt\u2019s drop might be it for Proteas with the next ball, pace on, taken by Sciver-Brunt behind square for a clever four. I feel for de Klerk, who has bowled far better than 1/17 from three \u2013 a top edge falls safely to finish. 18 from 18 is now the ask. If they can get rid of both of these set batters\u2026 well, obviously that\u2019s their only hope. 16th over: England 101-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 37, Sciver-Brunt 31). Target 125. A lot riding on Mlaba now but she can\u2019t quite get it right, letting the set pair score relatively easily to the sweepers on the legside. Seven off leaves 24 from 24. Time for England to ice it. 15th over: England 94-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 33, Sciver-Brunt 28). Target 125. This is such an important over. And the response from Sciver-Brunt \u2013 predicting that it was going to be banged into the pitch but ended up a half-tracker, put away for four. Three balls left in her spell. Two now. One. Four more! Not quite as short this time but NSB makes it look like it is, pulling a second boundary. 12 off the over. That should be decisive. Kapp is finished; 1/17 from her overs. Sciver-Brunt, as usual, stands up when it matters. 14th over: England 82-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 32, Sciver-Brunt 17). Target 125. Tryon once again \u2013 her third. An important over, effectively the final over needed from their fifth bowler, with Luus helping out with one. Six off, no boundaries threatened and no inch given. With 43 off 36 left, South Africa are now pushing the Marizanne Kapp button. 13th over: England 76-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 31, Sciver-Brunt 12). Target 125. Sune Luus for the first time, which used to be the classic high-risk/high-reward play when she was a volatile legspinner. In theory, it\u2019s a bit different now she\u2019s turned herself into a finger spinner but Wyatt has made her mind up that this is the over she needs to get the game on her terms, taking risks but getting away with it early on before slamming her down the ground for four \u2013 a powerful strike. Pulling to deep midwicket she doesn\u2019t quite get as much, bringing Brits into the game running off the rope, but she\u2019s not quite able to get her hands under it \u2013 terrific fielding all the game. 10 off the over. The required rate is back to exactly seven an over, which is where I reckon it\u2019ll be with six balls to go. 12th over: England 66-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 24, Sciver-Brunt 9). Target 125. Cat and mouse stuff here, England getting the singles they need to keep the board moving but aren\u2019t willing to risk giving it big to break the chase open. de Klerk has a fine back-of-the-hand change-up and uses it a few times through the over, the last of which came ever so close to a return catch opportunity from Nat Sciver-Brunt. This is on a knife edge. 11th over: England 62-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 22, Sciver-Brunt 7). Target 125. Ohhh, Wyatt clips to backward square but de Klerk elects not to dive after running in off the rope \u2013 she saves the subsequent runs but was that a chance to take a defining catch? Seven runs from the Khaka over, which is exactly what they need. She has one still to bowl, Kapp as well. It\u2019ll be of critical importance for South Africa when those two overs are used. \u201cG\u2019day Adam.\u201d Hello, Simon McMahon. Having already lost to Bangladesh and the Windies, I fear for Scotland\u2019s women against both these sides. Still, \u2018good experience\u2019, right? Regarding this game, it\u2019s looking like it could be a close one. Tell me, will there be a SUPER OVER if the scores are level at the end.\u201d Scotland are unlikely to win a game but the experience of being at a World Cup, qualifying the way that they did, is considerable. Given this tournament expands in 2026, we will be seeing plenty of them in the years to come on the big stage. As for tonight\u2026 I\u2019m with you, the Super Over feels almost inevitable, doesn\u2019t it? 10th over: England 55-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 21, Sciver-Brunt 2). Target 125. They are looking to scoop Mlaba at every opportunity but are yet to take a boundary off her. Last ball here, four from it, and four it will stay with NSB unable to beat short fine. So, it\u2019s drinks at the halfway mark of the chase. England require 70 from 60 balls from here \u2013 I won\u2019t undermine your intelligence by telling you what the required rate therefore is. 9th over: England 51-2 (Wyatt-Hodge 18, Sciver-Brunt 1). Target 125. de Klerk came ever so close to bowling Wyatt earlier in the over, who responded to that fortune by playing her best shot: a carve over the top of point for four. It\u2019s to the credit of the South African seamer that it was then that she turned to her slower ball and got her reward. It does bring Nat Sciver-Brunt to the middle though: England\u2019s most reliable matchwinner. Huge moment! A slower ball, clipped back to the bowler. Such a clever cricketer, de Klerk makes no mistake in her follow-through. Big response from the Proteas! 8th over: England 40-1 (Wyatt-Hodge 13, Capsey 18). Target 125. Tryon again? Alright. Capsey is cool with that, dancing then lofting over extra cover for four \u2013 good cricket. Into the pitch works at Wyatt, picking out point a couple of times. Handy dots. A shovel to midwicket nearly brings two but Jafta, the \u2018keeper, charges after it to deny a second. The required rate from here is just over seven an over. This is set up for a thriller. 7th over: England 33-1 (Wyatt-Hodge 12, Capsey 12). Target 125. Nonkululeko Mlaba for some more left-arm orthodox with the field now back. I\u2019m a bit surprised they didn\u2019t stick with pace given how well it was going to this point. Capsey is into the bag of tricks right away, scooping a couple then trying it again and getting another via an edge. Wyatt-Hodge\u2019s turn and she\u2019s sweeping too. The game has changed entirely since spin was introduced, with these two enjoying the change of gear. Still, only five off. 6th over: England 28-1 (Wyatt-Hodge 11, Capsey 9). Target 125. Spin for the first time via Chloe Tryon; left-arm tweakers. And nearly another chance! DWH saw it short and flat-batted over cover but only just. A half-tracker to Capsey prompts a more convincing shot, pulled for four \u2013 a settler. Tryon responds with a dart at middle stump, kept out. Plenty riding on every ball with the field set to go back in a few balls time. Full again, sweep\u2026 four more! That\u2019s a top shot from Capsey, who I remind you was dropped third ball, before scoring, in the previous over \u2013 how that might define this match. 12 off it. 5th over: England 16-1 (Wyatt-Hodge 8, Capsey 0). Target 125. Alice Capsey in at No3 with plenty to do\u2026 and she\u2019s put down third ball! Bosch at backward point could\u2019ve made it a double wicket maiden, steered off the face \u2013 not a tough chance. Oh dear. It\u2019s still a brilliant wicket maiden from South Africa\u2019s number one but ever so close to something very special. Surely they bowl her through from here? Game on. Yep! Umps call, that\u2019s taking enough of leg stump after Bouchier missed her whip after shuffling across the crease. Kapp loves bowling that third over inside the power play and it pays off big time for the Proteas who are making all the running here. IS BOUCHIER LBW TO KAPP? Yes says the ump, review says the batter. Up we go! 4th over: England 16-0 (Bouchier 8, Wyatt-Hodge 8). Target 125. Khaka goes again. Quick single first ball, direct hit! Bouchier is home, the third ump confirms, but it\u2019s further evidence that the South Africans are all over this. Four singles to begin the over, which is not for nothing given all the dots in the first three overs. Wyatt-Hodge, starved of the strike so far, has to wait as they replace one of those zing balls (not for me). Anyway, Khaka is a bowler she knows well, confident enough to dance at her to lift over mid-off for four. Eight off the over, and some confidence with it for England. 3rd over: England 8-0 (Bouchier 6, Wyatt-Hodge 2). Target 125. Bouchier is battling to get it out of the fielding circle here, timing a couple of balls straight to offside fielders. They take out second slip to throw another fielder in the ring and she picks another outin turn. 2 from 13, two balls to go. Make that 2 off 14 \u2013 beaten by a Kapp gem, hitting the seam, ever so close to the edge. Last ball here, will Bouchier try something? She does! Dancing and connecting, over mid-on for four. What a relief that\u2019ll be. 2nd over: England 3-0 (Bouchier 2, Wyatt-Hodge 1). Target 125. Khaka starts with a booming inswinger to Wyatt-Hodge, who has to play it with respect. It was in the UAE that Khaka took a T20 5fa in the FairBreak Invitational a couple of years ago \u2013 a tournament I was working on. It was the same there was no pace at all but she was able to get it hoopoing around consistently, proving a nightmare in the power play. Super stuff from the get-go to Bouchier too after Wyatt gets off-strike \u2013 she\u2019s now absorbed nine got balls to start her innings, yikes. Last ball here, will she have a dart at it? Ohh \u2013 she does! Dance, inside edge, just missed the stumps \u2013 she\u2019s off the mark with two. The Proteas are all over them here but they have to add an early wicket next. 1st over: England 0-0 (Bouchier 0, Wyatt-Hodge 0). Target 125. Inside edge second ball! So close to the woodwork. No pace to work with here, Bouchier is nearly sorted out by movement in the air back towards the stumps. Kapp, so clever, follows it with an outswinger. Oooh, and another of those with the fifth ball here brings a conventional play-and-miss. Super start this. Maiden complete! What a cricketer, Marizanne Kapp. Marizanne Kapp has the new ball. What a competitive. Maia Bouchier is waiting for her, with Danni Wyatt-Hodge down the non-strikers\u2019 end. PLAY! It\u2019ll be a very different approach from South Africa with the ball. England went with just Sciver-Brunt\u2019s medium pace followed by four spinners. For the Proteas, they\u2019ll have at least four seamers in operation here including Marizanne Kapp, who for most of the last ten years has been the top-ranked T20i bowler in the world. From there, watch for Ayabonga Khaka\u2019s in-swinger with the new ball and Nadine de Klerk\u2019s outswing throughout. But Wyatt-Hodge loves to cut and slap; they must bowl straight. This is set up nicely. 125 doesn\u2019t look a daunting target but boundaries are so difficult to come by on these slow pitches. To put it into context, it\u2019s seven more than they were able to get against Bangladesh on this ground two days ago. England\u2019s four spinners did well to drag it back in the middle overs after the Proteas got out of the blocks well, but the final few overs went the way of the batting team. This should be fun. Back shortly. 20th over: South Africa 124-6 (Dercksen 20, de Klerk 1) Dercksen is who South Africa need on strike in the final over and she doesn\u2019t miss out when Sciver-Brunt gives her some pace to work with, pulling away for four. Two balls to go\u2026 inside edge, four more! They\u2019re above a run-a-ball now, the highest score on this ground in the tournament. Final ball of the innings and NSB goes for the back-of-the-hand slower ball and beats the blade. \u201cWe have a game on our hands here,\u201d says Lydia Greenway. Not wrong. Oh! A deflection of NSB\u2019s boot runs out Luus when backing up! The England superstar celebrates as a footballer might after scoring. You\u2019ll see that on social media. 19th over: South Africa 114-5 (Dercksen 11, Luus 1) Ecclestone has bowled superbly, varying her pace in the best tradition of clever finger spinners \u2013 they don\u2019t stand a chance of taking her out to the rope, four off. Ecclestone finishes with 2/15. Standard. Ecclestone again! With the first ball of the penultimate over she\u2019s picked up Kapp in much the same way she did Wolvaardt, crashing into the middle stump after taking plenty of pace off her stock delivery. Class, as always. Ends a very good knock. 18th over: South Africa 110-4 (Kapp 26, Dercksen 8) BOOM! Smith did everything right until the final ball when Annerie Dercksen slot-swept her outside the off-stump over midwicket into the crowd! That\u2019s the first six of the night and at the ideal time. It\u2019s Kapp who turns up the volume here with back-to-back boundaries, over cover against the spin then through midwicket with it. This has been a beaut of an innings, changing the energy entirely. But Dean bites back with her final ball bowling Tryon with from a very full length. They were disciplined, giving her nothing, and it worked. 17th over: South Africa 99-4 (Kapp 23) 16th over: South Africa 89-3 (Kapp 14, Tryon 1) Ecclestone to Tryon is a proper contest, and the points go to the spinner from this initial interaction: a yorker squeezed to point then a well-flighted alternative pushed to cover. It does mean Tryon keeps the strike though with Dean about to bowl to a player who will want to smash with the spin. Ecclestone! It\u2019s always Ecclestone. Beautiful dip, on target, middle stump rocked. Wolvaardt had to find a way to take her on but this wasn\u2019t high-percentage. As Lydia Greenway notes on telly though, this does bring Chloe Tryon to the middle\u2026 15th over: South Africa 85-2 (Wolvaardt 42, Kapp 11) Sciver-Brunt returns and Kapp takes her opportunity to work with some pace early on, crunching over extra cover for a classy boundary. Some player. Later in the over she had a dart at the same shot but doesn\u2019t quite middle it, giving Knight the chance to dive away to her left and drag it down \u2013 that saves at least a couple. Ten off though; the best over of the innings. From here, South Africa are set up to get up above 120, which will take some chasing. 14th over: South Africa 75-2 (Wolvaardt 40, Kapp 3) Kapp slaps her first ball past point for a couple that was very nearly a run out! Wolvaardt was happy with the one but Kapp was coming back but the throw went to the wrong end \u2013 not to be for England in the field, once again. The game feels different right away with Kapp out there, middling a single down the ground. Eight runs (and the wicket) from the over. Better. Both teams might be happy with that. Bosch nailed a lovely reverse from Glenn\u2019s first ball of the new over \u2013 exactly what she needed to start doing. Next ball it was an attempted lap: she missed, the legspinner hit. Time for Marizanne Kapp. 13th over: South Africa 67-1 (Wolvaardt 39, Bosch 14) We\u2019ve hit the point where it\u2019s in South Africa\u2019s interest to lose a wicket to give Chloe Tryon and Marizane Kapp a crack \u2013 a point made on TV too. Smith returns, no boundaries, seven off. It\u2019s not been 44 balls since the last time South Africa found the rope. Should they retire Bosch out? 12th over: South Africa 60-1 (Wolvaardt 37, Bosch 9) Facing four spinners, a T20 innings can get away from a batting team pretty quickly and that\u2019s the risk for South Africa unless they can start to assert themselves again. You can see Wolvaardt trying to do that using her feel to Glenn but it\u2019s all singles here once again. Another leg before shout comes at the end of the over, with Bosch again unable to make contact on the sweep, but it\u2019s given not out and Knight indicates that she thought it was missing off-stump so they don\u2019t refer it. England\u2019s spinners have been excellent since the power play, conceding just 25 runs in the next seven overs. Knight is turning the screws nicely. 11th over: South Africa 56-1 (Wolvaardt 35, Bosch 7) Shout for leg before from the first ball after drinks\u2026 turned down. It\u2019s Ecclestone asking the question and Bosch missing her sweep \u2013 they don\u2019t review due to the height height. I thought that was out? We get a second look thanks to TV and it was umpires\u2019 call \u2013 fair enough. Before you know it, Ecclestone has already reached the final ball of the over with just two singles conceded \u2013 she\u2019s brilliant at getting back to her mark and keeping the pressure on. Bosch can\u2019t beat midwicket to finish \u2013 she\u2019s 7 from 18, which is becoming a problem after South Africa\u2019s (relatively) brisk start, their run rate now down to just over five an over. 10th over: South Africa 54-1 (Wolvaardt 34, Bosch 6) Watching that drop back between overs, it was the most straightforward of the four with Ecclestone getting a good look and meeting the ball above knee height in her dive. Back to Glenn who races through another frugal set, Bosch unable to get her out of the fielding ring. Wolvaardt gets her chance from the final ball of the over and places out to deep midwicket, calling through a second run \u2013 it looks a chance for England but the throw isn\u2019t good enough. Drinks! 9th over: South Africa 51-1 (Wolvaardt 32, Bosch 5) Charlie Dean has three back on the legside now and bowls to that field, Wolvaardt unable to put away a drag down with a fielder at backward square. And another drop to finish! Sophie Ecclestone puts down Bosch on the edge of the circle at mid-off. The theme continues with this being a tough opportunity having to time her dive well, but none of the four have stuck so far. 8th over: South Africa 45-1 (Wolvaardt 28, Bosch 3) Now Sarah Glenn, the fourth spinner for England \u2013 their leggie. Expect her to attack the stumps with the field back. And so she does, three singles \u2013 Heath Knight is on camera and visibly happy with that. 7th over: South Africa 42-1 (Wolvaardt 26, Bosch 2) Another drop for England! Ecclestone, the best bowler in the world, finds Wolvaardt\u2019s edge first ball when looking to cut and it doesn\u2019t end up in Amy Jones\u2019 gloves. Another tough chance \u2013 they always are when a batter is cutting deep in the crease, but we\u2019re conditioned to Jones making those look easy. Five runs off Ecclestone without losing a wicket is a great result given what she normally does to teams in the middle overs. Wolvaardt is up for this. 6th over: South Africa 37-1 (Wolvaardt 22, Bosch 1) Shoooot! Laura Wolvaardt made her name at this level during the 2017 World Cup in England as a teenager when she played some of the best drives of the competition. Well, here\u2019s another of those through extra cover, threading Smith through the ring for the shot of the night so far. She retains the strike with a single down the ground \u2013 six runs and the wicket off the over. All told, the Proteas would be happy with where they are placed as the field drops back. To start the new over Brits dances at Smith with the clear intention of launching her over deep midwicket but picks out Gibson instead, coming in off that rope. Nice take. 5th over: South Africa 31-0 (Wolvaardt 17, Brits 13) That\u2019s a dropped catch from Sarah Glenn at short fine leg, Britts shoveling a sweep off the shoulder of the bat. The fielder did well to get to the contest diving forward but wasn\u2019t able to keep it off the turf \u2013 that\u2019s the second half-chance England have had from the opener. Later in the over at Wolvaardt, Dean pushes past her outside edge with extra pace, just missing the off-stump. To finish the over, the South African skipper gives the spinner her stumps when backing away to leg and has enough elevation to clear point for a couple. 4th over: South Africa 28-0 (Wolvaardt 15, Brits 12) Sciver-Brunt returns and the pace is to the delight of Wolvaardt, who muscles a pull shot through midwicket for four. This is turning into a very good start for the Proteas, four singles here on top of the boundary. 3rd over: South Africa 20-0 (Wolvaardt 9, Brits 10) Charlie Dean\u2019s turn. Aside from Sciver-Brunt it\u2019ll be all spin tonight, with Dean the off spin option for Heather Knight. Super accurate and able to alter her pace from ball to ball, she\u2019s going to be a handful on these surfaces. Three dots are followed by a cut for a couple by Brits. That shot prompts an overcorrection, too straight to finish and swept behind square for four. Six from the over doesn\u2019t feel like loads but every run-a-ball over is a win on these slow pitches. 2nd over: South Africa 14-0 (Wolvaardt 9, Brits 4) The call to prayer goes out as the sun starts to set in Sharjah. Over number two will be Linsey Smith. England\u2019s left-arm spinner was great against Bangladesh, especially early. But Wolvaardt makes room first ball, enough to crunch her through cover for four \u2013 top shot. Smith finds her range soon enough. As Lydia Greenway notes on telly, Smith\u2019s story is an important one, forcing her way back into this side in her late 20s after spending the last five years in the wilderness after initially playing at the T20 World Cup back in 2018. It speaks volumes about how strong the England domestic system has become that she\u2019s had the chance to bounce back into the side at this stage of her career, now at the peak of her powers. She sneaks past Brits\u2019 inside edge later in the over, prompting a leg before shout, but it\u2019s sliding past the leg stump and they elect not to review. Eight from the over. 1st over: South Africa 6-0 (Wolvaardt 4, Brits 1) Lovely shot first ball of the match, Wolvaardt using what pace there is to steer behind point for three; complete control. Ooh, dropped catch next up with Knight, back at first slip with Jones up to the stumps, unable to drag it in moving to her right. Not an easy chance; Brits gets a life right away. NSB misses down the legside but then gets back on target soon enough, so much so that Brits is nearly bowled shouldering arms! An eventful first over comes to an end. Nat Sciver-Brunt has the new ball. England\u2019s one seamer. She\u2019s up against Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits with Amy Jones up to the stumps right away. PLAY! Here come the players. Out to the middle for the national anthems, set to the ICC anthem, which is now a thing \u2013 seriously. South Africa\u2019s anthem has to be right at the top of the tree from those used by international cricket teams \u2013 certainly those that make it to World Cups on a regular basis. They\u2019re belting it out. The Proteas have been so close in these global tournaments over the last few years. If they can get up here, and set up a semi-final against Anyone But Australia, they\u2019ll be in great shape once again. The scores in the first innings at Sharjah so far in this comp: 119-7, 116, 93-7, 118-7. With that framing, we go out to the pitch report with Nat Germanos. She tells us that it is 36 degrees outside and that they\u2019re using a strip that makes one boundary a fraction shorter square of the wicket. Lisa Sthlaker reinforces that it\u2019ll be spin to win out there. England: Maia Bouchier, Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Heather Knight (c), Alice Capsey, Amy Jones (wk), Danielle Gibson, Sophie Ecclestone, Charlie Dean, Sarah Glenn, Linsey Smith. South Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (c), Tazmin Brits, Marizanne Kapp, Anneke Bosch, Sune Luus, Chloe Tryon, Nadine de Klerk, Annerie Dercksen, Sinolo Jafta (wk), Nonkululeko Mlaba, Ayabonga Khaka. Runs on the board and all that. Heather Knight says she would\u2019ve batted first too had she won the toss. Laura Wolvaardt is asked what she wants her team to improve upon. \u201cEverything.\u201d There you go. Of greater interest, both teams are unchanged. Good afternoon. Welcome to some Group B action from the T20 Women\u2019s World Cup in the UAE. Today we\u2019re down the Sharjah end of the freeway for a fixture that may not necessarily dictate which team advanced from England and South Africa \u2013 all things being equal, both should - but as importantly, who avoids Australia in the semi. For the Proteas, they stitched together the most impressive performance of the tournament so far, putting away the Windies by ten wickets. England, who are the favourites to top the group, were less impressive with the bat but never gave Bangladesh a chance with their four-pronged spin attack making the most of the slow surface. Expect the same today on that front with run-a-ball scores the objective. We\u2019re not far from the toss \u2013 I\u2019ll be back for that, and the teams, at 2:30pm BST with the first ball 3pm.

      "bodyText": "A rescue deal for the UK arm of TGI Fridays has been struck, with two private equity groups to buy 51 restaurants \u2013 although a further 35 outlets are to close with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. Calveton UK and Breal Capital, which own upmarket restaurants including Le Pont de la Tour, Quaglino\u2019s and Coq d\u2019Argent, have bought 51 sites from the joint administrators Teneo, which will result in the transfer of 2,389 employees. However, Teneo said in a statement that 35 restaurants were not included within the sale and so have been closed with immediate effect, resulting in 1,012 job losses. Restaurants due to close include those in Barnsley, Chelmsford, Dundee, Durham, Leeds, Newcastle, Northampton, Halifax and Swansea. The closures and job losses led to an angry response from Unite, the trade union. Unite Hospitality claimed in a social media post on X that staff had been shut out of sites and had been invited to a head office Zoom call with only one hour\u2019s notice. Bryan Simpson, Unite lead organiser for hospitality, said in a statement: \u201cThe way in which workers have been treated across TGI Fridays today is a national disgrace. To close venues and lock people out of their workplace with absolutely no notice is a moral outrage \u2026 We are currently supporting our TGI members through this incredibly anxious situation.\u201d Teneo said it had no comment on the union\u2019s X post. The rescue deal comes less than a month after the TGI Fridays parent company, Hostmore, appointed the advisory firm Teneo as administrators after struggling to turn around the business. Its restaurants have continued to operate as normal as administrators rushed to secure a deal. Daniel Smith, a senior managing director at Teneo, said in a statement that the casual dining sector had been hit by reduced discretionary spend due to the cost of living crisis. \u201cThis transaction with Breal Capital and Calveton UK preserves a significant proportion of jobs and will hopefully provide the business with the stability and support it needs to recover and grow.\u201d he said.

So much of what you\u2019ve said in this article reflects the stories that we hear from our service users.</p> <p>Domestic abuse can start after separation or be a continuation of what happened during the relationship. It\u2019s about maintaining control, and usually there are two ways of doing this \u2013 through money (economic abuse, eg maintenance) and the children (eg contact via the family courts). In this scenario, the perpetrators have a new raft of tools at their disposal and other services \u2013 police, family law, education, social services, health \u2013 are often unwittingly manipulated into becoming part of the abuse picture.</p> <p>As far as we know, our service is the only one of its kind in the country. We help mothers to rebuild their lives for themselves and their children. We offer wraparound emotional health and wellbeing services, access to a case worker, peer support and practical help (when we have the funds to do this), such as legal assistance and counselling. However, the demand far outstrips our capacity.</p> <p>Anecdotally, we know that the issue nationally is significant \u2013 you&nbsp;only need to take a look at the comments posted by followers of the Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/legallynik/\">@LegallyNik</a> (run by a Mums In Need patron). We\u2019re determined to do more. Long term, we want to roll out our support model nationwide. We want to flip the narrative through education, training and awareness.

It\u2019s about maintaining control, and usually there are two ways of doing this \u2013 through money (economic abuse, eg maintenance) and the children (eg contact via the family courts). In this scenario, the perpetrators have a new raft of tools at their disposal and other services \u2013 police, family law, education, social services, health \u2013 are often unwittingly manipulated into becoming part of the abuse picture. As far as we know, our service is the only one of its kind in the country. We help mothers to rebuild their lives for themselves and their children. We offer wraparound emotional health and wellbeing services, access to a case worker, peer support and practical help (when we have the funds to do this), such as legal assistance and counselling. However, the demand far outstrips our capacity. Anecdotally, we know that the issue nationally is significant \u2013 you only need to take a look at the comments posted by followers of the Instagram account @LegallyNik (run by a Mums In Need patron). We\u2019re determined to do more. Long term, we want to roll out our support model nationwide. We want to flip the narrative through education, training and awareness. The starting point for this is training family law professionals. This is where change will happen. Annie Moon General trustee, Mums In Need \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.",

Pristine gems printed by the photographer herself at home, they preserve time with attentiveness and reverence. A portrait of the furrowed face of elderly gentleman, his skin beaten to an impossible texture, presumably by the elements, rivals the stoic beauty of any Robert Frank or August Sander. A portrait of an elderly woman, meanwhile, finds the woman somewhere between labour and repose: sitting in her doorway, stockinged leg struck out, finger wagging. It seems to describe a generation, toughness and tenderness embodied, resilient and raging. A rag hangs limply on the brick wall beside her, like a flag.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Delyth became fascinated with political graffiti and attended protests across Wales and England for Welsh rights, for civil rights, for peace. She photographed signs, posters and emblems of grassroots activism.

The exhibition also shows how involved Delyth was in driving photography forward, trying to make it relevant beyond pictures hanging on walls or printed on pages. She cooked up an idea for portable exhibitions. And in 1978, she co-founded <a href=\"https://www.ffotogallery.org/\">Ffotogallery</a>, Wales\u2019 first dedicated photography institution. Fragments is also about photography\u2019s unique ability to bring people together. It\u2019s astonishing how little she is known outside Welsh-speaking communities.</p> <p>Delyth\u2019s exhibition sets the tone for the wider festival \u2013 which takes place not only across Cardiff, but at venues in Swansea, Merthyr Tydfil, Penarth, Wrexham, Ruthin, and Carmarthen. Under the umbrella of its title What You See is What You Get?, the festival gives a knowing nod to the position of many women and non-binary photographers, who make up the majority of exhibitors this year. In the deconsecrated chapel of the pretty, verdant cemetery in Penarth is a new commission, Out of Sight and Out of Mind, by Welsh artist <a href=\"https://www.jessieedwardsthomas.co.uk/\">Jessie Edwards-Thomas</a>. She creates an eerie, unsettling space to explore the precarity of parenting in a capitalist society, using photography in different ways. There\u2019s an installation of archival photographs, texts and anatomical illustrations of the womb and foetus that recalls <a href=\"https://www.carmenwinant.com/\">Carmen Winant</a>\u2019s work; a creepy self-portrait printed on a sheath of fabric and billowing gently like a church banner; and a series of unsettling photomontages that dump battered-looking, nightmarish dolls into found images of female factory workers.</p>    <p>Another unexpected account of motherhood can be found in the back of a bar in Swansea, where there is a show of three South American artists who belong to the <a href=\"https://foto-feminas.com/\">Foto F\u00e9minas</a> network.

A small selection here of cryptic and conceptual studies of S\u00e3o Paulo punctuate the space with a meditative thrum \u2013 Marchetti also collaborated with musician <a href=\"https://slepoyfrancisco.bandcamp.com/album/retratos\">Francisco Slepoy</a> to create a sound piece based on her recordings of the city. They lose something by being printed on gloss paper, rather than the industrial paper the artist intended.</p> <p>The highlights of Swansea are <a href=\"https://luizakons.46graus.com/\">Luiza Kons</a>\u2019 gripping vignettes. Her staged scenes of her parents, sister and herself in the rural landscapes of southern Brazil, near her grandmother\u2019s farm, fuse her father\u2019s childhood memories \u2013 such as the day they returned home to find their house on fire \u2013 with Kons\u2019 own visions and experiences with ASD. It\u2019s hardly a fond family album \u2013 the scenes are more like Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. Kons is a thrilling storyteller \u2013 and it\u2019s fortunate her family are willing and able actors.</p>    <p>Back in Cardiff at the National Museum, <a href=\"https://www.hollydavey.com/\">Holly Davey</a>\u2019s In Plain Sight (Miss Jenkins? After Richard Wilson), a new commission for the festival, works by stealth not shock. Taking the place (and the gilded frame) of Richard Wilson\u2019s 1760-65 painting <a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/dolbadarn-castle-160422\">Dolbadarn Castle</a>, alongside other 18th-century masters, Davey\u2019s work reveals the hidden history of the original painting. Thanks to advances in conservation technology, Davey found 20 X-rays of the painting in the collection archive, which show a portrait of a woman underneath Wilson\u2019s landscape work, hidden for two centuries. Correspondence suggests the figure is Miss Jenkins, and that the portrait was never paid for and was eventually turned on its side and painted over to create Dolbadarn Castle \u2013 using the lines of Miss Jenkins\u2019 body. Davey digitised the X-rays and created a lightbox work that brings history and painting into dialogue with the exposing light of photographic imagery, a perfect metaphor for the collision between the heavy hand of history that has attempted to paint certain bodies out of the picture, and the resilience of those disempowered bodies in spite of it. As you continue around the collection, you wonder what else might lie beneath.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tricky job to get a photo festival right. Run on shoestring budgets by small teams, they stick their neck out to sustain artists and reach audiences where big institutions and commercial galleries fail. But Ffoto Cymru 24 does it, and is dead on target.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ffotogallery.org/whats-on-listings/ffotocymru24\">Ffoto Cymru 24 is at various venues in Wales until 31 October</a></p></li> </ul>",

So it is a very difficult time for all people who have relations abroad in the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come across schools dealing with things well \u2013 they\u2019re not ignoring the situation and are acknowledging children\u2019s anxieties through tutor time, or there have been assemblies. I\u2019ve certainly met teachers who perhaps feel a bit more nervous about talking about the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Kebede said teachers were well aware of the requirement for them to be politically neutral. \u201cBut it is valid and sensible to talk about the conflict and it obviously does relate to many parts of the curriculum.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, the number one driver preventing schools from being able to allow space for children to discuss the difficult topics in the world around them is that they have so much to do in the curriculum elsewhere to meet performance targets.\u201d</p> <p>The government recently launched a curriculum and assessment review led by the education expert Prof Becky Francis that is due to publish recommendations next year.</p> <p>Kebede said: \u201cI think we should embed philosophy for children across the curriculum and reduce curriculum content. I used to teach philosophy for children. It\u2019s a dialogic approach that allows children to form their own opinions and come to a clearer understanding themselves of the world around then. But it\u2019s not always easy to find the time to do that in today\u2019s education system.\u201d</p> <p>The Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors incidents of antisemitism, and Tell Mama, which tracks complaints of anti-Muslim hate, have reported an increase in incidents in schools.</p> <p>The CST said that in the 12 months since 7 October 2023 there had been 141 antisemitic incidents affecting Jewish schoolchildren on their journeys to and from school, 102 targeting Jewish schools and 180 affecting Jewish children and staff at non-Jewish schools. On Monday, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, confirmed \u00a37m of funding to fight antisemitism in education.</p> <p>Over a similar period, Tell Mama recorded 141 hate incidents in schools linked to the war in the Middle East, with students from Middle Eastern and/or Muslim backgrounds being called \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cHezbollah\u201d.</p> <p>Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, said: \u201cSchools need to facilitate dialogue that encourages those of many identities to talk about who they are, what they believe and what commonalities we all share and build towards collective understanding and empathy.\u201d</p> <p>Glenn Bezalel, a deputy head at the City of London school and author of a book called Teaching Classroom Controversies, said many schools were avoiding teaching or talking about the conflict altogether. \u201cSchools are afraid of getting it wrong and potentially ending up in the eye of a media storm,\u201d said Bezalel, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s too complex to understand for many teachers who don\u2019t have sufficient training. Pupils with direct links to the conflict have said how school is and should be a safe haven where they can enjoy time with their friends and focus on their studies \u2013 the last thing they want is an emotionally driven discussion that could get out of hand so easily.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping children safe is our overriding responsibility. It is too raw and emotionally fraught right now to expect pupils to have a cerebral and disinterested debate when they may well have family members who have fallen victim to the conflict.\u201d</p> <p>Other schools are being supported by expert organisations, including the education charity Solutions Not Sides (SNS), which aims to create safe spaces for respectful disagreement, critical thinking and empathy. Over the past school year, 11,000 students in the UK completed SNS\u2019s youth education programme while a further 2,000 teachers and community leaders were trained in navigating \u201cIsrael-Palestine polarisation and hatred\u201d.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s director and founder, Sharon Booth, writing on the SNS website, said: \u201cThe pain of this year for our communities has been devastating. The progress we make from here will be paramount. It\u2019s time to de-escalate, educate, and give the next generation the chance to define a future of peace, justice, equality, and a rejection of hate.\u201d</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said schools should promote respect and tolerance between people of different beliefs in a safe and controlled environment. \u201cWe know navigating these issues can be challenging, which is why we provide extensive advice and resources such as approved lesson plans through our Educate Against Hate service,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cTeachers and leaders will be doing all they can to provide appropriate support in places where this is required.\u201d</p>",

Concern is also growing about the number of pupils and teachers in England with family members who are directly affected. \u201cI know lots of students hear about and feel worried about the news of the escalation,\u201d Kebede told the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing it, they\u2019re hearing it on the news, and they\u2019re hearing other adults discuss what\u2019s happening. \u201cI know teachers who have family who were affected by 7 October and what happened in Israel and I know of teachers who have students who are in other surrounding Middle East countries affected at the moment. So it is a very difficult time for all people who have relations abroad in the Middle East. \u201cI\u2019ve come across schools dealing with things well \u2013 they\u2019re not ignoring the situation and are acknowledging children\u2019s anxieties through tutor time, or there have been assemblies. I\u2019ve certainly met teachers who perhaps feel a bit more nervous about talking about the conflict.\u201d Kebede said teachers were well aware of the requirement for them to be politically neutral. \u201cBut it is valid and sensible to talk about the conflict and it obviously does relate to many parts of the curriculum.\u201d He added: \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, the number one driver preventing schools from being able to allow space for children to discuss the difficult topics in the world around them is that they have so much to do in the curriculum elsewhere to meet performance targets.\u201d The government recently launched a curriculum and assessment review led by the education expert Prof Becky Francis that is due to publish recommendations next year. Kebede said: \u201cI think we should embed philosophy for children across the curriculum and reduce curriculum content. I used to teach philosophy for children. It\u2019s a dialogic approach that allows children to form their own opinions and come to a clearer understanding themselves of the world around then. But it\u2019s not always easy to find the time to do that in today\u2019s education system.\u201d The Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors incidents of antisemitism, and Tell Mama, which tracks complaints of anti-Muslim hate, have reported an increase in incidents in schools. The CST said that in the 12 months since 7 October 2023 there had been 141 antisemitic incidents affecting Jewish schoolchildren on their journeys to and from school, 102 targeting Jewish schools and 180 affecting Jewish children and staff at non-Jewish schools. On Monday, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, confirmed \u00a37m of funding to fight antisemitism in education. Over a similar period, Tell Mama recorded 141 hate incidents in schools linked to the war in the Middle East, with students from Middle Eastern and/or Muslim backgrounds being called \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cHezbollah\u201d. Iman Atta, the director of Tell Mama, said: \u201cSchools need to facilitate dialogue that encourages those of many identities to talk about who they are, what they believe and what commonalities we all share and build towards collective understanding and empathy.\u201d Glenn Bezalel, a deputy head at the City of London school and author of a book called Teaching Classroom Controversies, said many schools were avoiding teaching or talking about the conflict altogether. \u201cSchools are afraid of getting it wrong and potentially ending up in the eye of a media storm,\u201d said Bezalel, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s too complex to understand for many teachers who don\u2019t have sufficient training. Pupils with direct links to the conflict have said how school is and should be a safe haven where they can enjoy time with their friends and focus on their studies \u2013 the last thing they want is an emotionally driven discussion that could get out of hand so easily. \u201cKeeping children safe is our overriding responsibility. It is too raw and emotionally fraught right now to expect pupils to have a cerebral and disinterested debate when they may well have family members who have fallen victim to the conflict.\u201d Other schools are being supported by expert organisations, including the education charity Solutions Not Sides (SNS), which aims to create safe spaces for respectful disagreement, critical thinking and empathy. Over the past school year, 11,000 students in the UK completed SNS\u2019s youth education programme while a further 2,000 teachers and community leaders were trained in navigating \u201cIsrael-Palestine polarisation and hatred\u201d. The charity\u2019s director and founder, Sharon Booth, writing on the SNS website, said: \u201cThe pain of this year for our communities has been devastating. The progress we make from here will be paramount. It\u2019s time to de-escalate, educate, and give the next generation the chance to define a future of peace, justice, equality, and a rejection of hate.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said schools should promote respect and tolerance between people of different beliefs in a safe and controlled environment. \u201cWe know navigating these issues can be challenging, which is why we provide extensive advice and resources such as approved lesson plans through our Educate Against Hate service,\u201d they said. Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cTeachers and leaders will be doing all they can to provide appropriate support in places where this is required.\u201d",

So you start writing in a panic, only to remember that a few keys on the laptop don\u2019t walk. Dammit, I meant work. Still, I\u2019m sure everything will be OK in the end.

I\u2019m in New York and the phone rings at 5.30am. And I don\u2019t mind telling you that I\u2019m not at my best that early in the morning.

I then threw every intelligent MP out of the party and promoted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the idiot\u2019s idiot.

Just the same old stories and excuses wheeled out yet again in leaden prose.\u201d</em></p> <p>Where was I? Ah yes, Europe. I had always been a Eurosceptic. Apart from the times I wasn\u2019t, when I was London mayor. Back in the day \u2013 after a stint on the Times, from which I had been sacked for lying \u2013 I got a job on the Telegraph, where I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/07/toxic-spell-broken-boris-johnson-trips-over-own-lies\">just made stories up</a>. So much easier than telling the truth. Over in Brussels, I came to realise the EU was a Freudian wish-fulfilment dream. If only I had the same insight into my own narcissism. But I\u2019ve never been curious about my behaviour; the way I invariably let down all those close to me.</p> <p>February 2016. I was choked. Blocked. Stuck. Unsure of which way to jump in the referendum. Some have said that I chose to back leave only because that was the best career move. But I can categorically say this is untrue. Never in my life have I taken the selfish path. My life has been one long pilgrimage of self-restraint and uxorious self-denial. The queen once told me that I was a role model for the country.</p> <p>What convinced me that Britain would be best out of the EU was the economics. Who in their right mind would not want the UK to take a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/28/brexit-worse-for-the-uk-economy-than-covid-pandemic-obr-says\">4% hit in GDP</a>? \u201c<em>Alea iacta est</em>,\u201d<em> </em>as Caesar said. There was no going back, even when that girly swot David Cameron had threatened to fuck me up. I have never forgiven Dave for becoming prime minister before me.</p> <p>Some have observed that I appeared shocked when the country voted for the Bozztastic Brexit. All I can say is: you try giving a press conference when you\u2019ve been drinking the night before and Michael Gove is off his face on ketamine and magic mushrooms. And why would anyone expect us to have a plan to implement Brexit? That had been Dave\u2019s job and he had just flounced out. So now I was being asked to take responsibility for my own actions. How unfair was that?</p> <p>\u201c<em>This is getting even worse than I imagined,\u2019 groaned Dilyn. \u2018God knows what the editor will make of this.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u201cThere is no editor,\u201d said the editor. \u201cOtherwise there would be almost nothing left.\u201d</em></p>    <p>So why, you might ask, did I not still run to be prime minister after the Gover had treached on me? After all, I would still have been the frontrunner. The simple answer is that I have never asked myself that question. Although I am certain I didn\u2019t bottle it. That wouldn\u2019t be like me at all.</p> <p>It was no more than I deserved when Theresa May invited me to be foreign secretary. \u201cRest assured,\u201d I told her. \u201cGlobal Britain will be safe with me. I\u2019m the man to keep Johnny Foreigner in his place. Just wait till you see the watermelon smiles on those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/23/london.race\">flag-waving piccaninnies</a>. Not to mention the women dressed up as letterboxes. As for Russia and China, I will be taking no prisoners.\u201d</p> <p>Talking of prisoners, let me just put the record straight on Nanzanin Zagjhari-Raticliffe. No one had done more than me to get her sentence increased. Who wouldn\u2019t want to spend a few more years in an Iranian jail? The queen later told me I was the best foreign secretary of her illustrious reign. Sadly, I had to cut my tenure short. Having praised Theresa\u2019s Chequers deal to the heights, I found myself having to resign two days later when I realised that David Davis had walked first.</p> <p>We now find ourselves in December 2019. All was going smoothly, plans were well advanced to build a bridge to the US and the whole country was celebrating my great election victory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was magnificent during Covid. Never before in this country\u2019s history has so much been owed by so many to me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, in January, came the coronavirus. Let me get one thing straight. My problem was not that I knew too little about zoonotic diseases, but that I knew too much. So I knew Covid was not going to be a major problem. Who cared if 2% of the population carked it? And yes, I had witnessed the scenes from Italy, but those Mediterranean types are always overexcitable. I couldn\u2019t see the point of attending five Cobra meetings when I had to help Carrie with her arrangements for the baby shower at Chequers.</p> <p>To cut a long story short, I was magnificent during Covid. Even down to being the first super-spreader, when I shook hands with a whole lot of infected people. No one could have done more than me, carrying on giving the country the leadership it needed even when I was in hospital. I was determined the Moloch would be contained.</p> <p>Never before in this country\u2019s history has so much been owed by so many to me, as Cicero once said. Time and again, I came to this country\u2019s rescue. By awarding PPE contracts to Michelle Mone. By personally developing a vaccine. If we had remained in the EU, no one in the UK would have got a vaccination and the whole country would have died.</p> <p>There were no lengths to which I would not go to keep my people safe. I even asked Bear Grylls, Russell Brand and Ant Middleton to launch an attack on the Netherlands to steal a large supply of the vaccine that they didn\u2019t have because they were in the EU. Slip unnoticed into Rotterdam harbour and then explode a nuclear device. The queen positively purred when I explained the plan to her. What could possibly go wrong with attacking a Nato ally, she said. Quite right, I said. The Dutch are practically Germans, so are not to be trusted.</p> <p>I seem to have forgotten some other bits. Like how I keep being let down by people I have appointed while never once doubting my judgment. Take Dominic Cummings. When he explained how he had immediately gathered together his family after testing positive for Covid so that they could drive 250 miles to Durham, then took his family out for another drive to test his eyesight, it all made complete sense.</p> <p>Amid all this, there were a few personal high points. Like my wedding to Carrie. The happiest day of my life. Largely because someone else was paying. Every prime minister needs a sucker like the Bamfords who will fork out cash on demand. I liked to call them my personal ATM.</p> <p>Now to the parties. The parties that absolutely did not happen.</p> <p><em>\u201cYou mean the Abba party,\u201d growled Dilyn. \u201cThe one on the night you fired Dom. I didn\u2019t get a wink.\u201d</em></p> <p><em>\u201cShut up,\u201d I said. \u201cOr you\u2019ll be back to the </em><em>dog </em><em>rescue.\u201d</em></p> <p>As I was saying, none of the parties ever took place. All the rules were obeyed at all times, because that\u2019s the kind of guy I am. <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2024-10-04/boris-johnson-tells-itv-news-he-regrets-apologising-for-partygate\">My only regret is apologising</a> in the first place. I should have just kept on lying about them and trying to brazen it out. But that\u2019s me all over.

Back in the day \u2013 after a stint on the Times, from which I had been sacked for lying \u2013 I got a job on the Telegraph, where I just made stories up. So much easier than telling the truth. Over in Brussels, I came to realise the EU was a Freudian wish-fulfilment dream. If only I had the same insight into my own narcissism. But I\u2019ve never been curious about my behaviour; the way I invariably let down all those close to me. February 2016. I was choked. Blocked. Stuck. Unsure of which way to jump in the referendum. Some have said that I chose to back leave only because that was the best career move. But I can categorically say this is untrue. Never in my life have I taken the selfish path. My life has been one long pilgrimage of self-restraint and uxorious self-denial. The queen once told me that I was a role model for the country. What convinced me that Britain would be best out of the EU was the economics. Who in their right mind would not want the UK to take a 4% hit in GDP? \u201cAlea iacta est,\u201d as Caesar said. There was no going back, even when that girly swot David Cameron had threatened to fuck me up. I have never forgiven Dave for becoming prime minister before me. Some have observed that I appeared shocked when the country voted for the Bozztastic Brexit. All I can say is: you try giving a press conference when you\u2019ve been drinking the night before and Michael Gove is off his face on ketamine and magic mushrooms. And why would anyone expect us to have a plan to implement Brexit? That had been Dave\u2019s job and he had just flounced out. So now I was being asked to take responsibility for my own actions. How unfair was that? \u201cThis is getting even worse than I imagined,\u2019 groaned Dilyn. \u2018God knows what the editor will make of this.\u201d \u201cThere is no editor,\u201d said the editor. \u201cOtherwise there would be almost nothing left.\u201d So why, you might ask, did I not still run to be prime minister after the Gover had treached on me? After all, I would still have been the frontrunner. The simple answer is that I have never asked myself that question. Although I am certain I didn\u2019t bottle it. That wouldn\u2019t be like me at all. It was no more than I deserved when Theresa May invited me to be foreign secretary. \u201cRest assured,\u201d I told her. \u201cGlobal Britain will be safe with me. I\u2019m the man to keep Johnny Foreigner in his place. Just wait till you see the watermelon smiles on those flag-waving piccaninnies. Not to mention the women dressed up as letterboxes. As for Russia and China, I will be taking no prisoners.\u201d Talking of prisoners, let me just put the record straight on Nanzanin Zagjhari-Raticliffe. No one had done more than me to get her sentence increased. Who wouldn\u2019t want to spend a few more years in an Iranian jail? The queen later told me I was the best foreign secretary of her illustrious reign. Sadly, I had to cut my tenure short. Having praised Theresa\u2019s Chequers deal to the heights, I found myself having to resign two days later when I realised that David Davis had walked first. We now find ourselves in December 2019. All was going smoothly, plans were well advanced to build a bridge to the US and the whole country was celebrating my great election victory. Then, in January, came the coronavirus. Let me get one thing straight. My problem was not that I knew too little about zoonotic diseases, but that I knew too much. So I knew Covid was not going to be a major problem. Who cared if 2% of the population carked it? And yes, I had witnessed the scenes from Italy, but those Mediterranean types are always overexcitable. I couldn\u2019t see the point of attending five Cobra meetings when I had to help Carrie with her arrangements for the baby shower at Chequers. To cut a long story short, I was magnificent during Covid. Even down to being the first super-spreader, when I shook hands with a whole lot of infected people. No one could have done more than me, carrying on giving the country the leadership it needed even when I was in hospital. I was determined the Moloch would be contained. Never before in this country\u2019s history has so much been owed by so many to me, as Cicero once said. Time and again, I came to this country\u2019s rescue. By awarding PPE contracts to Michelle Mone. By personally developing a vaccine. If we had remained in the EU, no one in the UK would have got a vaccination and the whole country would have died. There were no lengths to which I would not go to keep my people safe. I even asked Bear Grylls, Russell Brand and Ant Middleton to launch an attack on the Netherlands to steal a large supply of the vaccine that they didn\u2019t have because they were in the EU. Slip unnoticed into Rotterdam harbour and then explode a nuclear device. The queen positively purred when I explained the plan to her. What could possibly go wrong with attacking a Nato ally, she said. Quite right, I said. The Dutch are practically Germans, so are not to be trusted. I seem to have forgotten some other bits. Like how I keep being let down by people I have appointed while never once doubting my judgment. Take Dominic Cummings. When he explained how he had immediately gathered together his family after testing positive for Covid so that they could drive 250 miles to Durham, then took his family out for another drive to test his eyesight, it all made complete sense. Amid all this, there were a few personal high points. Like my wedding to Carrie. The happiest day of my life. Largely because someone else was paying. Every prime minister needs a sucker like the Bamfords who will fork out cash on demand. I liked to call them my personal ATM. Now to the parties. The parties that absolutely did not happen. \u201cYou mean the Abba party,\u201d growled Dilyn. \u201cThe one on the night you fired Dom. I didn\u2019t get a wink.\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d I said. \u201cOr you\u2019ll be back to the dog rescue.\u201d As I was saying, none of the parties ever took place. All the rules were obeyed at all times, because that\u2019s the kind of guy I am. My only regret is apologising in the first place. I should have just kept on lying about them and trying to brazen it out. But that\u2019s me all over. If I have a fault, it\u2019s that I\u2019m too honest. Anyway, you know how it is. One thing led to another: the parties, the Owen Paterson and Chris Pincher scandals. Soon, 60 ministers were resigning in protest. Caesar had fewer wounds than me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Charlotte Owen, an office junior in No 10. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will come through this crisis.\u201d Give that woman a peerage. I did try writing to all the Tory MPs \u2013 \u201cDear Grunts\u201d \u2013 whom I had never bothered to speak to in the previous three years, but they too were ungrateful for all I had done. So that was it. I was out of office. Them\u2019s the breaks. Still, at least I could now cash in on the speaker circuit and write a deeply reflective memoir. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting,\u201d said the publisher. On which note, I leave you with the queen\u2019s parting words to me. \u201cMy first prime minister was Winston Churchill. My last were you and Liz Truss. Just imagine. I think I might as well die now.\u201d Digested read, digested: Unreliable. Unhinged. Unreadable. Taking the Lead by John Crace is published by Little, Brown (\u00a318.99).

      "body": "<p>Hannah Winter threw a perfect spiral pass for a 30-yard touchdown for Great Britain under-15s against France at an empty Tottenham Hotspur stadium on Monday. In 2028 the west London schoolgirl could be doing the same in a packed arena beneath the lights at the Los Angeles Olympics.</p> <p>The rise to Olympic status of flag football, a non-contact version of the US gridiron game, has sparked a hunt for talent in schools and parks. The game\u2019s roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/aug/18/flag-football-rapidly-catching-on-uk\">80,000 British participants</a> suddenly have a plausible shot at Olympic glory.</p> <p>And if that was not enough to boost participation, Taylor Swift\u2019s frequent appearances at NFL games enthusiastically supporting her boyfriend, the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 tight end Travis Kelce, is providing rocket fuel.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a new sport there\u2019s so much room to become an Olympian,\u201d said Toshane Boyce, participation coordinator for NFL UK, which organised Monday\u2019s tournament that also involved girls\u2019 teams from Spain, Austria and Germany.</p> <p>\u201cNow Taylor Swift\u2019s involvement ramps it up even more. Girls are talking about it and want to get involved. The Taylor effect is helping us massively.\u201d</p>    <p>As well as Swifties giving the game a try, the allure of Los Angeles 2028 has also led to basketball players, track and field athletes and touch rugby players switching codes. It has echoes of the hunt for potential Team GB handball players before the London 2012 games.</p> <p>The NFL has been investing heavily in promoting the game in the UK, handing out balls and flag belts. Players are \u201ctackled\u201d by ripping a flag from a waist belt, an appealing alternative to the full contact version of the game that has many parents worrying about concussions.</p> <p>Instead of 11 padded-up players on the pitch for each side, five to seven take to the field in just shorts, T-shirts and trainers. The principles of the game are the same: the offence trying to advance the ball through a series of pre-planned plays while the defence tries to stop them.</p> <p>A sharp rise in the number of schools involved means participation numbers are expected to hit 100,000 by 2026. More than half are girls.

      "bodyText": "Hannah Winter threw a perfect spiral pass for a 30-yard touchdown for Great Britain under-15s against France at an empty Tottenham Hotspur stadium on Monday. In 2028 the west London schoolgirl could be doing the same in a packed arena beneath the lights at the Los Angeles Olympics. The rise to Olympic status of flag football, a non-contact version of the US gridiron game, has sparked a hunt for talent in schools and parks. The game\u2019s roughly 80,000 British participants suddenly have a plausible shot at Olympic glory. And if that was not enough to boost participation, Taylor Swift\u2019s frequent appearances at NFL games enthusiastically supporting her boyfriend, the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 tight end Travis Kelce, is providing rocket fuel. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a new sport there\u2019s so much room to become an Olympian,\u201d said Toshane Boyce, participation coordinator for NFL UK, which organised Monday\u2019s tournament that also involved girls\u2019 teams from Spain, Austria and Germany. \u201cNow Taylor Swift\u2019s involvement ramps it up even more. Girls are talking about it and want to get involved. The Taylor effect is helping us massively.\u201d As well as Swifties giving the game a try, the allure of Los Angeles 2028 has also led to basketball players, track and field athletes and touch rugby players switching codes. It has echoes of the hunt for potential Team GB handball players before the London 2012 games. The NFL has been investing heavily in promoting the game in the UK, handing out balls and flag belts. Players are \u201ctackled\u201d by ripping a flag from a waist belt, an appealing alternative to the full contact version of the game that has many parents worrying about concussions. Instead of 11 padded-up players on the pitch for each side, five to seven take to the field in just shorts, T-shirts and trainers. The principles of the game are the same: the offence trying to advance the ball through a series of pre-planned plays while the defence tries to stop them. A sharp rise in the number of schools involved means participation numbers are expected to hit 100,000 by 2026. More than half are girls. After the sport\u2019s inclusion in the LA 2028 games, Sport England, the government funding body, made a \u00a3250,000 grant to the British American Football Association. While the USA team is predictably favourite for gold, in August, the current Great Britain\u2019s women\u2019s team came seventh at the Flag Football World Championships in Finland. \u201cI have been dreaming about this ever since Los Angeles was selected,\u201d said Kate Bruinvels, one of the senior team players who started playing at university in Chichester a decade ago. \u201cI have been training every day for years and to have it finally accepted is unbelievable. Whether its the current squad or these girls out here, it\u2019s going to be huge.\u201d Valeria Barrocar La Femina, 14, is one of the current players representing Great Britain at U14 level. She isn\u2019t ruling out a run at the games squad, but for now, loves the adrenaline of the play and the sense of team togetherness.

He also said he had raised about $75m for the campaign in total.</p> <p>Furthermore, Lutnick appeared on Trump\u2019s The Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 and had previously donated to Democrats.</p> <p>His firm, Cantor FitzGerald, lost 658 employees in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, including his brother.

      "bodyText": "A senior official on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has said any appointees in a second Trump administration would need to prove \u201cfidelity and loyalty\u201d. The official also sought to distance the former president from Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation plan calling for a far-right federal government in the event of a Trump victory at the voting polls in November. Howard Lutnick, the chief executive officer of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald and co-chairperson of the former president\u2019s transition team, told the Financial Times that appointees to any second Trump administration are \u201call going to be on the same side, and they\u2019re all going to understand the policies, and we\u2019re going to give people the role based on their capacity \u2013 and their fidelity and loyalty to the policy, as well as to\u201d Trump. The comments come as the Trump team are trying to dispel concerns that a second Trump government would be as chaotic as the first, marked in part by infighting and a staff turnover calculated at 92% as of the day Joe Biden took office as president in 2021. \u201cThose people were not pure to his vision,\u201d Lutnick told the outlet. It is unlikely Lutnick\u2019s comments will calm concerns among those who believe government officials should place American democracy above Trump or any other president. Lutnick joined Trump\u2019s transition team in August along with Linda McMahon, the head of the Small Business Association under the former president and wife of the ex-World Wrestling Entertainment boss Vince McMahon in August. He maintained that Project 2025 was \u201cradioactive\u201d, though its authors openly support Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. \u201cProject 2025 is an absolute zero for the Trump-Vance transition,\u201d the billionaire said. \u201cYou can use another term \u2013 radioactive.\u201d Democrats have made the controversial document part of their campaign, describing it as a blueprint for a fast-tracked program to increase presidential power and \u201cstrip away our freedoms \u2013 by forcing states to report on women\u2019s miscarriages and abortions, cutting Social Security and Medicare, and eliminating the Department of Education\u201d. While Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, Democrats\u2019 campaigns for congressional seats have launched billboards in more than two dozen districts harnessing the document to the Republican agenda. \u201cAll of the data we have shows that Project 2025 just has huge interest and traction, more so than virtually every other issue,\u201d Represenative Jared Huffman of California, the leader of a task force on countering the project\u2019s agenda, told Axios. The Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from the document and its authors. But lines to the heart of the campaign are clear enough, among them Vance\u2019s foreword to Dawn\u2019s Early Light, a book by the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts. Lutnick told the FT that his job selecting candidates to become Trump appointees was that of \u201ca painter of a mosaic\u201d \u2013 and they would need to prepare for a \u201cfast and furious\u201d term if the former president was re-elected. Lutnick said he had given more than $10m to Trump\u2019s 2024 effort and another $500,000 for the transition. He also said he had raised about $75m for the campaign in total. Furthermore, Lutnick appeared on Trump\u2019s The Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 and had previously donated to Democrats. His firm, Cantor FitzGerald, lost 658 employees in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, including his brother. Lutnick said his experience hiring new employees was akin to his work for the Trump transition team. \u201cYou go to world-class people that you rate highly, and you ask them to help you,\u201d he said.",

British-born Efune regularly posts hardline views about the situation in the Middle East, sparking alarm among staff as it looks increasingly likely that he will become their new proprietor, having tabled a \u00a3550m bid. The move to exclusivity with Efune, a former editor of Jewish publication the Algemeiner Journal, who acquired the digital assets of former print newspaper the New York Sun three years ago, is expected this week. However, two sources that while Efune had tabled the highest bid, David Montgomery\u2019s National World, which has held presentations with Telegraph management, had not officially been ruled out. One source said that National World had \u201cbeen told\u201d that Efune was set to seal the deal. \u201cThere\u2019s real concern in the ranks over what Efune will do to our editorial stance on the Middle East,\u201d said one newsroom source. \u201cWe\u2019re already pro-Israel but people are worried he\u2019s going to turn the Telegraph into his own personal propaganda sheet.\u201d In a series of posts last week on X, he said Israel would \u201cdecapitate\u201d Iran\u2019s leadership with \u201ctargeted strikes and close quarter assassinations \u2026 I\u2019d expect the Ayatollah himself would be in the cross-hairs\u201d.

The 22,300 attendance, a slight drop on 2023 which was probably because a drizzly start to the day deterred walk-ups, could be seen as either 49% up on 2021, or 59% down on 2015.</p> \n<p>But the bare numbers are less important than the atmosphere and experience, and the good news for Longchamp and its biggest day is that the lack of an outstanding champion or two in the main event did not seem to be on anyone\u2019s mind. The enclosures were buzzy and busy but you could still move around. Queueing time for a baguette was about five minutes, and for a pint of beer, not even that.</p> \n<p>When set against the sheer scale, intensity and scrum of an event like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenhamfestival\">Cheltenham Festival</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/grandnational\">Grand National</a> at Aintree, Longchamp on Sunday felt \u2026 well, civilised.

Of course it would have been a better, more illuminating championship race if some of the best middle-distance horses of the season had been able to take part. Goliath dispatched Bluestocking by an easy two-and-a-quarter lengths in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/27/goliath-slays-rivals-to-pull-off-shock-25-1-king-george-queen-elizabeth-stakes-victory-horse-racing-tips\">King George at Ascot in July</a> and would have been a strong favourite to do so again on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Whether it would have added even a few hundred extra racegoers to the gate, however, is another question. The Arc is a race that has had an almost mystical significance for generations of racing fans, in Britain and Ireland in particular, and it is about much more than the horses that go to post for any particular renewal, or even backing the winner. For its keenest fans, it is all about being there, and after a rocky few years, it is an experience that again deserves to be on every racegoer\u2019s bucket list.</p>",

A walk around the track on Sunday, though, suggested that whether it is by luck, judgment or a combination of the two, the Arc has finally moved on. The 22,300 attendance, a slight drop on 2023 which was probably because a drizzly start to the day deterred walk-ups, could be seen as either 49% up on 2021, or 59% down on 2015. But the bare numbers are less important than the atmosphere and experience, and the good news for Longchamp and its biggest day is that the lack of an outstanding champion or two in the main event did not seem to be on anyone\u2019s mind. The enclosures were buzzy and busy but you could still move around. Queueing time for a baguette was about five minutes, and for a pint of beer, not even that. When set against the sheer scale, intensity and scrum of an event like the Cheltenham Festival or the Grand National at Aintree, Longchamp on Sunday felt \u2026 well, civilised. The course has learned the lessons of 2018 in terms of keeping its customers fed and watered, and the weekend\u2019s fans are beginning to trickle back. And it is the day and the location that matters, as much as the big race itself. Of course it would have been a better, more illuminating championship race if some of the best middle-distance horses of the season had been able to take part. Goliath dispatched Bluestocking by an easy two-and-a-quarter lengths in the King George at Ascot in July and would have been a strong favourite to do so again on Sunday. Whether it would have added even a few hundred extra racegoers to the gate, however, is another question. The Arc is a race that has had an almost mystical significance for generations of racing fans, in Britain and Ireland in particular, and it is about much more than the horses that go to post for any particular renewal, or even backing the winner. For its keenest fans, it is all about being there, and after a rocky few years, it is an experience that again deserves to be on every racegoer\u2019s bucket list.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember a game like it,\u201d Paulo Gazzaniga said. And nor does anyone else. Nobody had done done what he had just done: not his brother Gianfranco, not his dad Daniel, goalkeepers like him, not anyone, not here.</p> \n<p>\u201cIncredible,\u201d Michel S\u00e1nchez called it; Ernesto Valverde went for \u201cfarcical\u201d. When Girona and Athletic\u2019s coaches embraced at the end of a sunny Sunday afternoon, the last of 27 shots having finally settled a chaotic game in Catalonia, a 99th-minute winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/dec/04/ageless-goal-king-cristhian-stuani-cements-status-as-prince-of-girona-la-liga\">from the best striker Montilivi has seen</a> still overshadowed by three that <em>didn\u2019t</em> go in, Valverde wore a shrug and a smile that said <em>silly, innit</em>. Which is was. It was also brilliant. And bad. And <em>fun</em>, which football\u2019s meant to be.</p> \n<p>Historic, too. \u201cThis can\u2019t happen in <em>primera</em>,\u201d I\u00f1aki Williams said but it had, and for the first time ever. There were 13,396 people to witness it, a story they\u2019ll tell until the end of time, still laughing when they do just like they were still laughing when they left Montilivi. Three times Carlos del Cerro Grande called from the VAR room 712km away, three times Athletic went to the spot, three different men taking three different penalties. Paulo Gazzaniga saved them all. The goalkeeper whose first professional appearance was for Gillingham in front of 2,466 people at Underhill became the only man in La Liga history to stop three penalties in one day \u2013 or 29 minutes and 30 seconds, to be precise.</p> \n<p>\u201cAthletic shot themselves in the foot,\u201d one headline said but if they had tried, he would have saved that too. It\u2019s only his team\u2019s shots he doesn\u2019t stop. Although he saved a penalty against Feyenoord in midweek, three of the four Gazzaniga has conceded in the Champions League have been own goals. Then, where Alex Berenguer, Williams and Ander Herrera failed, Cristhian Stuani didn\u2019t and, instead of another Athletic victory, a fourth in five taking them into third, Girona won 2-1, their first in five. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win because of something unusual,\u201d Herrera insisted, entirely incorrectly. \u201cThank God \u2026\u201d Michel said afterwards, pausing to correct himself. \u201cWell, thank Gazzaniga.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe needed this,\u201d the man himself said, and maybe he had too. Girona had not won in six, losing twice in four league games and beaten in both of their Champions League matches, that feeling of Season After Syndrome hard to escape. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/sep/28/girona-la-liga-top-first-time-history-spain\">Last year\u2019s great revelation</a>, they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/12/girona-encounter-real-life-as-vinicius-junior-states-madrids-supremacy\">competed for the title</a> more than anyone else had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/dec/11/girona-shocking-assault-on-power-at-barcelona-la-liga-best\">and eventually reached Europe</a> for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/06/girona-barcelona-champions-league-la-liga-portu-michel\">qualifying for the Champions League</a>. Then what had happened was what tends to happen to great revelations. Aleix Garc\u00eda, their best midfielder and arguably Spain\u2019s too, left for Leverkusen. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/27/girona-artem-dovbyk-pichichi-la-liga\">Artem Dovbyk, La Liga\u2019s top scorer</a>, went to Rome. And Savinho, whose appearance was what made coach Michel think it was all possible in the first place, was a \u20ac40m signing for Manchester City, whose ownership group already owned him.</p> \n<p>If there was an inevitability about that, there was a weird inevitability about all this too, a sense that if it wasn\u2019t for bad luck they wouldn\u2019t have no luck at all. They had played reasonably well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/13/girona-and-their-boy-from-the-barrio-hit-new-heights-on-top-of-la-liga\">a team with 11 new players being rebuilt by a coach in whom they trust</a>, but competing in Europe and La Liga felt like a step too far and it just wasn\u2019t happening, fortune deserting them. They had lost in the last minute at the Parc des Princes. Against Feyenoord, they had scored two own goals, gifted another, had one of their own ruled out, missed a penalty and seen Viktor Tsygankov taken off, joining Oriol Romeu and Daley Blind on the injury list. At Valencia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/23/ruben-barajas-valencia-finally-find-their-league-to-briefly-liberate-mestalla\">where they had been beaten 2-0</a>, both goals had been long shots that went in off Juanpe. In short, five of the last seven they had conceded had been own goals.</p> \n<p>None were more painful than the one Gazzaniga scored. A symbol of what Girona have done over the last few years, signed from Fulham in the Championship where he had become third-choice goalkeeper, the kid who left Murphy, Argentina, at 15, was released by Valencia, went to Gillingham, Southampton and Spurs, mostly as a back-up, and made the second most saves in Spain last season, he played a key part in leading them to the Champions League. On their opening night, he made a dreadful error against PSG, a harmless enough ball escaping him and deflecting into the net in the last minute.</p> \n<p>At the end of Sunday\u2019s win, Michel admitted he had even been tempted to rotate. In the summer, they had signed Pau L\u00f3pez, after all. \u201cThat was more for emotional, mental reasons than anything else,\u201d the coach said. \u201cBut in the end I gave Gazzaniga continuity because I think he deserves it; he\u2019s always had that character to be able to compete in good times and bad.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1842922171146100929\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udeab This is getting ridiculous, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GazzanigaPaulo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GazzanigaPaulo</a>!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LALIGAHighlights?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LALIGAHighlights</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HrooeghKZU\">pic.twitter.com/HrooeghKZU</a></p>\u2014 LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1842922171146100929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2024</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest is history. This isn\u2019t the first time a goalkeeper has made three penalty saves in a game. <a href=\"https://x.com/dunfermlinep/status/1772698935443988894\">Dunfermline have a bit of a thing for it</a>, for a start, both in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/15/davis-cup-dives-pele-the-movie-star-and-lewis-hamilton-shocks-a-tiger\">favour and against them</a> \u2013 step forward Cammy Bell and Deniz Mehmet. Jean-Francois Gillet did it in Belgium too. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg1L5LNIkg\">everyone remembers Mart\u00edn Palermo missing three</a>. It\u2019s not even the first time Gazzaniga has completed a glorious triple \u2013 just look at this <a href=\"https://x.com/ftbllrswanimals/status/1430676879703412742\">with dog</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/ftbllrswanimals/status/1164811015369846786\">pig</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftbllrswanimals/status/1352828916927488000?lang=ga\">pony</a> \u2013 and post-game he said \u201cwhen you\u2019re a goalkeeper facing a penalty you always expect to save it\u201d. But no one had done it in La Liga \u2013 not even if you call this two plus one, pedants \u2013 and even he could not have imagined this. No one could, not even with Athletic having missed half of their last 10. \u201cWe\u2019re the team that won the Copa del Rey final on penalties,\u201d Valverde said afterwards, \u201cdon\u2019t ask me how.\u201d</p> \n<p>It all started in in the 27th minute when referee Juan Luis Pulido Santana was called to the VAR screen. Berenguer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/07/athletic-club-beat-mallorca-in-copa-del-rey-final-to-end-40-year-trophy-drought\">who scored the penalty</a> that took them to their first trophy in 40 years, asked to take it. \u201cHe was confident and he was the one that won it,\u201d Williams reasoned. The penalty was struck so badly Gazzaniga didn\u2019t even have to move far to save it. That meant that at half-time, the score was 1-1. Y\u00e1ser Asprilla<strong> </strong>had opened the scoring thanks to Miguel Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s inspired moment of walking away from the ball whistling, letting a cross go all the way through and into the net. Oihen Sancet had then finished off Berenguer\u2019s gorgeous scooped pass just before the break. In the dressing room, Valverde told his players that if there was another penalty, Williams should take it.</p> \n<p>So when they got another one, again given by VAR, on 55 minutes, he did. \u201cI was calm. I was clear that I was going down the middle: I knew the goalkeeper would move,\u201d Williams said. But he didn\u2019t, not much, and nor, more importantly, did the ball. \u201cIt was a technical error; the ball didn\u2019t lift it,\u201d he said. Gazzaniga got to his feet and rolled the ball out, the still place cheering, the game continuing, when another call brought them back again, the celebrations replaced by chants: \u201cHands up, it\u2019s a robbery!\u201d Down in Las Rozas, they had spotted Gazzaniga off his line. Athletic were given another chance. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t foreseen a third taker,\u201d Herrera admitted \u2013 it should have been Sancet but he had been taken off injured \u2013 so he asked for it. And Gazzaniga saved from him too, everyone falling about and appealing for penalties every time anyone moved, singing \u201creferee, give another\u201d until eventually he did.</p> \n<p>The shot had been almost as bad as Williams\u2019 effort. \u201cSometimes things come off well and sometimes they don\u2019t,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken maybe 50 penalties and that has never happened, the ball going so low. In 16 years, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen this happen.\u201d In over 100 years, it was the first time anyone had, history made.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c0a3a6af-defa-4c15-88d0-cba19182924a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Legan\u00e9s 0-0 Valencia, Espanyol 2-1 Mallorca, Getafe 1-1 Osasuna, Las Palmas 0-1 Celta Vigo, Real Valladolid 1-2 Rayo Vallecano, Real Madrid 2-0 Villarreal, Girona 2-1 Athletic, Alav\u00e9s 0-3 Barcelona, Sevilla 1-0 Betis, Real Sociedad 1-1 Atl\u00e9tico&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>History hurt too. This, as one Bilbao-based newspaper put it, \u201cwas a masters in how not to take a penalty\u201d. \u201cMisery from 11 metres,\u201d another headline called it; Athletic had \u201ccommitted hara kiri\u201d. Over on the bench, Valverde had a pen in his hand, Jon Rivas in El Pa\u00eds imagining him wanting to plunge it into the first person to go by, or write a letter of resignation there and then. But it was Williams who took it hardest, the opportunity to put his team into the lead and on course for another vital victory lost. \u201cI feel responsible for us not winning; this just can\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. Only it can and it had. Sunk by the trauma of it all, it was going to get even worse when, called by the VAR, on 98 minutes and 17 seconds Stuani scored the winner.</p> \n<p>With a penalty.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t remember a game like it,\u201d Paulo Gazzaniga said. And nor does anyone else. Nobody had done done what he had just done: not his brother Gianfranco, not his dad Daniel, goalkeepers like him, not anyone, not here. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Michel S\u00e1nchez called it; Ernesto Valverde went for \u201cfarcical\u201d. When Girona and Athletic\u2019s coaches embraced at the end of a sunny Sunday afternoon, the last of 27 shots having finally settled a chaotic game in Catalonia, a 99th-minute winner from the best striker Montilivi has seen still overshadowed by three that didn\u2019t go in, Valverde wore a shrug and a smile that said silly, innit. Which is was. It was also brilliant. And bad. And fun, which football\u2019s meant to be. Historic, too. \u201cThis can\u2019t happen in primera,\u201d I\u00f1aki Williams said but it had, and for the first time ever. There were 13,396 people to witness it, a story they\u2019ll tell until the end of time, still laughing when they do just like they were still laughing when they left Montilivi. Three times Carlos del Cerro Grande called from the VAR room 712km away, three times Athletic went to the spot, three different men taking three different penalties. Paulo Gazzaniga saved them all. The goalkeeper whose first professional appearance was for Gillingham in front of 2,466 people at Underhill became the only man in La Liga history to stop three penalties in one day \u2013 or 29 minutes and 30 seconds, to be precise. \u201cAthletic shot themselves in the foot,\u201d one headline said but if they had tried, he would have saved that too. It\u2019s only his team\u2019s shots he doesn\u2019t stop. Although he saved a penalty against Feyenoord in midweek, three of the four Gazzaniga has conceded in the Champions League have been own goals. Then, where Alex Berenguer, Williams and Ander Herrera failed, Cristhian Stuani didn\u2019t and, instead of another Athletic victory, a fourth in five taking them into third, Girona won 2-1, their first in five. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win because of something unusual,\u201d Herrera insisted, entirely incorrectly. \u201cThank God \u2026\u201d Michel said afterwards, pausing to correct himself. \u201cWell, thank Gazzaniga.\u201d \u201cWe needed this,\u201d the man himself said, and maybe he had too. Girona had not won in six, losing twice in four league games and beaten in both of their Champions League matches, that feeling of Season After Syndrome hard to escape. Last year\u2019s great revelation, they had competed for the title more than anyone else had and eventually reached Europe for the first time, qualifying for the Champions League. Then what had happened was what tends to happen to great revelations. Aleix Garc\u00eda, their best midfielder and arguably Spain\u2019s too, left for Leverkusen. Artem Dovbyk, La Liga\u2019s top scorer, went to Rome. And Savinho, whose appearance was what made coach Michel think it was all possible in the first place, was a \u20ac40m signing for Manchester City, whose ownership group already owned him. If there was an inevitability about that, there was a weird inevitability about all this too, a sense that if it wasn\u2019t for bad luck they wouldn\u2019t have no luck at all. They had played reasonably well, a team with 11 new players being rebuilt by a coach in whom they trust, but competing in Europe and La Liga felt like a step too far and it just wasn\u2019t happening, fortune deserting them. They had lost in the last minute at the Parc des Princes. Against Feyenoord, they had scored two own goals, gifted another, had one of their own ruled out, missed a penalty and seen Viktor Tsygankov taken off, joining Oriol Romeu and Daley Blind on the injury list. At Valencia, where they had been beaten 2-0, both goals had been long shots that went in off Juanpe. In short, five of the last seven they had conceded had been own goals. None were more painful than the one Gazzaniga scored. A symbol of what Girona have done over the last few years, signed from Fulham in the Championship where he had become third-choice goalkeeper, the kid who left Murphy, Argentina, at 15, was released by Valencia, went to Gillingham, Southampton and Spurs, mostly as a back-up, and made the second most saves in Spain last season, he played a key part in leading them to the Champions League. On their opening night, he made a dreadful error against PSG, a harmless enough ball escaping him and deflecting into the net in the last minute. At the end of Sunday\u2019s win, Michel admitted he had even been tempted to rotate. In the summer, they had signed Pau L\u00f3pez, after all. \u201cThat was more for emotional, mental reasons than anything else,\u201d the coach said. \u201cBut in the end I gave Gazzaniga continuity because I think he deserves it; he\u2019s always had that character to be able to compete in good times and bad.\u201d The rest is history. This isn\u2019t the first time a goalkeeper has made three penalty saves in a game. Dunfermline have a bit of a thing for it, for a start, both in their favour and against them \u2013 step forward Cammy Bell and Deniz Mehmet. Jean-Francois Gillet did it in Belgium too. And everyone remembers Mart\u00edn Palermo missing three. It\u2019s not even the first time Gazzaniga has completed a glorious triple \u2013 just look at this with dog, pig and pony \u2013 and post-game he said \u201cwhen you\u2019re a goalkeeper facing a penalty you always expect to save it\u201d. But no one had done it in La Liga \u2013 not even if you call this two plus one, pedants \u2013 and even he could not have imagined this. No one could, not even with Athletic having missed half of their last 10. \u201cWe\u2019re the team that won the Copa del Rey final on penalties,\u201d Valverde said afterwards, \u201cdon\u2019t ask me how.\u201d It all started in in the 27th minute when referee Juan Luis Pulido Santana was called to the VAR screen. Berenguer, who scored the penalty that took them to their first trophy in 40 years, asked to take it. \u201cHe was confident and he was the one that won it,\u201d Williams reasoned. The penalty was struck so badly Gazzaniga didn\u2019t even have to move far to save it. That meant that at half-time, the score was 1-1. Y\u00e1ser Asprilla had opened the scoring thanks to Miguel Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s inspired moment of walking away from the ball whistling, letting a cross go all the way through and into the net. Oihen Sancet had then finished off Berenguer\u2019s gorgeous scooped pass just before the break. In the dressing room, Valverde told his players that if there was another penalty, Williams should take it. So when they got another one, again given by VAR, on 55 minutes, he did. \u201cI was calm. I was clear that I was going down the middle: I knew the goalkeeper would move,\u201d Williams said. But he didn\u2019t, not much, and nor, more importantly, did the ball. \u201cIt was a technical error; the ball didn\u2019t lift it,\u201d he said. Gazzaniga got to his feet and rolled the ball out, the still place cheering, the game continuing, when another call brought them back again, the celebrations replaced by chants: \u201cHands up, it\u2019s a robbery!\u201d Down in Las Rozas, they had spotted Gazzaniga off his line. Athletic were given another chance. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t foreseen a third taker,\u201d Herrera admitted \u2013 it should have been Sancet but he had been taken off injured \u2013 so he asked for it. And Gazzaniga saved from him too, everyone falling about and appealing for penalties every time anyone moved, singing \u201creferee, give another\u201d until eventually he did. The shot had been almost as bad as Williams\u2019 effort. \u201cSometimes things come off well and sometimes they don\u2019t,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken maybe 50 penalties and that has never happened, the ball going so low. In 16 years, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen this happen.\u201d In over 100 years, it was the first time anyone had, history made. History hurt too. This, as one Bilbao-based newspaper put it, \u201cwas a masters in how not to take a penalty\u201d. \u201cMisery from 11 metres,\u201d another headline called it; Athletic had \u201ccommitted hara kiri\u201d. Over on the bench, Valverde had a pen in his hand, Jon Rivas in El Pa\u00eds imagining him wanting to plunge it into the first person to go by, or write a letter of resignation there and then. But it was Williams who took it hardest, the opportunity to put his team into the lead and on course for another vital victory lost. \u201cI feel responsible for us not winning; this just can\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. Only it can and it had. Sunk by the trauma of it all, it was going to get even worse when, called by the VAR, on 98 minutes and 17 seconds Stuani scored the winner. With a penalty.",

Asked about the row on Monday, Farage told a Reform UK press conference held for other reasons: \u201cThe speaker\u2019s office is always right.\u201d The Reform leader has been the focus of criticism in Clacton for not holding constituency surgeries, while some residents have complained of trying to reach him without success. He made his original claim during a phone-in on LBC in September, where he recalled the murder of the Conservative MP David Amess at a surgery in Essex three years ago. Farage was speaking on Monday at an event where he announced that Reform MPs had written to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, threatening to launch a crowdfunded private criminal prosecution of the alleged assailants of police during an incident at Manchester airport this year if the men were not charged by the Crown Prosecution Services (CPS). Four suspects remain on police bail in connection with the incident. Reform\u2019s five MPs alleged \u201ca very senior person\u201d in Greater Manchester police (GMP) \u201cor above\u201d made a deliberate decision not to release the full CCTV footage of the incident despite junior officers recommending they do so. \u201cThis significant decision led to misinformation circulating, protests and utterly false allegations against the police officers and the GMP,\u201d they added in the letter to Cooper. They repeated a claim that the public had concerns about \u201ctwo-tier policing and two-tier justice\u201d. A GMP spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing an investigation led by the GMP major incident team, a comprehensive file of evidence was sent to the CPS in mid-August, and we await a charging decision. We have avoided providing ongoing commentary on the case, including releasing footage, to ensure that justice can be served without the risk of prejudicing proceedings. We continue to support the officers involved.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere is no such thing as two-tier policing. We expect high standards of conduct from police officers and they must equally be able to carry out their jobs without disruption. It is right that the CPS and the IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] are both able to carry out their investigations independently, without fear or favour.\u201d The move by Reform UK echoes statements by its MPs after the killing of three young girls in Southport, when Farage suggested police were withholding information about who was responsible. An investigation by the police watchdog is under way into the incident at Manchester Airport in July and is expected to conclude in the next three months. Video footage showed a police officer kicking and stamping on the head of Muhammed Fahir, 19, as he and his 25-year-old brother were restrained by officers. It led to protests in Rochdale and Manchester city centre. More footage, obtained by the Manchester Evening News, emerged days later that appeared to show the lead-up to the disturbance, when two female police officers were knocked to the ground. The IOPC said two police officers remained under criminal investigation for assault and were being investigated for potential gross misconduct for alleged breaches of police professional standards.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m about two-thirds of the way through the seven-hour drive from Reykjav\u00edk to \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and the term \u201cNordic blue\u201d is starting to make sense. Through lashing rain, the narrow road twists and turns around the coastline of Iceland\u2019s Westfjords. Waterfalls hurtle down hillsides as the storm rages and snippets of Icelandic conversation float solemnly from the radio. At a rare hotel along the way, I have to be towed by kind strangers with a forklift truck after getting stuck in a car park. By the time I emerge from the six-mile-long Westfjords tunnel \u2013 a dimly lit, low-ceilinged single lane through a mountain \u2013 and see the lights of the town up ahead, I feel as if my state of mind has fundamentally altered.</p> <p>Like much of \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur \u2013 which is surrounded by mountains and lies on a fjord across the Denmark Strait from Greenland \u2013 the tunnel is immediately recognisable from the pages of Satu R\u00e4m\u00f6\u2019s Hildur series, a wildly successful publishing phenomenon that has put the genre of \u201cNordic blue\u201d on Europe\u2019s literary map.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do like violent books and movies \u2013 but I maintain the right to close my eyes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m always frightened when I have to enter the tunnel,\u201d says R\u00e4m\u00f6 over breakfast at her home by the sea the next morning, the storm having finally subsided. \u201cWhat if something happens in here? And then I started thinking\u201d \u2013 there\u2019s a sharp intake of breath \u2013 \u201cwhat is the worst thing that could happen in this tunnel? I wouldn\u2019t get out. I would just get lost in here. The walls would suck me in.\u201d</p> <p>Awe-inspiring landscapes, unpredictable weather events and a persistent feeling of everyday unease are typical of the series, which is named after protagonist Hildur R\u00fanarsd\u00f3ttir. The emotions and thoughts of its characters play alongside the dramatic backdrop \u2013 sometimes in unison, sometimes wildly at odds.</p>    <p>In Finland alone, R\u00e4m\u00f6 has sold nearly 600,000 books in the last two years, the equivalent of more than one for every 10 people in a country with a population of 5.6 million. Two of her books were the most borrowed in the Nordic country\u2019s libraries last year. The series has also become a bestseller in Germany, and was adapted into a TV series and a forthcoming play. The first book, called The Clues in the Fjord in English, is about to be published in the UK.</p> <p>The term Nordic blue didn\u2019t appear on R\u00e4m\u00f6\u2019s radar until after she had started writing the series. The author was at an industry event in London when a German TV producer used the phrase to describe her work. \u201cIt\u2019s like Nordic noir but more human,\u201d she says. \u201cNot like cosy crime or romantic crime, but more like how people are dealing with each other in life in general. There is a social-psychological aspect to it.\u201d</p>    <p>This comes in multiple forms: unspoken feelings, isolated lives, family trauma, social breakdown, finding solace in sex with a neighbour. The number of characters is few, which can lead to a comforting feeling of intimacy or an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia, depending on their inner states.</p> <p>There are still murders to be solved, though: a corpse in a fish farm; a man found in an avalanche with his throat cut; a businessman shot dead on a ski trail. But the investigation serves to further explore the characters\u2019 mindsets \u2013 such as how Hildur really feels about the neighbour she is sleeping with \u2013 rather than bring forward a juicy reveal or revel in a dose of violence.</p> <p>In a potential occupational hazard for a crime writer, R\u00e4m\u00f6 is squeamish. \u201cI do like to watch violent movies or read violent books,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I always maintain the right to close my eyes.\u201d In her own writing, the drama comes out of the internal traumas, the landscapes and human relationships. \u201cSisterhood, parenthood, friendships that don\u2019t work out, or love stories that crash or don\u2019t crash. That comes instead of graphic violence and I think that\u2019s Nordic blue.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>After her sisters go missing in a tunnel, Hildur self-medicates by surfing alone in the ocean</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Still, few fictional detectives worth their salt come without a dark side, and in Nordic noir the abyss within is usually deeper than elsewhere. In Henning Mankell\u2019s Kurt Wallander, Swedish crime fiction gave us an investigator who was gloomier and grumpier than anything seen before. And with Stieg Larsson\u2019s Lisbeth Salander and The Bridge\u2019s Saga Nor\u00e9n, it gave us female detectives who defied gender stereotypes through a lack of social skills. (The implication was that both were somewhere on the autism spectrum, though this was never explicitly stated.)</p> <p>Hildur also breaks new ground. The distinguishing quality of R\u00e4m\u00f6\u2019s detective is her fluidity. After her two sisters, R\u00f3sa and Bj\u00f6rk, vanish mysteriously in that sinister tunnel outside \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, she nurses a trauma that she self-medicates with exercise and by surfing alone in the ocean. She is self-contained, independent and romantically unattached, but also empathetic, sensitive and kind. Her sidekick is a handsome Finn called Jakob, who rarely stops knitting.</p> <p>Like Jakob, R\u00e4m\u00f6 is a Finnish expat living in the small island state on the mid-Atlantic ridge between North America and Europe, and her outsider\u2019s perspective on Iceland is the key to the series\u2019 success. On opposite ends of the Nordic region, separated by more than 1,000 miles, Finland and Iceland are culturally distinct.<strong> </strong>While their languages sound similar (\u201clike a calm hum,\u201d R\u00e4m\u00f6 says), they don\u2019t come from the same linguistic families and they share few words. Icelandic evolved from Old Norse while Finnish is more closely related to Hungarian, Sami and Estonian.</p> <p>R\u00e4m\u00f6, who first spent time in Reykjav\u00edk as a business studies student on a year abroad in her 20s and moved there for good in 2008, speaks both languages fluently but still writes in Finnish. As a newcomer, crime writers including Arnaldur Indri\u00f0ason and Lilja Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir became her guides to unlocking the secrets underneath the fabric of Icelandic society: a certain stubbornness of character, an uneasy relationship between tradition and modernity, the way successful women build protective barriers around themselves to stop others from stealing their achievements.</p>    <p>She chose the name Hildur, which derives from Old Norse for \u201cbattle\u201d, because it refers to the Valkyries who are said to have guided slain warriors to a blissful afterlife in Valhalla.</p> <p>Hildur was in part created out of the loneliness R\u00e4m\u00f6 experienced during Covid in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, where she eventually moved to from the capital with her family, initially working as a tourist guide. \u201cEverything closed down,\u201d she says, sitting at a candlelit table laid out with pastries, coffee and a Moomin ceramic jug of rhubarb cordial. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t have anything to do now. What the fuck? What am I doing next?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After spending some time thinking about the character of Hildur \u2013 her passions, characteristics, favourite pizza toppings \u2013 it was the arrival of her daughter\u2019s friend\u2019s parent on her doorstep that made her realise her \u201cimaginary friend\u201d had to be a police officer. From this chance encounter, an entire story evolved and soon she was in the toilet sending a whispered WhatsApp voice message to her publisher. \u201cI told her, \u2018I have this idea of a police officer. Her name is Hildur and she\u2019s working here, in my home village, and then there are these crimes, and I\u2019ve been planning these three stories in my head. What do you think? Does it sound really weird?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her publisher asked her to send the first 30 pages, which she wrote in just two weeks. This became the opening two chapters of the first book. Four years on, R\u00e4m\u00f6 is just finishing the fourth book of what was originally intended as a trilogy, with possibly more to come. In the third book, the Icelandic detective heads to Finnish Lapland to help Jakob prepare for a custody battle with his ex-wife. Laughing, R\u00e4m\u00f6 describes the enjoyment of matching Hildur with Finnish men. \u201cIt was so interesting because I got to explore new sides of her.\u201d</p> <p>The first book, meanwhile, has only just come out in Iceland. She was nervous about how it would be received but so far the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive \u2013 apart from a minor correction from an enthusiastic reader inside \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur police station about the coffee cups used by officers (R\u00e4m\u00f6 had described an assortment of cups bearing the names of political parties and unions, when in reality they are marked with the police officers\u2019 names). </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived here for 20 years,\u201d R\u00e4m\u00f6 says. \u201cI have an Icelandic passport.

Even then, I\u2019m still an outsider and I\u2019m always an outsider.\u201d But in writing, adds the author, this is something that can be turned to your advantage.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up\u2026 Environmental groups and sustainable finance campaigners have criticised BP following a report that the oil giant is dropping a target to cut its oil and gas production by the end of the decade. TGI Fridays will remain on UK high streets following a rescue deal for the chain, but more than 1,000 staff have lost their jobs with the immediate closure of 35 restaurants. Breal Capital and Calveton UK have acquired 51 restaurants after the group\u2019s previous operator fell into administration. It means that nearly 2,400 jobs have been saved across the US-themed restaurant and cocktail bar, but 35 restaurants not included in the sale have closed, leading to 1,012 redundancies. UK house prices have risen for the third month running, to just over \u00a3100 below their all-time high. German industry has been hit by another fall in orders\u2026. The UK\u2019s post-Brexit border plans have been delayed again, with new rules requiring safety forms to be sent with all imports delayed by three months. In the markets, the pound has hit a new three-week low against the US dollar. The Daily Mirror have a list of the 35 TGI Fridays stores to close, following the sale of part of the chain today. They are: Barnsley Birmingham Bracknell Brighton Marina Bristol Cabot Circus Cardiff Newport Road Chelmsford Cheltenham Croydon Derby Dundee Durham Edinburgh Fort Kinnaird Enfield Gateshead Gloucester Quays Halifax Jersey Leeds Leeds Trinity Leicester Lincoln Manchester Royal Exchange Newcastle Eldon Square Newport Northampton Prestwich Romford Sale Solihull Southampton West Quay South Speke Sutton Coldfield Swansea Watford North Administrators at Teneo have said that 35 TGI Fridays restaurants were not included in the sale and have been closed immediately, resulting in 1,012 redundancies. Online shopping group Very could soon be up for sale too. Sky News are reporting that the board of Very Group \u2013 now chaired by Nadhim Zahawi, the former chancellor \u2013 is lining up Barclays, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley to handle a strategic review of its ownership options. The process could result in the Barclay family ending its lengthy involvement with the business, Sky say, adding: A refinancing of the business, which counts the global investment giant Carlyle and Abu Dhabi-based IMI among its lenders, is also a possibility, according to insiders. They added, though, that a sale was more likely, with bidders expected to be courted on the basis of Very\u2019s technology-driven financial services arm as well as the core retail offering which sells everything from electrical goods to fashion. Last year, the Barclays also lost the Daily Telegraph, after running up nearly \u00a31bn of unpaid debts. Dovid Efune, the owner of the New York Sun, has now emerged as the leading contender to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph. Breal and Calveton are planning to \u201cmodernise\u201d TGI Fridays \u2013 a chain known for its loaded potato skins, wings, burgers and cocktails. A spokesperson for the new owners said: \u201cWe are delighted to be working with such an enthusiastic and committed Management Team to both modernise the business and capitalise on the heritage of this iconic Brand.\u201d TGI Fridays have provided a list of the restaurants saved from closure through today\u2019s sale to Breal Capital and Calveton UK. They are: Bluewater Trafford Centre Meadowhall Aberdeen Union Square Metrocentre Basildon Glasgow Fort Milton Keynes Stadium Braehead Wembley Birmingham NEC Glasgow Junction 27 [of the M62, I think] Castleford Lakeside Quay Teesside Bolton Norwich St Davids Doncaster Lakeside Fareham Liverpool One Stevenage White Rose Cribbs Causeway Rushden Lakes Stoke on Trent Southampton Silverburn Watford Central Aberdeen Beach Braintree Bournemouth Stratford High Wycombe Cheshire Oaks Walsall Milton Keynes Sheffield Nottingham Edinburgh Coventry Ashton-Under-Lyne Telford The O2 Staines Crawley Reading Cheadle Leicester Square Breaking: More than 2,000 jobs have been saved at TGI Fridays restaurant chain, after private equity firms Calveton and Breal Capital stepped in to buy part of the chain. The deal will save 51 of TGI Friday 87 UK restaurants, which should secure employment for almost half of the company\u2019s 4,500 employees. The sale comes less than a month after the TGI Fridays\u2019 parent company, Hostmore, appointed the advisory firm Teneo as administrators. Julie McEwan, chief executive of TGI Fridays UK, says: \u201cTGI Fridays is a much-loved brand with a rich heritage. The news today marks the start of a positive future for our business following a very challenging period for the casual dining sector as a whole. We look to the future with confidence that the TGI Fridays brand will continue to attract loyal and new guests. \u201cWe are devastated for our colleagues who will be leaving TGIs and thank them for their loyalty and contribution during their time with us. We are doing everything possible to retain our team and support those impacted. \u201cWe would like to thank our team and our loyal guests for supporting us during this transition. We are proud to serve millions of customers across the UK and are committed to continuing to evolve our proposition and to give our guests a great value for money experience that keeps them coming back to enjoy TGI Fridays time and again.\u201d But, the sale of part of TGI Fridays\u2019 estate suggests that many staff have lost their jobs. The Unite union have posted that staff have been reported being locked out of sites today with no notice, in what it calls \u201cfrankly appalling behaviour\u201d. BP\u2019s CEO Murray Auchincloss may hope to close the valuation gap with its rivals in the energy industry by watering down its commitment to sustainability goals. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: \u201cBP may feel it is being punished by the market for a strategy which included a 25% cut to oil and gas output by 2030 \u2013 already down from the original 40% reduction outlined in 2020 \u2013 so it appears this plan will now be ripped up completely. \u201cThe problem with reducing hydrocarbon production is it generates most of the cash which allows BP to reward shareholders with dividends and share buybacks. There is speculation that BP will not only scrap the output reduction plan, but it will also seek to increase the volume of oil and gas it produces by investing in geographies like the Middle East and Gulf of Mexico \u201cAuchincloss needs to demonstrate he has a genuine plan apart from not doing what the market doesn\u2019t like. If the reporting is correct, the company can expect to catch significant flak from regulators, politicians and environmental campaigners. However, that is probably easier to ignore than a stagnant share price. Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has reported a drop in sales in the last quarter, as it was hit by shortages of aluminium and a drop in demand in Europe and China. JLR sold 103,108 units in the second quarter of the year, compared with 12 months earlier. That included a 29% rise in sales in the UK, and a 9% rise in North America. However, sales fell by 22% in Europe, and by 17% in China. JLR repors that its production in the last quarter fell by 7% year-on-year, as a result of \u201csupply disruptions from a key high\u2011grade aluminium supplier\u201d that affected multiple manufacturers. That supplier was Switzerland\u2019s Novelis, whose factory was hit by flooding in early August. JLR also adds that a temporary hold was placed on around 6,500 vehicles, largely in the UK and Europe, at the end of September for additional quality control checks. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has won a legal victory at the court of appeal against a hedge fund which sued over its decision to cancel billions of dollars worth of nickel trades. Hedge fund Elliott Associates had appealed an earlier court decision which found that the LME had acted lawfully over its decision-making during a crisis in the nickel market in March 2022 when there was a dramatic and unprecedented spike in nickel prices. At the time the LME decided that the market had become disorderly, and that nickel trading should be suspended. Elliott sued the LME at the high court alleging that the cancellation of trading was unlawful and outside the scope of the LME\u2019s powers, and had violated Elliott\u2019s human rights as it had caused the hedge fund to lose net profits of $456m. However the high court ruled last November that the LME\u2019s decision had been lawful. The hedge fund appealed but the court of appeal has now rejected its appeal on all grounds. In the court\u2019s ruling, Lord Justice Stephen Males, one of the three judges, ruled that \u201cthe cancellation was lawful as a matter of domestic law.\u201d He said: \u201cThat was a once in a generation event. To have allowed the 8 March trades to stand would have meant a real risk of what has been graphically described as a \u2018death spiral\u2019 in the international metals market\u2026\u201d BP is facing a backlash following reports this morning that it has abandoned its target to cut oil and gas production by 2030. As covered earlier (see 8.10am), Reuters is reporting that CEO Murray Auchincloss is focused on projects in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico to boost output, rather than cutting oil and gas output by 25% by the end of the decade. Philip Evans, Greenpeace UK senior climate campaigner, says: \u201cThis is yet further proof that we cannot leave the future of our planet in the hands of fossil fuel bosses. It\u2019s clear that BP CEO Murray Auchincloss is hell-bent on prioritising company profits and shareholder wealth above all else as extreme floods and wildfires rack up billions of dollars in damages, destroying homes and lives all over the world. \u201cOil companies cannot be trusted to curtail their further destruction of the planet. We desperately need the UK government and leaders around the world to step in to bring these companies under control, put an end to their expansion, and place bold new polluter taxes on them to pay for the damage they are doing around the world.\u201d James Alexander, CEO of UKSIF (the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association) is also unimpressed, saying: \u201cMost oil and gas majors have consistently failed to invest enough into transition technologies, setting targets and making claims that have often been abandoned or debunked. The transition will not wait for them. The gap they have left is already being filled by renewables companies. It is increasingly dawning on investors that oil and gas companies that refuse to engage properly in the transition represent an unacceptable investment risk.\u201d Reclaim Finance stewardship campaigner Agathe Masson is urging shareholders to rein BP\u2019s board in, saying: \u201cBP is throwing any pretence of climate action out of the window in pursuit of increased production, despite its previous ambition to cut production of oil and gas. BP might be happy to see the planet burn in the name of profits, but investors must take a longer view and reject this climate-wrecking strategy. They must vote against the re-election of directors at the AGM to oppose this strategy, and act in the interests of net zero by refusing to provide new investments for fossil fuel developers. \u201c Over at John Lewis, CEO Nish Kankiwala is becoming a non-executive director at the retailer again, as new chairman Jason Tarry takes firm control of the business. Three weeks after taking over as chair, replacing Sharon White, Tarry will now chair John Lewis\u2019s executive team as well as the Partnership Board. Kankiwala, a former Hovis and Burger King executive, had become John Lewis\u2019s first CEO in March 2023 in an attempt to turn the business around. Nineteen months later, the CEO role is being dispensed with, in a sign that Tarry \u2013 who ran Tesco\u2019s UK and Irish operation for six years \u2013 will be running the John Lewis Partnership. Kankiwala says: \u201cThe Board asked me to move across from my Non-Executive Director role to Chief Executive back in March 2023. This was in view of such a significant time for the Partnership and to help accelerate this phase of the transformation. I was delighted to agree to take on the role for a two-year period during this time of pivotal change. Since then we\u2019ve refreshed our Partnership strategy to be rooted in retail; significantly improved our cash flows to enable record investment for growth; and returned the Partnership to full-year profit. \u201cIt\u2019s been the privilege of my life to lead the Partnership as CEO during this period of intense transformation. I am hugely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved so far - thanks to the hard work and dedication of our Partners. I have every confidence in Jason taking the Partnership from strength to strength in the next phase of our transformation and am delighted to continue to support him and the Board in an advisory capacity going forward.\u201d My colleague Nils Pratley pointed out back in April that it was hard to see where Kankiwala would fit in once Tarry arrived\u2026. The government has confirmed another delay to post-Brexit border plans, with new rules requiring safety forms to be sent with all imports delayed by three months. Part of the UK\u2019s Border Target Operating Model (BTOM) plan, all imports were expected to include safety and security declaration forms from 31 October before they could enter the UK. The forms used to assess the risk of products to UK security should include details of hauliers, descriptions of goods and details of the origins of products. However, this has now been pushed back until 31 January amid concerns that businesses were not ready for the changes. It is the latest in a long list of delays to Britain\u2019s border plan after the introduction of border checks on plant and animal products was only introduced on 30 April after five delays. Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade, said: \u201cThis is not a surprise as industry has seen little in the way of guidance being issued on the third implementation of Border Target Operating Model (BTOM). \u201cThe overall aim of the is to deliver a world-leading, digital first border system for the UK, not create more confusion and extra cost for business. We would urge the government to now step up the engagement programme in the lead up to the January deadline to ensure a smooth transition to the new checks.\u201d Alongside this, the government has also pushed back the introduction of the roll-out of its single trade window, a digital platform that allows traders to provide all import details in a single place. This was also set to be introduced on 31 October but has now been pushed back. The German economy is expected to contract by 0.2% in 2024, an economy ministry spokesperson has said, confirming an earlier report in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. The forecast for an inflation-adjusted contraction, which the ministry is due to publish on Wednesday, follows a previous government projection of 0.3% growth this year, Reuters adds. The pound has dropped to its lowest level in over three weeks against the US dollar this morning, as traders anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the months ahead. Sterling has lost half a cent this morning, to trade as low as $1.3064, its lowest since 12 September. Investors have been digesting last week\u2019s dovish words from Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who said the BoE could be a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in cutting interest rates if inflation news continued to be good. The BoE\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, then pushed back, warned on Friday against cutting interest rates \u201ctoo far or too fast. Goldman Sachs believes the debate on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is shifting away from whether cuts are appropriate towards how quickly policy restriction should be withdrawn. They expect the Bank to cut rates by a quarter of one percentage point at each meeting for the next year. Goldman told clients there is likely to be \u201cwidespread support\u201d for a quarter-point cut at the November MPC meeting, and for another cut in December, adding: We therefore continue to expect sequential 25bp cuts until Bank Rate reaches 3% in September 2025. Eurozone retail sales crept up by 0.2% in August, new data from Eurostat shows. It was driven by a 1.1% rise in spending on automotive fuel, while sales of other non-food products rose 0.3%, and food, drink and tobacco sales were up 0.2%. The highest monthly increases in the total retail trade volume were recorded in Luxembourg (+5.3%), Cyprus (+2.2%) and Romania (+1.6%). The largest decreases were observed in Denmark (-1.5%), Slovakia (-1.1%), Bulgaria and Croatia (both -0.7%). Back in the UK property sector, residential landlord Grainger has reported a jump in rents and predicted further growth over the year ahead. Grainger, which is the UK\u2019s largest residential landlord with about 12,000 homes, reported like-for-like rental growth of 6.3% for the year to the end of September, down from 7.7% in the previous year. Grainger says it is benefitting from '\u201crapidly accelerating growth in demand\u201d, which has kept its occupancy rate high \u2013 at 97.4%. The company says it also faces a \u201cFavourable political environment\u201d, saying: The newly elected Labour Government have publicly opposed introducing rent controls in favour of stimulating the housing supply-side and raising standards via the Renters\u2019 Rights Bill which Grainger already exceeds, and legislation which Grainger is proactively engaged on Grainger also points out that its CEO, Helen Gordon, has been. appointed to the UK Government\u2019s New Towns Taskforce. Just in: Investor confidence across the euro area has risen this month, despite the economic problems in Germany. After three declines in a row, Sentix\u2019s gauge of eurozone investor morale has risen to -13.8 in October, from -15.4 in September. Sentix reports that economic expectations rose this month, even as the current assessment of the economy plumbed a new low for the year, adding: The economy is starting its next attempt to emerge from recession/stagnation. The report found that all regions of the world are showing signs of improvement, although the German economy \u201cremains in recession mode for the time being\u201d. Sentix\u2019s Patrick Hussy says: The German economy remains in recession. Here too, the current assessment figures remain close to the year\u2019s lows. Expectations, on the other hand, show signs of easing with a plus of 6.8 points. The new economic stimulus in China is having an initial effect - albeit only to a manageable extent so far. The 5.8% fall in German factory orders in August was the biggest drop since January: Today\u2019s data has confirmed that demand for German industrial goods has continued to weaken, says Commerzbank\u2019s senior economist Ralph Solveen Solveen added: \u201cThis suggests that the German economy will at best stagnate in the second half of the year.\u201d Dark economic clouds are flocking over Germany this morning, with the news that manufacturing orders fell more sharply than expected in August. New orders at German factories fell by 3.8% month-on-month, statistics body Destatis reports this morning, rather worse than the 2% fall forecast by economists. On an annual basis, orders were 3.9% lower than in August 2023. Destatis reports that the large monthly drop was partly because \u201cextensive large orders\u201d had been placed in July, for vehicles such as aircraft, ships, trains, and military transport. If you exlude large orders, incoming orders in August were \u201conly\u201d 3.4% lower than in July, Destatis says. The decline in factory orders will make it harder for Germany\u2019s economy to return to growth, after it shrank slightly in April-June. Last month, the country\u2019s leading economic institutes downgraded their forecasts and predicted Germany\u2019s economy would shrink by 0.1% in 2024. Reuters are reporting that BP has abandoned a target to cut its oil and gas output by 2030. The apparent u-turn come as CEO Murray Auchincloss scales back the firm\u2019s energy transition strategy to regain the confidence of investors who have questioned its current strategy. Instead of cutting fossil fuel output, the focus has moved to several new possible investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico to boost its oil and gas output, Reuters reports. BT has already trimmed this target once. It had initially planned to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, but in February 2023 it cut this target to 25% and scaled back its climate ambitions. Auchincloss was appointed BP\u2019s CEO in January. So far this year its shares have fallen 10%, while rival Shell\u2019s are flat. A BP spokesperson has said: \u201cAs Murray said at the start of year... the direction is the same \u2013 but we are going to deliver as a simpler, more focused, and higher value company.\u201d Rising house prices will make it harder for first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder, unless lenders do continue to cut mortgage rates. And new data from estate agents Hamptons shows that younger home buyers are already facing a tougher squeeze from mortgage payments than older generations. Hamptons has calculated that millennials will be the first generation of homeowners to see mortgage repayments rise in the second half of their loan. Higher interest rates today, compared to a few years ago, mean that the average Millennial still has over half (61%) of their projected total mortgage repayments to make, they say. By the same point, the average Baby Boomer had 41% left to pay and Generation X had 40%. Hamptons reports that in 2024 prices, the average millennial (someone born between 1981 and 1995) will have paid \u00a3863 per month during the first five years of their mortgage loan. This compares to Generation X (those born from 1966 to 1980) who on average paid the equivalent of \u00a3923 a month (at today\u2019s prices), and Baby Boomers (1946-1965) who paid an average of \u00a3775 a month on their new mortgage. There\u2019s even an intergenerational divide between older Millennials who bought early at rock bottom pre-Covid mortgage rates, and younger ones who bought later at higher prices, and higher mortgage rates. And it\u2019s worse for those born in the late 1990s. Higher rates today mean that Generation Z face average mortgage payments of \u00a31,739 per month, roughly double what Millennials are paying. House prices could be spurred higher if the Bank of England cuts interest rates (as expected) next month, says Matt Thompson, head of sales at estate agent Chestertons: \u201cLower interest rates and sub-4% mortgage products saw more house hunters start their property search in September. The uplift in buyer activity, and looming changes to Capital Gains Tax in the upcoming Autumn Budget, also motivated sellers to put their property up for sale. We expect this level of market activity to continue and could see an additional boost in buyer motivation if the Bank of England decides to cut interest rates in November.\u201d Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says: \u201cLenders continue to reduce their mortgage rates, which is encouraging buyers to make their move. The Bank of England Governor\u2019s comments about a more aggressive approach to rate setting should feed through to even lower mortgage pricing. \u201cSeveral lenders repriced downwards last week, including HSBC, NatWest, Barclays and Santander. Two-year fixes are now available from 3.84 per cent while the cheapest five-year fix is pegged at 3.68 per cent, which will prove to be more palatable for borrowers than some of the higher rates they have been paying recently. \u201cThis ongoing rate war among lenders is great news for borrowers as there are some really compelling deals being launched, which will go some way to helping affordability.\u201d Tom Bill, head of UK residential research, Knight Frank, suggests there might be a \u201crelief bounce\u201d after this month\u2019s budget: \u201cThe last two years have underlined the close relationship between mortgage rates and house prices \u2013 as one goes up the other goes down. We expect low single-digit price growth this year as rates continue to drift lower, with the Budget the main cause of uncertainty on the horizon. If it better than feared, there is likely to be a relief bounce in activity before Christmas that lasts into next spring.\u201d On an annual basis, UK house price inflation was nearly a two-year high last month. The 4.7% increase in house prices on an annual basis in September is the fastest annual rate since November 2022, according to data from Halifax. Unsurprisingly, London continues to have the most expensive property prices in the UK. Halifax reports that the average house price in the capital rose by 2.6% in the year to September, to \u00a3539,238. That\u2019s still below the capital\u2019s peak property price of \u00a3552,592 set in August 2022. Halifax\u2019s data also shows that first time buyers are paying less for a home than in 2022. Todays report explains: The average amount paid by first-time buyers has increased by +4.2% over the past year, which equates to an extra \u00a39,409 in cash terms. This brings the typical first-time buyer property price up to \u00a3232,769, its highest level since May 2024. However that\u2019s still about \u00a31,000 less than the average amount paid by a first-time buyer two years ago (\u00a3233,760), a decrease of around -0.4%. Halifax reports that Northern Ireland continues to record the strongest property price growth of any nation or region in the UK. The average price of a property in Northern Ireland is now \u00a3203,593, after prices rose by. 9.7% on an annual basis in September. House prices in Wales rose by 4.4% to an average of \u00a3224,119. Scotland saw a more modest rise in house prices, up 2.1%, meaning a typical property now costs \u00a3205,718. Across England, the North West recorded the strongest house price growth of any region in England, up by +5.1% over the last year, to sit at \u00a3234,355. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK house prices have risen for the third straight month, lender Halifax reports this morning, helped by lower borrowing costs. According to Halifax, the average house price rose by 0.3% in September to \u00a3293,399, up from \u00a3292,540 in August, which pushed the annual growth rate up to 4.7%. This left the average price only a little short of the record high of \u00a3293,507 set in June 2022, on Halifax\u2019s index, before the market started to slide in autumn 2022 after the mini-budget pushed up mortgage rates. Amanda Bryden, Head of Mortgages at Halifax, says improved mortgage affordability is stimulating the market. But, she adds, it\u2019s \u201cessential\u201d to view these recent gains in context. Bryden explains: While the typical property value has risen by around \u00a313,000 over the past year, this increase is largely a recovery of the ground lost over the previous 12 months. Looking back two years, prices have increased by just +0.4% (\u00a31,202). Market conditions have steadily improved over the summer and into early autumn. Mortgage affordability has been easing thanks to strong wage growth and falling interest rates. This has boosted confidence among potential buyers, with the number of mortgages agreed up over 40% in the last year and now at their highest level since July 2022. While improved mortgage affordability should continue to support buyer activity \u2013 boosted by anticipated further cuts to interest rates \u2013 housing costs remain a challenge for many. As a result we expect property price growth over the rest of this year and into next to remain modest.\u201d The agenda 7am BST: Halifax house price index for September 7am BST: German factory orders for August 9.30am BST: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for August",

      "body": "<p>No prime minister plans to spend the first hundred days in Downing Street learning how not to govern for the next hundred.</p> <p>The intensity of the job is famously relentless, but it\u2019s also supposed to be exhilarating. The confident stride of a triumphant leader should mask initial missteps. For Keir Starmer to look already winded, however, suggests that something has gone badly wrong. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/sue-gray-resigns-as-keir-starmer-chief-of-staff-downing-street\">The departure of Sue Gray</a>, his chief of staff, confirms it.</p> <p>Gray was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/09/sue-gray-first-week-starmer-chief-of-staff-labour\">hired from the civil service</a> last year to coordinate preparations for government. It was her responsibility to make sure the new administration looked focused, professional, ready to deliver. In other words, she was meant to orchestrate a transition exactly unlike the one that has actually happened. No wonder she has gone.</p> <p>Officially, Gray has resigned to take on a new role as envoy for the nations and regions. In Westminster parlance that means exile from court. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/keir-starmer-no-10-chief-of-staff-sue-gray-resignation\">new chief of staff</a> is Morgan McSweeney, Starmer\u2019s campaigns director and architect of the project that propelled Labour from a pit of electoral gloom to a record parliamentary majority.</p> <p>McSweeney\u2019s admirers naturally see the new Downing Street arrangement as a positive development, clarifying chains of command and removing someone who was an origin of internal strife and a magnet for unhelpful publicity. Ask government insiders about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/16/no-10-power-struggle-rumours-sue-gray-morgan-mcsweeney\">rumours of rivalry</a> between McSweeney and Gray and you will probably be told that those stories are wide of the mark. The real antagonism was between Gray and <em>everyone.</em> No 10 was not functioning as a dynamic political operation because, it is alleged, the prime minister\u2019s gatekeeper restricted officials\u2019 access to the prime minister while unofficial relations were contaminated with mistrust imported from her previous career as a senior mandarin. Downing Street has denied these claims.</p> <p>Gray also has defenders, especially among Labour MPs. They see a powerful woman whose primacy at the centre of government was resented by a swaggering clique of entitled young men (\u201cthe boys\u2019 club\u201d). Viewed from that angle, the reshuffle of senior advisers is a coup \u2013 the culmination of a campaign of malevolent briefing and leaks, containing more than a whiff of misogyny.</p> <p>One thing everyone agrees on is that the system wasn\u2019t working. Something had to change. A choppy start was foreseeable and, to a degree, unavoidable. The new prime minister was never going to get an easy ride from newspapers that treat the mere fact of Labour rule as distasteful at best. A foul economic legacy was always going to subdue the national mood.</p> <p>But even with those headwinds, a new government with a massive majority, facing a despised and divided opposition, should have enjoyed a phase of full-spectrum dominance.

      "bodyText": "No prime minister plans to spend the first hundred days in Downing Street learning how not to govern for the next hundred. The intensity of the job is famously relentless, but it\u2019s also supposed to be exhilarating. The confident stride of a triumphant leader should mask initial missteps. For Keir Starmer to look already winded, however, suggests that something has gone badly wrong. The departure of Sue Gray, his chief of staff, confirms it. Gray was hired from the civil service last year to coordinate preparations for government. It was her responsibility to make sure the new administration looked focused, professional, ready to deliver. In other words, she was meant to orchestrate a transition exactly unlike the one that has actually happened. No wonder she has gone. Officially, Gray has resigned to take on a new role as envoy for the nations and regions. In Westminster parlance that means exile from court. The new chief of staff is Morgan McSweeney, Starmer\u2019s campaigns director and architect of the project that propelled Labour from a pit of electoral gloom to a record parliamentary majority. McSweeney\u2019s admirers naturally see the new Downing Street arrangement as a positive development, clarifying chains of command and removing someone who was an origin of internal strife and a magnet for unhelpful publicity. Ask government insiders about rumours of rivalry between McSweeney and Gray and you will probably be told that those stories are wide of the mark. The real antagonism was between Gray and everyone. No 10 was not functioning as a dynamic political operation because, it is alleged, the prime minister\u2019s gatekeeper restricted officials\u2019 access to the prime minister while unofficial relations were contaminated with mistrust imported from her previous career as a senior mandarin. Downing Street has denied these claims. Gray also has defenders, especially among Labour MPs. They see a powerful woman whose primacy at the centre of government was resented by a swaggering clique of entitled young men (\u201cthe boys\u2019 club\u201d). Viewed from that angle, the reshuffle of senior advisers is a coup \u2013 the culmination of a campaign of malevolent briefing and leaks, containing more than a whiff of misogyny. One thing everyone agrees on is that the system wasn\u2019t working. Something had to change. A choppy start was foreseeable and, to a degree, unavoidable. The new prime minister was never going to get an easy ride from newspapers that treat the mere fact of Labour rule as distasteful at best. A foul economic legacy was always going to subdue the national mood. But even with those headwinds, a new government with a massive majority, facing a despised and divided opposition, should have enjoyed a phase of full-spectrum dominance. It should not have been forced into a defensive crouch within months. The stream of stories about senior Labour figures being showered with gifts and freebies should have been gripped harder and faster. Some of the reporting has reeked of partisan spite. Donors donating is not corruption. But resentment of media bias seems to have blinded Starmer to the gravity of the wound being inflicted \u2013 the projection of moral equivalence between his fresh new government and the rancid old one. In a climate of entrenched cynicism about all politicians and their motives, literal adherence to rules over donations or uncertainty about what was permitted is no defence. Nor is there any protection from the self-certified ethical superiority that some Labour folk assume as a marker of being on the left, and not-the-Tories. Most voters don\u2019t lavish the benefit of the doubt on ministers simply because their flag is red. Gray\u2019s critics locate her at the origin of the strife.

It wasn\u2019t just their 34 regular-season wins (more than any WNBA team in history) or their record-breaking efficiency numbers. It was the execution, the intensity, the discipline and attention to detail: they were so unselfish, so dialed-in and everyone looked like they were having a blast.

Candace Parker re-signed during free agency, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/28/candace-parker-retires-wnba-las-vegas-aces\">announcing her retirement</a> at the start of training camp. They stumbled to a 6-6 start while Gray worked her way back from a foot injury suffered during last year\u2019s WNBA finals, racking up as many losses in the first month as they did all of last year. Wilson continued to show that she is the best player on the planet, earning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/22/aja-wilson-becomes-second-unanimous-mvp-in-wnba-history\">a third Most Valuable Player award</a> and becoming only the second player to win it unanimously, but Las Vegas were too often undone by backcourt inconsistency and the loss of their defensive identity. Wilson hinted at that back in August after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A191wE4bfIo\">her 42-point eruption</a> was wasted in a defeat to one of the league\u2019s worst teams.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen snippets in games that we have enough to get the job done,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of, do we want to get it done? The confidence is there, the talk is going to always be there. But are we going to put the work in to get it done? Are we going to do the extra little things? And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take us there.\u201d</p> <p>The Aces did tear off a couple winning streaks right before the Olympic break (winning 10 from 11) and to close the regular season (nine from 10) to earn the No 4 seed, but in the end their self-accountability wasn\u2019t enough. A strangely ponderous season finally came to end on Sunday afternoon with a 86-72 loss to the Liberty at Michelob Ultra Arena in the WNBA semi-finals.</p>    <p>Since clinching their second straight title on New York\u2019s home floor last October, the Aces went on to lose five straight to the Liberty: all three regular-season meetings and the first two games of their best-of-five semi-final series. Las Vegas were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/04/wnba-playoffs-lynx-sun-aces-liberty-scores\">finally able to pull one back in Game 3</a>, but were a frigid 7-of-30 from behind the arc and shot 32.8% overall in Sunday\u2019s finale as New York closed the show in style.</p> <p>\u201cThis team was put together to take us out, and they did,\u201d Aces coach Becky Hammon said. \u201cI think their group earned it. They earned it all year.\u201d</p> <p>The Aces\u2019 ouster was a microcosm of their entire season. Wilson turned in another standout performance with 19 points, 10 rebounds and five blocked shots, but found herself undermanned against the Liberty frontcourt pairing of Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones, who combined for 33 points and 20 rebounds. The backcourt offered up a silhouette of last year\u2019s clockwork efficiency with Gray (six assists, seven points), Young (1-for-10 from the floor) and Kelsey Plum (5-for-16) all below their standard. On the other end, New York\u2019s ability to spread the floor and fill it up from beyond three-point range exposed the Aces\u2019 defensive shortcomings.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve changed the way this league plays,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that our team can be proud of. We sped it up and spaced it out. I think it\u2019s been great for our game.\u201d</p>    <p>But perhaps the biggest factor in the Aces\u2019 regression was the loss of their competitive edge, something Hammon has hinted at for months. Part of it could be down to physical and mental fatigue: the entirety of the Aces\u2019 core four played in the Paris Olympics while much of the league enjoyed a three-week break. But the Las Vegas coach delivered her bluntest assessment yet after Tuesday night\u2019s Game 2 defeat in Brooklyn that pushed the Aces to the brink of elimination.</p> <p>\u201cThe feel was different from the jump [of the season],\u201d Hammon said. \u201cAnd this is why three-peating is hard, let\u2019s be real. The whole league has been pissed off for the last eight months and my players are in commercials, and this and that and being fricking celebrities. And you get distracted. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard. Because human nature is distracting.\u201d</p> <p>Hammon was less caustic after Sunday\u2019s ouster, her first season-ending defeat after winning titles in her first two years on the sidelines, but the message was consistent. The Aces were beaten by a better team, but their loss of focus and intensity was all on their side and entirely preventable.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of hard learning lessons,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cIt hurts now but I promise it\u2019s going to hurt tomorrow, probably worse, because it sets in the next day. You\u2019ve got to build habits and you\u2019ve got a work in a way that you believe you deserve to win. That you believe you deserve to win. At the end of the day, our shortcomings stood out a little bit.</p> <p>\u201cWe have some great things to build on. We don\u2019t have it every year. That\u2019s not the way this works. You don\u2019t get to flip a switch. But it\u2019s the beautiful thing about sports, actually. The work and the commitment and the buy-in and the play-hard and the want-to and the will, will always show up in the end.\u201d</p> <p>Simply wanting it more will only be part of it. The Aces have decisions to make on Plum, Alysha Clark and Tiffany Hayes, who are all unrestricted free agents. Already squeezed on cap space, the depth issues that go back to their championship years won\u2019t be easily resolved. And they won\u2019t pick until 16th in next year\u2019s draft after having their first-round pick rescinded by the league after an investigation found that they violated rules regarding workplace policies and impermissible player benefits.</p> <p>With a prime Wilson in the fold, the Aces will never be far from the top. But Hammon is keenly aware there\u2019s plenty of work to do.</p> <p>\u201cNew York has had really great will and determination this whole year\u201d Hammon said. \u201cWe talked a lot of smack last year. I\u2019m sure they heard it, and they got to smack us next year. For us, we will have a long offseason. And for us, we will be back next year, and I\u2019m sure the focus level will be very different. I can pretty much guarantee that.\u201d</p>",

Las Vegas were finally able to pull one back in Game 3, but were a frigid 7-of-30 from behind the arc and shot 32.8% overall in Sunday\u2019s finale as New York closed the show in style. \u201cThis team was put together to take us out, and they did,\u201d Aces coach Becky Hammon said. \u201cI think their group earned it. They earned it all year.\u201d The Aces\u2019 ouster was a microcosm of their entire season. Wilson turned in another standout performance with 19 points, 10 rebounds and five blocked shots, but found herself undermanned against the Liberty frontcourt pairing of Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones, who combined for 33 points and 20 rebounds. The backcourt offered up a silhouette of last year\u2019s clockwork efficiency with Gray (six assists, seven points), Young (1-for-10 from the floor) and Kelsey Plum (5-for-16) all below their standard. On the other end, New York\u2019s ability to spread the floor and fill it up from beyond three-point range exposed the Aces\u2019 defensive shortcomings. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed the way this league plays,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that our team can be proud of. We sped it up and spaced it out. I think it\u2019s been great for our game.\u201d But perhaps the biggest factor in the Aces\u2019 regression was the loss of their competitive edge, something Hammon has hinted at for months. Part of it could be down to physical and mental fatigue: the entirety of the Aces\u2019 core four played in the Paris Olympics while much of the league enjoyed a three-week break. But the Las Vegas coach delivered her bluntest assessment yet after Tuesday night\u2019s Game 2 defeat in Brooklyn that pushed the Aces to the brink of elimination. \u201cThe feel was different from the jump [of the season],\u201d Hammon said. \u201cAnd this is why three-peating is hard, let\u2019s be real. The whole league has been pissed off for the last eight months and my players are in commercials, and this and that and being fricking celebrities. And you get distracted. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard. Because human nature is distracting.\u201d Hammon was less caustic after Sunday\u2019s ouster, her first season-ending defeat after winning titles in her first two years on the sidelines, but the message was consistent. The Aces were beaten by a better team, but their loss of focus and intensity was all on their side and entirely preventable. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of hard learning lessons,\u201d Hammon said. \u201cIt hurts now but I promise it\u2019s going to hurt tomorrow, probably worse, because it sets in the next day. You\u2019ve got to build habits and you\u2019ve got a work in a way that you believe you deserve to win. That you believe you deserve to win. At the end of the day, our shortcomings stood out a little bit. \u201cWe have some great things to build on. We don\u2019t have it every year. That\u2019s not the way this works. You don\u2019t get to flip a switch. But it\u2019s the beautiful thing about sports, actually. The work and the commitment and the buy-in and the play-hard and the want-to and the will, will always show up in the end.\u201d Simply wanting it more will only be part of it. The Aces have decisions to make on Plum, Alysha Clark and Tiffany Hayes, who are all unrestricted free agents. Already squeezed on cap space, the depth issues that go back to their championship years won\u2019t be easily resolved. And they won\u2019t pick until 16th in next year\u2019s draft after having their first-round pick rescinded by the league after an investigation found that they violated rules regarding workplace policies and impermissible player benefits. With a prime Wilson in the fold, the Aces will never be far from the top. But Hammon is keenly aware there\u2019s plenty of work to do. \u201cNew York has had really great will and determination this whole year\u201d Hammon said. \u201cWe talked a lot of smack last year. I\u2019m sure they heard it, and they got to smack us next year. For us, we will have a long offseason. And for us, we will be back next year, and I\u2019m sure the focus level will be very different. I can pretty much guarantee that.\u201d",

She felt worried, scared and unsafe \u201c24/7\u201d. The girl said: \u201cI used to harm myself and bring a knife to school.\u201d</p> <p>Asked by her barrister, Caroline Rees KC, how old she had been when she first began taking knives into school, she said she was in year 3 or 4 of primary school.</p> <p>The girl said that in September 2023 she was excluded from school for about a week after a kitchen knife was found in her bag. Her father began checking her bag but she would take a blade in her pocket every day.</p> <p>On the day of the attack in April, the girl said she took a multi-tool with a blade that her father used for fishing into school. She said she was feeling grumpy and irritable and got angry when the assistant headteacher Fiona Elias told her she was not allowed into a school hall at break time.</p> <p>\u201cI was very, very angry,\u201d the girl said. She said she had told her friends she was going to \u201cslap\u201d or \u201cbeat up\u201d Elias, which could lead to her being expelled. She said this had been a \u201cpetty threat\u201d and had not planned to use the blade.</p> <p>The defendant remembered talking to Elias in the playground but does not recall striking her or the second teacher, Liz Hopkin. She said: \u201cI remember the start of it. The end of it was kind of a blur \u2026 I remember saying to myself: \u2018What am I doing? Stop.\u2019 I remember being very hot. I remember feeling exhausted and panicked and scared.\u201d</p> <p>The girl said that during the attack a friend told her: \u201cThink of your family.\u201d She said: \u201cI tried to breathe slowly but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Asked by Rees if she was in control of herself, the girl replied: \u201cNo.\u201d She said she remembered catching sight of a girl who had allegedly bullied her. The defendant said: \u201cI turned around and screamed, \u2018You\u2019re next.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>After she stabbed the girl, her victim told her: \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking psychopath.\u201d The defendant said she replied to the girl: \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p> <p>The 14-year-old said she accepted she did not like Elias but insisted she did not want to see her or the other two to come to harm. \u201cI\u2019ve never wished for anyone to be dead,\u201d she said.</p> <p>After the attacks, the girl said she felt \u201cempty and relieved\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A girl who stabbed two teachers and a fellow pupil in a playground has told a jury that she had taken knives into school since she was seven or eight. The girl, who was 13 at the time of the attacks, said she carried blades every day because she used them to self-harm and she was frightened of being bullied and didn\u2019t trust the system to protect her. She told Swansea crown court that the memory of the assaults was a blur but repeatedly insisted she did not intend to kill the three victims. Asked what the attacks felt like now, she said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like I did it.\u201d She felt \u201cterrible, guilty\u201d, adding: \u201cI would do anything to go back.\u201d The girl, now 14, has admitted wounding the two teachers and pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, but denies attempted murder. She told the court she was unhappy at school and was physically and verbally abused. She felt worried, scared and unsafe \u201c24/7\u201d. The girl said: \u201cI used to harm myself and bring a knife to school.\u201d Asked by her barrister, Caroline Rees KC, how old she had been when she first began taking knives into school, she said she was in year 3 or 4 of primary school. The girl said that in September 2023 she was excluded from school for about a week after a kitchen knife was found in her bag. Her father began checking her bag but she would take a blade in her pocket every day. On the day of the attack in April, the girl said she took a multi-tool with a blade that her father used for fishing into school. She said she was feeling grumpy and irritable and got angry when the assistant headteacher Fiona Elias told her she was not allowed into a school hall at break time. \u201cI was very, very angry,\u201d the girl said. She said she had told her friends she was going to \u201cslap\u201d or \u201cbeat up\u201d Elias, which could lead to her being expelled. She said this had been a \u201cpetty threat\u201d and had not planned to use the blade. The defendant remembered talking to Elias in the playground but does not recall striking her or the second teacher, Liz Hopkin. She said: \u201cI remember the start of it. The end of it was kind of a blur \u2026 I remember saying to myself: \u2018What am I doing? Stop.\u2019 I remember being very hot. I remember feeling exhausted and panicked and scared.\u201d The girl said that during the attack a friend told her: \u201cThink of your family.\u201d She said: \u201cI tried to breathe slowly but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Asked by Rees if she was in control of herself, the girl replied: \u201cNo.\u201d She said she remembered catching sight of a girl who had allegedly bullied her. The defendant said: \u201cI turned around and screamed, \u2018You\u2019re next.\u2019\u201d After she stabbed the girl, her victim told her: \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking psychopath.\u201d The defendant said she replied to the girl: \u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d The 14-year-old said she accepted she did not like Elias but insisted she did not want to see her or the other two to come to harm. \u201cI\u2019ve never wished for anyone to be dead,\u201d she said. After the attacks, the girl said she felt \u201cempty and relieved\u201d. She said: \u201cI felt I didn\u2019t have anything on my mind any more.\u201d The prosecutor William Hughes KC asked the defendant about notes she had written in which she said she wanted to do something \u201chumans aren\u2019t supposed to do\u201d and referred to committing the \u201ccrime of a lifetime\u201d. She had also drawn a picture of the schoolgirl she stabbed and written that she \u201cwill burn\u201d. The defendant insisted she had not really planned to hurt anyone.

She added that she had not found what had happened funny but explained: \u201cIt was supposed to be some sort of joke.\u201d The trial continues.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>BREAKING NEWS</strong></h2> <p>Manchester City and the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/07/manchester-city-premier-league-tribunal-verdict\">are both claiming victory</a> \u2013 of course \u2013 after the champions challenged its rules on commercial deals.</p> <h2><strong>THE NEED FOR SPEED</strong></h2> <p>As if scoring a goal inside the opening minute of three consecutive top-flight matches wasn\u2019t remarkable enough, the manner in which Brentford managed to do so without going on to win any of the games in question rather beggars belief. The first defeat was understandable, with Yoane Wissa taking the foolhardy decision to hoof the hornet\u2019s nest at the home of the champions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/14/manchester-city-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">after just 23 seconds</a>. And while there was a certain inevitability about the Bees\u2019 ensuing defeat, it did not go unnoticed that Manchester City were reduced to employing the dark arts to help close out the win a whole week before they would accuse Arsenal of inventing time-wasting. Against Tottenham, Bryan Mbeumo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/21/tottenham-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">took a second less</a> to hook the ball past Guglielmo Vicario in a game Brentford also went on to lose, while the volley he spanked past Alphonse Areola <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/28/brentford-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">after 37 seconds</a> against West Ham was only be enough to earn his side a draw. Thomas Frank\u2019s side had scored three goals against three different sides inside 90 seconds of combined action but just a solitary point to show for it.</p> <p>Clearly something had to change and against Wolves, Brentford <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/brentford-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">adopted a different approach</a>, losing the pre-match coin-toss and waiting a full 75 seconds to score pretty much the same goal for the fourth game in a row. Send players forward, get the ball launched and then whack in a cross for whoever happens to be completely unmarked in the opposition penalty area to steer goalwards. Considering the first recorded game of association football was played in 1863, it seems amazing that nobody has ever thought of doing this before. And considering Brentford had scored early goals in their previous three games, prompting forensic dissections of their approach, it seems even more amazing that Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s Wolves were so totally unprepared for this eventuality.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost the coin-toss,\u201d deadpanned Frank upon being asked what took his team so long to trouble the scoreboard operator. \u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing coin-tosses all week and clearly [Christian] N\u00f8rgaard didn\u2019t do well enough so it took a little bit longer this time.

      "bodyText": "BREAKING NEWS Manchester City and the Premier League are both claiming victory \u2013 of course \u2013 after the champions challenged its rules on commercial deals. THE NEED FOR SPEED As if scoring a goal inside the opening minute of three consecutive top-flight matches wasn\u2019t remarkable enough, the manner in which Brentford managed to do so without going on to win any of the games in question rather beggars belief. The first defeat was understandable, with Yoane Wissa taking the foolhardy decision to hoof the hornet\u2019s nest at the home of the champions after just 23 seconds. And while there was a certain inevitability about the Bees\u2019 ensuing defeat, it did not go unnoticed that Manchester City were reduced to employing the dark arts to help close out the win a whole week before they would accuse Arsenal of inventing time-wasting. Against Tottenham, Bryan Mbeumo took a second less to hook the ball past Guglielmo Vicario in a game Brentford also went on to lose, while the volley he spanked past Alphonse Areola after 37 seconds against West Ham was only be enough to earn his side a draw. Thomas Frank\u2019s side had scored three goals against three different sides inside 90 seconds of combined action but just a solitary point to show for it. Clearly something had to change and against Wolves, Brentford adopted a different approach, losing the pre-match coin-toss and waiting a full 75 seconds to score pretty much the same goal for the fourth game in a row. Send players forward, get the ball launched and then whack in a cross for whoever happens to be completely unmarked in the opposition penalty area to steer goalwards. Considering the first recorded game of association football was played in 1863, it seems amazing that nobody has ever thought of doing this before. And considering Brentford had scored early goals in their previous three games, prompting forensic dissections of their approach, it seems even more amazing that Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s Wolves were so totally unprepared for this eventuality. \u201cWe lost the coin-toss,\u201d deadpanned Frank upon being asked what took his team so long to trouble the scoreboard operator. \u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing coin-tosses all week and clearly [Christian] N\u00f8rgaard didn\u2019t do well enough so it took a little bit longer this time. It\u2019s fantastic, there\u2019s a great mentality in the group.\u201d Of course, one group in which it could be argued there is not a similarly great mentality is that which represents Wolverhampton Wanderers, who currently sit bottom of the Premier League table with one point from seven games. Never one to swing gleefully from the chandeliers even at the best of times, O\u2019Neil was particularly morose following his side\u2019s latest defeat.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves has decided not to raise tax on pensions contributions in this month\u2019s budget, after public sector unions warned that doing so would hurt their members. The chancellor is understood to have decided against the move, which had been considered as one of a number of tax rises designed to repair the hole in the public finances. Reeves had been considering reducing the 40% rate of tax relief that higher earners enjoy on pension contributions, in a move that could have raised \u00a310bn a year. Public sector unions warned, however, that doing so would hit almost 1 million of their members, erasing much of the pay increases that the government has just agreed. One government official told the Times, which first reported the decision, that it would have been \u201cmadness\u201d to increase taxes on public sector workers in this way. The Treasury refused to comment on the budget. Reeves has been weighing up a number of revenue-raising measures as she looks to avoid sharp cuts to public services, which had been assumed under the previous government\u2019s spending plans. One of them had been to cut the higher rate of tax relief on pension savings, which is currently enjoyed by those earning more than \u00a350,270 a year. A paper earlier this year by the left-of-centre Fabian Society recommended creating a single rate of tax relief for all earners, which could have been set between 20% and 30% instead. Such a move would have disproportionately hit public sector workers, however, who often have more generous pension arrangements than those in the private sector. Vishal Sharma, chair of the pensions committee at the British Medical Association, said: \u201cAttacking our pensions in this way would completely reverse this progress [on public sector pay deals] by once again taking money away from doctors in a different way. Not only would this negate the recent hard-won pay rises but it would probably reignite the recent pay disputes that have been seen across the NHS.\u201d Other tax-raising options remain available to the chancellor, however, including reducing the amount that people can take out of their pension pots tax-free when they retire. Reeves is also considering making changes to capital gains tax and inheritance tax. One option proposed by the Fabian Society is to levy inheritance tax on unspent pension pots, which can currently be passed on untaxed. Treasury officials will continue to work on the main budget measures for the next few weeks until they finalise their decisions in the week before the announcement on 30 October. This week, however, Reeves will have to give the Office for Budget Responsibility an indication of what she intends to do in order for its forecasters to create their first \u201cpost-measures\u201d analysis, which will be presented to the chancellor next Monday. One major decision still to be finalised is whether Reeves will change the official definition of government debt to allow her to borrow more without violating her own promise to have debt falling by the fifth year of the forecast period.",

On 7 October, the Israeli government neglected to do that. Today, the hostages appear an afterthought in the mind of Israel\u2019s prime minister. It is an accepted fact that Netanyahu\u2019s main objective is to keep himself in power (and away from criminal proceedings), at the expense of all else.</p> <p>Meanwhile, this same Israeli government is doing whatever it can to handicap any potential, viable, acceptable (to its own people) Palestinian leadership. The popular Fatah leader, Marwan Barghouti (who has openly supported a two-state solution), remains in an Israeli prison where his lawyers and family report that he faces harsh conditions. Other Fatah leaders \u2013 the core party of the Palestinian national movement that signed the Oslo accords aiming for two states in 1993 \u2013 have been dismissed by the Israeli leaders, as the Israeli government also is destroying any viable Palestinian Authority. The argument that key Palestinian leaders and thinkers make \u2013 that the greatest defeat of Hamas would be to begin a negotiation for the two-state option that Hamas historically rejects \u2013 continues to be rejected, too, by the Netanyahu government.</p> <p>Still, friends of mine in the Israeli peace camp have expressed the hope, perhaps myopic \u2013 but I choose to believe it possible \u2013 that out of such great tragedy could come a peaceful resolution. Indeed, a previous war between Israel and Egypt resulted in Anwar Sadat\u2019s visit to Israel and a peace treaty, to pull one historic example.</p> <p>There are partners on the ground and in the region for Israel. At the recent UN general assembly, Jordan\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Ayman Safadi, proclaimed: \u201cThe Israeli prime minister came here today and said that Israel is surrounded by those who want to destroy it,\u201d he began. \u201cWe\u2019re here \u2013 members of the Muslim-Arab committee, mandated by 57 Arab and Muslim countries \u2013 and I can tell you very unequivocally, all of us are willing to guarantee the security of Israel in the context of Israel ending the occupation and allowing for the emergence of a Palestinian state.\u201d</p> <p>In the past, an Israeli leader would pounce on the chance to transform these words into facts on the ground. Yet, Netanyahu shamefully ignores them. Political leaders in Israel, even those leading the struggling left camp, are tame at best in embracing this option right now.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of us must stop trying to make peace. As the region has spiraled since 7 October, so too has the global protest movement, with scenes and incidents that many of us on the left thought we would never see or hear. Inexplicably, leftists have waved flags of support for fundamentalist, dictatorial regimes like Hamas and Hezbollah, thrown red paint on synagogues and employed Nazi slogans.</p> <p>This left has essentially divided Jews into \u201cgood Jews\u201d, (those who are anti-Zionist, who disown Israel\u2019s right to exist) and \u201cbad Jews\u201d, (those of us who believe that the Jewish people have a right to self-determination).</p> <p>Antisemitism and hateful cancellation rhetoric lives among some of the protesters, but that certainly does not represent all of them. Many protesters are rightly heartsick from the civilian deaths and destruction, and others want the cause of the Palestinians to be seen as equal to that of the Israelis in US foreign policy, as it should be.</p> <p>There is an urgent need for a progressive and liberal movement to come together, on campuses and in communities, that will say enough; we are for humanity on both sides, we are for dignity and democracy for everyone. There are 7 million Jews and 7 million Palestinians in the same parcel of land and neither is going anywhere.</p> <p>It is time to stop the cancellation and the boycotting of either side. Time to embrace those who want to live and to live freely. I believe that to free Palestine will also free Israel. No people is free when they dominate another.</p> <p>I believe there could be a majority in the US for this approach. We can build a progressive alliance for peace. An alliance that is in the clear best interest of US foreign policy.</p> <p>A plurality of American Jews support a two state solution, 46% believe a two-state solution is the best possible outcome to the conflict, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/03/21/majority-in-u-s-say-israel-has-valid-reasons-for-fighting-fewer-say-the-same-about-hamas/#:~:text=Jewish%20Americans%20(46%25)%20and,country%20with%20an%20Israeli%20government.\">February 2024 Pew survey</a>. American Jews also supported humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza more than the overall American population did. (61% v 50%).</p> <p>It\u2019s urgent that we build alliances, not rip each other apart. That we march with love, not shout or blockade with hate. This past week, on Rosh Hashanah, at my Brooklyn synagogue Congregation Beth Elohim, our senior rabbi, Rabbi Rachel Timoner gave a sermon to several thousand congregants (including at least one leading US political leader) and received a standing ovation. She said: \u201cWe are Jews who stand with the Israelis in the streets; who stand with the hostages; who count ourselves with the brave peace activists who do not give up, who continue to fight for a future where all human beings count. We are Jews who will find our way to those difficult conversations with our neighbors on antisemitism, and will rebuild relationships and make new ones, because we know that we cannot go it alone.\u201d (Our synagogue was desecrated with red paint and slogans after 7 October and our neighborhood is an epicenter of ongoing protests against Israel).</p> <p>None of us can go it alone. But there must be a coming to terms with our shared humanity. We need to seek practical ways to promote a constructive US policy moving forward that effectively spirals the region toward sustainable peace and human rights for all. It means creating a movement of urgency, compassion and practicality. That would be an impactful way to commemorate 7 October.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jo-Ann Mort is co-author of Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today\u2019s Israel?

Those are the results of the latest Guardian Essential poll of 1,139 voters, which also found that half the electorate (50%) is in favour of reducing \u201ctax breaks like negative gearing for property investors\u201d. With Labor\u2019s Help to Buy shared equity scheme set to return to parliament this week, the poll results appear to be a boost for the Greens, who have delayed that bill to call for a cap on rent increases and reforms to negative gearing and the capital gains tax concession. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In the poll, respondents were concerned about their ability to pay for groceries and essentials (67%), energy (65%), health (61%) and housing (59%). Education (53%) and transport (51%) were still of concern to more than half of voters. Last week the Albanese government made a series of announcements on grocery prices including more money for the competition watchdog and tighter rules on pricing to crack down on \u201cshrinkflation\u201d. Less than half (48%) of respondents said the government could have a \u201clarge impact\u201d on the price of \u201cgroceries and essentials\u201d, although this rose to 59% among respondents who described themselves as either \u201cstruggling a bit\u201d or \u201cin serious difficulty\u201d financially. Just over half (52%) said the government could have a \u201clarge impact\u201d on housing. Voters were asked if they supported a series of economic reforms. A majority supported price caps (70%); increasing taxes paid by large corporations (70%); reducing income taxes (65%); funding more social services (61%); running budget surpluses to reduce inflation (60%); and raising the level of income support for the unemployed (53%). In December 2022 the Albanese government temporarily capped coal and gas prices, but has repeatedly refused Greens\u2019 demands for a cap on rents, arguing it would harm supply. The poll was conducted after a fortnight of Anthony Albanese and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, being asked about the treasury conducting modelling on possible changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. Half of respondents supported reducing \u201ctax breaks like negative gearing for property investors\u201d, with just 16% opposed and 33% neither supporting nor opposing. Price caps found support across the political spectrum, with 70% or more support from backers of all parties. But negative gearing was more polarising with majority support among those voting Labor (56%), Greens (58%) or for minor parties or independents (53%), but less than majority support among Coalition voters (46%). The poll asked voters if their financial circumstances were: \u201ccomfortable\u201d, enough to pay bills, save and buy luxuries; \u201csecure\u201d, to pay bills and have some money spare; \u201cstruggling a bit\u201d, meaning they need to budget; or \u201cin serious difficulty\u201d meaning \u201cbeing able to pay all the bills is a regular concern\u201d. Of those describing themselves as \u201ccomfortable\u201d or \u201csecure\u201d, the poll found 42% support the Coalition, 34% Labor, 8% the Greens, 12% for minor parties or independents and 2% \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. In two-party preferred terms that group was 51% for the Coalition and 47% for Labor. Of those who were \u201cstruggling a bit\u201d or \u201cin serious difficulty\u201d 30% support Labor, 26% Coalition, 15% Greens, 22% for minor parties and independents, and 7% did not know. In two-party preferred terms that group was 51% for Labor and 43% for the Coalition. Asked about electric vehicles, 62% of respondents said they don\u2019t own one and don\u2019t intend to buy one, about a third (32%) said they don\u2019t currently own one but intend to buy one within five years and 6% already owned an EV. When told that \u201cthose with a petrol car pay tax on the fuel they buy but there is no similar tax for those who drive EVs\u201d, 40% supported a road user tax on EV cars per kilometre driven, with 27% opposed. Most respondents (71%) said the gap between rich and poor Australians is increasing, compared with about a quarter (27%) who said it is staying the same and just 2% who said it is decreasing. In a forced-choice question, a majority (51%) of respondents agreed with the view that \u201cwhen the economy is growing there is a need for significant government intervention to ensure that economic growth is redistributed fairly\u201d. By contrast, 29% agreed with the view that \u201cwhen the economy is growing the benefits flow through to everyone and there is little need for government intervention\u201d. A further 20% were undecided. The poll found that just 12% of respondents said the political system is \u201cworking well\u201d, about half (48%) believe it \u201cneeds reform but is fundamentally sound\u201d although many (40%) want \u201cfundamental change\u201d.

      "bodyText": "An Australian health worker who is helping to manage emergency care in Gaza is blunt when asked what her fellow Australians need to know about the situation in the besieged territory after a year of war. \u201cThat it is worse than you can imagine,\u201d Sally Stevenson tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThe destruction is everywhere, as far as the eye can see, it is in the air we breathe. There is no safe place in Gaza. For anyone, especially children.\u201d Stevenson, the executive director of the Illawarra Women\u2019s Health Centre, arrived in Gaza three weeks ago on assignment with the medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). She is based in Gaza\u2019s al-Mawasi region, which Israel has designated as a safe space. Stevenson describes the area as \u201cthe so-called humanitarian zone\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Stevenson explains that more than 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.1 million have been displaced in the war, many of them multiple times, while 50% of MSF\u2019s staff live in tents. Because of these \u201crelentless forced movements\u201d, she says the humanitarian zone measuring 41 sq km is home to 1.2 million displaced people. She says 30,000 people live in one square kilometre, \u201cin the most rudimentary temporary shelters\u201d. These shelters are \u201cmade with whatever is available, some plastic sheeting, torn pieces of cloth, cardboard\u201d. \u201cThere is no water or sewerage system. There are no toilets,\u201d Stevenson says. \u201cPeople just like you and me are now living in the dirt or sand, with no food or water security \u2026 no education for their children, and very limited access to medical care due to a decimated health system.\u201d As an emergency coordinator, Stevenson is responsible for supporting MSF\u2019s medical and logistics teams and ensuring \u201cwe are reaching the most vulnerable patients with the highest needs\u201d. But she says the \u201cunhygienic and appalling living conditions\u201d are directly affecting people\u2019s health, with MSF teams seeing an increase in diarrhoea and skin diseases. \u201cAs winter approaches, we are seeing a distressing increase in upper respiratory tract infections, which we know will only get worse,\u201d she says. \u201cMore than 500,000 women of reproductive age lack access to essential services including antenatal care, postnatal care and family planning. Over 1 million children are now in need of mental health and psychosocial support and will probably carry the trauma of the war for many years.\u201d Monday marked the first anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage \u2013 about 100 of whom remain unaccounted for. At least 41,909 Palestinians have been killed and 97,303 wounded in Gaza since Israel launched its military response to the 7 October attacks, the territory\u2019s health authorities said on Monday, with thousands more likely lost in the rubble. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told the UN last month that the death toll in Gaza included more than 11,000 children, and that the territory was the deadliest place on Earth to be an aid worker. Wong said on Monday the 7 October anniversary was a time \u201cto remember the horror of Hamas\u2019 terror attack\u201d and that the loss of civilian life in the conflict was \u201cdevastating\u201d. She added: \u201cThe need for peace has never been greater.\u201d The Israeli government states it is targeting Hamas, not Palestinian civilians, but that Hamas embeds itself among civilians and civilian infrastructure. Israel has also rejected allegations of genocide as \u201cfalse and outrageous\u201d. Stevenson has found it heartbreaking to witness \u201cthe utter inhumanity of this war\u201d but she also wishes to acknowledge \u201cthe humanity, compassion, generosity, professionalism and dignity of the Palestinian people\u201d. She says MSF opened two field hospitals in Deir al-Balah \u201cas the health system in Gaza has been effectively dismantled by the Israeli forces after one year of war\u201d. \u201cThe hardest part is seeing the loss of hope \u2013 the destruction of homes, olive trees and memories, history and identity; the strikes killing children and erasing whole family lines.\u201d Stevenson is firm in her conviction that there must be an immediate and sustained ceasefire. \u201cAnd Australians, if we are to be true to our own humanity, must do everything we can to make this happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Three metres below ground in a newly developed square in Shoreditch, east London, is a short expanse of brickwork that is both unique and utterly magical. These low brick walls, measuring 14 metres by five, are the foundations of the stage of the Curtain theatre, where William Shakespeare\u2019s company of actors were based between 1597 and 1599. It was on this stage that Romeo and Juliet and Henry V are believed to have first been performed. And next year, with the opening of a Museum of Shakespeare on the site, visitors will be able to stand \u2013 perhaps even to act \u2013 on the very same spot, thanks to a glass floor suspended over one of the most important and resonant spaces in theatrical history. Shakespeare was associated with several London playhouses during his career, including the Theatre, nearby in Shoreditch, and the Globe, across the Thames in Bankside; the remains of these and other Tudor theatres have been excavated in recent years. Nowhere else, however, can visitors stand on the footprint of the actual stage where Shakespeare performed \u2013 the current Globe is a modern reconstruction some distance from the original theatre \u2013 or see the original Elizabethan floor surface on which he and his fellow players stood in the wings waiting to go on. Heather Knight, who led excavations on the site for Museum of London Archaeology, also worked on several other theatrical sites in London, but said the Curtain was special because of its state of preservation and the way its discovery in 2011 changed theatrical history. \u201cIt was described as a complete gamechanging moment, but the more we travel in time from that statement, the more of a gamechanger it\u2019s becoming.\u201d That\u2019s because, even after she first unearthed the stage\u2019s footings, Knight and everyone else believed the Curtain had been circular, like the Globe. As she would later discover, it was actually rectangular. \u201cThere was a received narrative that proper playhouses start off round and then just get bigger, with the pinnacle of that evolution being the Globe,\u201d said Knight. \u201cAnd all of a sudden we\u2019ve got this early, yet long-lived, rectangular structure. It\u2019s like \u2013 hold on, what\u2019s going on here? \u201cThis has changed our understanding of theatre development.\u201d It also forced a swift change of plans for the overall development, called the Stage; the initial scheme by the architects Perkins &amp; Will involved turning a jumble of Victorian warehouses into seven new residential and office buildings and a public plaza, incorporating a circular underground structure. Finding a rectangular building prompted a rethink above and below ground. \u201cAs the excavation went on, we gradually recognised the importance of the site,\u201d said Adam Yang, the project manager for the architects. \u201cBecause the archaeological footprint became bigger and bigger, the museum design became more and more important.\u201d Their solution is a low, steel and glass building, which leads down to an idiosyncratic subterranean space showcasing the stage ruins, and with space for other exhibitions and potentially, performance. The new museum, by \u201cexperience designers\u201d Bompas and Parr, is scheduled to open at the end of 2025, and will be themed around a day in the life of the playwright, according to the director, Sam Bompas. \u201cI love the fact that your heartbeat quickens in that space,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the feeling that we want to give all visitors, amplified dramatically.\u201d Decisions on whether the attraction would only be accessible with a fee had yet to be confirmed, he said, though the stage ruins are visible to passers-by at street level through a viewing window designed for the purpose. To Knight, the most intriguing question is how the design of the Curtain, with under-stage tunnel and multiple entrances, may have affected the work performed there. \u201cDoes this stage shape actually lend itself to battles?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe seem to have the \u2018fightier\u2019 plays in rectangular buildings\u201d. \u201cWhen you think about Romeo and Juliet, essentially, it\u2019s not the greatest love story ever,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a series of fight scenes linked by dialogue.\u201d That said, within the foundations, she also discovered post holes that would have supported an onstage balcony.

      "body": "<p>Group C of the third round of Asia\u2019s World Cup qualification looked tricky when it was made \u2013 but for Australia, tricky is turning tough. One point from games against Bahrain and Indonesia was not part of the script, which became more dramatic with the subsequent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/20/graham-arnold-socceroos-coach-quits-resignation\">resignation of Graham Arnold</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/23/tony-popovic-new-socceroos-coach-graham-arnold-replacement\">the appointment of Tony Popovic</a>. His first game is against China in Adelaide on Thursday \u2013 a must-win given the disastrous start and a trip to group leaders Japan five days later.</p> <p>On the plus side, Popovic knows how to get results in Asia, as he demonstrated during Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 run to Asian Champions League glory in 2014. Perhaps the best result that season was the semi-final victory over Chinese powerhouse and title-holders Guangzhou Evergrande, back when Chinese football was making waves around the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/02/graham-arnold-afc-coach-of-year-shortlist-international-player-cortnee-vine-ellie-carpenter\">Graham Arnold on AFC coach of year shortlist, Matildas pair also up for Asian awards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, though, the old \u201cChina crisis\u201d cliches are back. The injury-hit national team arrive in South Australia with confidence as low as their sixth place position in the six-team group. After being on the end of a 7-0 thrashing by Japan and then a home defeat to Saudi Arabia, the Reds are still looking for a first point and some pride. Since the World Cup was expanded and Asia got eight places, the likes of China can make it to the tournament in north America. A third straight defeat in three third-round games, however, would not only put their theoretical hopes of a top-two finish and automatic qualification officially off the menu, but also call into question finishing third or fourth.</p> <p>Expectations are not high. \u201cWe are not going to make the World Cup,\u201d said one Chinese FA official. \u201cThis qualification round is our World Cup.\u201d Such sentiments are understandable even without September\u2019s stinging defeats. Team Dragon only made it this far due to the heroics of Hassan Sunny. The Singapore goalkeeper made a number of fine saves, 11 in total, against Thailand in the final game of the second round to prevent the Thais from finishing above China . When he is not stopping shots, the 40 year-old is boiling pots of noodles in a restaurant that was suddenly receiving great reviews from fans in China and visits from tourists.</p> <p>A similar hero may be needed this time around. Fans are still waiting for China coach Branko Ivankovi\u0107 to make a difference. The Croatian, appointed in February, led Oman in qualification for 2022 when they finished just a point behind Australia, with the highlight being a win in Japan. He also defeated the Samurai Blue as boss of Iran in qualification for the 2006 World Cup. Did he, wondered the usually gloomy Chinese media as the third round started, have Japan\u2019s number?</p> <p>No. The disaster in Saitama was China\u2019s second heaviest loss of all time and, coming against their bitter rival, their most humiliating. The Reds just could not cope with Japan\u2019s movement and passing. The 2-1 defeat to Saudi Arabia in Dalian was just as painful. An own goal gave China a 14th minute lead and the roars grew louder five minutes later as Mohamed Kanno was shown red. A goal up and a man up with most of the game remaining, 50,000 fans settled back to enjoy a much-needed victory.

      "bodyText": "Group C of the third round of Asia\u2019s World Cup qualification looked tricky when it was made \u2013 but for Australia, tricky is turning tough. One point from games against Bahrain and Indonesia was not part of the script, which became more dramatic with the subsequent resignation of Graham Arnold and the appointment of Tony Popovic. His first game is against China in Adelaide on Thursday \u2013 a must-win given the disastrous start and a trip to group leaders Japan five days later. On the plus side, Popovic knows how to get results in Asia, as he demonstrated during Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 run to Asian Champions League glory in 2014. Perhaps the best result that season was the semi-final victory over Chinese powerhouse and title-holders Guangzhou Evergrande, back when Chinese football was making waves around the world. Now, though, the old \u201cChina crisis\u201d cliches are back. The injury-hit national team arrive in South Australia with confidence as low as their sixth place position in the six-team group. After being on the end of a 7-0 thrashing by Japan and then a home defeat to Saudi Arabia, the Reds are still looking for a first point and some pride. Since the World Cup was expanded and Asia got eight places, the likes of China can make it to the tournament in north America. A third straight defeat in three third-round games, however, would not only put their theoretical hopes of a top-two finish and automatic qualification officially off the menu, but also call into question finishing third or fourth. Expectations are not high. \u201cWe are not going to make the World Cup,\u201d said one Chinese FA official. \u201cThis qualification round is our World Cup.\u201d Such sentiments are understandable even without September\u2019s stinging defeats. Team Dragon only made it this far due to the heroics of Hassan Sunny. The Singapore goalkeeper made a number of fine saves, 11 in total, against Thailand in the final game of the second round to prevent the Thais from finishing above China . When he is not stopping shots, the 40 year-old is boiling pots of noodles in a restaurant that was suddenly receiving great reviews from fans in China and visits from tourists. A similar hero may be needed this time around. Fans are still waiting for China coach Branko Ivankovi\u0107 to make a difference. The Croatian, appointed in February, led Oman in qualification for 2022 when they finished just a point behind Australia, with the highlight being a win in Japan. He also defeated the Samurai Blue as boss of Iran in qualification for the 2006 World Cup. Did he, wondered the usually gloomy Chinese media as the third round started, have Japan\u2019s number? No. The disaster in Saitama was China\u2019s second heaviest loss of all time and, coming against their bitter rival, their most humiliating. The Reds just could not cope with Japan\u2019s movement and passing. The 2-1 defeat to Saudi Arabia in Dalian was just as painful. An own goal gave China a 14th minute lead and the roars grew louder five minutes later as Mohamed Kanno was shown red. A goal up and a man up with most of the game remaining, 50,000 fans settled back to enjoy a much-needed victory. Yet, somehow, Hassan Kadesh, a player who had never scored before, found the back of the net twice \u2013 the second in the last minute \u2013 to give the Saudis a crucial win. At the end, fans in the stadium and on social media called for Ivankovi\u0107\u2019s head, blaming him for poor marking at corners, ineffectual and late substitutions, and an inability to make the extra man count. It was only when he was seen watching domestic games recently that it became clear he was still in the job. Defeat in Adelaide won\u2019t result in the axe falling but that may change if it is followed by a failure to beat Indonesia on home soil next week on home soil. If Ivankovi\u0107 could be near the end, then, as he starts out Popovic will have taken great heart from the fact that both Saudi Arabian goals came from set pieces. With the visitors set to sit back in Adelaide, the recent lack of defensive organisation could be key. Up front, there has been just one own goal in two games and there\u2019s worse news: star attacker Wu Lei, who has played in La Liga with Espanyol and is, by some distance, the top scorer of the Chinese Super League and a talisman for Kevin Muscat at Shanghai Port, is injured.

      "body": "<p>I live in central Tel Aviv, and walking around my neighbourhood I see packed cafes, restaurants and wine bars. Israel\u2019s longest and toughest war is being fought several dozens of miles away, but our \u201cnon-stop city\u201d has not altered its lifestyle. Last Tuesday at dusk, as news reports warned of the coming Iranian missile attack, the beach was full of surfers. But partying cannot hide the war from our minds. It is present everywhere in fading pictures of the Israeli hostages left behind in Hamas dungeons.</p> <p>On the lamp post down the street, I look at the image of Eden Yerushalmi, a 24-year-old Tel Avivian kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova music festival on the fateful 7 October. Her pictures are all over town, featuring her last words: \u201cYou will find me, right?\u201d But we didn\u2019t. Starved and tortured, Yerushalmi was murdered by her captors, with five other hostages, in late August in a tunnel in Rafah. Their horrible death was a stark reminder of Israel\u2019s worst ever, continuing defeat.</p> <p>Rather than uniting the country around saving lives, as in the past, the hostages\u2019 fate became just another battleground in our polarised, fractured society. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, would not accept what Hamas has demanded for releasing the remaining 101 hostages, <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/world/netanyahu-says-half-of-hostages-in-gaza-are-still-alive-awfvhfc4\">half of them</a> presumed alive. He will not stop the war, nor release incarcerated Palestinians, including the masterminds of deadly terrorist attacks, to bring home the Israelis held by Hamas. His government prefers to occupy Gaza and pave the way for Jewish resettlement there.</p> <p>To Israel\u2019s Jewish liberals, Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to \u201cbring them home now\u201d is another incarnation of his lifelong mission to \u201creplace the elites\u201d, whom he views as too cosmopolitan and condescending towards his base of socially conservative, ultra-Orthodox and ultra-nationalist Jews. Last year, after a second comeback to power at the head of a fervent rightwing coalition, Netanyahu launched a campaign to turn Israel into a theocratic, authoritarian state.</p> <p>The battered liberals fought back.

      "bodyText": "I live in central Tel Aviv, and walking around my neighbourhood I see packed cafes, restaurants and wine bars. Israel\u2019s longest and toughest war is being fought several dozens of miles away, but our \u201cnon-stop city\u201d has not altered its lifestyle. Last Tuesday at dusk, as news reports warned of the coming Iranian missile attack, the beach was full of surfers. But partying cannot hide the war from our minds. It is present everywhere in fading pictures of the Israeli hostages left behind in Hamas dungeons. On the lamp post down the street, I look at the image of Eden Yerushalmi, a 24-year-old Tel Avivian kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova music festival on the fateful 7 October. Her pictures are all over town, featuring her last words: \u201cYou will find me, right?\u201d But we didn\u2019t. Starved and tortured, Yerushalmi was murdered by her captors, with five other hostages, in late August in a tunnel in Rafah. Their horrible death was a stark reminder of Israel\u2019s worst ever, continuing defeat. Rather than uniting the country around saving lives, as in the past, the hostages\u2019 fate became just another battleground in our polarised, fractured society. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, would not accept what Hamas has demanded for releasing the remaining 101 hostages, half of them presumed alive. He will not stop the war, nor release incarcerated Palestinians, including the masterminds of deadly terrorist attacks, to bring home the Israelis held by Hamas. His government prefers to occupy Gaza and pave the way for Jewish resettlement there. To Israel\u2019s Jewish liberals, Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to \u201cbring them home now\u201d is another incarnation of his lifelong mission to \u201creplace the elites\u201d, whom he views as too cosmopolitan and condescending towards his base of socially conservative, ultra-Orthodox and ultra-nationalist Jews. Last year, after a second comeback to power at the head of a fervent rightwing coalition, Netanyahu launched a campaign to turn Israel into a theocratic, authoritarian state. The battered liberals fought back. Scores of protesters chanted \u201cdemocracy\u201d and vowed to defend the independent judiciary, the source of civil rights in a country with no constitution or common ethos. But unlike pro-democracy movements elsewhere, ours had a militaristic tone: many of its leaders and public speakers showed off their military experience and rank, to prove their loyalty to the state, and the protesters\u2019 ace card was the threat of reservist fighter pilots not to fly under a dictatorship. It all recalled the Israel of my childhood after the 1967 six-day war, when fighter pilots and decorated soldiers were the epitome of the elite. And the movement deliberately ignored the elephant in the room that was created by that 1967 victory \u2013 the occupation of millions of Palestinians \u2013 lest the Kaplan Street marchers be smeared by Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cpoison machine\u201d as unpatriotic. Then came 7 October, and the overlooked conflict exploded in our faces: the total surprise by Hamas, the slaughtering and raping and looting and kidnapping in the communities around Gaza, followed by the brutal Israeli counter-offensive. Netanyahu denied any responsibility for the country\u2019s worst tragedy yet. Overcoming its initial shock, his coalition resumed its zeal to crush civil freedoms at home and grab Palestinian land in the occupied territories. The anti-Bibists faced a conundrum. Overwhelmed by the grief and horrors of 7 October, replayed constantly in Israel\u2019s media, they strongly supported the war against Hamas and its latest escalation with Hezbollah and Iran. The series of blows to Israel\u2019s foe in Lebanon, culminating in the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, elicited joy and pride across the political aisle. Our pilots and intelligence were winning, less than a year after their worst debacle. But the popular war cannot overshadow the deeper sense that our government is still going after us, leading the country to disaster and using the external pretext to win the culture war at home. And it exacerbates the painful disillusionment over the antebellum mentality of living a western-style life in the liberal Tel Aviv enclave, as if the Palestinian-Israeli conflict didn\u2019t exist.

Some decided to leave: professors extending their sabbatical leaves, affluent families taking \u201ca year off and then we\u2019ll see\u201d and young digital nomads, flocking to the new Israeli havens of Greece, Portugal and Thailand.

Perhaps the only thing MPs can agree on is that the last three weeks, which Pesutto has spent in court defending himself in a defamation trial launched by Deeming, have done irreparable harm. For four days, Pesutto was cross-examined by Deeming\u2019s barrister. His deputy, David Southwick, and the party\u2019s upper house leader, Georgie Crozier, also took the stand, while Liberal MPs Renee Heath, Richard Riordan, and Kim Wells testified on behalf of Deeming.

The evidence may not have captured the attention of many Victorian voters but it has done enough to anger MPs from both the conservative and moderate factions of the party. Pesutto, for his part, has repeatedly said he exhausted every effort to settle. Since March, when there were also rumblings of a leadership challenge, Liberal MPs have said support is largely split between Battin and Nepean MP, Sam Groth, a former professional tennis player.

      "body": "<p>In the late afternoon on 7 October, an Israeli software engineer in his mid-30s found himself driving down a deserted road parallel to the perimeter fence that separated Gaza from Israel. He had been fighting for hours with an AK-47 taken from a dead Hamas militant. Now he and three friends were headed to the town of Ohad to search for relatives who had gone missing.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnly when we set off south did we understand how big this was. It was like an apocalypse,\u201d the engineer, who did not want to be named, said last week. \u201cThere were hundreds of bodies of civilians inside their cars or on the road, hundreds of dead terrorists with their pickup trucks or motorbikes. There were dead police, army vehicles on fire. We were alone.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was among scores, possibly hundreds, of Israelis who headed independently to the combat zone around Gaza on the morning of the raid launched by Hamas on 7 October last year. Many were lauded as heroes by their compatriots, but that they were needed at all underlined the deep failures of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that, a year on, remain part of the traumatic legacy of the attack for millions of Israelis.</p> \n<p>The continuing recriminations are part of a bitter broader argument over who to blame for the biggest security failure in Israel since the foundation of the country in 1948. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has avoided accepting responsibility, though several senior military and intelligence officials have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/head-of-israeli-spy-agency-unit-8200-resigns-over-7-october-failings\">resigned or admitted their errors</a>.</p> \n<p>In all, about 1,200 were killed in the raid launched by Hamas. Most of the dead were civilians, many murdered in their homes or at a music festival. Victims included children and elderly people. <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session56/a-hrc-56-crp-3.pdf\">A UN inquiry</a> found reasonable grounds to believe that attackers committed sexual violence at several locations, including rape and gang-rape. Hamas militants, and other extremists from Gaza who followed them, also seized about 250 hostages, of which approximately 100 remain in the territory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were told that the first line of defence is Hamas, because they\u2019ve got too much to lose now by an attack</p> \n  <footer> <cite>Reservist combat medic</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Since the attack, Israel media has picked over what went wrong. A picture has emerged of top commanders caught between their growing concern <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/more-details-unveiled-of-idf-intel-on-oct-7-plans-consults-hours-before-hamas-attack/\">after warnings of a possible mass attack into southern Israel from Gaza</a>, and the prevailing belief among senior officers and the top political leadership that Hamas had been deterred by repeated bouts of conflict. Many officials were convinced that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-cash-to-crypto-global-finance-maze-israels-sights-2023-10-16/\">huge sums of direct aid sent into Gaza from Qatar</a> and other economic incentives such as permits for Palestinian labourers to work in Israel had also convinced Hamas, which had been in power since 2007, to forgo violence in at least the short term. At a counter-terrorism conference months before the attack, David Barnea, head of the Mossad, Israeli\u2019s main foreign intelligence service, did not mention Hamas in a speech about potential threats to the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were complacent and lazy and suffered a sort of groupthink and we are going to pay a huge price for that,\u201d one military intelligence officer, a specialist in Gaza, told the Guardian shortly after the 7 October attack.</p> \n<p>A second big problem was the faith placed in the supposedly impregnable billion-dollar fence built around the territory.</p> \n<p>Reservist officers who had served several tours around Gaza were shocked by a new attitude among IDF officers in the year before the attacks.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere were vehicles that simply didn\u2019t run, equipment that didn\u2019t work, patrols that didn\u2019t happen because there was no threat. When we asked how we were meant to fight back if there was a big attack, they told us \u2026 it just wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d a reservist combat medic said last month.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were told that the first line of defence is Hamas, because they\u2019ve got too much to lose now by an attack and will themselves restrain their own people, and anyway then there\u2019s the fence, which no one can get through. I actually argued with my senior officers over this but it went nowhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>Just days before the attack, a series of mistakes were made. Concerned local military commanders ordered assessments, which reported intense training by elite Hamas fighters, but failed to act. When dozens, possibly hundreds, of Israeli sim cards suddenly were connected to Israeli networks in the early hours of 7 October, Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security service, sent only a small team to the border. At <a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/02/28/revealed-the-idf-chiefs-key-decision-at-4-a-m-after-unusual-intelligence-alarmed-officials/\">a hastily convened meeting</a> at about 3.30am on 7 October, senior IDF officers remained unsure if the unusual Hamas activity in Gaza was a training exercise or preparation for an attack.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"630298b1-f19a-4408-bfa3-d99a7009e3f4\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i><b>The 'concept'</b></i></p>\n    <p>Many in Israel talk about the \u201cconcept\u201d \u2013 a collective idea that Hamas had been deterred or pacified through repeated rounds of conflict and economic incentives. The word is a reference to a similar mass misjudgement among decison-makers before the 1973 war against Egypt and Syria. Like then, it suggests complacency and hubris at the very highest levels of state. It also fitted a broader Israeli policy of refusing any political concessions, such as allowing progress towards a Palestinian state, and a strategy of exacerbating division in Palestinian politics. The concept contributed to the failure to anticipate and so prepare for a major attack by Hamas, Israeli commentators have repeatedly said.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i><b>An overreliance on technology</b></i></p>\n    <p>The most obvious technological defence against attack was the billion-dollar fence, complete with sniper towers and surveillance systems, built around Gaza. This was thought to be completely impregnable. But another big problem was a reliance on surveillance and communications interception to monitor Hamas and allied groups in the territory. Without human informants in Gaza, Israel\u2019s intelligence-gathering efforts were inadequate. Those resources that were deployed were focused closely on stopping Hamas rocket attacks into Israel. Much greater attention was paid to infiltrating Hezbollah, the Islamist militant organisation based in Lebanon, which was seen as the greater threat.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i><b>Warnings missed or ignored</b></i></p>\n    <p>Evidence of attack planning that did reach Israel\u2019s services was misinterpreted or ignored. In 2022, Israel got hold of a Hamas plan for a major attack through the fence, codenamed Jericho Wall. Despite its significance, the plan was filed away because officials believed the group was incapable of such an operation.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Last summer, there were warnings that Hamas had completed a series of training exercises simulating a raid on kibbutzim and IDF outposts on the Israeli side of the border. One intelligence report described intensive training among Hamas\u2019s elite Nukhba fighters, including mounting a mass attack on military positions and taking prisoners.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>On 6 October, some observers told senior officers about individual Hamas commanders who seemed to be preparing something. As before, the suspicious activities were dismissed as \u201croutine\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>The smokescreen</b></p>\n    <p>The Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, took exceptional measures to preserve the security of the 7 October operation, telling almost no one what was planned. But he also threw up a smokescreen, lulling Israel into false security with public statements that could mislead, sometimes by coming close to telling the truth.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In 2022, Hamas produced <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/life/television/2024-01-03/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-hamas-produced-tv-series-that-may-have-revealed-october-7-plans/0000018c-c5b4-ddba-abad-c7b568710000\">a TV series called Fist of the Free</a>, which depicted its militants raiding Israel en masse. Sinwar gave out prizes to all those involved at a public ceremony, praising in a speech the accuracy of the series and saying that that their work was \u201can integral part of what we\u2019re preparing\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But though public anger at intelligence services has been great, some of the most bitter reproaches have been levelled at the IDF itself for failing to mobilise faster to defend communities. Though some regular military units, the police and other services did deploy in the first hours of the 7 October attack, it was often small groups of reservists who had grabbed uniforms or weapons at home who joined the battle, sometimes playing decisive roles.</p> \n<p>Nimrod Palmach, a reservist major and the chief executive of an Israeli NGO, defied orders to join his special forces unit in Jerusalem and drove south after hearing that \u201cthousands of terrorists\u201d were in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, where 46 of about 400 residents were killed by militants going from house to house and 72 were abducted, according to the UN.</p> \n<p>\u201cI just took a handgun and went as far as I could. I realised that every moment, people were being killed. I left a video testament on my phone for my kids so it could be found if I was killed myself,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Armed with an assault rifle taken from a dead Hamas militant, Palmach took body armour from a dead soldier and fought for hours alongside other reservists and small groups of regular soldiers around the kibbutz of Be\u2019eri, where, according to the UN report, 105 residents of the kibbutz were killed by the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allied group, as well as armed civilians from Gaza.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the beginning it was just us and special forces who were coming from their homes but as the day went by more and more sporadic [regular IDF] forces arrived. By late afternoon, the full IDF came, in full gear, combat battalions. A lot of good fighters were waiting for directions and orders which never came,\u201d Palmach said.</p> \n<p>One reason for the slow response was that the IDF\u2019s forces around Gaza were fighting for their lives through the critical first hours of the Hamas attack when most casualties were inflicted. Defenders were not at full strength because of the holiday weekend \u2013 the Jewish festival of Simchat Torah \u2013 and only a few hundred soldiers were scattered in small detachments around the perimeter fence.

      "bodyText": "In the late afternoon on 7 October, an Israeli software engineer in his mid-30s found himself driving down a deserted road parallel to the perimeter fence that separated Gaza from Israel. He had been fighting for hours with an AK-47 taken from a dead Hamas militant. Now he and three friends were headed to the town of Ohad to search for relatives who had gone missing. \u201cOnly when we set off south did we understand how big this was. It was like an apocalypse,\u201d the engineer, who did not want to be named, said last week. \u201cThere were hundreds of bodies of civilians inside their cars or on the road, hundreds of dead terrorists with their pickup trucks or motorbikes. There were dead police, army vehicles on fire. We were alone.\u201d He was among scores, possibly hundreds, of Israelis who headed independently to the combat zone around Gaza on the morning of the raid launched by Hamas on 7 October last year. Many were lauded as heroes by their compatriots, but that they were needed at all underlined the deep failures of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that, a year on, remain part of the traumatic legacy of the attack for millions of Israelis. The continuing recriminations are part of a bitter broader argument over who to blame for the biggest security failure in Israel since the foundation of the country in 1948. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, has avoided accepting responsibility, though several senior military and intelligence officials have resigned or admitted their errors. In all, about 1,200 were killed in the raid launched by Hamas. Most of the dead were civilians, many murdered in their homes or at a music festival. Victims included children and elderly people. A UN inquiry found reasonable grounds to believe that attackers committed sexual violence at several locations, including rape and gang-rape. Hamas militants, and other extremists from Gaza who followed them, also seized about 250 hostages, of which approximately 100 remain in the territory. Since the attack, Israel media has picked over what went wrong. A picture has emerged of top commanders caught between their growing concern after warnings of a possible mass attack into southern Israel from Gaza, and the prevailing belief among senior officers and the top political leadership that Hamas had been deterred by repeated bouts of conflict. Many officials were convinced that huge sums of direct aid sent into Gaza from Qatar and other economic incentives such as permits for Palestinian labourers to work in Israel had also convinced Hamas, which had been in power since 2007, to forgo violence in at least the short term. At a counter-terrorism conference months before the attack, David Barnea, head of the Mossad, Israeli\u2019s main foreign intelligence service, did not mention Hamas in a speech about potential threats to the country. \u201cWe were complacent and lazy and suffered a sort of groupthink and we are going to pay a huge price for that,\u201d one military intelligence officer, a specialist in Gaza, told the Guardian shortly after the 7 October attack. A second big problem was the faith placed in the supposedly impregnable billion-dollar fence built around the territory. Reservist officers who had served several tours around Gaza were shocked by a new attitude among IDF officers in the year before the attacks. \u201cThere were vehicles that simply didn\u2019t run, equipment that didn\u2019t work, patrols that didn\u2019t happen because there was no threat. When we asked how we were meant to fight back if there was a big attack, they told us \u2026 it just wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d a reservist combat medic said last month. \u201cWe were told that the first line of defence is Hamas, because they\u2019ve got too much to lose now by an attack and will themselves restrain their own people, and anyway then there\u2019s the fence, which no one can get through. I actually argued with my senior officers over this but it went nowhere.\u201d Just days before the attack, a series of mistakes were made. Concerned local military commanders ordered assessments, which reported intense training by elite Hamas fighters, but failed to act. When dozens, possibly hundreds, of Israeli sim cards suddenly were connected to Israeli networks in the early hours of 7 October, Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security service, sent only a small team to the border. At a hastily convened meeting at about 3.30am on 7 October, senior IDF officers remained unsure if the unusual Hamas activity in Gaza was a training exercise or preparation for an attack. But though public anger at intelligence services has been great, some of the most bitter reproaches have been levelled at the IDF itself for failing to mobilise faster to defend communities. Though some regular military units, the police and other services did deploy in the first hours of the 7 October attack, it was often small groups of reservists who had grabbed uniforms or weapons at home who joined the battle, sometimes playing decisive roles. Nimrod Palmach, a reservist major and the chief executive of an Israeli NGO, defied orders to join his special forces unit in Jerusalem and drove south after hearing that \u201cthousands of terrorists\u201d were in the kibbutz of Nir Oz, where 46 of about 400 residents were killed by militants going from house to house and 72 were abducted, according to the UN. \u201cI just took a handgun and went as far as I could. I realised that every moment, people were being killed. I left a video testament on my phone for my kids so it could be found if I was killed myself,\u201d he said. Armed with an assault rifle taken from a dead Hamas militant, Palmach took body armour from a dead soldier and fought for hours alongside other reservists and small groups of regular soldiers around the kibbutz of Be\u2019eri, where, according to the UN report, 105 residents of the kibbutz were killed by the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an allied group, as well as armed civilians from Gaza. \u201cAt the beginning it was just us and special forces who were coming from their homes but as the day went by more and more sporadic [regular IDF] forces arrived. By late afternoon, the full IDF came, in full gear, combat battalions. A lot of good fighters were waiting for directions and orders which never came,\u201d Palmach said. One reason for the slow response was that the IDF\u2019s forces around Gaza were fighting for their lives through the critical first hours of the Hamas attack when most casualties were inflicted. Defenders were not at full strength because of the holiday weekend \u2013 the Jewish festival of Simchat Torah \u2013 and only a few hundred soldiers were scattered in small detachments around the perimeter fence. Many were killed or abducted when their positions were overrun; others fought desperately for hours to avoid the same fate. A heavy assault on the main local headquarters at Re\u2019im, just a kilometre from the Nova festival, was nearly successful, which in part explains the apparent paralysis of local commanders and their superiors. Critical surveillance and communications gear was knocked out in the attack. \u201cThere was no central command so we didn\u2019t know what to do and where to go \u2026 There was no connection between the units,\u201d said a special forces soldier who was one of the first to reach the combat zone. \u201cWe were too few, and [when] we tried to get into the kibbutzim we were attacked by hundreds of Hamas men \u2013 we pulled back to wait for bigger forces.\u201d Several of those interviewed by the Guardian remembered how the situation began to stabilise late on 7 October, though fighting continued for more than 48 hours as remaining militants were found and killed.

As the initial shock wore off, they tried to understand the day\u2019s events. \u201cWe always trained to attack, to be aggressive \u2026 but it was the opposite,\u201d said the special forces soldier. \u201cI still [see] \u2026 the dead kids, burned bodies, the girls at the festival.\u201d As for the engineer, he has yet to make sense of what went wrong on 7 October 2023. \u201cI actually just really don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI keep thinking about it.

      "bodyText": "Name: Virginia Woolf Barbie. Age: About a decade old. Appearance: Prim, Victorian, hair in a bun. Any relation? To whom? To Virginia Woolf, the author of To the Lighthouse and A Room of One\u2019s Own. Well, yes, sort of. What do you mean, sort of? It\u2019s actually a Barbie doll, but one that looks like Virginia Woolf. You mean coincidentally? No, I think it was intentional: the doll was holding a tiny copy of Mrs Dalloway. They took the celebrated writer and proto-feminist Virginia Woolf and turned her into a dolly? Well, they didn\u2019t in the end. The American toy company Mattel proposed the Woolf doll some years ago, but the author\u2019s estate objected. I should think so. \u201cWe all agreed, over our dead bodies,\u201d said the social historian \u2013 and Woolf\u2019s great niece \u2013 Virginia Nicholson, speaking at the Cheltenham literature festival this weekend. Is Mattel in the habit of introducing somewhat counterintuitive Barbie editions? In a word, yes; some fall under its \u201cinspiring women\u201d banner, others are celebrity role models. Were any of them a worse idea than Virginia Woolf Barbie? While there is no exhaustive accounting of Barbie dolls that never made it past the planning phase, plenty of odd choices actually did get produced. Name one. There is, for example, such a thing as a Dr Maya Angelou Barbie. No there isn\u2019t. There is. Is it a good likeness? The doll retains Barbie\u2019s classic and highly improbable body proportions, but she\u2019s clutching an edition of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, so it\u2019s definitely her. Well I never. There have also been commemorative Barbies of Billie Jean King, Helen Keller, the investigative journalist and civil rights leader Ida B Wells, the British primatologist Dr Jane Goodall and Queen Camilla. I suppose they teach young girls that you can achieve great things while still being impossibly skinny. These days Barbies come in a range of body types, including curvy, tall and petite. But, yes, they\u2019re all still pretty thin. What\u2019s the most inappropriate celebrity Barbie out there? Mattel did once issue a pair of dolls modelled on Elvis and Priscilla Presley on their wedding day. Remind me: how old was Priscilla when she started dating Elvis? She was 14. I\u2019m starting to think a Virginia Woolf Barbie isn\u2019t such a terrible idea. Good news \u2013 if you manufacture it in the UK, you might not even need the estate\u2019s permission. Do say: \u201cWe\u2019ve got 600,000 new Barbie bodies ready to ship; just waiting to find out whether we\u2019re doing Kamala heads or Melania heads.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cShe\u2019s holding a tiny lettuce \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s Liz Truss.\u201d",

Enjoy the off season? Less than eight days after the end of the English cricket summer, the winter begins with the first Test against Pakistan in Multan. Ordinarily that would generate a certain ennui. But when a man is tired of Pakistan v England, he is tired of sport; for there is in Pakistan v England all that sport can afford.</p> <p>These series always give us something, from exhilarating cricket to pantomime controversy to surprise victories. Pakistan are in a bit of a mess, and were recently beaten 2-0 at home by Bangladesh, yet that often makes them more dangerous \u2013 especially now that Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah are back in the side. There are a few 2005-06 vibes about the build-up to this series. Pakistan low, England high; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2005%E2%80%9306\">final score: Pakistan 2-0 England</a>. And don\u2019t get me started <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_against_Pakistan_in_the_UAE_in_2011%E2%80%9312#\">on 2011-12</a>.</p> <p>A more obvious reference point is England\u2019s last tour of Pakistan, the remarkable 3-0 win in 2022 that elevated Ben Stokes to the ranks of truly great captains. He\u2019s unfit for this game, though he will be in the dressing-room as both the boss of the family and consigliere to Ollie Pope. </p> <p>In 2022 Stokes and England had to get blood out of a road to win. This time, by all accounts, the pitches could be much livelier. Rise and shine everyone!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-07T04:10:47.547Z\">at 5.10am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Simon Burnton\u2019s report from Multan is live, which means time\u2019s up and that\u2019s the end of the show. We\u2019ll be back at 5.30am tomorrow morning; see you then. England Women play South Africa this afternoon in a big game at the T20 World Cup. You can follow that with Adam Collins. England\u2019s spin-bowling coach Jeetan Patel talks to Sky Sports That was a day of solid toil. Pretty proud of the boys to put in the stint they did in the final session. You need energy from your teammates and the guys put in a helluva stint in the field. To have them six down would have been amazing, but taking three wickets in the last session really sets us up for the morning. [What\u2019s it being in the field on a day like that?] You go through every plan you\u2019ve got, every idea, but you keep getting overwhelmed by the weather and the heat. You have to dig deeper and deeper and deeper and I think the boys did that. The way Chris Woakes got Babar Azam was high-class bowling, moving one away and then bringing it back. But when you\u2019re that knackered, and your shirt is saturated, and you\u2019re dripping with sweat, it\u2019s a fine art. The pitch didn\u2019t spin as much as we thought it would. It\u2019s challenging because you have one eye on not giving them too many boundaries and the other eye on taking wickets. We kept catchers in but we also had sweepers, almost as a cuddle so that they could go about their work. We always talk about the scoreboard and putting two wickets on it. If we can put two on it \u2013 maybe three with the nightwatchman \u2013 and they\u2019re 350 for 7\u2026 We\u2019ll see what happens, you can\u2019t judge the pitch until both teams have batted on it. Abdullah Shafique, who made a classy 102, speaks to Sky Sports I\u2019m feeling happy because performing for your team is a next-level feeling. I tried to focus on the process (rather than the outcome). When a senior batter like Shan Masood is playing so well it helps me a lot, and it\u2019s a chance for me to learn by watching him as well. Thanks Tim, hello again. It\u2019s not often that 328 for 4 represents a reasonable day, but England will feel quite upbeat as they leave the field \u2013 especially as Babar Azam took the same walk off a few minutes earlier. 85th over: Pakistan 328-4 (Shakeel 35, Naseem Shah 0) Pope, who has looked more like a captain as the day has gone on, turns to Brydon Carse for the last over. That almost works too as there\u2019s an LBW shout against Shakeel, but there was bat involved. Shakeel retorts with a whip for four and that is that. England have done well to fight back from 260-1, but the day belongs to Shan Masood and Abdullah Shafique, the two centurions. And I have a plane to catch, so Rob is generously reappearing. Thanks for your company and correspondence. 84th over: Pakistan 324-4 (Shakeel 31, Naseem Shah 0) So the new ball does the trick, Babar\u2019s run of under-50 scores continues, and Woakes begins to repay the selectors\u2019 faith by taking his first Test wicket on Pakistan soil. When Naseem comes out as a nightwatchman, Woakes beats him twice outside off. Woakes digs deep, beats Babar outside off with a beauty, then raps him on the pad and persuades Kumar Dharmasena to raise the finger. Babar reviews but the three reds are all in a row. Where does Woakes think he is, Edgbaston? 84th over: Pakistan 324-3 (Babar 30, Shakeel 31) Babar drives Atkinson for three. Shakeel cuts hard and gets only a single, as Pope takes a painful blow on the hand but manages to take the pace off the ball. The TV director concentrates on the sunset, a fried egg writ large. 83rd over: Pakistan 319-3 (Babar 26, Shakeel 30) It\u2019s not Leach, it\u2019s Woakes. He finds enough movement away from the left handed Shakeel to draw a thick edge, but it never looked like going to hand. And Shakeel responds with a rasping cut for four. 82nd over: Pakistan 315-3 (Babar 26, Shakeel 26) Shakeel breaks the shackles! He drives Atkinson\u2019s first delivery for an effortless three, and then Babar follows suit with a four to bring up the fifty partnership \u2013 52 off 113 balls, a throwback to the old school. Atkinson rallies, finds some lift, tries a yorker, but Babar stands firm. The commentators remind us that, on England\u2019s last tour of Pakistan in 2022, Stokes gave the new ball to Leach. 81st over: Pakistan 308-3 (Babar 22, Shakeel 23) Another over of spin, another single for Saud Shakeel. And the new ball is being taken! 80th over: Pakistan 307-3 (Babar 22, Shakeel 22) Just a single off Leach\u2019s over too. Not only do both batters have 22, but they\u2019ve both taken 55 balls to get there. Could they both get hundreds? They could, though the new ball should have something to say. England may not take it tonight, given the weary limbs of the seamers \u2013 though this spell from the spinners suggests that Pope is keeping his options open. 79th over: Pakistan 306-3 (Babar 22, Shakeel 21) Just a single off Bashir\u2019s over. You know those moments when the game of cricket goes to sleep? This is one of them. \u201cSo, where has this Pakistan performance been hiding?!\u201d asks Em Jackson. \u201cThis is good stuff from them (although, as the clich\u00e9 goes, can you tell a pitch until both sides have batted on it?).\u201d That\u2019s not a clich\u00e9, it\u2019s one of the eternal verit\u00e9s. \u201dSecondly, whilst The Hundred may have been good for the women\u2019s game \u2013 but we will need to see if England lift the World Cup to know a bit more about the health of the short-form game for England\u2019s women \u2013 how many Hundred listeners who were were there when Ben Stokes was injured will be listening to/watching this Test match, do we think? \u201dEngland should never have to rely on one player, but losing one\u2019s captain for first Test of an away Test series (especially for the Hundred), seems careless at the very least! \u201cEm Jackson, nr Newcastle, basking in Durham remaining in D1 &amp; Glos winning some silverware this year.\u201d Impressive geographic spread there, Em. 78th over: Pakistan 305-3 (Babar 22, Shakeel 20) Leach continues, yeoman that he is. Shakeel goes back to the sweep, reversing for two. 77th over: Pakistan 302-3 (Babar 22, Shakeel 17) Bashir, bowling to Babar, gets that maiden. He\u2019s been much more parsimonious in this spell (5-2-10-1). Pakistan\u2019s run rate, which was racing along at 4.7 when Masood was at the wheel, has now slowed to 3.9. And there\u2019s a new ball looming if Ollie Pope fancies it. 76th over: Pakistan 302-3 (Babar 22, Shakeel 17) Babar brings up the 300 with a push into the covers off Leach. Shakeel, feeling tied down after making only three off 32 balls, goes down the track and doesn\u2019t quite get to the pitch, but improvises well with a chip for two. 75th over: Pakistan 299-3 (Babar 21, Shakeel 15) Bashir beats Shakeel with a beauty, his second-best ball of the day. Dip, turn, everything but the edge. Bashir puts his hands on his head and so does Root at slip. 74th over: Pakistan 298-3 (Babar 20, Shakeel 15) Carse, like Woakes, is taken off after two overs, so maybe this is a policy to save the quicks from sheer exhaustion. Leach returns, bearing dots, not letting Shakeel play his sweeps. A caption shows that Leach has offered a little less turn than the other two spinners. Yes, but far more control. 73rd over: Pakistan 298-3 (Babar 20, Shakeel 15) Babar, still a bit itchy, goes down the track to Bashir, who tries to fire the ball down the leg side. It\u2019s not wide enough and Babar adjusts smoothly to flick it over midwicket for four. 72nd over: Pakistan 293-3 (Babar 16, Shakeel 14) Carse continues and the batters remember that singles are an option too. The sun is still out, but the shadows of the floodlight pylons are paler now \u2013 and so long that they stretch right across the field. 71st over: Pakistan 290-3 (Babar 15, Shakeel 12) Bashir, eyeing another maiden, manages five dots to Babar. And then he gets cut for four, with a hint of imperiousness. 70th over: Pakistan 286-3 (Babar 11, Shakeel 12) Woakes is taken off after only two overs, for reasons I can\u2019t work out, but it makes little difference as Brydon Carse keeps up the pressure with a maiden. Off the last ten overs, Pakistan have scored only 25-2 \u2013 and half of those runs came in one over from Leach, when Shakeel played those three sweeps. Meanwhile, back home, Surrey have decided they haven\u2019t got enough seamers. 69th over: Pakistan 286-3 (Babar 11, Shakeel 12) Leach takes a well-earned breather and hands over to Bashir, who capitalises on his fine fielding by bowling his first maiden of the day. The only run is a bye as Jamie Smith misses a take down the leg side. And that\u2019s drinks, with England winning the last hour by dismissing both the centurions. 68th over: Pakistan 285-3 (Babar 11, Shakeel 12) Babar wants to get on with it. He cuts Woakes, hard, beating the man at short cover but not the man at deep cover, Bashir, who makes a fine stop. Next he goes down the track, only to find he can\u2019t reach the pitch and has to defend. Then he stays put and plays a flashing drive \u2013 straight to Bashir again. Woakes picks up his first maiden and, nice guy that he is, he will be giving some of the credit to Bashir\u2019s vigilance and Ollie Pope\u2019s canny field setting. 67th over: Pakistan 285-3 (Babar 11, Shakeel 12) Babar cuts Leach for four, playing it late, showing his class. There are still 23 overs left in the day, in theory, so the extra half-hour will be needed. If England wilt in the heat, Pakistan may well get the chance to push on towards 400. 66th over: Pakistan 280-3 (Babar 6, Shakeel 12) Atkinson gets a breather after his success and Woakes returns. He is thriftier than he was earlier, keeping Shakeel quiet after allowing Babar a single. \u201cPakistan were talking the Bazball talk before the game,\u201d wrote Steve Hudson, before those two wickets, \u201cand they are now very much walking the walk. \u201cThere are a surprising number of England fans who hate (not too strong a word) Bazball, on the grounds that it is undignified, unscientific, simplistic slogging, and is therefore just not Test cricket as they know it. \u201cBut clearly other Test teams see this differently. Will it take the experience of England losing a series to the kind of positive, attacking cricket that they hate, to make them think there is merit in it?\u201d Good question. 65th over: Pakistan 279-3 (Babar 5, Shakeel 12) Shakeel, facing Leach, has only one thing in mind: sweeping all before him. He opens his account with a crisp sweep for four, then reaches even further forward to sweep for four more. And then a reverse for four more! The counter-attack is on. 64th over: Pakistan 267-3 (Babar 5, Saud Shakeel 0) With two new arrivals at the crease, even on a road, the batting is uneasy. Babar is a great player going through a lean patch: his Test average since the beginning of last year is only 21, with not a single fifty. He shows why that might be by shaping to cut Atkinson and inside-edging for a jammy four. 63rd over: Pakistan 263-3 (Babar 1, Saud Shakeel 0) Masood may now be wishing he had retired. He shaped to off-drive into a gap but got too much bottom hand into it and gave a low return catch, coolly taken by Leach. In this spell, 9-2-20-1, he has quietly reclaimed his place as England\u2019s senior spinner. One brings two! 62nd over: Pakistan 263-2 (Masood 151, Babar 1) Babar, facing Atkinson, tries to get off the mark with one of his dreamy drives, only to be foiled by a sharp stop at mid-off. Then there\u2019s a full toss which he tucks away. He sets off fast, seeing a two, but Masood can only limp a single. I wonder if he was thinking of retiring hurt until Shafique got out. 61st over: Pakistan 261-2 (Masood 150, Babar Azam 0) You wait hours for a maiden from a spinner, then two come at once. Leach, the only miser in this attack, now has 14-2-37-0, and he should probably get a sliver of the credit for that wicket. 60th over: Pakistan 261-2 (Masood 150, Babar Azam 0) Even in this heat, Gus Atkinson\u2019s golden arm is still working. He went full and wide, found a smidgen of away-swing and drew Shafique into a loose drive. So Mushtaq Mohammad and Zaheer Abbas hang onto their record, which has now stood for 53 years. The breakthrough! A gentle pull for a single takes Shan Masood to 150. He has slowed down since reaching 100 but has still got there in 165 balls. He was under pressure before this; he\u2019s not any more. 59th over: Pakistan 260-1 (Shafique 102, Masood 149) Leach bowls a maiden! With a little help from these injuries. It\u2019s the fourth of the day and the first by a spinner. 58th over: Pakistan 260-1 (Shafique 102, Masood 149) Shafique, facing Carse, plays a checked hook for a single to bring up the 250 partnership, only the fourth in Pakistan\u2019s history for the second wicket. Carse draws a false shot from him with another bouncer, a top edge that lands safely in the long-stop zone. England\u2019s best hope of a breakthrough is a retired hurt, as Shafique is now hobbling too. \u201cBasically,\u201d says Gower, \u201cit\u2019s two good legs between them.\u201d 57th over: Pakistan 256-1 (Shafique 100, Masood 147) Masood toys with his opposite number by reverse-sweeping Leach for four. But it seems to give him some grief himself, causing a bout of cramp. 56th over: Pakistan 251-1 (Shafique 100, Masood 141) Carse is bowling to a packed offside field, and Masood still manages to slash for four. The only whiff of a wicket is a faint one as Shafique fences at a lifter and Jamie Smith takes the ball down the leg side, but there\u2019s not even a token appeal. 55th over: Pakistan 246-1 (Shafique 100, Masood 137) Abdullah Shafique is facing Jack Leach, biding his time, waiting for \u2026 a ball to swing for a straight six! That\u2019s a handsome way to reach a hundred. It\u2019s come off 165 balls with ten fours and two sixes, the other one being the stroke that took him to fifty. \u201cIt was at Multan,\u201d says Krish Krishnamoorthy, \u201cthat Virendra Sehwag scored his triple century. This match is meandering to a draw unless England commit some harakiri. At this rate a few centuries by English bowlers are on the cards too.\u201d True! Bashir could get there in his next spell: he\u2019s gone for 59 off 11 overs. 54th over: Pakistan 239-1 (Shafique 94, Masood 136) It\u2019s time for Brydon Carse, who, as Root said before the match, knows how to grab a wicket out of nowhere. He almost gets one now, luring Masood into a loose cut that goes straight to Pope at point. He gets his fingers to it but not under it as it dies on him. Masood, naturally, responds with a two, driven in the same direction. \u201cTo be fair,\u201d says Steve Cox, \u201cZain\u2019s description is exactly how I imagine Edgbaston, with a few more rowdy drunks thrown in.\u201d 53rd over: Pakistan 236-1 (Shafique 94, Masood 133) Leach continues after tea and springs a surprise with his first ball, an airy yorker that beats Masood and inches past the off stump. \u201cI do believe he\u2019s tossed one up!\u201d says David Gower. Masood, unruffled, plays a leg glance to maintain his policy of getting \u2019em in twos. The weather forecast appears on the screen \u2013 34 and sunny. At the same time, an email comes in from Liam Crowley. \u201cIs Zain honestly suggesting nobody ever complains about the weather in Britain?\u201d Ha. \u201cEven before lunch on the first day,\u201d says Jordan White, \u201ceveryone was up in arms about how poor England\u2019s chances are, their bowling attack isn\u2019t what it used to be, valid points about why Anderson is off playing golf etc etc. I do love watching English fans and journalists pile on their own team so quickly, not in a schadenfreude way but because it usually seems to me to be completely over the top. \u201cI could be wrong but I have a feeling that Brook, Root, Smith et al on this pitch could check in for a few days and notch up a few double tons. It\u2019s not a sure thing but the massive pessimism is based on about the same level of gut feeling... Maybe I should spend less time on Twitter.\u201d Join the club! \u201cYou can\u2019t help but chuckle,\u201d says Zain Malik, \u201cat how Multan is framed in the English press. A land so distant and scorching it might as well be Mars, just with more camels and donkey carts. It\u2019s as if the English reporters expect a Lawrence of Arabia remake every time they step off the plane. \u201cNow, flip the script: imagine Pakistani media describing Edgbaston as a gloomy wasteland of perpetual rain, grey skies, and\u2026 street crime. \u2018Locals seen preparing for another monsoon of drizzle; donkey carts swapped for Vauxhalls, no improvement noted.\u2019 \u201dYes, it\u2019s hot in Multan. Yes, Woakes is turning a shade of cherry red not seen outside of an actual cherry, but come on do you hear anyone complaining about how miserable visiting teams feel under England\u2019s fifty shades of grey? The world is made of different climates, and if you\u2019re playing cricket, you have to learn to deal. Today it\u2019s heatstroke in Multan, tomorrow it\u2019s trench foot in Manchester.\u201d 52nd over: Pakistan 233-1 (Shafique 94, Masood 130) Shafique looked as if he was shutting up shop before tea, but now, facing Root, he sweeps for four and punches for two. And that\u2019s tea, with Pakistan lording it. After making 122-1 in the morning session, they\u2019ve added 111-0 in the afternoon. The pitch is so flat that they could make 700. For England, only only Gus Atkinson has a wicket, and that seems to have come several weeks ago. 51st over: Pakistan 227-1 (Shafique 88, Masood 130) \u201cJust once,\u201d says one of the commentators, \u201cI\u2019d like to see Leach try a moon ball.\u201d Leach mysteriously fails to comply, but he does manage another near-maiden. 50th over: Pakistan 226-1 (Shafique 87, Masood 130) Tidy enough from Root. England have managed to seal off the boundary, conceding no fours since that controlled edge by Shafique off Woakes seven overs ago. But only one ball, that ripper from Bashir, has carried any threat. \u201cNice visors England,\u201d says Paul Sokhy. \u201cWhere\u2019s the next wicket coming from?\u201d At a wild guess, Harry Brook\u2019s medium-pace filth. 49th over: Pakistan 222-1 (Shafique 86, Masood 127) Leach does well, tying Masood down for five balls, beating the bat with two of them but finding the pad rather than thin air. If you\u2019ve never sent an email to the OBO, now would be a good time to start. 48th over: Pakistan 221-1 (Shafique 86, Masood 126) There\u2019s a change at the other end too, as Woakes goes back to the deep to wonder why he isn\u2019t putting his feet up back in Brum. On comes Joe Root, who, according to the ICC ratings, is the fourth-best all-rounder in Test cricket. Not many people would agree with that, least of all Root himself, but he\u2019s well worth a go. He makes a respectable start, finding some flight, but Masood marches on. He has time for another hundred today. 47th over: Pakistan 217-1 (Shafique 84, Masood 124) Pope makes a change at the spin end, replacing Shoaib Bashir with Uncle Jack Leach, who\u2019s been the most frugal of England\u2019s bowlers. He reels off three dots before allowing three singles. 46th over: Pakistan 214-1 (Shafique 82, Masood 123) Another over from Woakes, another pair of twos for Masood. The ring of four Under-10 fielders is now a ring of five \u2013 three silly mid-offs, two silly mid-ons. And no silly shots. 45th over: Pakistan 209-1 (Shafique 81, Masood 119) A gentle cut for a single from Masood lifts this stand to 200, Pakistan\u2019s best for the second wicket against England since 1971 (my Mushtaq and my Zaheer long ago). Masood and Shafique have done it off only 40.4 overs, showing flair as well as grit: one of them hadn\u2019t made a Test hundred for ages, the other had been struggling to reach five. 44th over: Pakistan 207-1 (Shafique 80, Masood 118) You know those edges Chris Woakes finds at will in England? Well, he\u2019s just got one here. But Shafique controlled it well, steering it past the spot where, in England, second slip\u2019s right boot would be. Woakes has 10-0-48-0: a decent shift in an ODI. 43rd over: Pakistan 202-1 (Shafique 76, Masood 117) We have a review! Masood tried to sweep Bashir and the ball looped up to Ben Duckett at leg slip. England leave the decision. late and the third umpire confirms that there was no bat. \u201cIt was sent upstairs,\u201d says Mike Atherton, \u201cwith absolutely no conviction by Ollie Pope.\u201d Harsh but fair: in his four Tests as captain Pope has been a consistently hopeless reviewer. 42nd over: Pakistan 199-1 (Shafique 75, Masood 115) Still no joy for Woakes as Masood helps himself to a couple of twos and a single. 41st over: Pakistan 194-1 (Shafique 75, Masood 110) Bashir manages a moral victory, beating Masood with a beauty \u2013 pitching on middle-and-off, turning sharply, flicking the pad. HawkEye shows that it was a little too high, the only thing keeping it from perfection. But Bashir then gives Shafique an easy drive for three, so his figures don\u2019t get any better (9-0-54-0). 40th over: Pakistan 189-1 (Shafique 72, Masood 109) Woakes continues, running in hard, as if he didn\u2019t have a terrible overseas record to carry around. His only slip, Joe Root, now moves to short extra, one of four men in a ring, standing around like they did in the Under-10s. That means Woakes needs to pitch it up, but he goes back of a length outside off and Shan Masood glides for four. Morning everyone and thanks Rob. He got the short straw today: rising at 5am and then having only one wicket to report. 39th over: Pakistan 184-1 (Shafique 72, Masood 104) Masood was on 16 when he successfully reviewed after being given out LBW to Brydon Carse. Since then he\u2019s been almost flawless, and his calculated assault before lunch has definitely affected Shoaib Bashir. His figures belong to an ODI from the early 2000s: 8-0-50-0. Bashir drops short and is cut for three by Shafique, then drifts too straight and is tickled for three more by Masood. \u201cAura,\u201d says Gary Naylor matter-of-factly. \u201cViv.\u201d Time for drinks and for me to hand over to Tim de Lisle. See you later. 38th over: Pakistan 177-1 (Shafique 69, Masood 100) Chris Woakes, whose last over was the 12th of the innings, returns to the attack to signal the end of England\u2019s bumper bonanza. He has a slip, short mid-on, leg gully and fervent hope that this ball will start to reverse swing. Masood drives his first ball majestically for four, then tucks two off the pads to move to 99. A single off the hip takes him to a refinded and courageous hundred, his first in Tests since 2020 and his first as captain. He was under so much pressure coming into this game; he has responded by racing to a century in 102 balls. 37th over: Pakistan 170-1 (Shafique 69, Masood 93) Bashir replaces Leach, who may change ends himself. As Ian Ward says on commentary, if Pakistan take Bashir down here Ollie Pope will have serious problems. A decent over from Bashir includes a wider delivery, on the classical Australian line, which Shafique inside-edges into the leg side. 36th over: Pakistan 169-1 (Shafique 69, Masood 92) Shafique swivel-pulls Atkinson past leg slip for four more, then plays a beautiful back-foot drive to the cover boundary. This is now his highest Test score since the 201 against Sri Lanka 15 months ago. We\u2019ll never know how the stars of 2022 \u2013 Anderson, Robinson and Wood \u2013 would have done on this pitch. It does look exceptionally good for batting. \u201cWhich team or individual had the greatest \u2018aura\u2019 do you think?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThe All Blacks? Brazil? The great West Indian and Australian cricket teams? Spain and Barcelona? Muhammad Ali, Shane Warne, Phil Taylor, Roger Federer, Tiger Woods? Though I think \u2018aura\u2019 is not always the same as \u2018great\u2019. Some individuals can carry a certain aura within a team that does not, like Stokes and the current England side, and somebody like Cantona certainly had an aura, but doesn\u2019t normally feature in any greatest player of all time debates. Many of those who faced a peak Phil Taylor were beaten before the first dart was thrown. Likewise Mike Tyson in the late 80s. I\u2019m not sure any of this makes sense, but that\u2019s never stopped me before.\u201d The first person who comes to mind is Warney, specifically at Edgbaston on 17 June 1999, though I might not say that to the face of late 80s Mike Tyson. 35th over: Pakistan 161-1 (Shafique 61, Masood 92) With mid-off up, Shan Masood feels secure enough to dance down the track and blast Leach for six. That\u2019s a lovely shot to bring up a tremendous 150 partnership with Shafique. England are in abundant bother. \u201cI know it was only a few ODIs but I felt like Brook showed more captaincy potential in that Australia series than we\u2019ve ever really seen from Pope,\u201d asys Phil Harrison. \u201cI know this is a tough gig and not everyone can be Ben Stokes but Pope just seems a bit random and scattergun \u2013 whereas Brook seemed to have decent plans and gambler\u2019s instincts. I guess it\u2019s a workload thing with him but I\u2019d like to see them turning to him again, sooner rather than later.\u201d He did look more natural, didn\u2019t he. It\u2019s not easy to change the vice-captain while keeping him in the team, though ideally this wouldn\u2019t be a consideration. I do also think Pope is no longer being judged objectively, even if I can\u2019t quite work out why. 34th over: Pakistan 154-1 (Shafique 60, Masood 86) Ben Stokes is watching on with Matthew Potts, who might be secretly glad to have missed out here, and Jordan Cox. He loves a spell of short stuff so this post-lunch tactic will surely have had his blessing, but for now all it\u2019s really doing is fatiguing the England quick bowlers. Atkinson has now bowled nine overs, Carse eight, Woakes six. 33rd over: Pakistan 151-1 (Shafique 59, Masood 84) Leach continues to keep things pretty tight: 5-0-10-0. The rest are all going at at least four an over, seven in Bashir\u2019s case. 32nd over: Pakistan 150-1 (Shafique 58, Masood 84) Atkinson takes over from Carse on bumper duty. After gloving one well short of Jamie Smith, Masood top-edges a pull over the man at fine leg for six. Joe Root, fielding on the boundary, was almost in business. Masood has scooted to 84 from 86 balls, Shafique has 58 from 98. England look a bit lost, though we should stress this is the flattest of pitches. 31st over: Pakistan 142-1 (Shafique 58, Masood 76) Masood gets down on one knee to sweep Leach behind square for four. Man he\u2019s played well today. He said before the series that the 2022 series changed the world; it certainly changed the tempo of Masood\u2019s batting. Until the end of that series his Test strike-rate was 46; since then it\u2019s 77. I know this is veering into Jaiswal/Duckett territory but stats are stats. In other news, are you a Wisden superfan? Well you jolly well should be! Their podcasts are really terrific \u2013 insightful, mature, funny, infectious - and now there are loads more of them on Patreon. 30th over: Pakistan 137-1 (Shafique 58, Masood 71) Shafique pulls Carse through midwicket for four with oodles of authority. One of the most impressive things about Pakistan\u2019s batting today has been the C-word. Clarity, doofus. They\u2019ve picked the right balls and the right times to attack, and I keep blinking at their scoring rate of 4.6 per over as it feels like they have taken very few risks. The umpire calls \u2018over\u2019 after five balls, but then somebody realises the mistake and a weary Carse has to go back to his mark and finish it off. 29th over: Pakistan 132-1 (Shafique 54, Masood 70) A chastening day like this is what England need, certainly their inexperienced bowlers. Atkinson, Carse and Bashir should learn lessons that will be valuable in the future; Test cricket isn\u2019t all milk, cookies and Dukes balls. Leach, with the aid of some relatively defensive fields. has slowed Pakistan down by conceding only four runs from three overs. He did this at times in the 2022 series, bowling dry while England waited for the ball to reverse swing. The square was fairly lush this morning so we don\u2019t know if there will be any reverse today. 28th over: Pakistan 130-1 (Shafique 53, Masood 69) A short ball from Carse sits up perfectly for Masood to pull through midwicket for four. This is his highest Test score since that 156 against England in August 2020, which is his highest overall. It might not be in a few hours\u2019 time because this pitch looks so flat. It\u2019s notable that Carse\u2019s pace is already down below 85mph. I don\u2019t say that criticially: it\u2019s inevitable when he\u2019s flogging the ball halfway down in 35 degree heat. 27th over: Pakistan 124-1 (Shafique 53, Masood 63) Jack Leach continues after lunch. He ended the season in terrific form for Somerset, taking 36 wickets in eight innings, so he should be full of the joys. He has a slip and short leg for Masood, who drives a single to deep mid-on. There\u2019s a hint of turn, no more than a soup\u00e7on. 26th over: Pakistan 123-1 (Shafique 53, Masood 62) Carse has no slips, so both batters know what\u2019s coming: a short spell in more ways than one. Masood pulls a single and then Shafique gloves a pull safely on the leg side. The ball landed well short of backward square leg but that\u2019ll give England a bit of encouragement. The Pakistan physio comes on at the end of the over. It looks like Shan Masood needed an energy gel or some such. Brydon Carse is going to start after lunch, replacing Shoaib Bashir at the end whose name I know not. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see young Abdullah Shafique back in form,\u201d writes Zain Malik. \u201cThe last time he played this soundly was in Colombo, where he amassed a brilliant 200 runs. Batting in Asian conditions against the red ball, he has been outstanding, showcasing the promise everyone seemed to overlook during his recent slump. Now, the bookish, technically sound and brave Abdullah is back, supporting his captain with poise. \u201dShan Masood\u2019s aggression has been key to helping Abdullah settle in and change gears, allowing him to shift from cautious to confident with ease. On the other hand, Carse has bowled well, creating some pressure, while Woakes and Bashir looked off coloir and as easy to read as a well-thumbed novel. With England\u2019s inexperienced bowling attack struggling, Pope must be wishing for a magic playbook because his current field placements are giving new meaning to the term \u2018trial and error\u2019.\u201d I\u2019d agree with all of that except maybe the last bit. We should cut him a bit of slack, this being his first Test as captain outside England, and he went through some of the Stokes playbook. The worry is that he doesn\u2019t have Stokes\u2019 intuition when it comes to deviating from that playbook. Welcome to Pakistan. England endured two hours of hard yakka on a flat Multan pitch, and there\u2019s plenty more than come. Saim Ayub fell early, gloving Gus Atkinson down the leg side, but Abdullah Shafique and the captain Shan Masood made classy fifties to put Pakistan on top. Brydon Carse was probably the pick of the England bowlers. Both Shafique and Masood went after Shoaib Bashir, whose six overs disappeared for 40. Reports of Pakistan\u2019s decline and all that. 25th over: Pakistan 122-1 (Shafique 53, Masood 61) Jack Leach, playing his first Test since the miracle of Hyderabad in January, is given the final over before lunch. Nothing to report, just a single to Shan Masood. It\u2019s been Pakistan\u2019s session! 24th over: Pakistan 121-1 (Shafique 53, Masood 60) Now Shafique is ready to dominate Bashir. He drives and cuts stylish boundaries before skipping down to smack Bashir over mid-on for six. That's a brilliant shot which takes him to a classy fifty from 77 balls. Bashir\u2019s figures aren\u2019t pretty: 6-0-42-0. 23rd over: Pakistan 105-1 (Shafique 38, Masood 59) Ollie Pope is trying a few things in the field, including a leg slip for Masood. But England look a little flat, the reality of bowling in Pakistan starting to kick in, and a no-ball from Atkinson brings up the Pakistan hundred in excellent time. They\u2019ve had a superb morning. 22nd over: Pakistan 99-1 (Shafique 35, Masood 58) Masood made Test hundreds in three consecutive innings in 2019-2020, culminating in a mighty 156 against England at Old Trafford. Over the next four years he averaged less than 20. And, while it\u2019s too early to hail a return to form, the signs are really encouraging for him and Pakistan. 21st over: Pakistan 98-1 (Shafique 35, Masood 57) Shan Masood times Atkinson through midwicket for a couple to reach an admirable half-century from 43 balls. It takes courage to play this positively, even on such a flat pitch, when you\u2019re under so much pressure as captain. A gorgeous drive through extra cover brings him four more. \u201cLooking like a good toss to win!\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cBen Stokes\u2019 figures are hardly in Jacques Kallis/Imran Khan territory, but it\u2019s in situations like this where his aura, an underrated attribute in sport, really comes into its own. Inexperienced bowlers (and batters) could always glance across at the all-rounder, lately captain, and think, \u2018We\u2019re still in this\u2019 regardless of the scoreboard. Someone is going to have to acquire an aura \u2013 and soon.\u201d Aura and also imagination in the field; England are definitely missing that. 20th over: Pakistan 89-1 (Shafique 35, Masood 48) Masood continues his calculated assault on Bashir with a whip through midwicket for three. His speed of scoring is allowing Shafique to settle in; he defends the rest of the over and has made 3 from his last 23 balls. 19th over: Pakistan 86-1 (Shafique 35, Masood 45) Gus Atkinson replaces Brydon Carse, who bowled a threatening first spell of 5-1-21-0. There has two slips so you\u2019d expect him to generally bowl fuller than Carse did in his last couple of overs. Indeed he does, and Shafique plays out a maiden. 18th over: Pakistan 86-1 (Shafique 35, Masood 45) Shan Masood makes it three boundaries in four balls off Bashir, rocking back to pull mightily over midwicket. That, as Mike Atherton says on commentary, is Masood\u2019s reward for coming down the pitch in the previous over. Bashir pulled his length back slightly and Masood took advantage. This is extremely good batting from Masood, who ends the over by running down the pitch to drive over mid-off for four more. He has quietly raced to 45 from 41 balls, including 20 off 12 from Bashir. 17th over: Pakistan 78-1 (Shafique 35, Masood 37) Pope misses a run-out chance when Shafique takes an inexplicable single to short mid-on. He was barely in the frame when Pope\u2019s underarm throw whistled past the stumps. Pope, who was only a few yards away, punched the stumps in frustration. Carse is now bowling a lot of short deliveries, which is hard work in this heat. Shafique is taking very few risks, in his strokeplay if not always his running, and the over passes without further incident. 16th over: Pakistan 76-1 (Shafique 34, Masood 36) Bashir has a big shout for LBW turned down when Masood flicks across the line. Ollie Pope, who burned 10 reviews against Sri Lanka, decides it didn\u2019t straighten enough. And he\u2019s right. That appeal leads to an inelegant hack for four from Masood, who charges down the pitch to drag Bashir past mid-on. He comes down again next ball, this time to smash the ball back over Bashir\u2019s head for another boundary. That\u2019s a much better shot, and an emphatic statement of intent. Pakistan have scored 59 in the last 10 overs. 15th over: Pakistan 67-1 (Shafique 33, Masood 28) A wide ball from Carse is driven stylishly past extra cover for four by Masood; that\u2019s his best shot of the morning. Ollie Pope has switched to a funkier field, with only one catcher behind the wicket, Ben Duckett in a kind of sixth slip position. Time for some short stuff. Masood turns his back on a ball that doesn\u2019t get up and whacks him on the fleshy part of the thigh arm. \u201cNot quite toasty in Sale today, looking at Multan,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cPoor old Zak Crawley, back in the side but taken out of the firing line with him healing finger seems to have spent most of the morning session running to the boundary. That must be brutal, this early into five long days. I\u2019m definitely happy to be sat at home in comfortable clothes, hearing that. He\u2019s going to get his steps in!\u201d 14th over: Pakistan 61-1 (Shafique 32, Masood 23) With nothing much happening for the seamers, Ollie Pope has an early look at Shoaib Bashir. He starts with a dipping full toss outside leg stump which Masood flicks for three to bring up a rapid, well-judged fifty partnership from 59 balls. Two more singles from the over. 13th over: Pakistan 56-1 (Shafique 31, Masood 19) When Carse pushes one wide of off stump, Shafique times a lovely drive through mid-off for four. Risk and reward, cricket\u2019s eternal dance. Masood is beaten later in the over, playing a slightly absent-minded cut stroke. Carse has been the most threatening of the England bowlers tis morning, though you\u2019d also expect him to be the most expensive as the day progresses. After an interesting first hour, it\u2019s time for drinks. 12th over: Pakistan 50-1 (Shafique 26, Masood 18) Woakes has an LBW appeal caught in the throat when he registers an inside-edge from Shafique. He does lunge around his front pad a bit at times so he should be an LBW candidate. A single to Shafique brings up Pakistan\u2019s fifty inside 12 overs, which is good going given how few risks they\u2019ve taken. 11th over: Pakistan 49-1 (Shafique 25, Masood 18) This has been a good start from Carse, whose pace is now consistently around 89-90mph. Every mile helps. Masood had thick edged the previous delivery for four, so Carse went fuller and even straighter to hit the pad in front of middle and leg. It was clearly hitting and the only issue was where it pitched. Replays showed it was fractionally outside leg stump so Carse will have to wait for his first Test wicket. REVIEW! Masood given out LBW to Carse I reckon this pitched just outside leg stump and will be overturned. 10th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Shafique 25, Masood 12) Woakes changes ends to replace Atkinson, who bowled a first spell of 4-1-17-1. Shafique opens the face to glide his first ball wide of gully for four, an accomplished shot that adds a bit more colour to Woakes\u2019 already flushed cheeks. The last ball, thrown deliberately wider, beats Shafique\u2019s attempted drive. Woakes has bowled better than figures of 5-0-25-0 suggest, so we should definitely resist the urge to jump to conclusions. Should. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Shan Masood, as Pakistan\u2019s Test captain, has never quite captured the hearts of fans or the dressing room,\u201d writes Zain Malik,. \u201cStepping in for the beloved Babar Azam, this university-educated, Yorkshire-bred skipper carries an air of elitism that seems out of sync with the rugged charm of Pakistani cricket. \u201cHe presents himself as the \u2018gentleman cricketer,\u2019 a breed last spotted in Pakistan in the \u201880s. Every time he walks to the crease, he\u2019s not just facing the opposition. He\u2019s facing fans who aren\u2019t sold on him and teammates who aren\u2019t quite sure why he\u2019s in charge. As he strides out early in Multan, Shan will be hoping to construct an innings that drowns out the critics, one ball at a time. If it goes to plan, that knock might just spell \u2018Shan\u2019 and, more importantly, \u2018Ssshh\u2019.\u201d 9th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Shafique 19, Masood 12) Time for the debutant Brydon Carse. His first ball is closked at 87mph, which would be more impressive if we weren\u2019t using to Mark Wood\u2019s flamethrowing, and later in the over he beats Shan Masood\u2019s attempted cut. An excellent start from Carse: a maiden and a top speed of 90mph. \u201cTalking of dreams,\u201d begins Showbizguru, \u201cif I take my wife\u2019s statin last thing by mistake instead of my own brand I get some bizarre ones. Sometime during the night I was dreaming I was on a film set asking Daniel Craig when he could find time to do some press interviews. As ever he was the perfect gentleman. I have absolutely no idea why I dreamed this but I presume the clue is in my name.\u201d 8th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Shafique 19, Masood 12) Too full from Atkinson and Shafique drives sweetly through mid-off for four. His shot selection so far has been really good. A leading edge from Masood runs away for three, which makes it 19 from the last two overs. England\u2019s three slips are starting to look redundant; it might be time for the captain Ollie Pope to get gently funky. Carse definitely, perhaps a spinner too. 7th over: Pakistan 27-1 (Shafique 14, Masood 9) A fraction of width from Woakes allows Shafique to play an impressive back-foot drive for three. \u201cClass, proper class,\u201d says David Gower on commentary. The outfield must be slow as that would usually have gone for four. It\u2019s the first of three consecutive threes, with Masood waving a short ball through the covers and Shafique clipping wristily through midwicket. Woakes looks a bit hot and bothered: the ball is doing nothing and he has figures of 4-0-19-0. Early days, everyone calm down. Why\u2019s everyone using capital letters these days? 6th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Shafique 8, Masood 5) Pakistan have started cautiously, which is no surprise given their recent batting form. Even though they\u2019ve lost an early wicket, the early signs are that there are plenty of runs to be had today. There\u2019s a bit of bounce but almost no sideways movement. 5th over: Pakistan 14-1 (Shafique 8, Masood 2) Woakes has another LBW shout against Shafique turned down, this time on height and line. Good umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena as (almost) always. There\u2019s been no movement for Woakes apart from a couple of deliveries in the first over, and Shafique is able to collect a pair of twos in that over. Since his double hundred against Sri Lanka year Shafique has been in dreadful form, reaching 5 in only three of his last 10 Test innings, but he looks in decent order. 4th over: Pakistan 10-1 (Shafique 4, Masood 2) Before that wicket I\u2019d typed that England might be in a for day of hard yakka, because there hasn\u2019t been as much lateral movement as expected. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see Pakistan are batting as I dreamed that England were bowled out before lunch for 86 in stark contrast to the first day of the 2022 series,\u201d says Dave Voss. \u201cI also dreamed that I won a gold medal in the coxless pair at rowing with none other than Steve Redgrave, despite forgetting about the final and him finding someone else to row it with him but still giving me the medal. Not sure what it forbodes for the series but there you go.\u201d The first part of your dream is clearly PTSD from day one of the 2011-12 series, when England\u2019s all-conquering batters were reduced to 43 for 5 on the first morning. The second part, I got no idea. Saim Ayub is caught down the leg side. He gloved a short ball off the hip and was smartly taken to his right by Jamie Smith. At first it looked like a typical strangle but maybe he was undone by some extra bounce. Either way, a fine start for Gus Atkinson in his first overseas Test. 3rd over: Pakistan 5-0 (Shafique 1, Ayub 4) Saim Ayub, a talented left-hander playing only his fourth Test, is beaten on the angle by Woakes. This is a pretty good start from England \u2013 but when Woakes pitches one up, looking for swing, Ayub drives elegantly to the cover boundary. Lovely shot. 2nd over: Pakistan 1-0 (Shafique 1, Ayub 0) Gus Atkinson shares the new ball, as he did for most of an outstanding debut summer in Test cricket. You\u2019d imagine he\u2019ll learn more in these three Tests than he did in six in England. He starts with a maiden to Shafique: very tight line and length, pace around 84mph. 1st over: Pakistan 1-0 (Shafique 1, Ayub 0) Chris Woakes opens the bowling to the right-handed Abdullah Shafique, with three slips in place. Zak Crawley, who has just recovered from a broken finger, isn\u2019t among them. For now the line-up is Root, Duckett and Brook. Woakes has an LBW shout second ball when Shafique pushes around his front pad. It was missing leg but this is a nice start, with the fourth zipping past the outside edge. Woakes averages 51 away from home and this is a huge series for him, essentially an exam to assess his suitability for next winter\u2019s Ashes. Shafique gets off the mark with a quick single into the covers. \u201cThe numbers suggest it\u2019s not as warm as the English summer of \u201822 when it hit 40\u00b0,\u201d writes Med. \u201cHopefully Pakistan provide some opposition this time.\u201d Never was I happier to live in Orkney than during that week. A reminder of the teams, who are currently lining up for the anthems. Pakistan Ayub, Shafique, Masood (c), Babar, Shakeel, Rizwan (wk), Ali Agha, Jamal, Shaheen, Naseem, Abrar. England Crawley, Duckett, Pope (c), Root, Brook, Smith (wk), Woakes, Atkinson, Carse, Leach, Bashir. From our man in Multan There are an extraordinary number of kites circling, swooping and settling on the outfield as I write. They might not quite outnumber spectators but there\u2019s not much in it. We rarely get more than a scattering of pigeons in England - if the match between the nation\u2019s cricket teams was preceded by one between their outfield avians it would be a short and extremely bloody battle. Anyway, here are the ticket prices for this series. Lord\u2019s it ain\u2019t. Pitchwatch There\u2019s a bit of grass, so England could have some joy this morning, but there are also cracks that will widen in the Multan oven. It sounds like batting first was a fairly straightforward decision. Ollie Pope speaks These are the hottest conditions I\u2019ve played in but we\u2019ve trained really well and we\u2019re ready for that challenge We would\u2019ve batted first. There\u2019s a bit of moisture in the pitch so hopefully we can take advantage of that. I\u2019m excited to see [Brydon Carse] go in Test cricket \u2013 he\u2019s got that extra bit of pace and he\u2019s exciting to watch. Ramiz Raja, conducting the toss, tells the Pakistan captain Shan Masood: \u201cKeep that smile on your face boss, you\u2019ll need it.\u201d Chris Woakes, playing his first overseas Test of the Bazball era and his first in Asia since 2016, will be straight into the action. 1 December 2022: the day the world changed Temperatures should reach 37 degrees in Multan today This McCullum fella needs to chill out a bit Both captains named their XIs in advance, which saves us engaging in futile speculation. Brydon Carse, who has jumped the cab rank in the last six weeks, will make his Test debut for England. Zak Crawley and Jack Leach also return, with Dan Lawrence, Josh Hull and Olly Stone dropping out of the side. No new faces for Pakistan but Aamer Jamal, who was hugely impressive in his debut series in Australia last winter, returns from injury to join Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah in an eyecatching pace attack. Both teams have picked three seamers and two spinners, a balance they may regret if the pitch is as grassy as suggested. We\u2019ll soon find out. [Edit: this last bit was nonsense from me \u2013 both teams have the right balance. It\u2019s as if they know what they\u2019re doing.] Pakistan Ayub, Shafique, Masood (c), Babar, Shakeel, Rizwan (wk), Ali Agha, Jamal, Shaheen, Naseem, Abrar. England Crawley, Duckett, Pope (c), Root, Brook, Smith (wk), Woakes, Atkinson, Carse, Leach, Bashir. Morning folks. Enjoy the off season? Less than eight days after the end of the English cricket summer, the winter begins with the first Test against Pakistan in Multan. Ordinarily that would generate a certain ennui. But when a man is tired of Pakistan v England, he is tired of sport; for there is in Pakistan v England all that sport can afford. These series always give us something, from exhilarating cricket to pantomime controversy to surprise victories. Pakistan are in a bit of a mess, and were recently beaten 2-0 at home by Bangladesh, yet that often makes them more dangerous \u2013 especially now that Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah are back in the side. There are a few 2005-06 vibes about the build-up to this series. Pakistan low, England high; final score: Pakistan 2-0 England. And don\u2019t get me started on 2011-12. A more obvious reference point is England\u2019s last tour of Pakistan, the remarkable 3-0 win in 2022 that elevated Ben Stokes to the ranks of truly great captains. He\u2019s unfit for this game, though he will be in the dressing-room as both the boss of the family and consigliere to Ollie Pope. In 2022 Stokes and England had to get blood out of a road to win. This time, by all accounts, the pitches could be much livelier. Rise and shine everyone!",

      "body": "<p>For weeks Pakistan teased England with talk of green pitches and seamer-friendly conditions, and then in the final hours before the opening game they peeled off the covers, shaved off anything betraying any evidence of chlorophyll, gave the heavy roller a final, deathly spin and, once the coin had fallen in their favour, told the tourists to do their best. </p> <p>What followed was a bowling performance that, at least until they took three wickets for 95 in the final session, was as flat as the surface the bowlers were forced to toil on, and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/pakistan-captain-says-england-changed-world-cricket-by-way-they-won-in-2022\">opportunity for a Pakistan lineup</a> that has struggled for form.</p> <p>Pakistan finished on 328 for four after centuries from Shan Masood and Abdullah Shafique carried them to a position of dominance \u2013 though given they started their last series by scoring 448 for six declared across the best part of two days against \u00adBangladesh and still managed to lose the game, it is still not one that feels particularly secure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/oct/07/pakistan-v-england-first-test-day-one-live\">Pakistan v England: first men\u2019s cricket Test, day one \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is hard to see how the presence of Jimmy Anderson, England\u2019s fast bowling coach, would have improved matters but this was certainly not a day that made his decision to start the series on a Scottish golf course appear any wiser. </p> <p>For all their toil the seamers all had their moments: Chris Woakes\u2019s best spell came late in the day, under floodlights and with the second new ball, during which he trapped Babar Azam lbw, Brydon Carse bowled with pace and as much venom as it was possible to extract from the surface, and Gus Atkinson took two wickets.</p> <p>The first of those gave England early hope, Pakistan\u2019s opening \u00adpartnership broken for what was both a terrible score and also their best for nine months. </p> <p>When the ball flicked Saim Ayub\u2019s glove on its way down the leg side and into Jamie Smith\u2019s gloves he had scored four and his team eight, which somehow ranks as the best partnership so far between him and Shafique. The openers are averaging 3.28 after seven attempts together. In the history of Test cricket no pair have gone so long without reaching double figures.</p> <p>If that was sweet, all that \u00adfollowed for England was sweat. The breakthrough brought Masood to the crease, with his struggling side \u00adteetering on the edge of a fresh crisis. </p> <p>His position as captain and in the team has become the subject of debate in recent months, and it had been more than four years and 26 innings since he last scored a Test ton, in which time his average was a \u00admiserable 20.69. But it swiftly \u00adtranspired there were no demons in this pitch, and none in his head either.</p>    <p>From the start, and a first-ball hit down the ground for a couple, Masood\u2019s timing was sweet and his movements smooth, and he was \u00adparticularly dismissive when \u00adEngland attempted some short stuff after lunch. But for a brief scare when he was given out lbw on 16 \u2013 a \u00addecision reversed on review because the ball pitched wide of leg stump \u2013&nbsp;he gave his opponents nothing but punishment.</p> <p>Shafique at the other end was less fluent, more safety-focused, as might be expected of a player who had been dismissed for fewer than five runs in seven of his previous 10 Test innings. Not that it was without ambition, and he scored 10 fours and two sixes \u2013 immaculately timed given that one, lifted down the ground off the spin of Shoaib Bashir, brought up his 50 and the other, lifted down the ground off the spin of Jack Leach, brought up an exuberantly received hundred \u2013 on his way to an 184-ball 102.</p> <p>Shafique\u2019s one misjudgment came at the start of the 17th over, when he called for a wildly ill-conceived single off Carse and presented Ollie Pope with a wonderful chance to run him out, but the England captain did not appreciate quite how much time he had. From close range but side-on, he attempted an underarm throw at the stumps that narrowly missed, with the batter still distant. After that Shafique retreated into his shell, and a run of 17 successive dot balls, which he eventually busted out of by hitting 15 off one Bashir over.</p> <p>The next time England got \u00adanywhere close to a wicket was \u00adprecisely 26 overs later. Masood \u00adwas on 115, and even that was close only in their imaginations, with a review for a possible catch that nobody at any stage seemed very excited about duly showing the ball hitting only a pad before looping to slip (Pope\u2019s 11th review as captain thus \u00adproving as poor as the previous 10, an \u00adextraordinary run of failures).</p> <p>Both batters eventually fell in the hour after tea, Shafique pushing straight to Pope at cover and Masood, having scored 151 off 177, chipping a return catch to Leach. </p> <p>Babar and Saud Shakeel then very equally shared a stand of 61 for the fourth wicket before the former fell for 30 to bring Naseem Shah out as nightwatch.</p> <p>It is worth noting that England have never had a swifter turnaround from their last Test of the summer to their first of the winter. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/09/brilliant-nissanka-leads-sri-lanka-to-emphatic-test-victory-over-england\">Sri Lanka wrapped up victory at the Oval on 9 September</a>; it might in the end not have been the \u00adhorror show that had been threatened but this often lifeless display came, \u00adperhaps appropriately, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7suz9ndPBHg\">28 days later</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For weeks Pakistan teased England with talk of green pitches and seamer-friendly conditions, and then in the final hours before the opening game they peeled off the covers, shaved off anything betraying any evidence of chlorophyll, gave the heavy roller a final, deathly spin and, once the coin had fallen in their favour, told the tourists to do their best. What followed was a bowling performance that, at least until they took three wickets for 95 in the final session, was as flat as the surface the bowlers were forced to toil on, and an opportunity for a Pakistan lineup that has struggled for form. Pakistan finished on 328 for four after centuries from Shan Masood and Abdullah Shafique carried them to a position of dominance \u2013 though given they started their last series by scoring 448 for six declared across the best part of two days against Bangladesh and still managed to lose the game, it is still not one that feels particularly secure. It is hard to see how the presence of Jimmy Anderson, England\u2019s fast bowling coach, would have improved matters but this was certainly not a day that made his decision to start the series on a Scottish golf course appear any wiser. For all their toil the seamers all had their moments: Chris Woakes\u2019s best spell came late in the day, under floodlights and with the second new ball, during which he trapped Babar Azam lbw, Brydon Carse bowled with pace and as much venom as it was possible to extract from the surface, and Gus Atkinson took two wickets. The first of those gave England early hope, Pakistan\u2019s opening partnership broken for what was both a terrible score and also their best for nine months. When the ball flicked Saim Ayub\u2019s glove on its way down the leg side and into Jamie Smith\u2019s gloves he had scored four and his team eight, which somehow ranks as the best partnership so far between him and Shafique. The openers are averaging 3.28 after seven attempts together. In the history of Test cricket no pair have gone so long without reaching double figures. If that was sweet, all that followed for England was sweat. The breakthrough brought Masood to the crease, with his struggling side teetering on the edge of a fresh crisis. His position as captain and in the team has become the subject of debate in recent months, and it had been more than four years and 26 innings since he last scored a Test ton, in which time his average was a miserable 20.69. But it swiftly transpired there were no demons in this pitch, and none in his head either. From the start, and a first-ball hit down the ground for a couple, Masood\u2019s timing was sweet and his movements smooth, and he was particularly dismissive when England attempted some short stuff after lunch. But for a brief scare when he was given out lbw on 16 \u2013 a decision reversed on review because the ball pitched wide of leg stump \u2013 he gave his opponents nothing but punishment. Shafique at the other end was less fluent, more safety-focused, as might be expected of a player who had been dismissed for fewer than five runs in seven of his previous 10 Test innings. Not that it was without ambition, and he scored 10 fours and two sixes \u2013 immaculately timed given that one, lifted down the ground off the spin of Shoaib Bashir, brought up his 50 and the other, lifted down the ground off the spin of Jack Leach, brought up an exuberantly received hundred \u2013 on his way to an 184-ball 102. Shafique\u2019s one misjudgment came at the start of the 17th over, when he called for a wildly ill-conceived single off Carse and presented Ollie Pope with a wonderful chance to run him out, but the England captain did not appreciate quite how much time he had. From close range but side-on, he attempted an underarm throw at the stumps that narrowly missed, with the batter still distant. After that Shafique retreated into his shell, and a run of 17 successive dot balls, which he eventually busted out of by hitting 15 off one Bashir over. The next time England got anywhere close to a wicket was precisely 26 overs later. Masood was on 115, and even that was close only in their imaginations, with a review for a possible catch that nobody at any stage seemed very excited about duly showing the ball hitting only a pad before looping to slip (Pope\u2019s 11th review as captain thus proving as poor as the previous 10, an extraordinary run of failures). Both batters eventually fell in the hour after tea, Shafique pushing straight to Pope at cover and Masood, having scored 151 off 177, chipping a return catch to Leach. Babar and Saud Shakeel then very equally shared a stand of 61 for the fourth wicket before the former fell for 30 to bring Naseem Shah out as nightwatch. It is worth noting that England have never had a swifter turnaround from their last Test of the summer to their first of the winter. Sri Lanka wrapped up victory at the Oval on 9 September; it might in the end not have been the horror show that had been threatened but this often lifeless display came, perhaps appropriately, 28 days later.",

The Qantas in-flight entertainment selection contains a number of big hitters, including Inside Out 2, The Fall Guy, A Quiet Place: Day One and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.

      "bodyText": "Ireland is a \u201cplayground\u201d for Russian intelligence, a former deputy chief of an Irish army unit has said following claims that a member of parliament was recruited by the Kremlin to undermine Anglo-Irish relations during Brexit talks. Cathal Berry, now a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD, member of the Irish parliament), said he had not been surprised by a report at the weekend that the unnamed politician had been recruited \u201cas an agent of influence\u201d in a honeytrap operation. \u201cIf you are looking to affect a western country with extensive assets and a poor security culture then Ireland is ground zero,\u201d Berry told the Irish Times. \u201cHere the Russians get maximum impact for minimum effort. It is a playground for them.\u201d According to the report in the Irish Sunday Times, the aim of the operation was to build contact with loyalist paramilitaries at a time of sensitive discussions with the UK about whether there would be checks on the Irish border or not. The reported mission ties in with wider hybrid warfare efforts identified by the EU which it says can involve anything from disinformation to suspected arson and antisemitic attacks. \u201cRussia has written the manual on hybrid operations, misinformation, disinformation, cyber-attacks, anything that\u2019s deniable or that\u2019s very difficult to attribute to them,\u201d said Berry, a former second-in-command of the Irish Ranger Wing and now an independent TD for Kildare. According to the newspaper, the Irish military and security services identified the potential agent, code-named Cobalt, but he remains in office. There is no apparent evidence of him having being paid or having passed information to the Russians. He has not been arrested or charged. The opposition TD Richard Boyd Barrett has called for action by the authorities. \u201cI think anybody who has been corrupted by any external power rather than serving the interests of ordinary people has a serious case to answer,\u201d he said. The politician was said to have been recruited by Sergey Prokopiev, who worked in the embassy in Dublin from 2019-22, and was expelled two years ago after allegations he was an undeclared intelligence officer. On Sunday the taoiseach, Simon Harris, said he would not comment on matters of security but noted that Ireland was \u201cnot immune\u201d to Russian attempts to influence public discourse. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as any surprise to any of us that Russia seeks to influence public opinion, seeks to distort public opinion and is active in relation to that across the world and that Ireland is not immune from that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen a very significant increase in that level of activity since the brutal invasion by Russia of Ukraine.\u201d Asked whether he knew who the alleged agent was, Harris said he could not comment on security matters but that he was \u201csatisfied that our gardai and our intelligence services working internationally with counterparts take this issue very, very seriously\u201d. The Russian embassy said on Monday it had \u201calways believed that there is no sense or value in commenting\u201d on what it described as \u201cthe primitive anti-Russian concoctions\u201d in the Sunday Times. Russia\u2019s presence in Ireland has previously been the subject of concern, with planning permission to quadruple the size of the Russian embassy overturned by the government in 2020 due to concern over the new complex\u2019s purpose. At the time, Berry said the proposed complex, which would have included a subterranean network of 20 storage rooms, 10 power plant rooms and 13 toilets, looked more like a \u201cnerve centre\u201d for Russian intelligence.",

The US senator from Ohio said women without biological children are \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too\u201d.</p> <p>Harris called Vance\u2019s comments \u201cmean and mean-spirited\u201d.</p>    <p>Vance has said he regretted that \u201ca lot of people took it the wrong way\u201d, but he did not particularly regret the comments themselves.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s podcast comes as Harris begins a media blitz amid political media criticism that she has not subjected herself to one-on-one interviews since she secured the Democratic nomination, with the exception of Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>Cooper, the podcast host, also asked Harris about Trump\u2019s comments last month that \u201cwomen will be happy, healthy, confident and free\u201d if he is given a second presidency.</p> <p>Harris alluded to how Trump appointed three US supreme court justices who in 2022 formed part of the conservative bloc that overturned the federal right to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a> once established by the landmark Roe v Wade case. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the same guy that is now saying that?\u201d Harris asked. \u201cSo yeah, there you go.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris hit back at the Republican Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019s comments that the vice-president and Democratic White House nominee \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble\u201d because she does not have children of her own. \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,\u201d Harris told the Call Her Daddy podcast host Alex Cooper in a taped interview released on Sunday. Sanders, a deputy White House press secretary during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, told a rally crowd in September that her \u201ckids keep me humble. \u201cUnfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t have anything keeping her humble,\u201d Sanders said. In a taped interview with Cooper, Harris said there are \u201ca whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it\u2019s really important for women to lift each other up\u201d. Harris, who is a stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff\u2019s two children, Cole and Ella Emhoff, added: \u201cWe have our family by blood and then we have our family by love. And I have both. \u201cAnd I consider it to be a real blessing.\u201d Harris discussed her relationship with her stepchildren, who are her husband\u2019s biological children from his first marriage, saying: \u201cThey are my children. And I love those kids to death, and family comes in many forms.\u201d But Sanders came back at Harris in a statement emailed to the Hill on Sunday, saying she \u201cwould never criticize a woman for not having children. \u201cThe point I was making and that Kamala Harris confirmed by her own admission is that she doesn\u2019t believe our leaders should be humble, which explains her arrogant claim that she alone can fix our nation\u2019s problems after spending the last four years making them worse,\u201d she continued. The clash stems from 2021 comments made by Trump\u2019s running mate in November\u2019s presidential election, JD Vance. The US senator from Ohio said women without biological children are \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too\u201d. Harris called Vance\u2019s comments \u201cmean and mean-spirited\u201d. Vance has said he regretted that \u201ca lot of people took it the wrong way\u201d, but he did not particularly regret the comments themselves. Sunday\u2019s podcast comes as Harris begins a media blitz amid political media criticism that she has not subjected herself to one-on-one interviews since she secured the Democratic nomination, with the exception of Oprah Winfrey. Cooper, the podcast host, also asked Harris about Trump\u2019s comments last month that \u201cwomen will be happy, healthy, confident and free\u201d if he is given a second presidency. Harris alluded to how Trump appointed three US supreme court justices who in 2022 formed part of the conservative bloc that overturned the federal right to an abortion once established by the landmark Roe v Wade case. \u201cThis is the same guy that is now saying that?\u201d Harris asked. \u201cSo yeah, there you go.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>\u2018Now I only watch TV in Turkish\u2019</h2> <p>During lockdown, I watched a Turkish show called Dirili\u015f: Ertu\u011frul. It is set in the 13th century and it\u2019s about Ertu\u011frul, the father of Osman who founded the Ottoman empire. I enjoyed it immensely. This led me to research other Turkish programmes and I\u2019ve been hooked to this day. Now the only programmes I watch are Turkish! I\u2019ve also picked up the language and have started to learn it online. One of my favourite shows is called Emanet. I\u2019m currently on episode 764! Sometimes the subtitles aren\u2019t available, but I follow as best as I can. <strong>Lady-Marie Dawson-Malcolm, 62, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Watching Swedish TV has made me more understandable\u2019</h2> <p>TV has helped me with studying Swedish. I found the Swedish broadcasting company SVT online and alongside reading and grammar lessons, I would watch comedy shows such as Trevlig helg, Morran och Tobias, Leif och Billy or Terese i Kassan. Comedies are useful because they\u2019re shorter and you don\u2019t have to watch the whole series to know what\u2019s what. I have to look up many of the words, but I get used to them. My Swedish accent is far from perfect, though I think watching TV in Swedish has made me more understandable. Whenever I go back to Sweden, fewer and fewer people are immediately switching to English when they hear me speak. <strong>Stenner, 26, Lancashire </strong></p> <h2>\u2018Drag Race Espa\u00f1a is my favourite\u2019</h2>    <p>I started Spanish lessons in 2017. I was planning a trip to Costa Rica and Cuba at the time. Then I became addicted and carried on the lessons after I returned. I practised on Duolingo, and my Spanish teacher recommended watching Spanish TV with subtitles. My favourite is Drag Race Espa\u00f1a. I get to learn a lot of colloquial terms and rude words. Last night I watched the first episode of the new season and I learned \u201cQue co\u00f1o es eso?\u201d, which means \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Much more likely to be used than some of the things I have learned on Duolingo! <strong>Sarah Wait, 43, Bristol </strong></p> <h2>\u2018This Welsh comedy helped me not to take myself too seriously\u2019</h2> <p>I moved to Anglesey 10 years ago after I met my wife. I committed to learn Welsh and one of the first things my mother-in-law bought me was a DVD of Beryl, Cheryl and Meryl \u2013 a comedy programme in Welsh. It really introduced an element of fun to the language for me. Crucially, it helped me to realise not to take myself too seriously, and that it was more important to attempt to speak what I knew without fear or concern of getting it wrong than not speak at all. <strong>Baron Walkden, 40, Anglesey</strong></p> <h2>\u2018This sci-fi made me fall in love with learning German again\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve been studying German as a third language for nearly four years and went on a student exchange to Cologne in 2022. But since being back in Australia, my fluency has really decreased. I recently watched the German TV series Dark on Netflix, which is an incredible sci-fi mystery thriller, and it\u2019s made me fall in love with the language all over again. Most of the characters speak Hochdeutsch (high German), which is very helpful for someone learning German as a foreign language because it\u2019s clearer to understand than dialects. Surprisingly, the show\u2019s discussions on time travel and philosophy have actually improved my vocabulary by expanding it beyond the typical subject matter of textbooks, which are understandably more focused on daily topics than the butterfly effect. <strong>Maya, Australia</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I now know a lot of obsolete Chinese expressions!\u2019</h2> <p>I learned Chinese watching historical costume dramas set during the Qing dynasty. The ones I began with were Qianlong Dynasty, Yongzheng Dynasty and Kangxi Dynasty. I combined watching TV with reading; first bilingual books and kids\u2019 books, then more advanced ones. TV was very effective for getting used to spoken Chinese. The problem was that I ended up knowing a lot of archaic and now obsolete expressions and couldn\u2019t always think of the appropriate 21st-century equivalent in actual conversation with people in China. Fortunately, some people I met appreciated the outdated touch to some of my vocabulary. <strong>Alexandra Nikolaisen, 43, Vienna, Austria</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve recently upgraded from children\u2019s TV to Borgen\u2019</h2>    <p>To learn Danish I started with YouTube videos of Cocomelon, a show for children. It uses basic language and rhythmic songs so it\u2019s really easy to pick up core words. Then I upgraded to some dubbing of familiar movies, such as Disney films and Toy Story. I\u2019ve recently upgraded again to Borgen on Netflix, which is a Danish show about politics. This has been helpful on a more formal, adult level. It can be tricky, especially with a less commonly spoken language like Danish, to get any sort of immersion. TV gives you that. It can show you the typical flow and rhythm when it\u2019s spoken, and you can pick up colloquial words, modern updates and even accents. The Danish tend to drop letters in their casual language \u2013 so TV helps me know what\u2019s going on when I visit Copenhagen. <strong>Emily, 28, Lincoln </strong></p> <h2>\u2018I developed the accent and mannerisms of an Estonian comedian\u2019</h2> <p>One of the most effective things I did to learn Estonian was watch comedy sketches from the show Tujurikkuja (best translated as Buzzkill). It ran every New Year\u2019s Eve in Estonia and gave a satirical look at the year\u2019s events and Estonian culture, and introduced me to a wide range of vocabulary. The videos were largely on YouTube and the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d had English subtitles. I was also able to listen to the pronunciation of the comedians and mimic them. If I\u2019d only stuck to the textbook, I\u2019d be able to order food in Estonian \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t have had anything to talk about. I could bring up my favourite sketch (the Estonian prime minister fighting the Finnish President as Godzillas). Then I could ask what their favourite was, which everyone had. One unexpected outcome was that I developed the accent and mannerisms of one of the lead comedians. I once met an Estonian at a conference, and we chatted about the show. The following day she introduced me to her group as \u201cthe English guy I was telling you all about, who speaks fluent Estonian exactly like the comedian Ott Sepp\u201d. <strong>David, 37, </strong><strong>Tallinn, Estonia </strong></p>",

It can show you the typical flow and rhythm when it\u2019s spoken, and you can pick up colloquial words, modern updates and even accents. The Danish tend to drop letters in their casual language \u2013 so TV helps me know what\u2019s going on when I visit Copenhagen. Emily, 28, Lincoln \u2018I developed the accent and mannerisms of an Estonian comedian\u2019 One of the most effective things I did to learn Estonian was watch comedy sketches from the show Tujurikkuja (best translated as Buzzkill). It ran every New Year\u2019s Eve in Estonia and gave a satirical look at the year\u2019s events and Estonian culture, and introduced me to a wide range of vocabulary. The videos were largely on YouTube and the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d had English subtitles. I was also able to listen to the pronunciation of the comedians and mimic them. If I\u2019d only stuck to the textbook, I\u2019d be able to order food in Estonian \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t have had anything to talk about. I could bring up my favourite sketch (the Estonian prime minister fighting the Finnish President as Godzillas). Then I could ask what their favourite was, which everyone had. One unexpected outcome was that I developed the accent and mannerisms of one of the lead comedians. I once met an Estonian at a conference, and we chatted about the show. The following day she introduced me to her group as \u201cthe English guy I was telling you all about, who speaks fluent Estonian exactly like the comedian Ott Sepp\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. One year ago, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people \u2013 the deadliest event for Jewish people since the Holocaust. A further 251 were taken hostage. In the months that followed, the Israeli offensive in Gaza laid waste to the densely populated coastal territory and has so far killed almost 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. As Israel marked the day with vigils and protests around the country, Hezbollah rockets struck Haifa, Israel\u2019s third-largest city, wounding five, in response to the country\u2019s bombardment of Beirut. A new Israeli military division has been sent to southern Lebanon, raising questions over the scope of Israel\u2019s operation in the country. How many hostages remain in Gaza, one year later? Nearly 100 hostages have yet to return home. While hopes were raised by the release of 117 hostages early in the war, including 105 in an exchange during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, more hostages have been found dead than alive during Israeli operations as the offensive has dragged on. One year later, some families are just learning that their loved ones were killed in the initial attacks, with their remains still in Gaza. How are the families of hostages coping? \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. A year is just too long. I can\u2019t take it any more,\u201d says Aviva Siegel, who was held hostage for 51 days before being released but whose husband, Keith, is still captive. For the families of the six Thai migrant workers who are still being held, the lack of news has been unbearable. What is happening in Gaza? The Israel Defense Forces has called on residents in the northern Gaza Strip, where 300,000 people are estimated to have remained, to evacuate southward towards the so-called humanitarian zone of al-Mawasi, where an estimated 1 million displaced people are sheltering. One year later, what are conditions like for Palestinians in Gaza? Health workers who volunteered in Gaza say that beyond the airstrikes and military operations that have destroyed much of the territory, malnutrition is a huge problem, as well as worsening sanitation and the limited access to water. Medical supplies are hard to come by, with medics reporting that they are operating without essentials such as surgical gowns and gauze. While polio vaccinations started last month, the brutal reality was that some of the children being vaccinated in the morning would be seen as casualties by the evening, said one doctor. How are people marking the first anniversary around the world? From London to Berlin to Tokyo, people are honoring the memories of those killed in the 7 October attacks with memorials, as well as taking to the streets in protest against the Israeli offensive in Gaza. In the US, cities and campuses are on high alert for any unrest. Still reeling from Hurricane Helene, Florida braces for Hurricane Milton Just days after Hurricane Helene devastated swaths of Florida, the state is preparing for Hurricane Milton to hit its western peninsula by midweek. Milton was upgraded to a category 1 hurricane on Sunday, prompting Florida to expand its state of emergency. Are Floridians evacuating? Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida\u2019s emergency management division, is urging residents to prepare for the \u201clargest evacuation that we have seen most likely since 2017 Hurricane Irma\u201d. More than 6.8 million people were evacuated for Irma. Pinellas county issued mandatory evacuation orders for six hospitals, 25 nursing homes and 44 assisted living facilities, totaling about 6,600 patients, while Pasco county has issued mandatory evacuations to go into effect Monday at 10am for all those in low-lying or flood-prone areas. What is Governor Ron DeSantis saying? With 4,000 National Guard troops helping state crews to remove debris, DeSantis has directed that Florida crews dispatched to North Carolina in Helene\u2019s aftermath return to the state to prepare for Milton. \u201cWe\u2019re going 24-7,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck.\u201d In other news \u2026 Two people have been killed and at least 10 injured in a suspected suicide attack near Karachi airport, Pakistan, that was targeting Chinese nationals, with the separatist militant group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) taking responsibility for the attack. Kamala Harris has embarked on a weeklong media blitz as she seeks to gain an edge over Donald Trump in the US election\u2019s key battleground states. A black bear with three cubs injured a 74-year-old Colorado man after crashing through the sliding glass door of his home and clawing at him when he tried to get them to leave. Two boys have been arrested in connection with an assault on the former New York governor David Paterson and his stepson while they were out for a walk on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. Stat of the day: At least 200 people remain missing after Hurricane Helene More than a week after Hurricane Helene made landfall in the south-east US, killing at least 230 people, search-and-rescue efforts continue for hundreds more who remain missing. Across six states, shattered communities are picking up the pieces, with the scale of destruction still unknown. What will be the long-term effects of Helene? Experts believe the fallout from damaged infrastructure \u2013 as well as rampant misinformation \u2013 will plague communities for years, if not decades. While asthma flare-ups and breathing problems are likely to increase with mold and standing water, other regions operating without running water are raising concerns about sanitation, including the spread of viruses such as hepatitis A and stomach bugs. How are local communities coming together to fill the gaps? With some residents complaining about the response from federal and state governments, mutual aid groups are stepping up to provide their communities with the non-perishable foods, generators, menstrual products and baby supplies they need. Don\u2019t miss this: Jewish Americans and Palestinian Americans reflect on the Middle East conflict, one year on In the year after the 7 October attacks, Jewish Americans and Palestinian Americans across generations and political divides have been pulled into a crisis unfolding half a world away. As Jewish Americans grapple with antisemitism \u2013 \u201cPeople hold me accountable for the Israeli government,\u201d said 30-year-old Lea Silvert, whose aunt and uncle were killed by Hamas during the 7 October attacks \u2013 Palestinian Americans wait in fear to hear from relatives still in Gaza. \u201cI\u2019ve lost 20 relatives since Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza,\u201d said Dr Emad Shehada, 48. \u2026 or this: Behind Trump\u2019s ironclad grip on rightwing media Trump\u2019s media strategy has evolved this election cycle with the current state of the rightwing media landscape. While Fox is still a dominant source, it is not nearly Trumpy enough for the most Maga adherent, despite some of its hosts embracing election denialism. As more and more conservatives flock toward far-right influencers and lesser-known outlets built around Trumpism, the former president\u2019s grip on rightwing media grows stronger \u2013 and the bubbles in which a divided US live become echo chambers.

      "body": "<p><em>This is the first of three stories </em><em>about the run-up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">2024 US presidential election</a> in Shasta county, a region of 180,000</em><em> people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/03/mike-lindell-shasta-county-california-dominion-voting-systems\">election-denial movement</a> and a hotbed for far-right politics.</em></p> <p>When Shasta county had to search for a new official to oversee its elections earlier this year, there was an obvious candidate.</p> <p>Her name was Joanna Francescut, and she had been the assistant elections clerk and registrar of voters in this remote region in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>\u2019s far north. Francescut had worked in elections for more than 16 years, oversaw the office of the county clerk and registrar of voters for months after her boss went on leave, and was endorsed by elections officials and prominent area Republicans alike.</p>    <p>Instead, the ultra-conservative majority on Shasta county\u2019s board of supervisors in June selected Tom Toller, a former prosecutor who had never worked in elections and vowed to change the office culture, improve public confidence, and \u201cclean up\u201d voter rolls.</p> <p>Were it any other California county, the decision would have been shocking. But Shasta county in recent years has made a name for itself as a center for far-right politics and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/03/mike-lindell-shasta-county-california-dominion-voting-systems\">election-denial movement</a>, which maintains that Donald Trump, and not Joe Biden, won the 2020 presidential election. In the past year, the majority on the board of supervisors, the county\u2019s governing body, has cast doubt on the integrity of the local elections office and sought to rid the county of voting machines.</p> <p>The move fueled anxiety among some of the county\u2019s residents. Before one of the most turbulent and consequential races in recent history, Toller will be in charge of administering the election to 114,000 voters with just a few months\u2019 experience under his belt.</p>    <p>Already, challenges have been thrown his way. In September, a county advisory board, which makes recommendations to Shasta\u2019s governing body, <a href=\"https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2024/09/10/shasta-county-elections-panel-again-asks-supervisors-to-defy-state-law/75157492007/\">proposed</a> limiting absentee ballots and returning to one-day voting. Toller rejected the proposal, pointing out the plan would violate state law.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are worried about it,\u201d said Robert Sid, a Shasta county conservative who supported Francescut and has been frustrated by conspiracy theories about the elections office. \u201cIf there was any hint of scandal [at the office], I\u2019d be the first one down there. But there\u2019s never been anything.\u201d</p> <p>Toller declined the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview, citing his office\u2019s focus on preparations for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/us-elections-2024-early-voting-explainer\">early voting</a>.</p> <p>The controversy in Shasta over the elections office is a more extreme version of an issue that experts have been sounding the alarm about for years. US elections officials are leaving at increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/09/2020-election-workers\">high rates</a> after facing intense harassment and threats in the aftermath of the 2020 election and are being replaced by administrators with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/23/election-office-luzerne-county-pennsylvania\">less experience and institutional knowledge</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p>For 20 years, Shasta\u2019s elections had been managed by Cathy Darling Allen, one of the only Democrats elected to office in this region where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one.</p> <p>Allen\u2019s job, a non-partisan administrative role, radically changed after the 2020 election, when Trump refused to acknowledge his defeat. As an election-denial movement flourished locally and the county\u2019s governing body veered radically to the right, her office came under growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/27/us-midterms-rural-california-voters-election-officials-fear-for-safety\">scrutiny and dealt with harassment and bullying</a>. The evening of a local election in June 2022, someone placed a camera outside her office.</p>    <p>Allen was <a href=\"https://www.redding.com/elections/results/local/2022-06-07/06089/\">re-elected</a> with almost 70% of the vote that year. But she was frequently villainized by the far-right majority on the board of supervisors, which had set out to dramatically change how elections are conducted in Shasta county.</p> <p>In early 2023, the county board of supervisors cancelled its contract with Dominion Voting Systems, the company maligned by Trump and his supporters, without a replacement, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/04/far-right-county-throws-out-voting-machines-with-nothing-to-replace-them\">attempted to implement</a> a costly and error-prone hand-counting method. Soon after, the state thwarted those efforts with the passage of a bill preventing counties from using manual tallies in most elections.</p> <p>Far-right county officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/05/california-voting-machines-election-deniers\">insisted</a> they would use their hand-counting method in November 2023 regardless, and falsely claimed elections were being manipulated; Allen made clear she would follow state law, and the election ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/16/california-shasta-county-counting-votes-election-deniers\">unfolded without issue</a>.</p> <p>Many voters heralded Allen\u2019s commitment to upholding election law in the face of unprecedented attacks. People routinely stopped her in public to express their appreciation, she previously told the Guardian, and often sent cards and notes of gratitude. But Allen\u2019s position also made her the No 1 enemy of Shasta county\u2019s far right, one local journalist <a href=\"https://anewscafe.com/2023/10/20/redding/when-the-going-gets-tough-the-tough-get-knitting-during-supervisors-meetings/\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>In February, Allen shocked the county when she announced plans to retire with two years left in her term. She had been diagnosed with heart failure, she said. \u201cAn essential part of recovering from this diagnosis is stress reduction. As many election officials could probably tell you right now, that\u2019s a tough ask to balance with election administration in the current environment,\u201d she wrote in a letter to the community.</p>    <p>***</p> <p>Francescut, Allen\u2019s deputy, seemed an obvious choice for her replacement, given her more than 16 years\u2019 experience assisting with more than 30 elections in the county. She had been training for the role for years and took on Allen\u2019s job \u2013 in addition to her own \u2013 and oversaw the March election.</p> <p>She had the support of her ex-boss, elections clerks in two other counties, as well as a conservative former county supervisor.</p> <p>The board of supervisors held public interviews with eight candidates, including Francescut, Toller and Clint Curtis, an attorney and former congressional candidate who has long claimed he was once hired by a lawmaker to create a software that could rig elections.</p> <p>During public comment after the first day of interviews, an air of cynicism hung over the room. Several speakers urged the board to hire Francescut while acknowledging the supervisors had likely already made their decision. \u201cThe fix is in,\u201d one woman shouted from the audience.</p> <p>Board members took a combative approach with Francescut. One supervisor, Kevin Crye, attempted to coax her into criticizing her former boss, while another, Patrick Jones, accused her of \u201cmal-conduct\u201d. Their tone was hostile, said Sid, who characterized the public interviews as a \u201cdog and pony show\u201d.</p>    <p>Francescut, who described the process as \u201chumbling\u201d, tried to focus on her values as a leader and on her work ethic,<strong> </strong>she said in an interview with the Guardian in June. \u201cI prepared myself the best I could to get the job I\u2019ve been striving to get for the last 16 years. Even if right now isn\u2019t the right time. I have community support behind me.\u201d</p> <p>In his interview with the panel, Toller said he would bring what he described as necessary change to the elections office, and suggested he would not mind pushing back against state law.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that just because the secretary of state of California tells us a statute or regulation must be interpreted in a certain way, that\u2019s not the end of the story,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And then there was Curtis, who has advocated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/georgia-hand-counting-ballots-2024-election-explained\">hand-counting</a> and noted in his <a href=\"https://www.shastacounty.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/community/page/4803/rov_applications_-_redacted.pdf\">application</a> he was a speaker at election events hosted by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow founder who has spent millions of dollars promoting lies about elections in the US.</p> <p>During the public hearing in June, a group of residents who have frequently spoken publicly on their concerns about vote tampering and their beliefs that elections are being rigged expressed their support for Curtis. None of the speakers who offered public comment spoke in favor of Toller.</p> <p>Still, Toller\u2019s appointment was a win for critics of the elections office in a year with relatively few victories for them. Patrick Jones, the official who has most aggressively condemned voting machines and spread misinformation, in March lost his bid for re-election by a landslide. In June, a county judge <a href=\"https://shastascout.org/the-lack-of-evidence-was-profound-judge-dismisses-case-alleging-mal-conduct-in-shasta-countys-march-5-primary-election/\">dismissed a lawsuit</a> from a failed supervisor candidate who sued the elections office, claiming that an error in the placement of her name on the ballot cost her the election. She had sought to change the outcome of the election.</p> <p>\u201cThe lack of evidence was profound,\u201d the judge said of the case.

      "bodyText": "This is the first of three stories about the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election in Shasta county, a region of 180,000 people in northern California that has emerged as a center of the election-denial movement and a hotbed for far-right politics. When Shasta county had to search for a new official to oversee its elections earlier this year, there was an obvious candidate. Her name was Joanna Francescut, and she had been the assistant elections clerk and registrar of voters in this remote region in California\u2019s far north. Francescut had worked in elections for more than 16 years, oversaw the office of the county clerk and registrar of voters for months after her boss went on leave, and was endorsed by elections officials and prominent area Republicans alike. Instead, the ultra-conservative majority on Shasta county\u2019s board of supervisors in June selected Tom Toller, a former prosecutor who had never worked in elections and vowed to change the office culture, improve public confidence, and \u201cclean up\u201d voter rolls. Were it any other California county, the decision would have been shocking. But Shasta county in recent years has made a name for itself as a center for far-right politics and the election-denial movement, which maintains that Donald Trump, and not Joe Biden, won the 2020 presidential election. In the past year, the majority on the board of supervisors, the county\u2019s governing body, has cast doubt on the integrity of the local elections office and sought to rid the county of voting machines. The move fueled anxiety among some of the county\u2019s residents. Before one of the most turbulent and consequential races in recent history, Toller will be in charge of administering the election to 114,000 voters with just a few months\u2019 experience under his belt. Already, challenges have been thrown his way. In September, a county advisory board, which makes recommendations to Shasta\u2019s governing body, proposed limiting absentee ballots and returning to one-day voting. Toller rejected the proposal, pointing out the plan would violate state law. \u201cPeople are worried about it,\u201d said Robert Sid, a Shasta county conservative who supported Francescut and has been frustrated by conspiracy theories about the elections office. \u201cIf there was any hint of scandal [at the office], I\u2019d be the first one down there. But there\u2019s never been anything.\u201d Toller declined the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview, citing his office\u2019s focus on preparations for early voting. The controversy in Shasta over the elections office is a more extreme version of an issue that experts have been sounding the alarm about for years. US elections officials are leaving at increasingly high rates after facing intense harassment and threats in the aftermath of the 2020 election and are being replaced by administrators with less experience and institutional knowledge. *** For 20 years, Shasta\u2019s elections had been managed by Cathy Darling Allen, one of the only Democrats elected to office in this region where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one. Allen\u2019s job, a non-partisan administrative role, radically changed after the 2020 election, when Trump refused to acknowledge his defeat. As an election-denial movement flourished locally and the county\u2019s governing body veered radically to the right, her office came under growing scrutiny and dealt with harassment and bullying. The evening of a local election in June 2022, someone placed a camera outside her office. Allen was re-elected with almost 70% of the vote that year. But she was frequently villainized by the far-right majority on the board of supervisors, which had set out to dramatically change how elections are conducted in Shasta county. In early 2023, the county board of supervisors cancelled its contract with Dominion Voting Systems, the company maligned by Trump and his supporters, without a replacement, and attempted to implement a costly and error-prone hand-counting method. Soon after, the state thwarted those efforts with the passage of a bill preventing counties from using manual tallies in most elections. Far-right county officials insisted they would use their hand-counting method in November 2023 regardless, and falsely claimed elections were being manipulated; Allen made clear she would follow state law, and the election ultimately unfolded without issue. Many voters heralded Allen\u2019s commitment to upholding election law in the face of unprecedented attacks. People routinely stopped her in public to express their appreciation, she previously told the Guardian, and often sent cards and notes of gratitude. But Allen\u2019s position also made her the No 1 enemy of Shasta county\u2019s far right, one local journalist wrote. In February, Allen shocked the county when she announced plans to retire with two years left in her term. She had been diagnosed with heart failure, she said. \u201cAn essential part of recovering from this diagnosis is stress reduction. As many election officials could probably tell you right now, that\u2019s a tough ask to balance with election administration in the current environment,\u201d she wrote in a letter to the community. *** Francescut, Allen\u2019s deputy, seemed an obvious choice for her replacement, given her more than 16 years\u2019 experience assisting with more than 30 elections in the county. She had been training for the role for years and took on Allen\u2019s job \u2013 in addition to her own \u2013 and oversaw the March election. She had the support of her ex-boss, elections clerks in two other counties, as well as a conservative former county supervisor. The board of supervisors held public interviews with eight candidates, including Francescut, Toller and Clint Curtis, an attorney and former congressional candidate who has long claimed he was once hired by a lawmaker to create a software that could rig elections. During public comment after the first day of interviews, an air of cynicism hung over the room. Several speakers urged the board to hire Francescut while acknowledging the supervisors had likely already made their decision. \u201cThe fix is in,\u201d one woman shouted from the audience. Board members took a combative approach with Francescut. One supervisor, Kevin Crye, attempted to coax her into criticizing her former boss, while another, Patrick Jones, accused her of \u201cmal-conduct\u201d. Their tone was hostile, said Sid, who characterized the public interviews as a \u201cdog and pony show\u201d. Francescut, who described the process as \u201chumbling\u201d, tried to focus on her values as a leader and on her work ethic, she said in an interview with the Guardian in June. \u201cI prepared myself the best I could to get the job I\u2019ve been striving to get for the last 16 years. Even if right now isn\u2019t the right time. I have community support behind me.\u201d In his interview with the panel, Toller said he would bring what he described as necessary change to the elections office, and suggested he would not mind pushing back against state law. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer that just because the secretary of state of California tells us a statute or regulation must be interpreted in a certain way, that\u2019s not the end of the story,\u201d he said. And then there was Curtis, who has advocated hand-counting and noted in his application he was a speaker at election events hosted by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow founder who has spent millions of dollars promoting lies about elections in the US. During the public hearing in June, a group of residents who have frequently spoken publicly on their concerns about vote tampering and their beliefs that elections are being rigged expressed their support for Curtis. None of the speakers who offered public comment spoke in favor of Toller. Still, Toller\u2019s appointment was a win for critics of the elections office in a year with relatively few victories for them. Patrick Jones, the official who has most aggressively condemned voting machines and spread misinformation, in March lost his bid for re-election by a landslide. In June, a county judge dismissed a lawsuit from a failed supervisor candidate who sued the elections office, claiming that an error in the placement of her name on the ballot cost her the election. She had sought to change the outcome of the election. \u201cThe lack of evidence was profound,\u201d the judge said of the case. A state court denied her attempt to appeal the ruling. *** Those who buy into conspiracy theories about voter fraud and stolen elections are not giving up on their efforts to remake the voting process in the region. The local elections commission recently recommended the county limit absentee ballots and return to one-day voting. Toller, in a move that may have surprised some of his supporters, rejected that idea and said doing so would not comply with state law. Those items will come before the board of supervisors for consideration. With a new elections official, a deeply divided county and an intense presidential contest, the office faces busy and daunting months ahead. Between November 2023 and June more than a third of the elections office\u2019s 21 staffers left. But Francescut has said that she plans to stay put \u2013 at least through November \u2013 to help maintain stability in the office and support Toller as he learns the ropes. \u201cIn the long run, ensuring that the November election is where it needs to be and the voters are able to vote, that\u2019s the biggest priority right now in my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s way more important than me as an individual.\u201d",

As Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus&amp;ab_channel=TomR35\">once said</a>, it\u2019s delicate, but potent.

This was one year into the life of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 console, and in the absence of a new Halo, Gears was the one big exclusive lined up for the holiday season. It had to be a system-seller, and not every game can do that. \u201cYou need a game that a person can point out to their spouse, like, \u2018Look how cool this is, look at these features,\u2019\u201d Bleszinski says to me today. You can understand Microsoft\u2019s worry: does a person see a gratuitous amount of blood in a game trailer, turn to their partner and say, \u201cLook how cool this is\u201d?</p> <p>\u201c[The] contention about the saw is that it\u2019s a little over-the-top gory,\u201d a Microsoft executive said in the MTV film. Gears\u2019 producer replied: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the kind of branding we were going for, I thought.\u201d</p> <p>Epic got its way: Bleszinski demonstrated the in-game rifle chainsaw live on stage at E3, to a rave response. That weapon might have defined Gears forever if not for two things. The first is that Bleszinski was sad.</p>    <p>Before Jules\u2019 Mad World was the Gears<em> </em>song, it was on repeat in Bleszinski\u2019s Dodge Viper. As he laboured on Gears<em> </em>and dreamed of virtual bloodshed, he languished in the death throes of a failing marriage. At night he tooled around North Carolina in his sports car, with Mad World and Evanescence\u2019s My Immortal on a mix CD.

Gears is still his signature work, and its violent masculinity coexists with melancholy. His impression of a London built on Viking and Roman ruins inspired the \u201cdestroyed beauty\u201d of Gears\u2019 post-apocalyptic landscapes; his longing for his own lost father was reflected in Marcus Fenix; the desperation of his unhappy marriage became, grandiosely, the desperation of humanity\u2019s struggle for survival. (Bleszinski\u2019s then-wife was transmuted, uncharitably, into a female monster called the Berserker. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the Berserker is angry and blind,\u201d Bleszinski says.)</p> <p>The second thing was that Microsoft opened its pocketbook.

      "bodyText": "At the Xbox Games Showcase this June, Microsoft debuted a trailer for the eighth game in the violent, grandiose and unexpectedly maudlin Gears of War series: a prequel. The sight of series heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as younger men is \u201can emotional homecoming like no other\u201d, as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox blog put it. But the real tug at the heartstrings comes with the first notes of a slow, instrumental rendition of Tears for Fears\u2019 Mad World. \u201cAs a 41-year-old man, that piano got me tearing up,\u201d wrote one YouTube commenter. It\u2019s a throwback to the original, iconic Gears of War trailer from 2006, in which a lonesome Fenix picks through his ruined world to Gary Jules\u2019 plaintive cover of the same song. And you can\u2019t blame Microsoft for leaning on nostalgia. As Mad Men\u2019s Don Draper once said, it\u2019s delicate, but potent. Eighteen years on, that Gears of War trailer is still some of the most effective video game marketing ever. It really spoke to the melancholy heart that beats within this superficially macho game. In 2006, Cliff Bleszinski was a 31-year-old game designer at North Carolina\u2019s Epic Games, making a shooter about a fraternal bond of Herculean soldiers who vivisect aliens with chainsaws mounted on assault rifles. \u201cI just wanted to see a gun with a chainsaw on it,\u201d he explained in a Microsoft-produced promotional film aired on MTV. \u201cThat sounds like a chocolate-and-peanut-butter situation to me.\u201d Playtesters at Microsoft, the game\u2019s publisher, had registered concerns that the chainsaw produced \u201ca gratuitous amount of blood\u201d. This was one year into the life of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 console, and in the absence of a new Halo, Gears was the one big exclusive lined up for the holiday season. It had to be a system-seller, and not every game can do that. \u201cYou need a game that a person can point out to their spouse, like, \u2018Look how cool this is, look at these features,\u2019\u201d Bleszinski says to me today. You can understand Microsoft\u2019s worry: does a person see a gratuitous amount of blood in a game trailer, turn to their partner and say, \u201cLook how cool this is\u201d? \u201c[The] contention about the saw is that it\u2019s a little over-the-top gory,\u201d a Microsoft executive said in the MTV film. Gears\u2019 producer replied: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the kind of branding we were going for, I thought.\u201d Epic got its way: Bleszinski demonstrated the in-game rifle chainsaw live on stage at E3, to a rave response. That weapon might have defined Gears forever if not for two things. The first is that Bleszinski was sad. Before Jules\u2019 Mad World was the Gears song, it was on repeat in Bleszinski\u2019s Dodge Viper. As he laboured on Gears and dreamed of virtual bloodshed, he languished in the death throes of a failing marriage. At night he tooled around North Carolina in his sports car, with Mad World and Evanescence\u2019s My Immortal on a mix CD. Once, a friend in the passenger seat \u2013 as Bleszinski recalled in his 2022 memoir \u2013 jabbed at the dashboard until it spat the disc out. \u201cThis is sad shit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to get you help.\u201d Perhaps improbably, Gears was the help he needed. \u201cI believe sometimes the best work comes out of tortured artists and sadness,\u201d Bleszinski says. Gears is still his signature work, and its violent masculinity coexists with melancholy. His impression of a London built on Viking and Roman ruins inspired the \u201cdestroyed beauty\u201d of Gears\u2019 post-apocalyptic landscapes; his longing for his own lost father was reflected in Marcus Fenix; the desperation of his unhappy marriage became, grandiosely, the desperation of humanity\u2019s struggle for survival.

      "body": "<p>Geordie Greep has a knack for proclamations. When the 25-year-old musician meets me at a bar in Soho, London, he barely speaks above a whisper over the course of our 90-minute conversation \u2013 a surprising contrast to the charismatic frontman of Black Midi he\u2019s presented as for the past few years. But less than 10 minutes in he\u2019s already dished out a handful of loosely interconnected mantras for modern life: \u201cThe metric of whether it\u2019s a good bar is if you feel like it\u2019s someone\u2019s house\u201d; \u201cThere\u2019s no saying sorry in America \u2013 they think you\u2019re taking the piss\u201d; \u201cThe best thing about London is that everyone\u2019s really nice \u2013 in America, everyone\u2019s looking for a chance to get ahead\u201d. Spend a day with Greep and you\u2019d probably end up with a pamphlet\u2019s-worth of rules on how to live.</p> <p>Greep\u2019s debut solo album \u2013 coming after he unceremoniously announced Black Midi\u2019s disbandment on Instagram earlier this year \u2013 is its own proclamation, too: on the state of music, manhood and \u201cThe Greep\u201d, the Brit School kid who in the space of a few short years became one of indie rock\u2019s most feverishly loved and fervently hated frontmen. The album is called The New Sound though it\u2019s actually a gloriously rendered pastiche of a lot of old sounds \u2013 Steely Dan studio sleaze, fizzy Tropic\u00e1lia, the dishevelled glamour and acerbic wit of early-60s Judy Garland.</p> <p>\u201cWith Black Midi, a lot of the time people would say \u2018I\u2019m into it, but it\u2019s a bit hard to listen to\u2019, and I said, \u2018Yeah, I can see what you\u2019re saying,\u2019\u201d he says. During their tenure \u2013 seven years in which they hit the Top 30 of the UK albums chart, were Mercury prize-nominated, garnered a huge and rabid online fanbase, and were proclaimed the future of rock on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 Greep always figured that confusing lyrics and obscured vocals weren\u2019t a problem, because people could always \u201cread the lyrics sheet. And one day I was like, \u2018Wait, that is so dumb. Music is meant to be listened to.

      "bodyText": "Geordie Greep has a knack for proclamations. When the 25-year-old musician meets me at a bar in Soho, London, he barely speaks above a whisper over the course of our 90-minute conversation \u2013 a surprising contrast to the charismatic frontman of Black Midi he\u2019s presented as for the past few years. But less than 10 minutes in he\u2019s already dished out a handful of loosely interconnected mantras for modern life: \u201cThe metric of whether it\u2019s a good bar is if you feel like it\u2019s someone\u2019s house\u201d; \u201cThere\u2019s no saying sorry in America \u2013 they think you\u2019re taking the piss\u201d; \u201cThe best thing about London is that everyone\u2019s really nice \u2013 in America, everyone\u2019s looking for a chance to get ahead\u201d. Spend a day with Greep and you\u2019d probably end up with a pamphlet\u2019s-worth of rules on how to live. Greep\u2019s debut solo album \u2013 coming after he unceremoniously announced Black Midi\u2019s disbandment on Instagram earlier this year \u2013 is its own proclamation, too: on the state of music, manhood and \u201cThe Greep\u201d, the Brit School kid who in the space of a few short years became one of indie rock\u2019s most feverishly loved and fervently hated frontmen. The album is called The New Sound though it\u2019s actually a gloriously rendered pastiche of a lot of old sounds \u2013 Steely Dan studio sleaze, fizzy Tropic\u00e1lia, the dishevelled glamour and acerbic wit of early-60s Judy Garland. \u201cWith Black Midi, a lot of the time people would say \u2018I\u2019m into it, but it\u2019s a bit hard to listen to\u2019, and I said, \u2018Yeah, I can see what you\u2019re saying,\u2019\u201d he says. During their tenure \u2013 seven years in which they hit the Top 30 of the UK albums chart, were Mercury prize-nominated, garnered a huge and rabid online fanbase, and were proclaimed the future of rock on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 Greep always figured that confusing lyrics and obscured vocals weren\u2019t a problem, because people could always \u201cread the lyrics sheet.

      "body": "<p>\u201cMany people here,\u201d asserted Frank Schmidt, \u201cdon\u2019t even know what my team achieved here today, playing for a result until the end against a Champions League participant. I would like to encourage everyone to look at their performance a little. It was sensational.\u201d</p> \n<p>RB Leipzig emerged victorious from this Sunday meeting of European competition recoverers in southern Germany which, in context, had no business being as satisfying and as enduringly interesting as it turned out to be. Yet here was coach Schmidt feeling he had the unusual task of defending his team after a historic week in Heidenheim\u2019s history, which almost had an even better ending.</p> \n<p>In weeks like this, it should not be difficult to recall exactly how far Schmidt and his team have come. The coach\u2019s tenure at Heidenheim is less an era and more an odyssey. Since he took the helm in 2007, the club have risen from the fifth tier to first, begun to establish themselves in the Bundesliga and even reached Europe. On Thursday night, Voith-Arena hosted its first European group-stage game, as the on-loan teenage star Paul Wanner put in the rebound from his own saved penalty late on to beat Olimpija Ljubljana in the Conference League.</p> \n<p>Maybe that\u2019s it. Perhaps Heidenheim and Schmidt have picked up the age-old problem of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, if in a very different arena, desensitising their public by making the extraordinary every day. It might have been perceived differently had Jan Sch\u00f6ppner\u2019s second-half piledriver flown six inches lower rather than smacking the crossbar, giving the hosts a deserved equaliser. Instead Lo\u00efs Openda\u2019s vicious finish from an Antonio Nusa pass proved to be the decider, as well as an eloquent expression of Leipzig\u2019s far greater means (\u201cthey have maybe 12 times our squad value,\u201d pondered Schmidt) and their higher ambitions.</p> \n<p>Heidenheim and Leipzig are two clubs with, ostensibly, much in common; authors of improbable rises up the levels of German football and now in the Bundesliga to upset the status quo, albeit with different senses of timing. To define them thus, however, would to ignore almost all of the detail. Heidenheim supporters made their distaste for the RB concept clear with a matchday protest as long ago as 2013, when the two sides met for the first time back in the third tier. Last week, before their latest visit, 24-hour security was deployed at Voith-Arena to prevent a repeat of last season, when masked assailants broke in on the eve of the game and sprayed the away end with butyric acid, making it smell of vomit even post-clean (which also lumbered the club with a \u20ac15,000 fine).</p> \n<p>Leipzig have long since grown used to the opprobrium. Yet the club\u2019s culture is to demand more of themselves than focus on outside perception. The morning after the deflating home Champions League defeat to 10-man Juventus, all the management big dogs convened, including Mario G\u00f3mez and the supervisory board chairman Oliver Mintzlaff, to pick through the bones of it. Marco Rose is a Leipzig native and has done good work at the club. Yet each setback brings analysis, and he will never be safe in his seat. Mintzlaff complained in the buildup to Sunday\u2019s game that whenever an opportunity opens up for Leipzig to thrust towards the top, they never manage to take it. Here, with Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund having dropped points and Bayern Munich about to, they got the necessary done.</p> \n<p>They also picked themselves up from setbacks, with what would have been an opener for Benjamin Sesko just after half-time ruled out for a debatable foul on Willi Orban. Openda, who \u2013 like the team\u2019s star Xavi Simons \u2013 has not looked quite as sharp as he might after a summer at the Euros, picked up the slack, underlining the quality at their disposal. In fact, that still-unbeaten Leipzig sit level with leaders Bayern on points despite the knowledge they can still get better, stronger and sharper underlines that their depth is perhaps greater than it ever has been.</p> \n<p>Heidenheim do not have such luxuries, as Schmidt would like some fans to remember. But Sunday highlighted that like Leipzig, their ambition and motivation still burns bright despite a hefty workload.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5a4e23b6-bca0-419c-b761-edd2949e9990\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Augsburg 2-1 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Bayer Leverkusen 2-2 Holstein Kiel, Bochum 1-3 Wolfsburg, Union Berlin 2-1 Borussia Dortmund,&nbsp; Werder Bremen 0-1 Freiburg, St Pauli 0-3 Mainz, Heidenheim 0-1 Leipzig, Eintracht Frankfurt 3-3 Bayern Munich, Stuttgart 1-1 Hoffenheim</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 It should have been a day of celebration for Leverkusen, as they marked two years in charge for Xabi Alonso (and 100 games at the helm), plus the club\u2019s 120th birthday, which was heralded by the team wearing a special-edition retro jersey. Holstein Kiel should have been compliant opponents too and looked like they would be after going 2-0 down to Victor Boniface and Jonas Hofmann goals in the first eight minutes. Instead, a gutsy comeback from the promoted club gained them a point \u2013 the once-feted Fiete Arp netted the equaliser from the penalty spot \u2013 as Leverkusen gave away a two-goal lead in the Bundesliga for the third time this season, a huge setback after seemingly making big defensive strides against Bayern and Milan. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t recognise the danger in some situations,\u201d lamented the returning Hofmann. \u201cWith an attitude like this and performance like this, we won\u2019t win anything,\u201d said skipper Lukas Hradecky bluntly. \u201cI hope everyone thinks about it and wakes up during the international break. It can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 For the third game in succession Bayern dazzled and dominated against good opponents and, once again, they didn\u2019t win, victims of league top scorer Omar Marmoush\u2019s stoppage-time equaliser to give him a brace and his Eintracht Frankfurt a thrilling 3-3 draw. Much as against Leverkusen and Aston Villa, Bayern were again inspired by Michael Olise and should have been out of sight (they had 23 shots, with 13 on target, to Eintracht\u2019s six shots and four on target). Instead they wake to a Monday morning of doubts \u2013 not just due to the injuries picked up by Harry Kane, Dayot Upamecano and Mathys Tel, but over whether they can snare the trophies to match their talent, given the risks which they continue to take under Vincent Kompany (\u201cthis is Bayern Munich\u2019s identity and you don\u2019t change your identity,\u201d said a defiant Max Eberl).</p> \n<p>\u2022 For crisis rather than light fretting, enter the consistently inconsistent Dortmund, who followed up dropping an avalanche of Champions League goals on Celtic with a colourless performance at Union Berlin, leading to a second straight away defeat in the Bundesliga. It has become almost predictable, as Bild\u2019s Patrick Kleinmann wrote: \u201cQuite a few were already certain at the final whistle on Tuesday that, despite and precisely because of the success (against Celtic), the next setback would follow at the Alte F\u00f6rsterei.\u201d BVB again defended poorly (\u201cwe are conceding far too many goals,\u201d admitted Nuri Sahin) but that is only the tip of the iceberg for a team who ran 9km less than an energised Union. Sahin needs time, but he also needs better guidance.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Elsewhere it was a great weekend for Jonathan Burkhardt, who scored twice in Mainz\u2019s 3-0 win at St Pauli to continue his strong start and then got a first Germany call-up from Julian Nagelsmann hours later, replacing the injured Kai Havertz.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "\u201cMany people here,\u201d asserted Frank Schmidt, \u201cdon\u2019t even know what my team achieved here today, playing for a result until the end against a Champions League participant. I would like to encourage everyone to look at their performance a little. It was sensational.\u201d RB Leipzig emerged victorious from this Sunday meeting of European competition recoverers in southern Germany which, in context, had no business being as satisfying and as enduringly interesting as it turned out to be. Yet here was coach Schmidt feeling he had the unusual task of defending his team after a historic week in Heidenheim\u2019s history, which almost had an even better ending. In weeks like this, it should not be difficult to recall exactly how far Schmidt and his team have come. The coach\u2019s tenure at Heidenheim is less an era and more an odyssey. Since he took the helm in 2007, the club have risen from the fifth tier to first, begun to establish themselves in the Bundesliga and even reached Europe. On Thursday night, Voith-Arena hosted its first European group-stage game, as the on-loan teenage star Paul Wanner put in the rebound from his own saved penalty late on to beat Olimpija Ljubljana in the Conference League. Maybe that\u2019s it. Perhaps Heidenheim and Schmidt have picked up the age-old problem of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, if in a very different arena, desensitising their public by making the extraordinary every day. It might have been perceived differently had Jan Sch\u00f6ppner\u2019s second-half piledriver flown six inches lower rather than smacking the crossbar, giving the hosts a deserved equaliser. Instead Lo\u00efs Openda\u2019s vicious finish from an Antonio Nusa pass proved to be the decider, as well as an eloquent expression of Leipzig\u2019s far greater means (\u201cthey have maybe 12 times our squad value,\u201d pondered Schmidt) and their higher ambitions. Heidenheim and Leipzig are two clubs with, ostensibly, much in common; authors of improbable rises up the levels of German football and now in the Bundesliga to upset the status quo, albeit with different senses of timing. To define them thus, however, would to ignore almost all of the detail. Heidenheim supporters made their distaste for the RB concept clear with a matchday protest as long ago as 2013, when the two sides met for the first time back in the third tier. Last week, before their latest visit, 24-hour security was deployed at Voith-Arena to prevent a repeat of last season, when masked assailants broke in on the eve of the game and sprayed the away end with butyric acid, making it smell of vomit even post-clean (which also lumbered the club with a \u20ac15,000 fine). Leipzig have long since grown used to the opprobrium. Yet the club\u2019s culture is to demand more of themselves than focus on outside perception. The morning after the deflating home Champions League defeat to 10-man Juventus, all the management big dogs convened, including Mario G\u00f3mez and the supervisory board chairman Oliver Mintzlaff, to pick through the bones of it. Marco Rose is a Leipzig native and has done good work at the club. Yet each setback brings analysis, and he will never be safe in his seat. Mintzlaff complained in the buildup to Sunday\u2019s game that whenever an opportunity opens up for Leipzig to thrust towards the top, they never manage to take it. Here, with Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund having dropped points and Bayern Munich about to, they got the necessary done. They also picked themselves up from setbacks, with what would have been an opener for Benjamin Sesko just after half-time ruled out for a debatable foul on Willi Orban. Openda, who \u2013 like the team\u2019s star Xavi Simons \u2013 has not looked quite as sharp as he might after a summer at the Euros, picked up the slack, underlining the quality at their disposal. In fact, that still-unbeaten Leipzig sit level with leaders Bayern on points despite the knowledge they can still get better, stronger and sharper underlines that their depth is perhaps greater than it ever has been. Heidenheim do not have such luxuries, as Schmidt would like some fans to remember. But Sunday highlighted that like Leipzig, their ambition and motivation still burns bright despite a hefty workload. Talking points \u2022 It should have been a day of celebration for Leverkusen, as they marked two years in charge for Xabi Alonso (and 100 games at the helm), plus the club\u2019s 120th birthday, which was heralded by the team wearing a special-edition retro jersey. Holstein Kiel should have been compliant opponents too and looked like they would be after going 2-0 down to Victor Boniface and Jonas Hofmann goals in the first eight minutes. Instead, a gutsy comeback from the promoted club gained them a point \u2013 the once-feted Fiete Arp netted the equaliser from the penalty spot \u2013 as Leverkusen gave away a two-goal lead in the Bundesliga for the third time this season, a huge setback after seemingly making big defensive strides against Bayern and Milan. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t recognise the danger in some situations,\u201d lamented the returning Hofmann. \u201cWith an attitude like this and performance like this, we won\u2019t win anything,\u201d said skipper Lukas Hradecky bluntly. \u201cI hope everyone thinks about it and wakes up during the international break. It can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d \u2022 For the third game in succession Bayern dazzled and dominated against good opponents and, once again, they didn\u2019t win, victims of league top scorer Omar Marmoush\u2019s stoppage-time equaliser to give him a brace and his Eintracht Frankfurt a thrilling 3-3 draw. Much as against Leverkusen and Aston Villa, Bayern were again inspired by Michael Olise and should have been out of sight (they had 23 shots, with 13 on target, to Eintracht\u2019s six shots and four on target). Instead they wake to a Monday morning of doubts \u2013 not just due to the injuries picked up by Harry Kane, Dayot Upamecano and Mathys Tel, but over whether they can snare the trophies to match their talent, given the risks which they continue to take under Vincent Kompany (\u201cthis is Bayern Munich\u2019s identity and you don\u2019t change your identity,\u201d said a defiant Max Eberl). \u2022 For crisis rather than light fretting, enter the consistently inconsistent Dortmund, who followed up dropping an avalanche of Champions League goals on Celtic with a colourless performance at Union Berlin, leading to a second straight away defeat in the Bundesliga. It has become almost predictable, as Bild\u2019s Patrick Kleinmann wrote: \u201cQuite a few were already certain at the final whistle on Tuesday that, despite and precisely because of the success (against Celtic), the next setback would follow at the Alte F\u00f6rsterei.\u201d BVB again defended poorly (\u201cwe are conceding far too many goals,\u201d admitted Nuri Sahin) but that is only the tip of the iceberg for a team who ran 9km less than an energised Union. Sahin needs time, but he also needs better guidance. \u2022 Elsewhere it was a great weekend for Jonathan Burkhardt, who scored twice in Mainz\u2019s 3-0 win at St Pauli to continue his strong start and then got a first Germany call-up from Julian Nagelsmann hours later, replacing the injured Kai Havertz.",

      "bodyText": "The Nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2024 has been awarded to two scientists for their work on tiny RNA molecules that help cells control which proteins they produce. Victor Ambros of the University of Massachusetts medical school, and Gary Ruvkun of Harvard medical school and Massachusetts general hospital, have been awarded the prize for the discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Announced by the Nobel assembly at Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm, Sweden, the winners will share equally a prize of 11m Swedish kronor (about \u00a3810,000). Their work helped explain how, despite all our cells carrying the same DNA, they can produce different proteins and have different characteristics. For example, nerve cells and muscle cells are highly specialised for different functions. \u201cThe seminal discovery of microRNA has introduced a new and unexpected mechanism of gene regulation,\u201d said Olle K\u00e4mpe, vice-chair of the Nobel committee for physiology or medicine. \u201cMicroRNAs are important for our understanding of embryological development, normal cell physiology, and diseases such as cancer.\u201d Inside the nucleus of our cells, genetic information is stored as the double-stranded molecule, DNA.

For many years scientists thought they had the answer in proteins called transcription factors. These bind to DNA and either activate or prevent the production of mRNA. But as Ambros and Ruvkun revealed, that was not the full story. Working with a type of tiny roundworm known as C.elegans the pair independently shed light on another mechanism, publishing seminal papers in the early 1990s. Their research showed that tiny stretches of RNA, known as microRNA, could directly bind to mRNA, preventing the instructions for the corresponding protein from being \u201cread\u201d by protein-making machinery. \u201cFor a long time, however, microRNA was believed to be an oddity, peculiar to C.elegans,\u201d said K\u00e4mpe.

Ambros and Ruvkun are no strangers to each other: the pair carried out postdoctoral research at the same time in the laboratory of Robert Horvitz, who himself shared the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2002. Prof Venki Ramakrishnan, who shared the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2009 for his work elucidating the structure of the cell\u2019s protein-making apparatus, welcomed the news. \u201cThis is a very well deserved and long awaited prize which shows that small RNAs can regulate which genes are expressed in different types of cells.

But, he added, \u201cIt is a pity that David Baulcombe, whose lab discovered a similar phenomenon in plants and shared the 2008 Lasker award with Ambros and Ruvkun, was not included in the prize.\u201d Thomas Perlmann, secretary general of the Nobel assembly, said he was able to reach Ruvkun in the US on Monday morning, waking the scientist. \u201cHis wife answered, and it took a long time before he came to the phone and sounded very tired, but he quite rapidly was quite excited and happy when he understood what it was all about,\u201d Perlmann said, adding he had not yet been able to reach Ambros. \u201cI left a message on his mobile phone and hope he gives me a call soon,\u201d he said. The 2024 Nobel prize in physics will be announced on Tuesday, followed by the chemistry prize on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "As the sun began to set at Sydney\u2019s town hall, some people quietly lit candles while a person began reading the first few stanzas of a poem. Calls for resistance echoed throughout the city\u2019s central business district. An 18-year-old activist, Hussein Abdullah, took the microphone, identifying himself as Lebanese-Muslim. \u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d he started. \u201cI\u2019m outraged \u2013 365 days of genocide, 365 days since the world abandoned us. The only other emotion that has outweighed my rage is sadness. \u201cThere are no words, no speeches, no actions grand enough to capture a collective emotion. Grief has made itself our constant companion.\u201d It was a sombre crowd who gathered on Monday evening for a vigil \u201cto honour and mourn and remember\u201d Palestinian and Lebanese lives lost in Israel\u2019s latest military campaign that began almost 12 months ago. It began with a minute\u2019s silence, which was followed by a multi-faith prayer from members of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim community. A heavy police presence surrounded the gathering. A Kaddish \u2013 a Jewish prayer praising God, traditionally said in memory of the dead \u2013 was read first. Then Costandi Bastoli, born in Jerusalem and director of Palestinian Christians in Australia, spoke. \u201cWe refuse to let any unforgiveness or hatred to take hold,\u201d he said. \u201cMay we preserve our hearts from hatred and cultivate a desire for good, for all.\u201d Ahmed Ouf, a councillor at Cumberland council, asked the crowd to raise their hands. He recited supplications in Arabic \u201cfor the kids, the women, the men, the people\u201d of Gaza, Palestine and Lebanon. The evening concluded with singing of Palestinian and Lebanese resistance anthems as the crowd waved candles and lights from their smartphones. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The vigil followed protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane on Sunday, a day before the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks by Hamas in southern Israel. The New South Wales police applied to the state\u2019s supreme court last week to prevent both events from going ahead. But pro-Palestine organisers reached a last-minute agreement to proceed with the 6 October rally as well as the standing vigil on 7 October, which did not require a protest permit. \u201cI\u2019m beyond proud of what the movement has done yesterday and today,\u201d Jana Fayyad from Palestine Action Group, which organised the town hall event, told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe showed the state, we showed the police, we showed the media that their ploys to try to villainise us didn\u2019t work.\u201d Waiting for the vigil to begin, and wearing a Palestinian flag around his neck, Joseph, a Palestinian Australian, said there \u201cwas too much suffering going on\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of relatives who have been displaced in Gaza, the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been one year. Too many dead. We don\u2019t want this to spread even further.\u201d More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Israel during the 7 October attacks and subsequent military confrontation. In response, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground invasion of Gaza has killed almost 42,000 people and decimated neighbourhoods, displacing 1.9 million people and leaving a further 500,000 with catastrophic levels of food insecurity, according to local health ministry sources. The Israeli military has been conducting intense aerial campaigns in south Lebanon and the capital, Beirut. About 600 people attended a rally at Lakemba mosque in Sydney\u2019s south-west, many bearing Lebanese and Palestinian flags and others with Palestinian symbols. A heavy police presence included riot squad officers and a helicopter. The Lebanese Muslim Association\u2019s secretary, Gamel Kheir, described the vigil as \u201cexactly what\u2019s happening in the eastern suburbs, respecting the lives that have been lost\u201d. \u201cThis is not a celebration of any kind and for people and the politicians to make it out as if we\u2019re celebrating some atrocity is so disrespectful,\u201d Kheir said. The event aimed to mark a \u201cdifficult 12 months\u201d for those with links to Palestine, according to an organiser, Faraz Nomani. \u201cThere\u2019s catastrophic levels of death and destruction, we\u2019re here today to mark the fact that is was on this day last year that that sequence of events started,\u201d Nomani said. No arrests had been made at protests or vigils in Sydney as of 9pm Monday, police confirmed. \u2013 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",

      "body": "<p>At around midday on 19 August 1949, wreathed in thick mist, a British European Airways DC-3 going from Belfast to Manchester flew into a hillside on Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District, near Oldham. All the crew and 21 of the 29 passengers died on impact or soon afterwards. Eight passengers survived, including a young boy and his parents, although, devastatingly, their younger child was one of the fatalities. That surviving boy became my friend and statistical colleague, Prof Stephen Evans.</p> <p>I think we would agree that Stephen was lucky. But what do we mean by \u201cluck\u201d? We might say that someone has been lucky, or unlucky, if they have benefited or been harmed by something that was unpredictable and beyond their control. Luck has been called \u201cthe operation of chance, taken personally\u201d.</p> <p>Luck comes in three main flavours. Philosophers have identified \u201ccircumstantial luck\u201d, meaning being in the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time \u2013 such as Stephen\u2019s family taking that particular flight. Then there\u2019s \u201cresultant or outcome luck\u201d, where in a particular situation some people have good and&nbsp;some have bad outcomes due to factors beyond&nbsp;their&nbsp;control. Stephen had the good resultant luck of surviving.</p> <p>But perhaps the most important is \u201cconstitutive luck\u201d, which covers all the fortunate or unfortunate circumstances of your very existence; the period of history in which you were born, your parents, background, genes and character traits. So where was Stephen\u2019s constitutive luck? He told me that his father\u2019s experiences in the RAF led him to insist that the family sat at the back of the plane \u2013 and the only survivors were seated at the back. He had the right parents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People tend to overestimate the role of their efforts and acquired skills, whereas they should mainly be grateful for their constitutive luck</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In another remarkable example, on Christmas Eve 1971, 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/06/a-bolt-of-lightning-struck-my-plane-and-i-plunged-3000m-into-a-rainforest\">Juliane</a> Koepcke had the bad circumstantial luck of being on Lansa flight 508 when it was struck by lightning over the Amazon jungle. She was thrown out, still strapped into her seat, and fell 3,000 metres (9,800ft). She had, however, amazing resultant luck when the thick jungle canopy broke her fall and she survived, although 90 other people, including her mother, died. And, just like Stephen, Juliane had constitutive luck. Her parents, who were ornithological researchers, had brought her up in the Amazon, and she had the necessary skills not only to look after her wounds, but also to journey for 11 days in the jungle until she found an encampment.</p> <p>In the political arena, leaders feel the need to express complete confidence in the effects of their actions, but if they recognised the major role of chance in what happens, they might try to nurture more resilience to the unexpected. Such humility can also be valuable at a personal level. When attributing reasons for any success they have, people tend to overestimate the role of their efforts and acquired skills, whereas they should mainly be grateful for their constitutive luck.</p> <p>I consider I have had great constitutive luck regarding the time, place and family into which I was born. But that&nbsp;presupposes the existential luck of being here at all. All of us have arisen through an extraordinary sequence of chance events that could easily have turned out very differently.</p> <p>My grandfather had the bad constitutive luck to be just the right age to join up at the start of the first world war, and he ended up as a gas officer for the British 104th Brigade, inspecting gas defences and weaponry north of the village of Passchendaelein the Ypres region of Belgium on the western front. He travelled roads and trenches that had been targeted by German artillery, and in the six weeks he was in post, his diary variously recorded: \u201cNarrow escape on return journey\u201d, \u201cLucky to get through in time\u201d, \u201cArtillery strafe\u201d. On 29 January 1918, his circumstantial luck inevitably ran out. Injured, he was taken to No 64 casualty clearing station.</p> <p>But his resultant luck did him a favour. He was categorised as unfit for frontline duties and spent the rest of the war well behind the lines. Meanwhile, his old battalion, the 18th Lancashire Fusiliers, was moved to the Somme in northern France, which was supposed to be a quiet area, a respite from the battles of 1916 that led to around 1 million casualties. They&nbsp;arrived just in time to face the massive spring offensive of 1918, fighting a desperate rearguard action and then going over the top in vain attempts to recapture&nbsp;territory.</p> <p>Of course, if one of those shells had fallen a bit closer, or if my grandfather had had to lead his men into attack, I would not be here to tell the story. And this is only one of the long chain of fortuitous events that led to my existence: my mother being captured by pirates in China and later escaping Shanghai in 1937 under shellfire; my parents meeting during the war; my father closely avoiding plane crashes in the RAF and then nearly dying of tuberculosis. Then, when a cold snap hit the UK in November 1952, they were living in a barely heated stone cottage, with no television and nothing to do but go to bed early to keep warm \u2026 and here I am.</p> <p>We can go even further in considering our existential luck. Humanity would probably not exist if an asteroid had not happened to hit the Earth 66m years ago, altering the climate and wiping out the non-bird dinosaurs, allowing mammals to develop.

Our entire universe only exists because of the \u201ccosmic luck\u201d of physical constants being in a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zone, and the ratio of matter to antimatter allowing things to coalesce after the big bang.</p> <p>Of course, we wouldn\u2019t be here to muse on our good fortune if this chain of events had not occurred, and this \u201csurvivorship bias\u201d means that it is philosophically challenging and, I believe, rather pointless, to talk about the probability of our existence. But perhaps the fragility of this chain should induce some humility about our self-importance.</p> <p>In short, once we properly acknowledge our existential and constitutive luck, we are left with a daunting but hopeful task: to try to make the best of the hand we\u2019ve been dealt.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Sir David Spiegelhalter is emeritus professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge and author of&nbsp;The Art of Uncertainty: How to Navigate Chance, Ignorance, Risk and Luck (Pelican).

      "body": "<p>If genealogy is destiny, as Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-immigrants-are-poisoning-blood-country-biden-campaign-liken-rcna130141\">believes</a>, then \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d \u2013 a phrase Trump repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-immigrants-are-poisoning-blood-country-biden-campaign-liken-rcna130141\">uses</a> \u2013 determines the fate of nations. By Trump\u2019s logic, \u201cblood\u201d is the true and final measure. Trump, like Hitler, appears to classify people and countries by \u201cblood\u201d on a scale of their innate racial characteristics. Those features define the essence of nations, which are themselves delineated on a racial pyramid, with the purest and whitest, the most Aryan, at the pinnacle. True to his doctrine, the Nazis on his family tree must explain his penchant for Hitlerian rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cPoison in the blood\u201d was the core of Hitler\u2019s race doctrine as well. Hitler, too, believed it explained the rise and fall of civilizations. \u201cAll great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning,\u201d stated Hitler. It is also Trump\u2019s fundamental trope. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning the blood of our country, and you have people coming in, think of it, mental institutions all over the world are being emptied out into the United States,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-fox-interview-migrants.html\">said</a> on Fox News in March. \u201cJails and prisons are being emptied out into the United States. This is poisoning our country.\u201d</p> <p>Just recently, on 31 August, addressing Moms For Liberty, a rightwing group devoted to book-banning, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/donald-trump-at-moms-for-liberty-says-ivanka-hired-millions-of-people\">raised again </a>the menace of \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d: \u201cBut what\u2019s happening to our country, our country is being poisoned, poisoned!\u201d</p> <p>At a rally on 18 September, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/us/politics/trump-vance-nativist.html\">elaborated</a>: \u201cThey\u2019re coming from the Congo, they\u2019re coming from Africa, they\u2019re coming from the Middle East, they\u2019re coming from all over the world \u2013 Asia! A lot of it coming from Asia \u2026 And what\u2019s happening to our country is we\u2019re just destroying the fabric of life in our country, and we\u2019re not going to take it any longer, and you got to get rid of these people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<em>Blut und Boden</em>\u201d \u2013 blood and soil \u2013 was adopted as an official slogan of the Nazi regime to express its ideal of the nation rooted in the authentic unity of Aryan blood. The community of its people \u2013 <em>Volksgemeinschaft</em> \u2013 comprised only those of shared ethnic blood. Aliens corrupting the blood, principally Jews, but also Slavs, Poles and Roma, were described as disease carriers and \u201cvermin\u201d \u2013 <em>Volksshadlinge</em> \u2013 and posed an existential threat. Only those people of the blood belonged to the <em>Heimat</em>, a concept the Nazis cast as the racially pure home, intrinsic to <em>Blut und Boden</em>.</p> <p>Jews were <em>Heimatlos</em> \u2013 a people separate from the <em>Heimat</em>, without a true home, wanderers, cosmopolitans and globalists, a menace to the sanctity of the culture and the identity of the nation. They were not simply outsiders, or the Other. They were a different species \u2013 subhumans, <em>Untermenschen</em> \u2013 and must be eradicated to preserve the blood of the race. \u201cAlthough it has features similar to a human, the subhuman is lower on the spiritual and psychological scale than any animal,\u201d instructed a pamphlet entitled <em>Der Untermenschen</em>, illustrated with distorted photographs of these lower beings to depict the \u201cbestial\u201d nature of the subhuman Jews and Slavs. Four million copies were published in 1942 under the direction of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS.</p> <p>\u201cIn some cases, they\u2019re not people, in my opinion,\u201d Trump said this March. \u201cBut I\u2019m not allowed to say that because the radical left says that\u2019s a terrible thing to say. These are animals, OK, and we have to stop it.\u201d When they are removed, it will be, says Trump, \u201ca bloody story\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Friedrich Trump, Trump\u2019s grandfather, was deported from his native Bavaria as an undesirable and had his German citizenship revoked in 1905. Born in the town of Kallstadt in 1869, he dodged compulsory military service and emigrated to the United States in 1885. In and around Seattle and the Yukon, he owned restaurants and hotels that also did a brisk business as brothels. He returned to Germany a well-to-do man, married Elisabeth Christ, and took her to New York. But his wife did not like America and was homesick.</p> <p>He returned to Kallstadt to settle, but the authorities investigated him and ruled he should be banished for dodging military service. He wrote the Prince of Bavaria a letter begging to stay. \u201cWhy should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family.\u201d His plea was rejected. He was expelled. Upon his return to New York, in October 1905, a son, named Fred, was born. The Trump family saga began.</p> <p>The Trump and Christ families, with the exception of Friedrich and Elisabeth Trump, remained in Kallstadt. Many of them served in the Nazi army. Some were members of the Nazi party. Two of these relatives of Donald Trump are now known to have fought and died for Hitler. It appears that they were involved in the early stage of the Holocaust. (A certified professional genealogist distinguished in the field discovered these Trump Nazi soldiers through their research, but prefers to remain anonymous to avoid retribution.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If \u2018blood\u2019 is the biological marker of indelible personal, racial and ethnic character, by his own reasoning Trump\u2019s organic linkage to Nazis must inexorably explain his unapologetic Hitlerian politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ernst Christ, of the Christ branch of the family, a first cousin once removed of Donald Trump, the son of his great-uncle Johannes Christ, born in Kallstadt, was a Nazi. Unteroffizier Christ, a corporal, served in the 1st Company of the Panzerjager-Abteilung 670, an anti-tank unit that saw action on the western front in Belgium and France before being transferred to participate in the invasion of Russia.</p> <p>In July 1942, Christ\u2019s company occupied the town of Polodovitoye, about 100 kilometers south of Stalingrad. The Nazi soldiers rounded up about 100 Jewish families who had fled there from throughout the region. According to <a href=\"https://collections.yadvashem.org/en/untold-stories/killing-site/14627126\">Yad Vashem</a>, the Holocaust research center in Jerusalem, \u201cJews were loaded onto trucks, supposedly to be taken home. In fact, the victims were taken outside the village toward a ravine located 50 meters south of the village. There the victims were shot or probably severely wounded and then doused with some highly flammable liquid and then set on fire.\u201d A month later, on 13 August, Unteroffizier Christ was killed in battle.</p> <p>Three days before, on 10 August, the Wehrmacht reached the outskirts of Stalingrad. On that day, Private Eduard Freund, born in Kallstadt, was killed. He was the first cousin once removed of Donald Trump, the son of Donald\u2019s great-aunt Elisabetha Trump and Karl Phillip Freund. Private Freund served in a security unit, the fourth company of the Sicherungs-Battalion 790, whose task of guarding supply lines and police work quickly turned, like that of all such units, into the operation of wholesale brutal terror. He was one of those soldiers from \u201call walks of life\u201d described in historian Christopher Browning\u2019s Ordinary Men, who found themselves occupiers in eastern Europe to execute the regime\u2019s policies, often under the control of the SS, where \u201cmass murder and routine had become one\u201d, murdering partisans and civilians alike, and systematically killing Jews. The policy was justified in a phrase \u2013 <em>Jude gleich Bolschewik gleich Partisan</em>, or \u201cJew equals Bolshevik equals Partisan\u201d.</p> <p>If \u201cblood\u201d is the biological marker of indelible personal, racial and ethnic character, by his own reasoning Trump\u2019s organic linkage to Nazis must inexorably explain his unapologetic Hitlerian politics. On Fox News, in March, Howard Kurtz, the host of its show Media Buzz, interviewed Trump. \u201cWhy do you use words like \u2018vermin\u2019 and \u2018poisoning of the blood\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe press, as you know, immediately reacts to that by saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s the kind of language that Hitler and Mussolini used.\u2019\u201d To which Trump replied, \u201cBecause our country is being poisoned.\u201d</p> <p>But another Trump relative stands as a repudiation of Trump\u2019s theory. John G Trump, Fred\u2019s younger brother, did not go into real estate. Instead, he earned a master\u2019s degree in physics and a doctorate in electrical engineering. He became a co-inventor of high-voltage electrostatic generators, which during the second world war he applied to advancements in radar. He served as the secretary of the microwave committee created by the federal government\u2019s new National Defense Research Committee. After the war, he was appointed director of MIT\u2019s High-Voltage Research Laboratory, whose work he used in cancer research and on environmental pollution.</p> <p>His <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/38/9/90/403973/John-George-Trump\">obituary</a> in Physics Today in 1985 by a colleague paid tribute to his personal virtues as well as his scientific contributions: \u201cTrump\u2019s remarkable personality mix contributed to all of this achievement and success. He was remarkably even-tempered, with kindness and consideration to all, never threatening or arrogant in manner, even when under high stress. He was outwardly and in appearance the mildest of men, with a convincing persuasiveness, carefully marshaling all his facts.\u201d Furthermore, wrote his eulogist, \u201cHe cared very little for money and the trappings of money.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, John Trump was nothing at all like his bullying, ignorant and greedy nephew, who bears the middle name \u201cJohn\u201d, the only apparent correspondence between them. The resemblance, regardless of genetics, is nil. Yet Trump cites him as proof of his intelligence, a case positive of \u201cblood\u201d. \u201cI had an uncle who went to MIT who is a top professor. Dr John Trump. A genius,\u201d Trump said in <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/2PdPX/www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1506/30/acd.01.html\">an interview</a> with CNN in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s in my blood. I\u2019m smart. Great marks. Like really smart.\u201d From time to time, he brings up his uncle as his forebear of his own \u201cgenius\u201d. \u201cGood genes, very good genes. OK, very smart.\u201d</p> <p>Through his distorted lens, Trump\u2019s uncle, who was the opposite of a narcissist, serves as a rationale for his narcissism. He is held up as an example of Trump\u2019s \u201cblood\u201d mania, though the scientist in the family had no use for the sort of malevolent superstition the Nazis propagated and his nephew mimics.</p> <p>Trump designates his blood as superior and the blood of those he chooses to demonize as inferior. \u201cWell, I think I was born with a drive for success,\u201d Trump <a href=\"http://us.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1002/10/ctw.01.html\">told CNN</a> in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m a gene believer. Hey, when you connect two racehorses, you usually end up with a fast horse.

Nice countries, you know like Denmark, Switzerland? Do we have any people coming in from Denmark? How about Switzerland? How about Norway?\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-i-have-not-read-hitlers-mein-kampf-2023-12-20/\">claims</a> he has not read Mein Kampf. His first wife, Ivana Trump, said he \u201creads a book of Hitler\u2019s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed\u201d, Vanity Fair <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2015/07/donald-ivana-trump-divorce-prenup-marie-brenner\">reported</a> in 1990. Trump explained it was a gift from a Jewish friend. Then, he told Marie Brenner of Vanity Fair, \u201cIf I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\u201d</p> <p>As Trump ginned up his third campaign, Hugh Hewitt, a rightwing radio talkshow host, tried to help cleanse Trump of taint from his \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d incantations. \u201cNow, Mr President,\u201d said the deferential Hewitt, \u201cyour critics say that you are using Hitlerian language that was used to dehumanize Jews by saying that Jewish blood cannot be part of German blood. Do you have anything like that in mind when you say poisoning our blood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, and I never knew that Hitler said it, either, by the way,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cAnd I never read Mein Kampf. They said I read Mein Kampf. These are people that are disinformation, horrible people that we\u2019re dealing with. I never read Mein Kampf.\u201d</p> <p>Asked again by Hewitt, Trump answered, \u201cFirst of all, I know nothing about Hitler. I\u2019m not a student of Hitler. I never read his works. They say that he said something about blood. He didn\u2019t say it the way I said it, either, by the way.\u201d Then, after showing he was familiar with Hitler\u2019s \u201cblood\u201d obsession that he had just said he did not know about, he repeated his \u201cpoison\u201d meme eight times.</p> <p>\u201cI know nothing\u201d was the comic punchline of Sergeant Schultz, the buffoonish Nazi prisoner-of-war camp guard from the 1960s television series Hogan\u2019s Heroes. \u201cI know nothing\u201d has been a useful if transparently false tactic of deflection for Trump, from David Duke \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about David Duke, OK?\u201d \u2013 to the Proud Boys.</p> <p>After the violent neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville in 2017, ringing with chants of \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d attended by a number of Proud Boys, Trump infamously stated, there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d.</p> <p>When Chris Wallace, the moderator of the 2020 CNN presidential debate, asked Trump if he would denounce white supremacists, he replied, \u201cProud Boys, stand back and stand by,\u201d a message to the neo-fascist paramilitary group that would be the shock troops in the attack on the Capitol on January 6. After the debate, he told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the Proud Boys are.\u201d Now, he has pledged to pardon those Proud Boys and others serving prison terms for their actions in the insurrection of January 6. He refers to them as \u201chostages\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>White supremacists, neo-fascists and neo-Nazis attach themselves to Trump, sometimes appearing as more than a fringe </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>White supremacists, neo-fascists and neo-Nazis attach themselves to Trump, sometimes appearing as more than a fringe \u2013 including, recently, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/mark-robinson-north-carolina\">self-proclaimed</a> \u201cBlack Nazi\u201d Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina, whom Trump <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/trump-has-embraced-ncs-mark-robinson-calling-him-martin-luther-king-on-steroids/\">called</a> \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d</p> <p>Neo-Nazis just seem to pop up weirdly on Trump\u2019s property. At Mar-a-Lago, on 22 November 2022, Trump had a night to remember: dinner with the antisemitic rapper Kanye West, AKA Ye, and Nick Fuentes, a neo-Nazi, who was a leader at the Charlottesville march and riot, present in the mob on January 6, and has built an antisemitic following he calls the \u201cGroypers\u201d. Afterward, when the press reported on the dinner, Trump issued a statement that Ye brought \u201ca guest whom I had never met and knew nothing about\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trump\u2019s footsie with Nazis mingles narcissism with Nazism. But it is his belief in the far-right \u201creplacement theory\u201d, which is the central idea of his campaign, that provides the greatest illumination on what are more than overlapping coincidences. The historical lineage of poisonous ideas, rather than \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d, explains Trump\u2019s doctrine of a master race, whether Trump is aware or not of the origins of his venom.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s embrace of the replacement theory may owe a good deal to its relentless promotion by its chief exponent, Tucker Carlson, who also serves as an intellectual mentor to JD Vance. On more than 400 shows when Carlson was on Fox News, according to the New York Times, \u201che has amplified the idea that a cabal of elites want to force demographic change through immigration\u201d.</p> <p>On his 2 September podcast, Carlson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/06/business/media/tucker-carlson-holocaust-interview-biden-administration.html\">interviewed</a> a <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/world-war-ii-and-the-rise-of-anti-798\">self-proclaimed</a> \u201cnon-racist fascist\u201d, Darryl Cooper, whom he introduced as \u201cthe best and most honest popular historian in the United States\u201d. For two hours, he held forth on Winston Churchill as the \u201cchief villain of the second world war\u201d and the Holocaust as an accident forced on Hitler. Despite Carlson\u2019s Nazi fascination, his principal influence has been as a recent popularizer of a doctrine developed more than a century ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When Trump says immigration, he means race.

He also helped write laws in the south banning interracial marriage.</p> <p>Hitler regarded Grant\u2019s book in his speeches as scientific proof and wrote him an admiring letter telling him it was his \u201cBible\u201d. \u201cIt was America, in spite of its enormous territory, that was the first country to teach us by its immigration law that a nation should not open its doors equally to all races,\u201d Hitler told the New York Times in an interview on 20 December 1931, before he seized power. \u201cLet China be for the Chinese, America for the Americans and Germany for the Germans.\u201d In 1936 the Nazis promoted The Passing of the Great Race as essential reading for Germans.</p> <p>\u201cThe irony is that by putting Madison Grant\u2019s theories into practice, the Nazis discredited those theories forever,\u201d wrote the historian Jonathan Spiro in his biography of Madison Grant, Defending the Master Race.</p> <p>That is, until Trump.</p> <p>When Trump says immigration, he means race.

He made a prophecy about who should be blamed if he is defeated in the election. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call this as a prediction, but in my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-jewish-voters-will-bear-lot-blame-loses-fighting-antisemiti-rcna171938\">said</a>.

      "bodyText": "If genealogy is destiny, as Donald Trump believes, then \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d \u2013 a phrase Trump repeatedly uses \u2013 determines the fate of nations. By Trump\u2019s logic, \u201cblood\u201d is the true and final measure. Trump, like Hitler, appears to classify people and countries by \u201cblood\u201d on a scale of their innate racial characteristics. Those features define the essence of nations, which are themselves delineated on a racial pyramid, with the purest and whitest, the most Aryan, at the pinnacle. True to his doctrine, the Nazis on his family tree must explain his penchant for Hitlerian rhetoric. \u201cPoison in the blood\u201d was the core of Hitler\u2019s race doctrine as well. Hitler, too, believed it explained the rise and fall of civilizations. \u201cAll great cultures of the past perished only because the originally creative race died out from blood poisoning,\u201d stated Hitler. It is also Trump\u2019s fundamental trope. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning the blood of our country, and you have people coming in, think of it, mental institutions all over the world are being emptied out into the United States,\u201d he said on Fox News in March. \u201cJails and prisons are being emptied out into the United States. This is poisoning our country.\u201d Just recently, on 31 August, addressing Moms For Liberty, a rightwing group devoted to book-banning, he raised again the menace of \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d: \u201cBut what\u2019s happening to our country, our country is being poisoned, poisoned!\u201d At a rally on 18 September, Trump elaborated: \u201cThey\u2019re coming from the Congo, they\u2019re coming from Africa, they\u2019re coming from the Middle East, they\u2019re coming from all over the world \u2013 Asia! A lot of it coming from Asia \u2026 And what\u2019s happening to our country is we\u2019re just destroying the fabric of life in our country, and we\u2019re not going to take it any longer, and you got to get rid of these people.\u201d \u201cBlut und Boden\u201d \u2013 blood and soil \u2013 was adopted as an official slogan of the Nazi regime to express its ideal of the nation rooted in the authentic unity of Aryan blood. The community of its people \u2013 Volksgemeinschaft \u2013 comprised only those of shared ethnic blood. Aliens corrupting the blood, principally Jews, but also Slavs, Poles and Roma, were described as disease carriers and \u201cvermin\u201d \u2013 Volksshadlinge \u2013 and posed an existential threat. Only those people of the blood belonged to the Heimat, a concept the Nazis cast as the racially pure home, intrinsic to Blut und Boden. Jews were Heimatlos \u2013 a people separate from the Heimat, without a true home, wanderers, cosmopolitans and globalists, a menace to the sanctity of the culture and the identity of the nation. They were not simply outsiders, or the Other. They were a different species \u2013 subhumans, Untermenschen \u2013 and must be eradicated to preserve the blood of the race. \u201cAlthough it has features similar to a human, the subhuman is lower on the spiritual and psychological scale than any animal,\u201d instructed a pamphlet entitled Der Untermenschen, illustrated with distorted photographs of these lower beings to depict the \u201cbestial\u201d nature of the subhuman Jews and Slavs. Four million copies were published in 1942 under the direction of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS. \u201cIn some cases, they\u2019re not people, in my opinion,\u201d Trump said this March. \u201cBut I\u2019m not allowed to say that because the radical left says that\u2019s a terrible thing to say. These are animals, OK, and we have to stop it.\u201d When they are removed, it will be, says Trump, \u201ca bloody story\u201d. *** Friedrich Trump, Trump\u2019s grandfather, was deported from his native Bavaria as an undesirable and had his German citizenship revoked in 1905. Born in the town of Kallstadt in 1869, he dodged compulsory military service and emigrated to the United States in 1885. In and around Seattle and the Yukon, he owned restaurants and hotels that also did a brisk business as brothels. He returned to Germany a well-to-do man, married Elisabeth Christ, and took her to New York. But his wife did not like America and was homesick. He returned to Kallstadt to settle, but the authorities investigated him and ruled he should be banished for dodging military service. He wrote the Prince of Bavaria a letter begging to stay. \u201cWhy should we be deported? This is very, very hard for a family.\u201d His plea was rejected. He was expelled. Upon his return to New York, in October 1905, a son, named Fred, was born. The Trump family saga began. The Trump and Christ families, with the exception of Friedrich and Elisabeth Trump, remained in Kallstadt. Many of them served in the Nazi army. Some were members of the Nazi party. Two of these relatives of Donald Trump are now known to have fought and died for Hitler. It appears that they were involved in the early stage of the Holocaust. (A certified professional genealogist distinguished in the field discovered these Trump Nazi soldiers through their research, but prefers to remain anonymous to avoid retribution.) Ernst Christ, of the Christ branch of the family, a first cousin once removed of Donald Trump, the son of his great-uncle Johannes Christ, born in Kallstadt, was a Nazi. Unteroffizier Christ, a corporal, served in the 1st Company of the Panzerjager-Abteilung 670, an anti-tank unit that saw action on the western front in Belgium and France before being transferred to participate in the invasion of Russia. In July 1942, Christ\u2019s company occupied the town of Polodovitoye, about 100 kilometers south of Stalingrad. The Nazi soldiers rounded up about 100 Jewish families who had fled there from throughout the region. According to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust research center in Jerusalem, \u201cJews were loaded onto trucks, supposedly to be taken home. In fact, the victims were taken outside the village toward a ravine located 50 meters south of the village. There the victims were shot or probably severely wounded and then doused with some highly flammable liquid and then set on fire.\u201d A month later, on 13 August, Unteroffizier Christ was killed in battle. Three days before, on 10 August, the Wehrmacht reached the outskirts of Stalingrad. On that day, Private Eduard Freund, born in Kallstadt, was killed. He was the first cousin once removed of Donald Trump, the son of Donald\u2019s great-aunt Elisabetha Trump and Karl Phillip Freund. Private Freund served in a security unit, the fourth company of the Sicherungs-Battalion 790, whose task of guarding supply lines and police work quickly turned, like that of all such units, into the operation of wholesale brutal terror. He was one of those soldiers from \u201call walks of life\u201d described in historian Christopher Browning\u2019s Ordinary Men, who found themselves occupiers in eastern Europe to execute the regime\u2019s policies, often under the control of the SS, where \u201cmass murder and routine had become one\u201d, murdering partisans and civilians alike, and systematically killing Jews. The policy was justified in a phrase \u2013 Jude gleich Bolschewik gleich Partisan, or \u201cJew equals Bolshevik equals Partisan\u201d. If \u201cblood\u201d is the biological marker of indelible personal, racial and ethnic character, by his own reasoning Trump\u2019s organic linkage to Nazis must inexorably explain his unapologetic Hitlerian politics. On Fox News, in March, Howard Kurtz, the host of its show Media Buzz, interviewed Trump. \u201cWhy do you use words like \u2018vermin\u2019 and \u2018poisoning of the blood\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe press, as you know, immediately reacts to that by saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s the kind of language that Hitler and Mussolini used.\u2019\u201d To which Trump replied, \u201cBecause our country is being poisoned.\u201d But another Trump relative stands as a repudiation of Trump\u2019s theory. John G Trump, Fred\u2019s younger brother, did not go into real estate. Instead, he earned a master\u2019s degree in physics and a doctorate in electrical engineering. He became a co-inventor of high-voltage electrostatic generators, which during the second world war he applied to advancements in radar. He served as the secretary of the microwave committee created by the federal government\u2019s new National Defense Research Committee. After the war, he was appointed director of MIT\u2019s High-Voltage Research Laboratory, whose work he used in cancer research and on environmental pollution. His obituary in Physics Today in 1985 by a colleague paid tribute to his personal virtues as well as his scientific contributions: \u201cTrump\u2019s remarkable personality mix contributed to all of this achievement and success. He was remarkably even-tempered, with kindness and consideration to all, never threatening or arrogant in manner, even when under high stress. He was outwardly and in appearance the mildest of men, with a convincing persuasiveness, carefully marshaling all his facts.\u201d Furthermore, wrote his eulogist, \u201cHe cared very little for money and the trappings of money.\u201d In other words, John Trump was nothing at all like his bullying, ignorant and greedy nephew, who bears the middle name \u201cJohn\u201d, the only apparent correspondence between them. The resemblance, regardless of genetics, is nil. Yet Trump cites him as proof of his intelligence, a case positive of \u201cblood\u201d. \u201cI had an uncle who went to MIT who is a top professor. Dr John Trump. A genius,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CNN in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s in my blood. I\u2019m smart. Great marks. Like really smart.\u201d From time to time, he brings up his uncle as his forebear of his own \u201cgenius\u201d. \u201cGood genes, very good genes. OK, very smart.\u201d Through his distorted lens, Trump\u2019s uncle, who was the opposite of a narcissist, serves as a rationale for his narcissism. He is held up as an example of Trump\u2019s \u201cblood\u201d mania, though the scientist in the family had no use for the sort of malevolent superstition the Nazis propagated and his nephew mimics. Trump designates his blood as superior and the blood of those he chooses to demonize as inferior. \u201cWell, I think I was born with a drive for success,\u201d Trump told CNN in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m a gene believer. Hey, when you connect two racehorses, you usually end up with a fast horse. And I really was \u2013 you know, I had a \u2013 a good gene pool from the standpoint of that.\u201d \u201cI have an Ivy League education, smart guy, good genes. I have great genes and all that stuff, which I\u2019m a believer in,\u201d Trump informed a crowd in Biloxi, Mississippi, in 2016. He had recently called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. \u201cYou have good genes, you know that, right?\u201d Trump told another nearly all-white rally during his 2020 campaign in a Minnesota town that had voted against accepting refugees. \u201cYou have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn\u2019t it, don\u2019t you believe? The racehorse theory. You think we\u2019re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota.\u201d He compared and contrasted. \u201cEvery family in Minnesota needs to know about sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet.\u201d \u201cWhy do we want all these people from shithole countries coming here?\u201d Trump bemoaned in a White House meeting in 2018. He pointed to Haiti \u2013 \u201ctake them out\u201d \u2013 El Salvador and the entire continent of Africa. \u201cWe should have more people from Norway.\u201d This April, at a fundraiser with donors at Mar-a-Lago, Trump proudly recalled his \u201cshithole countries\u201d moment to elaborate on his categories of acceptable and unacceptable immigrants. \u201cAnd when I said, you know, \u2018Why can\u2019t we allow people to come in from nice countries,\u2019 I\u2019m trying to be nice. Nice countries, you know like Denmark, Switzerland? Do we have any people coming in from Denmark? How about Switzerland? How about Norway?\u201d *** Trump claims he has not read Mein Kampf. His first wife, Ivana Trump, said he \u201creads a book of Hitler\u2019s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed\u201d, Vanity Fair reported in 1990. Trump explained it was a gift from a Jewish friend. Then, he told Marie Brenner of Vanity Fair, \u201cIf I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.\u201d As Trump ginned up his third campaign, Hugh Hewitt, a rightwing radio talkshow host, tried to help cleanse Trump of taint from his \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d incantations. \u201cNow, Mr President,\u201d said the deferential Hewitt, \u201cyour critics say that you are using Hitlerian language that was used to dehumanize Jews by saying that Jewish blood cannot be part of German blood. Do you have anything like that in mind when you say poisoning our blood?\u201d \u201cNo, and I never knew that Hitler said it, either, by the way,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cAnd I never read Mein Kampf. They said I read Mein Kampf. These are people that are disinformation, horrible people that we\u2019re dealing with. I never read Mein Kampf.\u201d Asked again by Hewitt, Trump answered, \u201cFirst of all, I know nothing about Hitler. I\u2019m not a student of Hitler. I never read his works. They say that he said something about blood. He didn\u2019t say it the way I said it, either, by the way.\u201d Then, after showing he was familiar with Hitler\u2019s \u201cblood\u201d obsession that he had just said he did not know about, he repeated his \u201cpoison\u201d meme eight times. \u201cI know nothing\u201d was the comic punchline of Sergeant Schultz, the buffoonish Nazi prisoner-of-war camp guard from the 1960s television series Hogan\u2019s Heroes. \u201cI know nothing\u201d has been a useful if transparently false tactic of deflection for Trump, from David Duke \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about David Duke, OK?\u201d \u2013 to the Proud Boys. After the violent neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville in 2017, ringing with chants of \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d attended by a number of Proud Boys, Trump infamously stated, there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d. When Chris Wallace, the moderator of the 2020 CNN presidential debate, asked Trump if he would denounce white supremacists, he replied, \u201cProud Boys, stand back and stand by,\u201d a message to the neo-fascist paramilitary group that would be the shock troops in the attack on the Capitol on January 6. After the debate, he told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the Proud Boys are.\u201d Now, he has pledged to pardon those Proud Boys and others serving prison terms for their actions in the insurrection of January 6. He refers to them as \u201chostages\u201d. White supremacists, neo-fascists and neo-Nazis attach themselves to Trump, sometimes appearing as more than a fringe \u2013 including, recently, the self-proclaimed \u201cBlack Nazi\u201d Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina, whom Trump called \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d Neo-Nazis just seem to pop up weirdly on Trump\u2019s property. At Mar-a-Lago, on 22 November 2022, Trump had a night to remember: dinner with the antisemitic rapper Kanye West, AKA Ye, and Nick Fuentes, a neo-Nazi, who was a leader at the Charlottesville march and riot, present in the mob on January 6, and has built an antisemitic following he calls the \u201cGroypers\u201d. Afterward, when the press reported on the dinner, Trump issued a statement that Ye brought \u201ca guest whom I had never met and knew nothing about\u201d. *** Trump\u2019s footsie with Nazis mingles narcissism with Nazism. But it is his belief in the far-right \u201creplacement theory\u201d, which is the central idea of his campaign, that provides the greatest illumination on what are more than overlapping coincidences. The historical lineage of poisonous ideas, rather than \u201cpoison in the blood\u201d, explains Trump\u2019s doctrine of a master race, whether Trump is aware or not of the origins of his venom. Trump\u2019s embrace of the replacement theory may owe a good deal to its relentless promotion by its chief exponent, Tucker Carlson, who also serves as an intellectual mentor to JD Vance. On more than 400 shows when Carlson was on Fox News, according to the New York Times, \u201che has amplified the idea that a cabal of elites want to force demographic change through immigration\u201d. On his 2 September podcast, Carlson interviewed a self-proclaimed \u201cnon-racist fascist\u201d, Darryl Cooper, whom he introduced as \u201cthe best and most honest popular historian in the United States\u201d. For two hours, he held forth on Winston Churchill as the \u201cchief villain of the second world war\u201d and the Holocaust as an accident forced on Hitler. Despite Carlson\u2019s Nazi fascination, his principal influence has been as a recent popularizer of a doctrine developed more than a century ago. Trump\u2019s replacement theory is derivative of the nativism of eugenicists and \u201crace scientists\u201d, especially Madison Grant, whose 1916 book, The Passing of the Great Race, warned against \u201cthe old stock being crowded out\u201d by \u201cswarms of Polish Jews\u201d and other aliens, who were pushing aside \u201cthe Nordic man\u201d, and fostering \u201csuicidal ethics which are exterminating his own race\u201d. Grant served as an adviser to the congressional members who wrote the Immigration Act of 1924, which severely restricted immigration of those ethnic groups from eastern and southern Europe that he deemed inferior, closing out Italians and Jews. He also helped write laws in the south banning interracial marriage. Hitler regarded Grant\u2019s book in his speeches as scientific proof and wrote him an admiring letter telling him it was his \u201cBible\u201d. \u201cIt was America, in spite of its enormous territory, that was the first country to teach us by its immigration law that a nation should not open its doors equally to all races,\u201d Hitler told the New York Times in an interview on 20 December 1931, before he seized power. \u201cLet China be for the Chinese, America for the Americans and Germany for the Germans.\u201d In 1936 the Nazis promoted The Passing of the Great Race as essential reading for Germans. \u201cThe irony is that by putting Madison Grant\u2019s theories into practice, the Nazis discredited those theories forever,\u201d wrote the historian Jonathan Spiro in his biography of Madison Grant, Defending the Master Race. That is, until Trump. When Trump says immigration, he means race. When he says crime, he means race. When he says communism, socialism, or Democrat, he means race. When he says America is declining, he means race. When he says \u201cAmerican First\u201d, he means race. When he says blood, he means race. When he says poison, he means race. When he says race, he means Black people. When he says race, he means Hispanics. When he says race, he means Muslims. And when he says race, he means other white people, too, some less white, less pure, less clean, less acceptable depending on their ancestral origin, than others. When he says race, he means the replacement theory. *** Trump has Hitler on the brain in unknowable ways until he lets his admiration seep out. \u201cWell, but Hitler did some good things,\u201d Trump remarked to his White House chief of staff, General John Kelly. \u201cWell, what?\u201d asked Kelly. \u201cWell, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy,\u201d Trump replied. Kelly was outraged. He told him, \u201cSir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing.\u201d Kelly reflected, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to believe he missed the Holocaust, though, and pretty hard to understand how he missed the 400,000 American GIs that were killed in the European theater,\u201d Kelly told Jim Sciutto, the CNN correspondent. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s more, again, the tough guy thing\u201d \u2013 Trump\u2019s insatiable need to playact. On 17 September, Trump launched a new theme with an old echo. He made a prophecy about who should be blamed if he is defeated in the election. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call this as a prediction, but in my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss,\u201d he said. Then, he repeated, \u201cIf I don\u2019t win this election \u2013 and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens because if 40%, I mean, 60% of the people are voting for the enemy \u2026\u201d He complained that as \u201cthe most popular person in Israel\u201d he was not \u201ctreated right\u201d by American Jews. Trump\u2019s Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner, his converted Jewish daughter Ivanka, his Jewish grandchildren, his Jewish adviser Stephen Miller, who is poised to be the implementer of the replacement theory and deportation of millions, including legal immigrants, and his Jewish supporters and donors are exempt from his condemnation of \u201cthe Jewish people\u201d. Trump\u2019s family ties don\u2019t give him pause from his obsession. His \u201cblood\u201d makes them kosher. In the case of an inconvenient contradiction his narcissism prevails. Trump\u2019s blame game is his version of the Dolchstosslegende \u2013 the stab in the back legend \u2013 that Germany did not lose the first world war in battle but was betrayed on the home front by Jews and leftists. Hitler traced his political awakening to his understanding of the Dolchstoss. Now, after all Trump has done for the Jews, after all he has done for Israel, \u201cthe Jewish people\u201d are ungrateful. Too many of them support \u201cthe enemy\u201d. Trump is warming up his myth of a scapegoat.

In the hours leading up to the anniversary, Israel bombed targets in Beirut and Gaza, while Hezbollah rockets struck Haifa, Israel\u2019s third-largest city, causing damage to buildings, police said. Israeli media reported 5 people were wounded in rocket attacks in Haifa and the city of Tiberias. The Israeli airstrikes battered Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, in what were among the most intense bombardment of the Lebanese capital since Israel sharply escalated its campaign against Hezbollah last month. Large fireballs lit the darkened skyline and booms reverberated across Beirut.

It said strikes also targeted Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Israel announced early on Monday that a soldier had been killed along the country\u2019s northern border with Lebanon, the latest casualty since the military launched ground operations targeting Hezbollah positions last week. Meanwhile, four projectiles were fired from the Gaza Strip just minutes after the country began to formally commemorate the 7 October attacks, according to the IDF.

      "body": "<p>When Joe Biden travels to Angola on Sunday, it will be the first trip to an African country of his presidency and the first to the continent by a sitting US president since Barack Obama visited Kenya and Ethiopia in 2015.</p> <p>It is a marker of how Africa\u2019s 54 countries are increasingly courted by global powers, drawn to the continent by geopolitical shifts and an abundance of minerals needed for electric cars and other battery-powered technologies.</p> <p>Biden will visit Angola from 13-15 October after three days in Germany, as his presidency draws to a close before the US election on 5 November. When Biden hosted his Angolan counterpart, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, at the White House in November 2023, he said Africa was \u201ccritically important\u201d, adding: \u201cNo country more important than Angola.\u201d</p> <p>The southern African country has historically been closer to Russia and, more recently, China.</p> <p>The ruling People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party fought for independence from Portugal. After independence in 1975, Angola descended into civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba intervened to support the MPLA, while the US and apartheid South Africa backed its opponents. More recently, Russia has been Angola\u2019s main arms supplier.</p> <p>Even before the Soviet Union collapsed, US oil companies including Chevron contributed the bulk of Angola\u2019s budget, said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a politics professor at the University of Oxford.</p> <p>\u201cAngola \u2026 has had a rocky relationship with the United States for many years.

      "bodyText": "When Joe Biden travels to Angola on Sunday, it will be the first trip to an African country of his presidency and the first to the continent by a sitting US president since Barack Obama visited Kenya and Ethiopia in 2015. It is a marker of how Africa\u2019s 54 countries are increasingly courted by global powers, drawn to the continent by geopolitical shifts and an abundance of minerals needed for electric cars and other battery-powered technologies. Biden will visit Angola from 13-15 October after three days in Germany, as his presidency draws to a close before the US election on 5 November. When Biden hosted his Angolan counterpart, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, at the White House in November 2023, he said Africa was \u201ccritically important\u201d, adding: \u201cNo country more important than Angola.\u201d The southern African country has historically been closer to Russia and, more recently, China. The ruling People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party fought for independence from Portugal. After independence in 1975, Angola descended into civil war. The Soviet Union and Cuba intervened to support the MPLA, while the US and apartheid South Africa backed its opponents. More recently, Russia has been Angola\u2019s main arms supplier. Even before the Soviet Union collapsed, US oil companies including Chevron contributed the bulk of Angola\u2019s budget, said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a politics professor at the University of Oxford. \u201cAngola \u2026 has had a rocky relationship with the United States for many years. Rocky means complicated, it doesn\u2019t mean purely hostile,\u201d said Soares de Oliveira. Oil also lured China, whose banks had committed to lending $46bn to Angola since 2000, a quarter of all their African loan commitments, according to Boston University data. With many infrastructure projects globally that were funded under China\u2019s belt and road initiative having failed to deliver hoped-for returns, China\u2019s focus has moved to smaller, greener investments and so-called \u201ccritical minerals\u201d. The US, the EU, the United Arab Emirates and others are belatedly playing catch-up. These minerals, which include copper and cobalt, are abundant in Angola\u2019s landlocked neighbours Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The US and EU\u2019s most high-profile play to secure supplies from Africa has been the Lobito Corridor. This includes refurbishing a railway that runs for about 1,000 miles (1,700km) from Kolwezi in DRC\u2019s copperbelt to the Lobito port, which is also due to be upgraded. There are plans to build a new line to Zambia and eventually to connect to infrastructure through Tanzania to the Indian Ocean. It is not clear if this involves partnering or competing with China, which pledged to upgrade the Tanzania-Zambia TAZARA railway that it financed in the 1970s. The US\u2019s Development Finance Corporation has put in $250m, with $4bn committed so far by all project partners, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said at an event in New York in September. \u201cThe US is desperate to catch up [with China] and this is one way,\u201d said Paula Cristina Roque, who has written books on Angolan politics. Angola\u2019s peace-building role in conflict-riven DRC is also important to the US, as is countering many African countries turning away from the US amid Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine and Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza and Lebanon, said Roque. \u201cOn the continent, Russia and China\u2019s most strategic and important partner \u2026 which was Angola, now falls squarely in the US sphere of influence,\u201d she said. Judd Devermont, Biden\u2019s former special assistant for Africa, rejected viewing US-Angola relations through a lens of competition with China. \u201cIt is an inaccurate or at least incomplete framing,\u201d said Devermont, now a partner at investment firm Kupanda Capital. \u201cThe importance of critical minerals is part of the equation but it doesn\u2019t define US policy.\u201d \u201cI think it is a matter of opportunity. President Louren\u00e7o, as far back his inauguration address, signalled an interest to work more closely with the United States and Europe.\u201d Louren\u00e7o, a Soviet-educated former general, had expressed a greater openness to foreign investment since taking office in 2017. But a failure to create jobs for a growing young population increased discontent. Louren\u00e7o pivoted further towards the west after the 2022 national elections, which the opposition said it had won. Meanwhile, political activists have been arrested and repressive laws introduced. For Jos\u00e9 Gama, an Angolan journalist living in South Africa, the US approach has been disappointing. \u201cWe thought Biden would help Angola with human rights,\u201d he said, recounting how hopes were raised when Biden committed to fighting authoritarianism in a 2021 speech soon after his inauguration. As for what comes after Biden, his deputy, Kamala Harris, has not deviated significantly on foreign policy. In her acceptance of the Democrat presidential nomination, she said that she would ensure \u201cthat America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Since the 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 Israelis last year, Jewish Americans across generations and political divides have been pulled into a crisis unfolding half a world away. For some, witnessing Israel\u2019s bombardment of civilians in Gaza has compelled them to protest in support of Palestinian rights. For others, a sense of growing antisemitism has created an atmosphere of isolation and unease in personal and professional circles. All describe navigating difficult conversations, grieving lost relationships and grappling with a painful new terrain.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke with five Jewish Americans who reflected on how their lives have changed over the last year. Their words have been edited and condensed.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018My relatives\u2019 bodies are being held hostage in Gaza and we are grappling with what that means\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Lea Silvert</strong><strong>, 30, Cambridge, Massachusetts, niece of Judih Weinstein Haggai and Gadi Haggai, who were killed on 7 October</strong><strong><br></strong></p>    <p>For months, my family waited for information. It was horrible. There was so much uncertainty in our lives. We didn\u2019t know if they were alive or dead. We didn\u2019t know if they were in Israel or Gaza. We had no idea. But I clung on to hope. I had visions that Judih and Gadi were alive in Gaza, either in a house or in the tunnels, and that they were with each other. I made myself believe that for 83 days.</p> <p>Now we know they are dead, that their bodies are being held hostage in Gaza, and my family is grappling with what that means for us. But also we\u2019re working very hard to advocate for the release of the hostages, for an end to the war, and for more humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p> <p>It\u2019s been hard to connect with other people on the topic of the hostages. At work or at school, I feel like I leave half of myself outside the door each time I walk in. I\u2019m often scared to bring it up, especially with people I don\u2019t know, because it\u2019s so polarizing. You\u2019re either for this side or you\u2019re for that side. It\u2019s all or nothing. It\u2019s very painful to hear everyone\u2019s opinions, especially when people aren\u2019t going through it themselves.</p> <p>I feel there is a microscope on me being Jewish and American, that people hold me accountable for the Israeli government, and I think that is incredibly antisemitic. Why would I be accountable for what Netanyahu does when I am one of the voices so actively challenging him? I don\u2019t understand that conflation between identity and the power of a fanatical rightwing government.</p>    <p>I feel very alone. I feel like a lot of people are quick to judge. Yet this is a moment that requires everyone to hold nuance and complexity \u2013 and that is very hard, and not at all automatic. At the same time, I\u2019ve received an outpouring of support and understanding from loved ones and complete strangers. It\u2019s given me strength and hope as I grieve.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019ve been lambasted by both sides\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Isaac Saul,</strong><strong> 33, Philadelphia, journalist at Tangle News, a non-partisan news site<br></strong></p>    <p>I think \u2013 and care \u2013 a lot about the conflict. When I graduated college, I went to a yeshiva in East Jerusalem. Leading up to 7 October, it had been 10 years since I\u2019d been in Israel, but I still had a lot of friends from my time there. When the attacks started, I got on WhatsApp to see if everybody was OK. And while everybody who I knew personally was safe, every one of them knew somebody who had been injured or killed. It felt really close.</p> <p>I wrote about it pretty early on. I said that Israel was going to respond, and that I was scared about what the response was going to be.</p> <p>At the same time, I saw people start talking about the conflict for the very first time as though they knew what they were talking about. Progressive friends of mine all of a sudden posted every day about Zionism being racism and Israel committing genocide. Jewish friends of mine were inclined to blindly support whatever Israel did and started posting shallow, borderline racist stuff about Palestinians. I was stuck between those two groups. It was frustrating and painful.</p> <p>When I started writing about it publicly, I heard from Palestinian Americans who were upset about how I was framing stuff, and I was lambasted by Jewish and Israeli Americans who said I was a self-hating Jew. It was pretty isolating. I wrote a piece recently about all the documentation of some of the horrific things that members of the IDF have done during the war. I got so many emails from people saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you wrote this email without mentioning a single thing Hamas has done,\u201d despite the fact that I\u2019ve been writing about Hamas for 11 months. Every three months I have an I\u2019m-throwing-in-the-towel breakdown. But then I\u2019ll lick my wounds and convince myself that it\u2019s important to keep doing this.</p> <p>And all of this is wrapped in a kind of guilt, because it isn\u2019t my neighborhood being bombed, or my family members and friends dying. Many Palestinians and Palestinian Americans have it way worse than me right now. So on top of all the other feelings, I have guilt that I am even struggling, when I\u2019m safe and secure thousands of miles away.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I am part of a community trying to create a Judaism beyond Zionism\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Linda Holtzman</strong><strong>, 72, Philadelphia, rabbi of the Tikkun Olam Chavurah<br></strong></p>    <p>I grew up, as many people did in the 60s and 70s, in a strongly Zionist household and community. It was only later that I started to realize there was much more to Israel than I had known. It became clear to me that there was a very vibrant Judaism in the world before the state of Israel, and now I see myself as part of a community of people who are trying to create a Judaism beyond Zionism.</p> <p>It was never easy to be an anti-Zionist in the Jewish world. But since 7 October , that opposition to anti-Zionism has strengthened, and the number of anti-Zionists I know \u2013 myself included \u2013 who have been pushed out of mainstream Jewish institutions is huge.</p> <p>I have been on the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College since the 1980s. In June, I was told that, because of budget concerns, I was no longer the director of student life. I could teach as an adjunct, but I basically lost my position. I was the only anti-Zionist on the faculty.</p> <p>At RRC, I supported students with a range of views \u2013 Zionists, anti-Zionists and everything in between. I loved knowing that there were people who saw things differently, but who were open to engaging and disagreeing. That, to me, feels like the ultimate Jewish value, and one that is vital in a rabbinical school.</p> <p>So my departure feels like a loss that is larger than just one faculty person who couldn\u2019t be budgeted for. It\u2019s the loss of the depth of that kind of discussion and disagreement. Until this year, it felt OK to identify as an anti-Zionist and to be fully a part of the faculty. And since 7 October, it has not felt like that.</p> <p>So while the establishment Jewish community is making things very difficult, it has also been a year of building real community among anti-Zionists. It\u2019s smaller, but we\u2019re there.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018A lot of code-switching\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Noah Rothman</strong><strong>, 26, San Fran</strong><strong>cisco, University of California, Berkeley, graduate and former president of Berkeley\u2019s chapter of Hillel, the Jewish campus organization</strong><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>    <p>In Berkeley, you had to be careful about what you said, who you said it to, and how you were saying it. Even within the Jewish community, I did a lot of code-switching.</p> <p>It was a really intense environment. So much happened. People left Hillel, and it transformed into a totally different space. On campus, there were protests and counter-protests, there was a walkout for Palestine, there were outside agitators, there was an encampment. At an event, some windows were broken. And then, there were also meetings going on behind the scenes. There was so much happening, and a lot of us were caught up in it.</p> <p>I got funding for some things to work with Muslim student groups. And unfortunately, that just never came to fruition. Things were just too sensitive.</p> <p>A pivotal point was I came back from spring break. I said to the Hillel rabbi: \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not gonna try to hide how I feel. I\u2019m not gonna apologize for what I believe in.\u201d I lost the patience I had been holding for the people who characterized Hillel as the enemy, as this horrible organization that was sponsoring genocide. Judaism and politics became so intertwined, and I was done with apologizing for all the good things we were doing, like hosting weekly Shabbat dinners.</p> <p>[After graduating], I spent the summer traveling and didn\u2019t really talk about Israel. Last year, all my conversations were about it, so I looked for an opportunity to escape. The only place I really talk about it now is among family. I\u2019m able to breathe.</p> <p>Part of me feels guilty that I don\u2019t talk about it more, because this is one of the issues of our time. I served a year and a half in the Israeli army, and my brother currently lives in Israel. He served in Gaza, and he was just called up this morning because of Lebanon. I\u2019m trying to balance this intimate relationship to the crisis with my need for self-preservation.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I traveled to Israel to volunteer after the war started\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Steve Sanderson, 60, Minneapolis, retired physician <br></strong></p>    <p>When 7 October hit, I felt I had to do something for my fellow Jews, for Israel and for the region. So, in late November, I traveled to Israel to volunteer on farms. I wanted to help people get food, but I also wanted to help the Israeli economy, as all of the international workers had left due to the war. I wound up staying for nearly a month.</p> <p>My wife was invariably supportive, although others questioned my desire to go into a war zone. But I didn\u2019t see it as an adventure. For me, it was a responsibility.</p> <p>I\u2019m a very proud Jew, and I\u2019m a very proud Zionist. Over the years, I\u2019ve been to Israel at least 40 times. I believe in the biblical, historical and legally recognized Jewish state of Israel, where everyone is welcome. But I also believe in learning about the narratives of others who have historical claims. I work towards the goal of peace and justice for everyone in the region by volunteering with organizations \u2013 like the Arava Institute, an apolitical organization focused on environmental diplomacy \u2013 in which Jewish Israelis are working together with Arabs and Palestinians.</p> <p>Still, after millennia of antisemitism, I genuinely believe that Jews and Judaism cannot survive without Israel. I also think it\u2019s Israel\u2019s right to defend herself and to destroy the monstrous organizations that are hell-bent on murdering of Jews.</p> <p>My wife and I are blessed to have many non-Jewish friends. I\u2019ve had great conversations with them in recent months, and they\u2019ve learned a lot about Israel, Jews and antisemitism. Yet I\u2019m disheartened that the world acts like Israel can\u2019t do anything right. We read a lot of different news sources in our household, and it feels publications always portray Israel \u2013 and by extension, Jews \u2013 in a negative light.</p> <p>Much of that is rooted in antisemitism, which has always been present, but has seriously ramped up since 7 October. It\u2019s depressing and stressful.</p>",

It\u2019s all or nothing. It\u2019s very painful to hear everyone\u2019s opinions, especially when people aren\u2019t going through it themselves. I feel there is a microscope on me being Jewish and American, that people hold me accountable for the Israeli government, and I think that is incredibly antisemitic. Why would I be accountable for what Netanyahu does when I am one of the voices so actively challenging him? I don\u2019t understand that conflation between identity and the power of a fanatical rightwing government. I feel very alone. I feel like a lot of people are quick to judge. Yet this is a moment that requires everyone to hold nuance and complexity \u2013 and that is very hard, and not at all automatic. At the same time, I\u2019ve received an outpouring of support and understanding from loved ones and complete strangers. It\u2019s given me strength and hope as I grieve. \u2018I\u2019ve been lambasted by both sides\u2019 Isaac Saul, 33, Philadelphia, journalist at Tangle News, a non-partisan news site I think \u2013 and care \u2013 a lot about the conflict. When I graduated college, I went to a yeshiva in East Jerusalem. Leading up to 7 October, it had been 10 years since I\u2019d been in Israel, but I still had a lot of friends from my time there. When the attacks started, I got on WhatsApp to see if everybody was OK. And while everybody who I knew personally was safe, every one of them knew somebody who had been injured or killed. It felt really close. I wrote about it pretty early on. I said that Israel was going to respond, and that I was scared about what the response was going to be. At the same time, I saw people start talking about the conflict for the very first time as though they knew what they were talking about. Progressive friends of mine all of a sudden posted every day about Zionism being racism and Israel committing genocide. Jewish friends of mine were inclined to blindly support whatever Israel did and started posting shallow, borderline racist stuff about Palestinians. I was stuck between those two groups. It was frustrating and painful. When I started writing about it publicly, I heard from Palestinian Americans who were upset about how I was framing stuff, and I was lambasted by Jewish and Israeli Americans who said I was a self-hating Jew. It was pretty isolating. I wrote a piece recently about all the documentation of some of the horrific things that members of the IDF have done during the war. I got so many emails from people saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you wrote this email without mentioning a single thing Hamas has done,\u201d despite the fact that I\u2019ve been writing about Hamas for 11 months. Every three months I have an I\u2019m-throwing-in-the-towel breakdown. But then I\u2019ll lick my wounds and convince myself that it\u2019s important to keep doing this. And all of this is wrapped in a kind of guilt, because it isn\u2019t my neighborhood being bombed, or my family members and friends dying. Many Palestinians and Palestinian Americans have it way worse than me right now. So on top of all the other feelings, I have guilt that I am even struggling, when I\u2019m safe and secure thousands of miles away. \u2018I am part of a community trying to create a Judaism beyond Zionism\u2019 Linda Holtzman, 72, Philadelphia, rabbi of the Tikkun Olam Chavurah I grew up, as many people did in the 60s and 70s, in a strongly Zionist household and community. It was only later that I started to realize there was much more to Israel than I had known. It became clear to me that there was a very vibrant Judaism in the world before the state of Israel, and now I see myself as part of a community of people who are trying to create a Judaism beyond Zionism. It was never easy to be an anti-Zionist in the Jewish world. But since 7 October , that opposition to anti-Zionism has strengthened, and the number of anti-Zionists I know \u2013 myself included \u2013 who have been pushed out of mainstream Jewish institutions is huge. I have been on the faculty of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College since the 1980s. In June, I was told that, because of budget concerns, I was no longer the director of student life. I could teach as an adjunct, but I basically lost my position. I was the only anti-Zionist on the faculty. At RRC, I supported students with a range of views \u2013 Zionists, anti-Zionists and everything in between. I loved knowing that there were people who saw things differently, but who were open to engaging and disagreeing. That, to me, feels like the ultimate Jewish value, and one that is vital in a rabbinical school. So my departure feels like a loss that is larger than just one faculty person who couldn\u2019t be budgeted for. It\u2019s the loss of the depth of that kind of discussion and disagreement. Until this year, it felt OK to identify as an anti-Zionist and to be fully a part of the faculty. And since 7 October, it has not felt like that. So while the establishment Jewish community is making things very difficult, it has also been a year of building real community among anti-Zionists. It\u2019s smaller, but we\u2019re there. \u2018A lot of code-switching\u2019 Noah Rothman, 26, San Francisco, University of California, Berkeley, graduate and former president of Berkeley\u2019s chapter of Hillel, the Jewish campus organization In Berkeley, you had to be careful about what you said, who you said it to, and how you were saying it. Even within the Jewish community, I did a lot of code-switching. It was a really intense environment. So much happened. People left Hillel, and it transformed into a totally different space. On campus, there were protests and counter-protests, there was a walkout for Palestine, there were outside agitators, there was an encampment. At an event, some windows were broken. And then, there were also meetings going on behind the scenes. There was so much happening, and a lot of us were caught up in it. I got funding for some things to work with Muslim student groups. And unfortunately, that just never came to fruition. Things were just too sensitive. A pivotal point was I came back from spring break. I said to the Hillel rabbi: \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not gonna try to hide how I feel. I\u2019m not gonna apologize for what I believe in.\u201d I lost the patience I had been holding for the people who characterized Hillel as the enemy, as this horrible organization that was sponsoring genocide. Judaism and politics became so intertwined, and I was done with apologizing for all the good things we were doing, like hosting weekly Shabbat dinners. [After graduating], I spent the summer traveling and didn\u2019t really talk about Israel. Last year, all my conversations were about it, so I looked for an opportunity to escape. The only place I really talk about it now is among family. I\u2019m able to breathe. Part of me feels guilty that I don\u2019t talk about it more, because this is one of the issues of our time. I served a year and a half in the Israeli army, and my brother currently lives in Israel. He served in Gaza, and he was just called up this morning because of Lebanon. I\u2019m trying to balance this intimate relationship to the crisis with my need for self-preservation. \u2018I traveled to Israel to volunteer after the war started\u2019 Steve Sanderson, 60, Minneapolis, retired physician When 7 October hit, I felt I had to do something for my fellow Jews, for Israel and for the region. So, in late November, I traveled to Israel to volunteer on farms. I wanted to help people get food, but I also wanted to help the Israeli economy, as all of the international workers had left due to the war. I wound up staying for nearly a month. My wife was invariably supportive, although others questioned my desire to go into a war zone. But I didn\u2019t see it as an adventure. For me, it was a responsibility. I\u2019m a very proud Jew, and I\u2019m a very proud Zionist. Over the years, I\u2019ve been to Israel at least 40 times. I believe in the biblical, historical and legally recognized Jewish state of Israel, where everyone is welcome. But I also believe in learning about the narratives of others who have historical claims. I work towards the goal of peace and justice for everyone in the region by volunteering with organizations \u2013 like the Arava Institute, an apolitical organization focused on environmental diplomacy \u2013 in which Jewish Israelis are working together with Arabs and Palestinians. Still, after millennia of antisemitism, I genuinely believe that Jews and Judaism cannot survive without Israel. I also think it\u2019s Israel\u2019s right to defend herself and to destroy the monstrous organizations that are hell-bent on murdering of Jews. My wife and I are blessed to have many non-Jewish friends. I\u2019ve had great conversations with them in recent months, and they\u2019ve learned a lot about Israel, Jews and antisemitism. Yet I\u2019m disheartened that the world acts like Israel can\u2019t do anything right. We read a lot of different news sources in our household, and it feels publications always portray Israel \u2013 and by extension, Jews \u2013 in a negative light. Much of that is rooted in antisemitism, which has always been present, but has seriously ramped up since 7 October. It\u2019s depressing and stressful.",

I didn\u2019t return this summer but my mother did. She sent me videos of what was left of a wonderful fruit market in Ramallah after Israeli soldiers burned it down.</p> <p>I grew up in a white community in upstate New York and stayed close with some high school friends. I educated them on Palestine and sent them Snapchat videos from my trips back home. After October, one of these friends told me that she was going to remain neutral. She said she was sorry and hoped my family was safe. But that was really triggering. I\u2019ve cut off a lot of people who are still oblivious to what\u2019s happening. This is no longer the time to say that you\u2019re neutral. I\u2019ve lost friends but I also gained some through my activism.</p> <p>I took part in the encampment at Columbia University. (I graduated in the spring with my MA.) When we were told to get off the lawn or risk suspension, many panicked and left. We weren\u2019t sure if the NYPD would return. But a few Palestinian American students stayed \u2013 and a bigger group encircled us to provide protection. Many weren\u2019t Muslim, Palestinian or Arab. That moment is engraved in my mind. I feel emotional, thinking about this support. Earlier, some people didn\u2019t even know what Palestine was. Now, it\u2019s everywhere.</p> <p>Maybe the last year really is leading to change.

The feeling of seeing my parents bewildered, as a child, never left me. I\u2019m 84 years old now and I can\u2019t forget my mother\u2019s tears. I was eight when Israel took over my town of Ein Karem. The world decided to give our land to somebody else to establish a country. We didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>My family arrived in California in the 1950s. My father made a good life for us. If it wasn\u2019t for that divine providence, I would still be there and maybe I would be dead by now. I do love the United States \u2013 and I\u2019m happy here, but it\u2019s not an honest broker. Our people in Gaza and the West Bank are being killed and dying of starvation. Yet our tax money is going against them. We\u2019re supplying Israel with everything. That upsets me the most.

She\u2019s stuck in Gaza with her husband and two young daughters. Last month, she told me over WhatsApp that she wishes Israel would drop a nuclear bomb on the city and get it over with. They can\u2019t take it any more.</p> <p>I\u2019ve lost 20 relatives since Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza. I feel helpless, sitting in metro Detroit. We used to be able to send money. Now, there\u2019s no way to get cash in.</p> <p>As a physician, it feels as though my sister is a terminally ill patient and I\u2019m scrambling to find a cure. Everyone is telling me: there\u2019s nothing you can do. I\u2019m starting to think that she may be right: maybe it is better for them to die than to live this way.</p>    <p>I identify as an independent but generally vote Democratic. America\u2019s continued funding of Israel\u2019s military has really changed my belief in the Democratic party. They have slogans about protecting minorities. This may be true for Black, Hispanic and gay Americans but when it comes to Muslim and Palestinian Americans, we\u2019re considered third-tier citizens. I\u2019ve decided not to vote for them unless there is a major change in policy.</p> <p>I met Michigan\u2019s governor and wrote to lawmakers. I would have preferred not hearing back, compared to the responses I got. They made it seem like there\u2019s nothing America can do about it \u2013 and that all they care about is protecting Israel.</p> <p>It\u2019s been more than 40 years since I was in Palestine. My wife is Palestinian but was born in Syria. My kids didn\u2019t know much about their Palestinian roots. Only my oldest has met my sister. But we\u2019ve been talking about it more now. It\u2019s difficult to explain 100 years of the Palestinian dilemma to teenagers. They\u2019re asking questions about our original village and texting their cousins.</p> <p>My parents live with me. They have aged a decade over the last year. They\u2019re depressed. I have to drag them outside, or they\u2019re always watching the news and crying.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I was asked to be an uncommitted delegate at the Democratic convention. At this point I\u2019m willing to do anything for Palestine\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Sabrene Odeh</strong></em><em><strong>, 29, Seattle, Washington, anti-trafficking advocate and community activist</strong></em><strong><br></strong></p>    <p>Pro-Israeli protesters knocked my father to the ground and spit on us, on 8 October. We were at a demonstration in Kirkland, Washington, calling for an end to Israeli bombardment, apartheid and 76 years of violent occupation. I kept thinking to myself, after that day: we\u2019re all we have. We have to protect each other.</p> <p>In the last year, I\u2019ve been a walking shell of a woman; I haven\u2019t been able to engage with my family or friends in the same way. I carry this immense guilt that I\u2019m not doing more.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Seattle. All four of my grandparents were displaced during the Nakba in 1948. In June, I was asked to be an uncommitted delegate at the Democratic national convention. I don\u2019t really believe in the political system in the US but at this point I\u2019m willing to do anything to advocate for Palestine.</p> <p>I grew up telling people I was Palestinian, not Palestinian American. My entire life, I\u2019ve felt that we don\u2019t belong here. I saw the way my grandparents were treated when they spoke broken English. People saw us differently, so I was hyper-aware that we were viewed as <em>less than</em> from a young age. But I\u2019ve started saying I am Palestinian American now because of how the western world has tried to discard us.</p> <p>We saw this with the young woman who was fatally shot by Israeli forces. Ay\u015fenur Ezgi Eygi had Turkish and American citizenship; she was from Seattle. But there was so much emphasis on her being Turkish, over American, by the government and western media. When it\u2019s convenient for you, we\u2019re no longer American, right? And when it\u2019s convenient for you, we\u2019re American. Now I use American as kind of a screw you to the system, to the people at the top, to say: I grew up here and I deserve to have a voice just like anyone else does.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I sued the US government for facilitating a genocide against my people\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Wael Buhaissy</strong></em><em><strong>, 56, California, electrical engineer and activist<br></strong></em></p>    <p>I don\u2019t have much faith in a court\u2019s ability to deliver justice for ordinary people \u2013 especially when it comes to challenging American foreign policy. But last year, I sued the American government for facilitating a genocide that killed my relatives. It was my way of making sure I\u2019m applying pressure from every angle.</p> <p>I\u2019m generally a shy person. But joining this legal case felt like an opportunity. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, going public with my identity. But these months have changed me. They made me bolder.</p> <p>I was born and raised in Kuwait, to parents who were made refugees in 1948; they are from a city formerly known as Majdal Asqalan in pre-1948 Palestine and now known as Ashkelon, in Israel. I moved to the US almost four decades ago.</p> <p>I felt anxious before giving testimony, in January, about how Israeli attacks killed my cousins and their children. Hours earlier, fellow members from my <em>dabke</em><em> </em>dance troupe performed outside the Oakland courthouse, where journalists gathered. Eventually, I appealed directly to the judge. I looked him in the eyes and said he could make a difference here. While he dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, he acknowledged that a genocide was plausible.</p>    <p>I usually find out about killed relatives through obituaries posted on social media. Every day, I wake up and expect that I\u2019m going to see images of dead bodies and shredded children on my phone. Often, I scroll away. But other times, I tell myself to keep looking because people in Gaza do not have that choice. As for the mainstream news, they\u2019re on team Israel. We barely see any Palestinians featured and news anchors routinely adopt Israeli talking points.</p>",

She\u2019s stuck in Gaza with her husband and two young daughters. Last month, she told me over WhatsApp that she wishes Israel would drop a nuclear bomb on the city and get it over with. They can\u2019t take it any more. I\u2019ve lost 20 relatives since Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza. I feel helpless, sitting in metro Detroit. We used to be able to send money. Now, there\u2019s no way to get cash in. As a physician, it feels as though my sister is a terminally ill patient and I\u2019m scrambling to find a cure. Everyone is telling me: there\u2019s nothing you can do. I\u2019m starting to think that she may be right: maybe it is better for them to die than to live this way. I identify as an independent but generally vote Democratic. America\u2019s continued funding of Israel\u2019s military has really changed my belief in the Democratic party. They have slogans about protecting minorities. This may be true for Black, Hispanic and gay Americans but when it comes to Muslim and Palestinian Americans, we\u2019re considered third-tier citizens. I\u2019ve decided not to vote for them unless there is a major change in policy. I met Michigan\u2019s governor and wrote to lawmakers. I would have preferred not hearing back, compared to the responses I got. They made it seem like there\u2019s nothing America can do about it \u2013 and that all they care about is protecting Israel. It\u2019s been more than 40 years since I was in Palestine. My wife is Palestinian but was born in Syria. My kids didn\u2019t know much about their Palestinian roots. Only my oldest has met my sister. But we\u2019ve been talking about it more now. It\u2019s difficult to explain 100 years of the Palestinian dilemma to teenagers. They\u2019re asking questions about our original village and texting their cousins. My parents live with me. They have aged a decade over the last year. They\u2019re depressed. I have to drag them outside, or they\u2019re always watching the news and crying. \u2018I was asked to be an uncommitted delegate at the Democratic convention. At this point I\u2019m willing to do anything for Palestine\u2019 Sabrene Odeh, 29, Seattle, Washington, anti-trafficking advocate and community activist Pro-Israeli protesters knocked my father to the ground and spit on us, on 8 October. We were at a demonstration in Kirkland, Washington, calling for an end to Israeli bombardment, apartheid and 76 years of violent occupation. I kept thinking to myself, after that day: we\u2019re all we have. We have to protect each other. In the last year, I\u2019ve been a walking shell of a woman; I haven\u2019t been able to engage with my family or friends in the same way. I carry this immense guilt that I\u2019m not doing more. I was born and raised in Seattle. All four of my grandparents were displaced during the Nakba in 1948. In June, I was asked to be an uncommitted delegate at the Democratic national convention. I don\u2019t really believe in the political system in the US but at this point I\u2019m willing to do anything to advocate for Palestine. I grew up telling people I was Palestinian, not Palestinian American. My entire life, I\u2019ve felt that we don\u2019t belong here. I saw the way my grandparents were treated when they spoke broken English. People saw us differently, so I was hyper-aware that we were viewed as less than from a young age. But I\u2019ve started saying I am Palestinian American now because of how the western world has tried to discard us. We saw this with the young woman who was fatally shot by Israeli forces. Ay\u015fenur Ezgi Eygi had Turkish and American citizenship; she was from Seattle. But there was so much emphasis on her being Turkish, over American, by the government and western media. When it\u2019s convenient for you, we\u2019re no longer American, right? And when it\u2019s convenient for you, we\u2019re American. Now I use American as kind of a screw you to the system, to the people at the top, to say: I grew up here and I deserve to have a voice just like anyone else does. \u2018I sued the US government for facilitating a genocide against my people\u2019 Wael Buhaissy, 56, California, electrical engineer and activist I don\u2019t have much faith in a court\u2019s ability to deliver justice for ordinary people \u2013 especially when it comes to challenging American foreign policy. But last year, I sued the American government for facilitating a genocide that killed my relatives. It was my way of making sure I\u2019m applying pressure from every angle. I\u2019m generally a shy person. But joining this legal case felt like an opportunity. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, going public with my identity. But these months have changed me. They made me bolder. I was born and raised in Kuwait, to parents who were made refugees in 1948; they are from a city formerly known as Majdal Asqalan in pre-1948 Palestine and now known as Ashkelon, in Israel. I moved to the US almost four decades ago. I felt anxious before giving testimony, in January, about how Israeli attacks killed my cousins and their children. Hours earlier, fellow members from my dabke dance troupe performed outside the Oakland courthouse, where journalists gathered. Eventually, I appealed directly to the judge. I looked him in the eyes and said he could make a difference here. While he dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, he acknowledged that a genocide was plausible. I usually find out about killed relatives through obituaries posted on social media. Every day, I wake up and expect that I\u2019m going to see images of dead bodies and shredded children on my phone. Often, I scroll away. But other times, I tell myself to keep looking because people in Gaza do not have that choice. As for the mainstream news, they\u2019re on team Israel. We barely see any Palestinians featured and news anchors routinely adopt Israeli talking points.",

      "body": "<p>For five hours, the British photographer Tristan Partridge trekked alongside 80 Kichwa-Panzaleo Indigenous people on a narrow mountainous path near San Isidro in the highlands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ecuador\">Ecuador</a>, to reach a high-altitude wetland ecosystem called the pa\u0301ramo. The group then reached the community\u2019s alpaca corral, where two thatched-roof huts became their base for the next two days.</p>    <p>\u201cPa\u0301ramos are alpine moorland found only in the northern Andes, and this particular pa\u0301ramo is located in the hills above the community itself,\u201d Partridge says. \u201cSome folk were on horseback, and we were accompanied by a number of donkeys and llamas laden with sacks of cement, food, firewood and tools.\u201d</p> <p>During that weekend in September 2011, their <em>minga</em><em> \u2013</em> voluntary work typically focused on building and maintaining shared infrastructure \u2013 was to help maintain San Isidro\u2019s 12-mile (20km) irrigation water pipeline. To keep the water flowing, the volunteers had to fix a section of the pipeline that had been washed away by a landslide.</p> <p>By 7pm, darkness had enveloped the hills, and the group clustered in and around the huts, with some people preparing the evening meal, chatting with the occasional Kichwa word mixed in among the everyday Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cThe cook team were making huge steaming pots of soup on an open fire within the smoke-blackened hut, and I took a quick photo. We ate where we could perch, gathering together at the end of 13 hours of work and hiking,\u201d he recalls.</p>    <p>The \u201cquick photo\u201d Partridge refers to is a striking image in his new photography book, <a href=\"https://pazmaen.com/mingassolidarity\">Mingas+Solidarity</a>, the result of a decade of collaborative work with the people of San Isidro. </p> <p>A specialist in anthropological fieldwork, he joined the community of 500 people in 96 households in the Andes foothills in 2011 and documented their way of life, especially the mingas, which form an integral part of life there.</p> <p>The book describes mingas, which originated in Inca culture, as \u201ccollective work parties\u201d that last from a few hours to a few days. They are \u201ca form of cooperative labour with a very long history across Andean regions\u201d. Partridge says that mingas are central to the Indigenous people\u2019s struggles for justice and dignity.</p>    <p>\u201cOften celebrated, if not romanticised, by outsiders as emblematic of community unity, mingas are also sometimes critiqued as a way for the state \u2013 and previously Inca rulers and Spanish colonial powers \u2013 to extract free labour from Indigenous peoples,\u201d the book reads.</p>    <p>Partridge has a PhD in social anthropology from the University of Edinburgh and extensive experience in community activism and fieldwork photography in countries such as India and Chile.

      "bodyText": "For five hours, the British photographer Tristan Partridge trekked alongside 80 Kichwa-Panzaleo Indigenous people on a narrow mountainous path near San Isidro in the highlands of Ecuador, to reach a high-altitude wetland ecosystem called the pa\u0301ramo. The group then reached the community\u2019s alpaca corral, where two thatched-roof huts became their base for the next two days. \u201cPa\u0301ramos are alpine moorland found only in the northern Andes, and this particular pa\u0301ramo is located in the hills above the community itself,\u201d Partridge says. \u201cSome folk were on horseback, and we were accompanied by a number of donkeys and llamas laden with sacks of cement, food, firewood and tools.\u201d During that weekend in September 2011, their minga \u2013 voluntary work typically focused on building and maintaining shared infrastructure \u2013 was to help maintain San Isidro\u2019s 12-mile (20km) irrigation water pipeline. To keep the water flowing, the volunteers had to fix a section of the pipeline that had been washed away by a landslide. By 7pm, darkness had enveloped the hills, and the group clustered in and around the huts, with some people preparing the evening meal, chatting with the occasional Kichwa word mixed in among the everyday Spanish. \u201cThe cook team were making huge steaming pots of soup on an open fire within the smoke-blackened hut, and I took a quick photo. We ate where we could perch, gathering together at the end of 13 hours of work and hiking,\u201d he recalls. The \u201cquick photo\u201d Partridge refers to is a striking image in his new photography book, Mingas+Solidarity, the result of a decade of collaborative work with the people of San Isidro. A specialist in anthropological fieldwork, he joined the community of 500 people in 96 households in the Andes foothills in 2011 and documented their way of life, especially the mingas, which form an integral part of life there. The book describes mingas, which originated in Inca culture, as \u201ccollective work parties\u201d that last from a few hours to a few days. They are \u201ca form of cooperative labour with a very long history across Andean regions\u201d. Partridge says that mingas are central to the Indigenous people\u2019s struggles for justice and dignity. \u201cOften celebrated, if not romanticised, by outsiders as emblematic of community unity, mingas are also sometimes critiqued as a way for the state \u2013 and previously Inca rulers and Spanish colonial powers \u2013 to extract free labour from Indigenous peoples,\u201d the book reads. Partridge has a PhD in social anthropology from the University of Edinburgh and extensive experience in community activism and fieldwork photography in countries such as India and Chile. He specialises in environmental justice and land rights and his work often documents \u201ccollective efforts to maintain connectedness with place and with each other\u201d, the book says. He first became interested in Ecuador when a new constitution came into force in 2008, which he says was \u201cvery progressive, very forward-looking\u201d as, among other measures, it included landmark provisions for Indigenous rights. Ecuador is a plurinational country with 14 Indigenous nationalities, including the Kichwa people. \u201cOne thing that is really remarkable about Ecuador is the strength and visibility of the national Indigenous movement and how well organised it is,\u201d Partridge says. Three main Indigenous bodies represent the Amazon, the highlands and the coastal regions. \u201cThis tight and established hierarchical organisation of the Indigenous movement allows cooperation between different communities and branches. It also enables swift and effective mobilisation of communities nationwide,\u201d Partridge says. But achievements made by the Indigenous peoples, says Partridge, could be fragile. \u201cOne key point in my project is that Indigenous rights and achievements in Ecuador, and everywhere, always have to be defended because, despite the gains, there might be a change of government at any time and it might completely disregard those rights,\u201d he says. *** Partridge first met members of the San Isidro community when he was working with the Seed Guardians Network, an organisation promoting sustainable farming, and visited them soon afterwards. He was struck by how well organised they were in the village. San Isidro was given control of the pa\u0301ramo in the 1960s when land reforms forced a breakup of the large hacienda farm estates. In 2009 it received a government grant to build the irrigation pipeline, in partnership with neighbouring communities. \u201cCommunity members are responsible for all ongoing maintenance of the pipeline, work which is unfunded.

I\u2019d call this unusual, except it is a lot less unusual than it used to be. Anti-Jewish hate crime skyrocketed after the Hamas attack on Israel last year and still hasn\u2019t returned to what we used to consider \u201cnormal\u201d. There have been almost as many antisemitic incidents in the year since 7 October 2023 as there were in the whole of 2020, 2021 and 2022 combined, according to figures from the Community Security Trust.</p> <p>It\u2019s complacent to assume Israel\u2019s war against Hamas causes this. Antisemites have always found ways to justify their contempt for Jews: either by referring to bad things some Jews have done, inventing things they haven\u2019t done, or blaming them for things other people do. Right now, it feels like all three are in play. The Marxist theorist Norman Geras called this \u201c<a href=\"https://fathomjournal.org/alibi-antisemitism/\">alibi antisemitism</a>\u201d, and nothing provides a greater alibi than Israel. That this fresh surge in visceral hatred began on 7 October itself, while Hamas gunmen were still raping festival-goers and burning kibbutz families in their homes, says everything.</p> <p>However, to focus only on antisemitism that can be seen and measured misses the point, not least because most Jewish people still go about their daily lives without problems. Deeper scars are being inflicted across the community by a shift that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into official statistics. This is found instead in the quiet shunning by schoolfriends, the dirty looks on the train when someone spots your Star of David necklace, or the colleagues\u2019 social media post hoping for a world in which Israel does not exist.</p> <p>Most Jews care deeply about Israel. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise: it is the land where the Jewish people first formed and references to it punctuate Jewish prayer. Today it is the only Jewish state in a world without many Jews at all. This attachment doesn\u2019t always align with political support, and most British Jews <a href=\"https://www.jpr.org.uk/reports/what-do-jews-uk-think-about-israel-and-its-leaders-and-how-has-changed-october-7\">strongly disapprove</a> of Israel\u2019s current leader. You can debate the rights and wrongs of this all day long, but you may as well try to argue away the existence of mountains as persuade Jews that Israel is a modern colonial artifice to which they have no authentic, historic link. It\u2019s an identity thing, like it or not.</p> <p>It can seem almost impossible to navigate the grief of 7 October, fear for the hostages still in captivity, empathy for the endless suffering of Palestinians and now Lebanese, and anxiety about increased antisemitism at home. This becomes even harder when so many people who might otherwise be allies against antisemitism have concluded that Israel simply should not exist, and that Zionism \u2013 the movement that created Jewish national self-determination \u2013 ranks alongside nazism and apartheid in political demonology. It all adds up to a shift in the atmosphere, as if the temperature for Jews has dropped a few degrees.</p> <p>The pressure comes from all sides. Watching <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/05/media/white-house-condemns-tucker-carlson-nazi-propaganda-interview/index.html\">Tucker Carlson</a> nodding away while a guest on his show named Winston Churchill \u2013 not Adolf Hitler \u2013 as the greatest villain of the second world war and claimed that millions died in Nazi camps not through design but by accident was a reminder of how easily Holocaust denial can still find its place in today\u2019s politics. When anti-Muslim riots swept across British towns in August, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/06/far-right-forums-used-to-plan-riots-now-encouraging-antisemitic-attacks\">online forums</a> used to organise them were replete with arguments about whether Jews were the real enemy, because according to many on the far right, mass immigration is part of a Jewish plot to destroy white civilisation. And these fascist conspiracy theorists found their counterparts in those parts of the anti-fascist response who <a href=\"https://everydayhate.substack.com/p/finchley-against-zionists\">claimed</a> the riots were themselves orchestrated by Israel. At least they agree on something: whatever you think is going wrong in the world, there are always Jews to blame.</p>    <p>Some deal with this by ducking beneath the duvet until, hopefully, it all passes. The Jewish university students who walk the long way round to their lectures to avoid the protest encampments, or the central London synagogues that cancel events and shorten their services on days when anti-Israel demonstrations march past their front doors. It wears you down, wondering whether some random stranger is going to call you a genocidal baby killer.</p> <p>Others do the opposite and are more defiantly, openly Jewish than ever. Buy that Star of David pendant, wear that hostage ribbon with pride. It feels more resilient but both responses spring from the same, new root, which is the need to think deeply about what it means to be Jewish in today\u2019s Britain.</p> <p>I know people who changed jobs because they didn\u2019t feel safe as a Jew in their existing workplaces after 7 October; others whose children changed schools for the same reason. When friends return to the UK after visiting Israel they say they felt much safer there than here. This seems irrational: physically they are in much more danger in Israel. \u201cBut I could be myself there and not worry\u201d, they reply. These fears are not about physical safety but identity safety: the ability to be openly Jewish without risking your friendships, standing or dignity.</p> <p>This is why new Jewish staff WhatsApp groups sprang up in countless workplaces after 7 October, for mutual support amid stories of antisemitism from colleagues and indifference from bosses. In some sectors the problems are so widespread that the WhatsApp groups are industry-wide. Many of those workplaces have Muslim staff WhatsApp groups too. They both provide safe spaces, operating in parallel but apart, an understandable and even necessary step in these times \u2013 but they also reflect a silent fracturing of our communities.</p> <p>This is all new. Postwar British Jewry has been one of the great success stories in Jewish history, albeit in a typically understated British way. The life this community has built here and its contribution to modern Britain are worthy of celebration, but it feels like that golden age is over.

      "bodyText": "As Donald Trump has ramped up fundraising from mega-donors for his 2024 presidential campaign and allied Super Pacs, he has increasingly pledged regulatory changes and other policies to boost their businesses, campaign-finance watchdogs have warned. Experts say Trump\u2019s political pitches and maneuverings are a clearly \u201ctransactional\u201d chase for big checks, and pose a serious danger of major corruption in a US political system already flooded with powerful donors and lobbyists. Trump\u2019s transactional fundraising style has accelerated, and is underscored by his intense efforts to corral backing and big checks from Elon Musk \u2013 the billionaire who owns the social media platform X and is worth $263bn\u2013 plus fossil-fuel and crypto currency moguls, while dangling favorable federal policies and perks, say critics. To boost Trump\u2019s electoral fortunes, the Musk-led America Pac had spent almost $60m by mid-September while fossil fuel donors who Trump has courted intensely have ponied up over $20m to other pro-Trump Super Pacs, his campaign and the Republican National Committee, according to OpenSecrets. \u201cFor Trump, political support, as well as access and influence, are all for sale to the wealthiest donors willing to finance Trump\u2019s candidacy,\u201d said Saurav Ghosh, the director of federal campaign finance reform at the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine a more apt description of corruption.\u201d Trump\u2019s wooing of Musk, who Trump has suggested could play a big role on a new federal advisory panel, and other super-rich donors have become more crucial to his chances in November as Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign has overall outraised Trump\u2019s. In August, for instance, the Harris campaign raised a whopping $190m versus the Trump campaign\u2019s haul of $43m, and the Harris campaign is slated to spend more on ads than Trump\u2019s in October. That disparity helps explain why Trump is now heavily focused on hauling in six- and seven-figure checks as he touts regulatory and other policies he would back if he wins in November: Trump\u2019s current drive for big checks come even though in his 2016 campaign Trump called Super Pacs, which can take unlimited sums, a \u201cscam\u201d and a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Campaign-finance watchdogs voice alarm at Trump\u2019s transactional fundraising modus operandi with mega-donors. \u201cTrump appears to see all politics as transactional,\u201d the ex-Federal Election Commission general counsel Larry Noble said, warning that Trump\u2019s dealings with Musk \u201cpresent a number of potential problems\u201d. Noble stressed that Musk \u201chas been aggressively promoting far-right conspiracy theories, lies and memes, many of which call into question the integrity of our elections. Trump\u2019s talk about giving Musk a role in advising on government operations in a second Trump administration should frighten anyone who cares about a functioning government.\u201d Other experts concur. \u201cTrump\u2019s general attitude toward fundraising is concerning because it clearly raises the specter of a presidential candidate effectively, and sometimes explicitly, offering political favors \u2013 including plum government positions or favorable policies \u2013 directly in exchange for contributions,\u201d Ghosh added. Some Republicans, too, express fears about Trump\u2019s transactional fundraising style. \u201cEverything to Trump is a deal, whether it\u2019s business or politics,\u201d said the ex-Republican congressman Dave Trott of Michigan. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t believe rules apply to him \u2026 There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s pushing the envelope.\u201d Criticism of Trump\u2019s transactional modus operandi escalated when Trump hosted a lavish dinner for about 20 oil and gas bigwigs at Mar-a-Lago in April, where he brazenly pledged regulatory, tax and other favors for their industry, if the executives raised $1bn to help him win in November. The Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse previously told the Guardian that Trump\u2019s pitch to the fossil-fuel leaders \u201cmeets the definition of corruption as the founding fathers would have used the term\u201d. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s growing web of fundraising, social media and other ties to Musk, who also heads Tesla and SpaceX, plus Trump\u2019s efforts to pull in large checks from cryptocurrency executives, are raising more red flags, say watchdogs. Critics say that Musk, who endorsed Trump in July, has turned X into a giant megaphone for Trumpist election misinformation, with posts making false claims about non-citizens voting in large numbers in key states. Since he bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, Musk has reinstated banned accounts of Trump and the conspiracist Alex Jones, plus some white supremacists and neo-Nazis who have spread phoney conspiracies that Haitians abduct pets and practice cannibalism. In early September, Musk posted an AI-generated image of Harris that portrayed her as a communist wearing a red uniform and a hat featuring a hammer and sickle. Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s America Pac has emerged as a major Trump campaign ally by mounting get-out-the-vote operations in several pivotal states. According to OpenSecrets, America Pac had spent about $57m by 17 September to boost Trump\u2019s electoral chances with ads and other get out the vote operations. To date, America Pac\u2019s donors include Musk, who has reportedly pledged to pony up millions of dollars to the Pac, and Musk associates such as Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir Technologies, and investor Antonio Gracias. But some state regulators have shown concerns about the Pac\u2019s operations after receiving complaints of misleading information: in August, Michigan and North Carolina officials announced investigations of America Pac\u2019s voter registration practices and website. Lawyers for Musk wrote to officials in both states that they can \u201crest assured knowing that America Pac is utilizing the data it collects to register voters and encourage them to vote\u201d. The world\u2019s richest man, Musk also personally hosted Trump on X on a streamed hour-long event in August giving Trump a valuable shot to reach his audience of about 195 million followers. Musk was also reportedly a top supporter of JD Vance to be Trump\u2019s running mate, and in a post on X called him an \u201cexcellent choice\u201d. Enhancing his Musk ties, Trump in September publicly embraced an idea Musk had first touted by announcing a plan to create a wide-ranging government efficiency commission aimed at making big spending cuts if he wins in November, which Musk could lead. Trump unveiled his new efficiency commission in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, a key business group, where he also touted slashing regulations and big cuts in federal spending. In his pitch, Trump also called for increasing energy production, and embraced cryptocurrencies. After Trump\u2019s speech, Musk modestly wrote on X: \u201cI look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises.

I want to close up the Department of Education, move education back to the states.\u201d Likewise Trump lauded Musk in a 22 September interview \u201cHe feels there\u2019s so much waste and fat in this country, and he\u2019s right.\u201d Noble and other critics raise red flags about Trump\u2019s burgeoning links with Musk. \u201cMusk\u2019s promotion of political attacks and lies to his 195 million followers on one of the largest social media platforms in the world which he controls, presents a real danger to our democracy on its own \u2026 Musk\u2019s handling of Twitter/X has led to the chaotic firing of staff, dismantling of efforts to monitor hate speech and lies, and the loss of business. \u201cTrump has dropped the facade of his transactions serving any ideology or purpose other than what he perceives as best for him at any given moment,\u201d he added. Trump\u2019s drive to rope in checks and other support from Musk, a cryptocurrency backer, has overlapped Trump moves to garner financial backing from more cryptocurrency titans. Trump in July spoke at the annual Bitcoin conference where he promised to make America \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world\u201d. Trump effusively praised the assembled industry leaders as \u201cgeniuses\u201d, even though in 2021 he called bitcoin a \u201cscam\u201d. To the crowd\u2019s delight, Trump pledged to fire the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler, who has earned a reputation as a tough regulator by cracking down on some cryptocurrency frauds, and \u201cappoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future\u201d. The wealthy crypto leaders who have ponied up to help Trump include th billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who each have donated $250,000 to America Pac, and more than $700,000 together to the pro Trump Make America Great Again Pac. In a crypto twist that revealed family ties to the industry, Trump hosted a virtual briefing on X in mid-September with his sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump to announce a new cryptocurrency venture dubbed World Liberty Financial, which they helped launch along with Trump friend Steve Witkoff and \u201ctwo little-known crypto entrepreneurs with no experience in running a high-profile business\u201d, according to the New York Times. Trump said on X that \u201ccrypto is one of those things we have to do. Whether we like it or not, I have to do it.\u201d Although Trump and his family reportedly won\u2019t own or manage World Liberty they may receive some compensation, and a white paper for the venture calls Trump its \u201cchief crypto advocate\u201d. \u201cThe last thing we need is a candidate for president of the United States or his family going into the crypto business,\u201d said Richard Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W Bush. Painter warned broadly: \u201cCrypto is one ideal vehicle for money laundering and paying bribes.\u201d Related concerns about crypto arose in September when the FBI in an annual report disclosed that fraud related to crypto businesses soared in 2023 with Americans suffering $5.6bn in losses, a 45% jump from the prior year. Election experts warn of other dangers in Trump\u2019s moves to lure big checks from donors in tandem with promising various government help to benefit their bottom lines. \u201cA somewhat unique hallmark of Donald Trump\u2019s political brand is how closely it\u2019s intertwined with his business identity,\u201d said Daniel Weiner, director of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. Weiner cautioned that while some of the funding support from tech leaders probably reflects \u201cgenuine affinity\u201d, he stressed: \u201cThese donors have a tremendous amount of business before the federal government \u2013 not just regulation but also a stake in hundreds of billions of dollars in government contracts.\u201d Likewise, Ghosh warned that Trump\u2019s \u201capproach to both campaigning and governing is fundamentally at odds with transparency, accountability and responsiveness to the public\u2019s interests\u201d.",

It was part of a suite of rules a pro-Trump majority has blitzed through in recent months that observers worry could cause confusion and open the door to undermining the election results. Other new rules allow local election board members to undertake an undefined \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before they certify election results and allow them unlimited access to documents before they vote to certify. The hand-count requirement, which was challenged in court last week, and the other new rules have elicited deep concern that Trump supporters have a powerful array of tools to create uncertainty about the vote this fall. Here\u2019s a look at the hand count and why it\u2019s become so controversial: What does the new rule say?

The rule does not define what correcting any inconsistency will entail. The rule only applies to ballots cast on election day. The state board of elections voted to put off considering a similar rule that would apply to early votes. Why is this controversial? Election officials across the state and voting rights groups have almost universally opposed the rule.

Growing up, Emma\u2019s Christmases revolved around her beloved grandmother, who passed away in 2017. \u201cShe was incredibly special and her death created a big hole in our family Christmas,\u201d she says. \u201cWe used to spend Christmas Day with her at my dad\u2019s house every year, and since she\u2019s been gone we\u2019ve had to find a new way to celebrate it. We now have Christmas at our house, and our ornaments are about us trying to create new traditions for our little family, while also being a link back to my grandmother.\u201d \u2018Our ornaments are about us trying to create new traditions for our little family,\u2019 says Emma When her grandmother was still alive, Emma had a decoration made featuring a photograph of herself, her mother and her grandmother, and all three women had their own. \u201cMy grandmother was buried with hers and I have mine out where I can see it all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that was another big reason for deciding to make all these other decorations every year \u2013 I knew they were really special mementos to have. \u201cEven before we began this tradition, most of our decorations had a personal meaning \u2013 we\u2019d picked them up in different places we\u2019d been, so they reminded us of trips we\u2019d taken. It won\u2019t be long until the entire tree is covered in ornaments that tell a story of our lives.\u201d The perfect gift The best people in life deserve the best chocolates, so treat them to Lily O\u2019Brien\u2019s Desserts Collection.

      "body": "<h2>Record-breaker Nobbs likened to Modric</h2> <p>The Aston Villa midfielder Jordan Nobbs became the Women\u2019s Super League\u2019s all-time leading appearance maker when she played in her 193rd WSL match, an entertaining 4-2 loss at Brighton. The Villa manager, Robert de Pauw, said: \u201cThe energy and the experience she brings on the pitch, I know she\u2019s one of the older players on the team, but good enough is old enough, like a little [Luka] Modric in midfield. If I compare it to one player it would be him. I have all the respect in the world for what she\u2019s doing and the level that she brings.\u201d The 71-times capped England international is being deployed in a deeper, holding role by De Pauw, rather than as the No 10 she became known as earlier in her career, and De Pauw said of the 31-year-old former Arsenal player: \u201cIf you read the game well like Jordan, then you can play in both roles.\u201d <strong>TG</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/brighton-aston-villa-wsl-match-report\">Match report: Brighton 4-2 Aston Villa</a></p>    <h2>Kaminski keeps Palace grounded</h2> <p>The Crystal Palace head coach, Laura Kaminski, was determined not to get carried away after her side secured their first WSL win. Her promoted team were deserved winners at Leicester, after conceding 11 goals without scoring in their opening fixtures against Tottenham and Chelsea, and Kaminski told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s made history for the club, which I\u2019m extremely proud of. The players deserved the points from their performance. We\u2019ve worked extremely hard and been through a really tough start in the WSL, and to keep their minds focused and learning throughout the weeks we\u2019ve had, to apply the execution today was fantastic. Now we really need to keep our feet on the ground, not be too high with the highs, not too low with the lows. I was asking the players to stay steady when we lost so now I certainly won\u2019t be asking them to celebrate too hard. It\u2019s one game, but we need to take the positives and really keep trying to improve.\u201d <strong>TG</strong></p> <h2>Blunt Arsenal hit familiar problem</h2> <p>It was a case of the same old story for Arsenal as they played out a goalless draw with Everton at the Emirates. Their inability to break down a deep, compact defence has become a running theme in the Jonas Eidevall era and it led to the dropping of another two points. The stats illustrated the crux of issue: Arsenal created 21 chances but managed only five efforts on target. That kind of ineffectiveness in front of goal rarely allows you to mount a title challenge. In contrast, it was a performance that will have given Everton a much-needed boost after a difficult start to this campaign. Brian S\u00f8rensen was full of praise for his team who dug deep to take home an important point. \u201cThe resilience, the togetherness, the willingness to fight for each other, the coolness, the calmness ... I\u2019m super-proud,\u201d he said. <strong>SD</strong></p> <h2>City showcase strength in depth</h2> <p>Manchester City went top with a comfortable 2-0 win over West Ham. Gareth Taylor made five changes to his XI, with Jill Roord starting for the first time since her anterior cruciate ligament injury. Chloe Kelly, Laura Blindkilde Brown and Mary Fowler made their first league starts of the campaign, while Vivianne Miedema and Khadija Shaw dropped to the bench. City struggled to extend their advantage after Lauren Hemp\u2019s 10th-minute opener, but that changed when Shaw came on to assist Fowler with her fourth touch. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe changed a few things obviously with new personnel coming in. We have to be patient in letting them settle and finding their rhythm. Second half I felt we needed that injection from the sidelines and we got that with Bunny [Shaw] and Aoba [Fujino]. We\u2019ve got improved options I feel this season now, which is going to help the team.\u201d <strong>EH</strong></p> <h2>Lundgaard injury mars Liverpool win</h2> <p>Liverpool\u2019s first win of the WSL season was marred by what looked to be a serious injury to the midfielder Sofie Lundgaard. The 22-year-old was forced off after her left knee buckled while she was challenging Tottenham\u2019s Amanda Nild\u00e9n. Lundgaard left the pitch in tears with the help of two physios in the 32nd minute. Liverpool\u2019s manager, Matt Beard, said her injury was \u201cprobably\u201d related to her anterior cruciate ligament. \u201cI\u2019m gutted for Sofie,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you could see the girls at half-time were visibly upset with the Sofie Lundgaard situation.

My friends abandoned me. I was dealing with a heartbreak and my son\u2019s health. I was so depressed and frustrated that I shaved my head completely,\u201d says Odiete, known as Jodie.</p> <p>\u201cThe doctors said my child might not live beyond two years. They said the condition had no cure and no surgery could fix it. I had to numb myself to that reality by quitting music and getting a nine-to-five job for one year to distract myself. I would often cry on my way to work in the long Lagos traffic.\u201d</p> <p>When Odiete shared images online of herself singing with her son Chinua she experienced trolling and abuse. \u201cI\u2019d post my baby, and people would ask what was wrong with him. Some even accused me of trying to abort him, which wasn\u2019t true. But sharing made me feel better, so I continued. I didn\u2019t want to hide him for ever. This is the world he\u2019s come into, and I want people to accept him for who he is.\u201d</p> <p>That drive led her to set up the Chinua Children Care Foundation to support other families with children with special needs, and to advocate for an education and welfare system for those children.</p> <p>In a society where poverty is widespread, being dependent on others is something that can be frightening and shameful, says Oluwakemi Oluwakoyode, whose daughter Oluwaponmile has cerebral palsy.</p> <p>Oluwaponmile\u2019s condition was withheld from her parents by healthcare workers who had seen how taboo and fear around disability in Nigeria had led to children being abandoned or rejected.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people advised me to kill and throw my baby away. I stopped taking public buses due to the comments</p> <footer> <cite>Oluwakemi Oluwakoyode</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When doctors finally admitted that they had known all along about her child\u2019s cerebral palsy, Oluwakayode was shocked.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my child would be dependent on others for many things in her life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Now aged six, Oluwaponmile, spent weeks in a coma as a baby but recovered. It was not until months later, when a doctor suggested physiotherapy for Oluwaponmile, that Oluwakayode realised that her daughter\u2019s condition had not been fully explained to her.</p> <p>Dr Iyare Osarhiemen, of Alex Ekwueme federal university teaching hospital in Ebonyi state, says withholding a diagnosis from parents for fear of scaring them is too common, although poor medical practice. \u201cIt only makes the parents anxious, and gives them false hope regarding the health of the child,\u201d he says.</p>    <p>Oluwakayode had to leave her job as headteacher in a Lagos primary school to care for Oluwaponmile, who suffered frequent seizures. In her community, many believed the baby was cursed, as disabilities can be <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320757168_Witchcraft_Wealth_and_Disability_Reinterpretation_of_a_folk_belief_in_contemporary_urban_Africa\">attributed to witchcraft</a> in parts of west Africa.</p> <p>\u201cSome people advised me to kill and throw my baby away. I stopped taking public buses due to the comments and started using a taxi, despite the cost, when I took her for therapy. I was slowly sliding into depression,\u201d Oluwakayode says.</p> <p>She enrolled her daughter in a private school, but after a few days she was pressed by the management to withdraw her after some parents threatened to remove their own children if Oluwaponmile stayed in the class. \u201cThey stripped my child of her dignity.

      "bodyText": "Having a baby should have been the icing on the cake for Joy Eseoghene Odiete, a musician whose hit song Kuchi Kuchi was an anthem to love known across Nigeria, while her appearance on Idols West Africa had brought her a TV audience. But her little boy was born with lissencephaly (a rare brain disorder) and cerebral palsy. \u201cMy marriage fell apart three months later. My friends abandoned me. I was dealing with a heartbreak and my son\u2019s health. I was so depressed and frustrated that I shaved my head completely,\u201d says Odiete, known as Jodie. \u201cThe doctors said my child might not live beyond two years. They said the condition had no cure and no surgery could fix it. I had to numb myself to that reality by quitting music and getting a nine-to-five job for one year to distract myself. I would often cry on my way to work in the long Lagos traffic.\u201d When Odiete shared images online of herself singing with her son Chinua she experienced trolling and abuse. \u201cI\u2019d post my baby, and people would ask what was wrong with him. Some even accused me of trying to abort him, which wasn\u2019t true. But sharing made me feel better, so I continued. I didn\u2019t want to hide him for ever. This is the world he\u2019s come into, and I want people to accept him for who he is.\u201d That drive led her to set up the Chinua Children Care Foundation to support other families with children with special needs, and to advocate for an education and welfare system for those children. In a society where poverty is widespread, being dependent on others is something that can be frightening and shameful, says Oluwakemi Oluwakoyode, whose daughter Oluwaponmile has cerebral palsy. Oluwaponmile\u2019s condition was withheld from her parents by healthcare workers who had seen how taboo and fear around disability in Nigeria had led to children being abandoned or rejected. When doctors finally admitted that they had known all along about her child\u2019s cerebral palsy, Oluwakayode was shocked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my child would be dependent on others for many things in her life,\u201d she says. Now aged six, Oluwaponmile, spent weeks in a coma as a baby but recovered. It was not until months later, when a doctor suggested physiotherapy for Oluwaponmile, that Oluwakayode realised that her daughter\u2019s condition had not been fully explained to her. Dr Iyare Osarhiemen, of Alex Ekwueme federal university teaching hospital in Ebonyi state, says withholding a diagnosis from parents for fear of scaring them is too common, although poor medical practice. \u201cIt only makes the parents anxious, and gives them false hope regarding the health of the child,\u201d he says. Oluwakayode had to leave her job as headteacher in a Lagos primary school to care for Oluwaponmile, who suffered frequent seizures. In her community, many believed the baby was cursed, as disabilities can be attributed to witchcraft in parts of west Africa. \u201cSome people advised me to kill and throw my baby away. I stopped taking public buses due to the comments and started using a taxi, despite the cost, when I took her for therapy. I was slowly sliding into depression,\u201d Oluwakayode says. She enrolled her daughter in a private school, but after a few days she was pressed by the management to withdraw her after some parents threatened to remove their own children if Oluwaponmile stayed in the class. \u201cThey stripped my child of her dignity. They called her an \u2018imbecile\u2019. They made me feel like having a child with special needs was something to be ashamed of,\u201d she says. Dr Murtala Yusuf, of the Usmanu Danfodiyo University faculty of education in Sokoto, worries that government neglect of children with disabilities contributes to the critical numbers of children out of school in Nigeria. \u201cThere are very few special needs schools in Nigeria and those that exist are in a terrible condition \u2013 a reflection of the government\u2019s neglect of education. They lack skilled manpower and resources,\u201d he says. There is no data on children in Nigeria with special needs but about 29 million people in the country live with disabilities, and across the African continent, about 95% of children with disabilities do not attend school. Despite a 2019 law that mandates inclusive education for children with special needs, most face stigma. Emmanuella Akinola, co-founder of Accesstech Innovation and Research Center, which provides assistive technology for the visually impaired in Nigeria, says: \u201cThe government is not living up to expectations. These laws are barely enacted. People with disabilities are not getting the right support from the government,\u201d Akinola adds that despite several promises, the government has failed to create support systems for families of children with special needs. The School for Special Needs Children in Osun state, established by the government in 1985, now depends on philanthropy for survival. \u201cMany hostels, classrooms and toilets are in disrepair. Some roofs leak and fences have collapsed. We reported the situation to the government, but no assistance has been provided,\u201d says a teacher who wishes to remain anonymous. Omotoke Olugbode, an inclusion advocate, says: \u201cThis problem stems from the fact that people do not see children with special needs as part of society.\u201d For Oluwakayode, who now helps the Chinua foundation organise meetings featuring skill acquisition programmes, health talks, and games for parents with special needs children, the group is now her and her daughter\u2019s family. \u201cI saw what Jodie did with her baby and I was inspired.

I home school her, and the rest of the family takes turns to help,\u201d she says. The community shares challenges and discusses strategies. Occasionally, cash donations and support equipment are distributed to families in need. Funds are provided for some to start businesses. Many of the women now volunteer in their communities, helping others understand that children should always be seen as a blessing. \u201cThese children may not communicate like others, but they are human beings who deserve to be loved,\u201d says Odiete. \u201cSometimes, we come together to laugh, cry and hug each other. This helps improve our mental health as caregivers to special needs children \u2013 a task which comes with diverse challenges.\u201d Society\u2019s insensitivity towards children with special needs can be overwhelming, says Faith Gabriel, 50, a civil servant in Kogi state. \u201cOne day, I prayed and asked God to take my life,\u201d says Gabriel, who cares for her four-year-old grandson, Eleojo, who has cerebral palsy. \u201cMost of the time, my waist and joints ache because I have to carry him everywhere,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>Scott McTominay will need to study Italian a while longer before he can understand all the lovely things being written about him in the nation\u2019s newspapers, but if he were to thumb through the sports pages from the past few days he might pick out one familiar word. Journalists scrambling to define the Scotsman have referred to him repeatedly as Antonio Conte\u2019s \u201cJolly\u201d.</p> \n<p>These are not remarks on the player\u2019s outlook, though they could be. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKLMpGAfFOw&amp;ab_channel=SSCNapoli\">My biggest dream as a person is to be happy</a>,\u201d said McTominay in an interview for Napoli\u2019s in-house channels last month. \u201cHappiness is the best thing in life, and that is the only thing I concentrate on: try to be happy, with my family, my friends, my girlfriend \u2026 when you have a smile on your face you play better at football as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Italian use of \u201cJolly\u201d refers instead to the Joker in a deck of cards, a throwback to the \u201cJolly Joker\u201d who appeared in <a href=\"https://www.mediastorehouse.co.uk/mary-evans-prints-online/new-images-july-2020/joker-playing-card-20154293.html\">packs imported from Britain two centuries ago</a>. McTominay is being billed as Napoli\u2019s wildcard: the guy whose versatility could upgrade a modest hand into a winning one.</p> \n<p>Hyperbole? Perhaps, but McTominay has made a decisive impact so far. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/25/manchester-united-sale-scott-mctominay-napoli\">Signed from Manchester United for \u20ac30.5m at the end of the transfer window</a>, he made his first start in a 0-0 draw with Juventus last month and scored his first Napoli goal during a Coppa Italia rout of Palermo five days later, finding the net within seconds of entering as a second-half substitute.</p> \n<p>He has played the full 90 minutes of both Napoli\u2019s league games since. After providing an assist \u2013 aided by the defender Andrea Carboni \u2013 for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia\u2019s goal against Monza, McTominay opened the scoring himself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/04/european-football-scott-mctominay-strikes-early-as-napoli-ease-past-como\">a 3-1 win over Como</a> on Friday night.</p> \n<p>The game had barely started when Giovanni Di Lorenzo angled a pass forward to Romelu Lukaku from the right flank. He held off a defender before keeping the ball moving inside to McTominay, who created space with his first touch then finished into the bottom left corner with his second. There were 25 seconds on the clock.</p> \n<p>McTominay ran to celebrate under the Curva, sharing the moment with fans he has described \u201csome of the best I\u2019ve ever seen and experienced\u201d. On the sidelines, Conte clenched his fists and bellowed. Before the Monza game, he had told Dazn: \u201cScott is a player who has goals in his blood \u2026 a footballer who has goals in his DNA.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was no surprise to see the manager make Lukaku a transfer priority this summer, the pair having worked together so fruitfully at Inter, but McTominay was not far behind on his wishlist. When Conte lamented about how the failure to sell Victor Osimhen was \u201cblocking\u201d the club\u2019s spending plans in late August, this was one of the main players on his mind.</p> \n<p>Napoli have shifted their entire tactical setup to accommodate McTominay\u2019s skillset. They began this season using a back three familiar to anyone who has followed Conte through his career, but swapped to a four-man defence against Juventus and have not looked back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA_EN/status/1842244867704938903\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">McTominay lighting it up! \u2728<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NapoliComo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NapoliComo</a> 1-0 <a href=\"https://t.co/VIXYWTa8EB\">pic.twitter.com/VIXYWTa8EB</a></p>\u2014 Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA_EN/status/1842244867704938903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2024</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The detail of the team\u2019s shape can shift according to the opponent and moment in a game. Some have called it a 4-3-3, while others see echoes of the 4-2-4 Conte favoured back when he was making his coaching breakthrough at Bari.</p> \n<p>In practice, McTominay has occupied the left side of the pitch, sometimes playing box-to-box but regularly moving up to hold positions even higher than Lukaku at centre-forward. The Belgian, in turn, will often drop deep, Conte long having believed Lukaku is most effective when he can run at defenders with the ball at his feet. Kvaratskhelia and Matteo Politano occupy the wings.</p> \n<p>After the draw against Juventus, Conte said the change of formation \u201cwas born from the arrivals of McTominay and [Billy] Gilmour, as well as the return of [Michael] Folorunsho [from a loan to Verona]. Before we only had two midfielders. Now we have a strong group to exploit.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is clear which of them was foremost in his thoughts. Where Gilmour and Folorunsho are yet to start a league game, McTominay already looks indispensable. His work ethic alone marks him out as Conte\u2019s kind of player, having covered more distance in all three of his starts than anyone else on the pitch. The sample size is tiny, but <a href=\"https://www.legaseriea.it/it/serie-a/statistiche\">Serie A\u2019s official data</a> puts him first in the league, averaging 11.91km per game. </p> \n<p>He has done much more than just run. Among the most encouraging aspects of McTominay\u2019s bright start is how quickly he has found understanding with his teammates Both of his goals arrived from Lukaku assists after he occupied spaces the centre-forward left open by moving away from the penalty box.</p> \n<p>These are early days, for both the player and his team. Napoli, who began their campaign with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/article/2024/aug/19/serie-a-antonio-conte-napoli-inter-milan\">humbling 3-0 defeat to Verona</a>, have bounced back so strongly they now sit top of the table heading into the international break. But they are yet to face many of Serie A\u2019s strongest teams.</p> \n<p>We will know more by mid-December, after they come through a seven-game stretch in which they face Milan, Atalanta, Inter, Roma, Torino and Lazio (once in the league and another time in the Coppa Italia). Still, it also bears remembering that this is a team that finished 10th in Serie A last season. To be in this position after seven games is already a big stride in the right direction.</p> \n<p>The performance against Como was far from flawless. Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s newly-promoted side responded well after falling behind and had already struck the post through Nico Paz before Gabriel Strefezza equalised with a shot from outside the box just before half-time.</p> \n<p>A Napoli victory hardly felt inevitable, but Sergi Roberto\u2019s slow reactions and clumsy challenge on Math\u00edas Olivera gifted them a penalty soon after the interval.

      "bodyText": "Scott McTominay will need to study Italian a while longer before he can understand all the lovely things being written about him in the nation\u2019s newspapers, but if he were to thumb through the sports pages from the past few days he might pick out one familiar word. Journalists scrambling to define the Scotsman have referred to him repeatedly as Antonio Conte\u2019s \u201cJolly\u201d. These are not remarks on the player\u2019s outlook, though they could be. \u201cMy biggest dream as a person is to be happy,\u201d said McTominay in an interview for Napoli\u2019s in-house channels last month. \u201cHappiness is the best thing in life, and that is the only thing I concentrate on: try to be happy, with my family, my friends, my girlfriend \u2026 when you have a smile on your face you play better at football as well.\u201d The Italian use of \u201cJolly\u201d refers instead to the Joker in a deck of cards, a throwback to the \u201cJolly Joker\u201d who appeared in packs imported from Britain two centuries ago. McTominay is being billed as Napoli\u2019s wildcard: the guy whose versatility could upgrade a modest hand into a winning one. Hyperbole? Perhaps, but McTominay has made a decisive impact so far. Signed from Manchester United for \u20ac30.5m at the end of the transfer window, he made his first start in a 0-0 draw with Juventus last month and scored his first Napoli goal during a Coppa Italia rout of Palermo five days later, finding the net within seconds of entering as a second-half substitute. He has played the full 90 minutes of both Napoli\u2019s league games since. After providing an assist \u2013 aided by the defender Andrea Carboni \u2013 for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia\u2019s goal against Monza, McTominay opened the scoring himself in a 3-1 win over Como on Friday night. The game had barely started when Giovanni Di Lorenzo angled a pass forward to Romelu Lukaku from the right flank. He held off a defender before keeping the ball moving inside to McTominay, who created space with his first touch then finished into the bottom left corner with his second. There were 25 seconds on the clock. McTominay ran to celebrate under the Curva, sharing the moment with fans he has described \u201csome of the best I\u2019ve ever seen and experienced\u201d. On the sidelines, Conte clenched his fists and bellowed. Before the Monza game, he had told Dazn: \u201cScott is a player who has goals in his blood \u2026 a footballer who has goals in his DNA.\u201d It was no surprise to see the manager make Lukaku a transfer priority this summer, the pair having worked together so fruitfully at Inter, but McTominay was not far behind on his wishlist. When Conte lamented about how the failure to sell Victor Osimhen was \u201cblocking\u201d the club\u2019s spending plans in late August, this was one of the main players on his mind. Napoli have shifted their entire tactical setup to accommodate McTominay\u2019s skillset. They began this season using a back three familiar to anyone who has followed Conte through his career, but swapped to a four-man defence against Juventus and have not looked back. The detail of the team\u2019s shape can shift according to the opponent and moment in a game. Some have called it a 4-3-3, while others see echoes of the 4-2-4 Conte favoured back when he was making his coaching breakthrough at Bari. In practice, McTominay has occupied the left side of the pitch, sometimes playing box-to-box but regularly moving up to hold positions even higher than Lukaku at centre-forward. The Belgian, in turn, will often drop deep, Conte long having believed Lukaku is most effective when he can run at defenders with the ball at his feet. Kvaratskhelia and Matteo Politano occupy the wings. After the draw against Juventus, Conte said the change of formation \u201cwas born from the arrivals of McTominay and [Billy] Gilmour, as well as the return of [Michael] Folorunsho [from a loan to Verona]. Before we only had two midfielders. Now we have a strong group to exploit.\u201d It is clear which of them was foremost in his thoughts. Where Gilmour and Folorunsho are yet to start a league game, McTominay already looks indispensable. His work ethic alone marks him out as Conte\u2019s kind of player, having covered more distance in all three of his starts than anyone else on the pitch. The sample size is tiny, but Serie A\u2019s official data puts him first in the league, averaging 11.91km per game. He has done much more than just run. Among the most encouraging aspects of McTominay\u2019s bright start is how quickly he has found understanding with his teammates Both of his goals arrived from Lukaku assists after he occupied spaces the centre-forward left open by moving away from the penalty box. These are early days, for both the player and his team. Napoli, who began their campaign with a humbling 3-0 defeat to Verona, have bounced back so strongly they now sit top of the table heading into the international break. But they are yet to face many of Serie A\u2019s strongest teams. We will know more by mid-December, after they come through a seven-game stretch in which they face Milan, Atalanta, Inter, Roma, Torino and Lazio (once in the league and another time in the Coppa Italia). Still, it also bears remembering that this is a team that finished 10th in Serie A last season. To be in this position after seven games is already a big stride in the right direction. The performance against Como was far from flawless. Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s newly-promoted side responded well after falling behind and had already struck the post through Nico Paz before Gabriel Strefezza equalised with a shot from outside the box just before half-time. A Napoli victory hardly felt inevitable, but Sergi Roberto\u2019s slow reactions and clumsy challenge on Math\u00edas Olivera gifted them a penalty soon after the interval. Lukaku converted, before setting up another summer signing, David Neres, to seal the points late on. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not thinking about nothing like that,\u201d said McTominay when asked about being top of the table at full-time. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to take it game by game \u2026 It\u2019s great for us to win here but we\u2019ve got a lot more work to do and a lot more steps to take.\u201d Having spoken about McTominay the previous week, Conte chose to highlight other players in his post-game remarks, praising Politano for how he had matured since they worked together at Inter, Neres for his impact off the bench and Lukaku, \u201cwho I always say can shift the balance of a game on his own.\u201d This team is still a work in progress. Napoli churned through three managers last season, and Conte\u2019s first job was to restore a sense of stability. Yet they did spend close to \u20ac150m on new signings this summer, bringing in not only Lukaku, McTominay, Gilmour and Neres but the defenders Rafa Mar\u00edn and Alessandro Buongiorno as well. Conte was expected to make this team competitive again at the top of Serie A, just perhaps not quite so quickly. McTominay\u2019s quick integration has been essential, a Scottish Jolly putting smiles on Neapolitan lips.",

      "body": "<p>In the last few months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has done interviews with rightwing Twitch streamer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/trump-adin-ross-tesla-rolex\">Adin Ross</a> and a host of podcasters, including Dr Phil, comedian Theo Von, computer scientist Lex Fridman, and YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/14/trump-logan-paul-ai-speech\">Logan Paul</a> \u2013 part of what <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/09/trump-lex-fridman-podcast-tour/679702/\">the Atlantic</a> has dubbed Trump\u2019s \u201cred-pill podcast tour\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s posted incessantly on his own social media platform, Truth Social. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/13/elon-musk-donald-trump-x-interview-delay\">did a live space</a> on Twitter/X with the platform\u2019s owner, Elon Musk. He talked with Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham and called into Fox &amp; Friends and spoke to other Fox hosts and personalities.</p> <p>His media strategy aligns with the current state of the rightwing media landscape: Fox is still a dominant source, but for the most Maga-adherent, it\u2019s not Trumpy enough, despite some of its hosts embracing election denialism around the 2020 US election. Instead, there\u2019s increasing fragmentation thanks to influencers and lesser-known outlets built around Trumpism.</p> <p>This is the first election since Tucker Carlson, once Fox\u2019s loudest voice in a primetime spot, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/24/tucker-carlson-leaving-fox-news\">reportedly fired</a> by the network, and his solo ventures so far haven\u2019t taken on the prominence he had on TV. It\u2019s also the first election since longtime Republican heavyweight Rush Limbaugh died. These big changes have left holes in rightwing media, which were filled by an increasing cadre of influencers, content creators and smaller outlets.</p> <p>Adrianna Munoz, a 58-year-old from Queens, New York, who attended a Trump rally earlier this year in the Bronx, told the Guardian that she mostly gets news from YouTube, X and conservative commentators she follows, such as Tim Pool and Benny Johnson.</p> <p>\u201cI used to watch TV news every morning \u2013 network news and the local news channel in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t. They sold out. They don\u2019t tell you the truth. I don\u2019t want to hear that rubbish.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s grip on rightwing media is ironclad, said Julie Millican, the vice-president of Media Matters, a progressive center that tracks conservative media. In the past, the Republican party and its candidates would follow what rightwing media did and align its policies that way \u2013 but now, the media follows Trump, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I used to watch TV news every morning \u2013 network news and the local news channel ... Now I don\u2019t. They sold out. They don\u2019t tell you the truth. I don\u2019t want to hear that rubbish</p> <footer> <cite>Adrianna Munoz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t capitulate to what Trump and his enablers and his supporters are looking for, then they\u2019ll shut you out,\u201d Millican said. Since his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his influence has only increased, and \u201cnow he has a stronger control over the entire media ecosystem than he did previously\u201d, she added.</p> <p>As rightwing outlets rise, the stories they cover differ more from what\u2019s on mainstream news, furthering the bubbles a divided United States lives within. While in years past, you\u2019d find different takes on the day\u2019s news in left- and right-leaning outlets, you\u2019ll now find stories that exist solely on rightwing media, Millican said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like every day is a new conspiracy or a new attack, and it\u2019s just hard to even keep up on it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf the time, when you listen to somebody who consumes nothing but rightwing media, you have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <h2>TV news and rightwing websites</h2> <p>Traffic to news websites, including rightwing sites, is down compared with 2020. Howard Polskin, who tracks conservative media on his site The Righting, said a few factors play into the decrease. Facebook and other Meta social media de-emphasize news content now, sending less traffic to news outlets. And 2020 had several major news events colliding: a pandemic that kept people online more, nationwide protests over racial justice and a hotly contested election.</p> <p>Polskin tracks monthly visits to rightwing sites and produces traffic reports. The top 10 for <a href=\"https://therighting.com/top-20/august-2024-top-20-right-wing-news-websites/\">August 2024</a>: Fox, Outkick (a sports and commentary site owned by Fox), Newsmax, Epoch Times, National Review, Washington Times, Daily Wire, TheBlaze, Washington Examiner and Daily Caller. Gateway Pundit is not far behind, and InfoWars, the once-maligned site headed by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/g-s1-24410/alex-jones-infowars-bankruptcy-sandy-hook-judge\">bankrupted</a> conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, is in the top 20.</p>    <p>No single star has taken the place that Carlson or Limbaugh once held. Some conservatives told the Guardian they stopped watching Fox as often after Carlson left or because the network isn\u2019t Maga enough.

      "bodyText": "In the last few months, Donald Trump has done interviews with rightwing Twitch streamer Adin Ross and a host of podcasters, including Dr Phil, comedian Theo Von, computer scientist Lex Fridman, and YouTuber Logan Paul \u2013 part of what the Atlantic has dubbed Trump\u2019s \u201cred-pill podcast tour\u201d. He\u2019s posted incessantly on his own social media platform, Truth Social. He did a live space on Twitter/X with the platform\u2019s owner, Elon Musk. He talked with Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham and called into Fox &amp; Friends and spoke to other Fox hosts and personalities. His media strategy aligns with the current state of the rightwing media landscape: Fox is still a dominant source, but for the most Maga-adherent, it\u2019s not Trumpy enough, despite some of its hosts embracing election denialism around the 2020 US election. Instead, there\u2019s increasing fragmentation thanks to influencers and lesser-known outlets built around Trumpism. This is the first election since Tucker Carlson, once Fox\u2019s loudest voice in a primetime spot, was reportedly fired by the network, and his solo ventures so far haven\u2019t taken on the prominence he had on TV. It\u2019s also the first election since longtime Republican heavyweight Rush Limbaugh died. These big changes have left holes in rightwing media, which were filled by an increasing cadre of influencers, content creators and smaller outlets. Adrianna Munoz, a 58-year-old from Queens, New York, who attended a Trump rally earlier this year in the Bronx, told the Guardian that she mostly gets news from YouTube, X and conservative commentators she follows, such as Tim Pool and Benny Johnson. \u201cI used to watch TV news every morning \u2013 network news and the local news channel in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t. They sold out. They don\u2019t tell you the truth. I don\u2019t want to hear that rubbish.\u201d Trump\u2019s grip on rightwing media is ironclad, said Julie Millican, the vice-president of Media Matters, a progressive center that tracks conservative media. In the past, the Republican party and its candidates would follow what rightwing media did and align its policies that way \u2013 but now, the media follows Trump, she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t capitulate to what Trump and his enablers and his supporters are looking for, then they\u2019ll shut you out,\u201d Millican said. Since his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his influence has only increased, and \u201cnow he has a stronger control over the entire media ecosystem than he did previously\u201d, she added. As rightwing outlets rise, the stories they cover differ more from what\u2019s on mainstream news, furthering the bubbles a divided United States lives within. While in years past, you\u2019d find different takes on the day\u2019s news in left- and right-leaning outlets, you\u2019ll now find stories that exist solely on rightwing media, Millican said. \u201cIt\u2019s like every day is a new conspiracy or a new attack, and it\u2019s just hard to even keep up on it anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHalf the time, when you listen to somebody who consumes nothing but rightwing media, you have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d TV news and rightwing websites Traffic to news websites, including rightwing sites, is down compared with 2020. Howard Polskin, who tracks conservative media on his site The Righting, said a few factors play into the decrease. Facebook and other Meta social media de-emphasize news content now, sending less traffic to news outlets. And 2020 had several major news events colliding: a pandemic that kept people online more, nationwide protests over racial justice and a hotly contested election. Polskin tracks monthly visits to rightwing sites and produces traffic reports. The top 10 for August 2024: Fox, Outkick (a sports and commentary site owned by Fox), Newsmax, Epoch Times, National Review, Washington Times, Daily Wire, TheBlaze, Washington Examiner and Daily Caller. Gateway Pundit is not far behind, and InfoWars, the once-maligned site headed by bankrupted conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, is in the top 20. No single star has taken the place that Carlson or Limbaugh once held. Some conservatives told the Guardian they stopped watching Fox as often after Carlson left or because the network isn\u2019t Maga enough. Fox agreed to pay $787m to settle a lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems over defamation claims for spreading lies about the voting machine company\u2019s role the 2020 election. Carlson abruptly left the network shortly after the settlement, and he has claimed his firing came as a result of the settlement. Fox denies that his removal had anything to do with the Dominion case. Frank Lipsett, a 63-year-old from the south Bronx who works as a residential housing superintendent, said he watches Fox because it\u2019s \u201cthe most honest and most informative outlet, though I\u2019m not saying they are perfect\u201d. Like many on the right, he has stopped reading mainstream newspapers because \u201cthey are not telling the truth.\u201d He said he sometimes reads the New York Post, a rightwing tabloid paper owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, the same owner as Fox. Another paper, Epoch Times, a far-right and anti-China outlet associated with the Falun Gong religion, continues to rank highly among conservative news outlets despite a justice department lawsuit that alleges it operates as a money laundering and cryptocurrency scam. Its stories are often shared by rightwing politicians or influencers. \u201cTheir cultural impact and political impact seems much smaller than the distribution,\u201d Polskin said. Carlene, a 58-year-old from the Upper East Side who attended the Trump rally in the Bronx, said she gets news from the Epoch Times, Daily Wire and X and sometimes tunes into CNN and MSNBC to get the other side. \u201cI watch less Fox News now after they got rid of Tucker Carlson,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me think Fox was just like everyone else.\u201d For the less online Republican, talk radio shows, especially those that run the airwaves in rural areas, play a strong role in setting the conservative message. As newspapers in rural areas have shuttered, creating a crisis in local news, these radio shows are \u201creaching voters that aren\u2019t tapped into the same media spaces that we often see in these large metropolises on either coast\u201d, Tripodi said. To fill Fox\u2019s void on TV, some conservatives have turned to Newsmax or One American News Network, which are farther to the right than Fox. \u201cOne American News Network and Newsmax did a very good job at establishing themselves as a place that would verify whatever Trump was saying,\u201d Tripodi said. David Fiedler, a 67-year-old retiree from Rock county, Wisconsin, told the Guardian at the Republican National Committee\u2019s Protect the Vote tour in September that he and his wife don\u2019t watch Fox or local news, but they stream podcasts by the Daily Wire or watch Rumble, the rightwing video platform. \u201cOur biggest news thing we watch is Newsmax,\u201d he said. Podcasts and influencers Beyond television and news sites, a rightwing news consumer will find a growing landscape of podcasts, YouTube channels, Substack newsletters, documentary film-makers and social media influencers all trying to build a following. \u201cFor every laid-off journalist, another Substack is born,\u201d Polskin said. \u201cAnd that just \u2026 fractionalizes the news audience even more.\u201d The top of the podcast charts on Spotify and Apple shows a host of conservatives: Shawn Ryan, Candace Owens, Carlson, Megyn Kelly. Ben Shapiro, the conservative commentator, has his own podcast, and his network, the Daily Wire, hosts some of the biggest rightwing pundits. \u201cIn terms of just influence and power in the media landscape, to me, he would be someone that\u2019s at the top of that space,\u201d Millican said. Polskin called Shapiro the \u201c800lb gorilla of rightwing podcasts\u201d. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, is also a major player. His organization is focused on turning college-age people conservative, and he\u2019s been on a tour around the country to college campuses in recent months, in addition to his podcast and social media presence. \u201cHe\u2019s almost become like an establishment media figure in his own right, except you would never actually see him on Fox News \u2013 his audience tends to be pretty old,\u201d Millican said. While he doesn\u2019t grab a huge share of the podcast market and he\u2019s currently in prison for defying a congressional subpoena related to the January 6 investigation, Steve Bannon has an outsize influence on the right with his War Room show. He gets big-name rightwing politicians as guests and still has Trump\u2019s ear, but he\u2019s never cracked the top 20 in Polskin\u2019s ratings. \u201cBecause of him, Project 2025 got on our radar last year because he was one of the early backers in hosting people who were involved with writing it, promoting the key tenants in it,\u201d Millican said. \u201cSmall audience, but still influential audience.\u201d Then there are also conspiracy-based websites and social media accounts from unnamed creators, such as End Wokeness, that spread rightwing attack lines that can filter up to the mainstream.

With the pivotal twist also horribly visible, all that\u2019s left is a handful of standard-issue pummellings that don\u2019t really stretch Adkins\u2019 skills. The recent Night of the Hunted is a much more satisfying bet for a straight-to-streaming sniper ordeal. \u2022 Take Cover is on digital platforms from 14 October",

      "body": "<p>At a wedding recently, I sat near two old friends talking about 1998, the year they drove all over Italy in a white Fiat Ducato van. Farther down the table, someone was talking about removal men swinging a wardrobe through a fifth-floor window. I listened in on both conversations, fading one out when the other was more interesting. At a certain point, though, the van chat turned to beans and sausages, so I tuned in.</p> <p>There was some back and forth about which city they were in \u2013 Novara in Piemonte, Mantova in Lombardia, or Treviso in Veneto \u2013 before the reminiscing concentrated on dinner. Having arrived at the venue and set everything up, they were told there was only one option \u2013 sausages and beans \u2013 and that when the two of them pointed out that they didn\u2019t eat meat, it was suggested they simply pulled them out. Being so hungry as to be flexible, they agreed, only to find that when the dish arrived the sausages were <em>sbriciolata</em><em> (</em>crumbled) through the beans. At which point, both of them seemed to turn to me as if they wanted confirmation that crumbling sausage into beans was a ridiculous and selfish thing to do. Which, of course, it is, if it\u2019s the only option for a mixed crowd.</p> <p>For sausage eaters, though, crumbling two at the foundation of a pot of braised beans is an effective way of making a small amount go a long way, not only imparting delicious flavour but heightening the flavour of the beans themselves. In fact, both beans and sausages contain trisulphides, which account for the earthy, mushroomy, fatty smell molecules. But the sausages can be left out, or cooked on the side.</p> <p>Another possibly annoying thing about this recipe is that while I\u2019m sure it could be adapted to use tinned beans, dried beans are pretty fundamental, because after soaking and a preliminary kickstart short boil (which could be adapted to a pressure cooker), the beans cook along with the other vegetables. And, as they do, they provide a tasty, cloudy bean broth that is the body of this dense and richly flavoured bean, herb and optional sausage soup-stew.</p> <p>The texture of the dish should be somewhere between a soup and a stew \u2013 dense, but not so much that a spoon stands upright \u2013 so, while it\u2019s simmering, keep an eye out and if at any point the pan looks dry, add a little more water. The dish also benefits from a rest, but remember it will get even denser as it sits. If that\u2019s the case, just add a little more warm water and, if needed, salt.

Or when you have just started university, or a new job, or therapy, or gone on holiday. At the very moment you thought you would be building a better life, instead you feel lost and as if life is falling apart.</p> <p>At moments like these, telling yourself that you should be happy and getting happier, or pretending to yourself that you are, is a callous lie.

Unless it is backed up by an unflinching emotional honesty about what you are feeling and thinking, including when things feel bad and difficult, the drive to build a better life can risk re-creating the same one you\u2019ve always known, only worse, because it\u2019s happening again.

After she howled for three hours for the first five nights, I almost drove her back to the rescue.

I had hoped for an active, independent dog to revive my broken spirit, but it soon became clear Verity was the exact opposite.

      "body": "<p>In an alternate universe, the American media would have answered 7 October by putting Jehad Abusalim on speed dial. Abusalim, who <a href=\"https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1655740\">runs</a> the Washington DC office of the Institute for Palestine Studies, is not only from Gaza, but also a Hebrew speaker who is completing a PhD in history, Hebrew and Judaic studies. Several months before the attack, he had published an <a href=\"https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/hamass-balancing-act-vis-a-vis-israel/\">essay</a> arguing that Hamas \u201cappears to be strategically conserving its resources for a potentially larger confrontation with Israel\u201d. It\u2019s hard to think of anyone within taxi distance of America\u2019s television studios who was better equipped to help Americans understand Hamas\u2019s massacre and Israel\u2019s brutal military response.</p> <p>In the days and weeks after 7 October , Abusalim used whatever platform he had to warn that Israel\u2019s response would bring destruction, not safety. Again and again, he predicted that Israel would obliterate Gaza without defeating Hamas. \u201cThere is no military solution to this crisis,\u201d he <a href=\"https://x.com/JehadAbusalim/status/1712064917161861372\">declared</a> on X (formerly Twitter) on 11 October. \u201cA ground invasion is unlikely to succeed,\u201d he <a href=\"https://x.com/JehadAbusalim/status/1713540056202248462\">added</a> on 15 October. \u201cIsrael is likely to kill ten times the number of Palestinians it has killed so far,\u201d he <a href=\"https://x.com/JehadAbusalim/status/1721519747131428870\">predicted</a> on 6 November. But \u201cIsrael will not achieve a military victory in Gaza.\u201d He also <a href=\"https://x.com/JehadAbusalim/status/1721519747131428870\">warned</a> of a wider war. \u201cMany are assuming there won\u2019t be a regional escalation,\u201d he added, \u201cbut they are wrong.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/04/gaza-question-world-human-war-future\">In Gaza, we have one question for the rest of the world: aren\u2019t we human, just like you? | A voice from Gaza</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A year later, Abusalim\u2019s words look prophetic. In July, researchers at Birzeit University, the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and McMaster University <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext\">estimated</a> that the death toll in Gaza could reach 186,000 \u2013 more than 18 times the figure <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/06/1210831466/death-toll-gaza-israel-hamas-conflict\">reported</a> by Gaza\u2019s health ministry last November. Yet, Israel remains far from fulfilling Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s vow to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/11/world/israel-news-hamas-war\">eliminate</a>\u201d Hamas. According to an analysis in August by CNN, the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Critical Threats Project and the Institute for the Study of War, Israel has rendered only three of Hamas\u2019s 24 battalions \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/\">combat ineffective</a>\u201d. In June, Israel\u2019s own top military spokesman, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-military-spokesman-hamas-defeated-netanyahu-war-gaza-rcna157991\">declared</a>, \u201cAnyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, the American media never gave Abusalim a megaphone. He appeared on network and cable television only <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz_cO3X35Ts\">once</a> in the six months following 7 October, and even then, it was only to detail his family\u2019s suffering, not to analyze the war. That was typical. According to a <a href=\"https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/the-sunday-talk-shows-on-gaza-a-study-in-media-bias/\">study</a> by George Washington University\u2019s William Youmans, America\u2019s four flagship Sunday talkshows \u2013 Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week and Fox News Sunday \u2013 collectively interviewed 140 outside guests on camera between 8 October 2023 and 14 January 2024. Only one was Palestinian.</p> <p>Who did the Sunday shows interview instead? For the most part, Washington insiders. In those early months of the war, more than 80% of the Sunday show guests were current and former US government officials. Few knew much about Gaza, and few questioned Israel\u2019s actions. On 5 November, for instance, Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, told Fox News Sunday that the US would help Israel \u201cdefeat Hamas\u201d. The network then turned to Jack Reed, a Democratic senator, who vowed to help Israel \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas.</p>    <p>It might seem natural that the networks responded to 7 October by platforming people who knew Washington, rather than people who knew Gaza. But by doing so, they replicated the media\u2019s failure after 9/11. In 2007, three academics set out to understand why, in the run-up to the Iraq war, the US media largely failed to surface the critiques being made by academic experts and observers abroad. Their answer: the US media takes its cues from America\u2019s two political parties. In their book, When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina, W Lance Bennett, Regina Lawrence and Steven Livingston concluded that when the US \u201cgovernment is already weighing competing initiatives\u201d, the media invites perspectives from both sides. But when official Washington decides that there is only one side \u2013 when \u201cpolicy decisions of dubious wisdom go unchallenged within government arenas\u201d \u2013 the mainstream media doesn\u2019t challenge them either. If Johnson and Reed agree that the US must help Israel destroy Hamas, then Fox News Sunday concludes that those are the terms of legitimate debate.</p> <p>The problem with this dynamic is that ruinous foreign policy decisions often enjoy bipartisan support, at least initially. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Lyndon Johnson the authority to escalate America\u2019s intervention in Vietnam, passed the Senate 88-2 and the House 416-0. In 2002, many prominent congressional Democrats \u2013 including Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Tom Daschle, then Senate majority leader, and Richard Gephardt, then House minority leader \u2013 voted to authorize George W Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq. And after 7 October, Biden and his Republican opponents vied to show who supported Israel\u2019s war more emphatically.</p> <p>Not only did leaders of both parties support the war. They both largely ignored the conditions under which Palestinians live. In his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/20/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-unites-states-response-to-hamass-terrorist-attacks-against-israel-and-russias-ongoing-brutal-war-against-ukraine/\">speech</a> from the Oval Office on 20 October, the president used the word \u201coccupied\u201d to describe Russia\u2019s control over parts of Ukraine but not Israel\u2019s control over the West Bank. In neither that speech nor the one he delivered two days earlier in Tel Aviv, did Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-october-7th-terrorist-attacks-and-the-resilience-of-the-state-of-israel-and-its-people-tel-aviv-israel/\">acknowledge</a> that Palestinians in Gaza have lived for decades under blockade.</p> <p>As a result, the mainstream media largely ignored these realities too \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPt1rltBVGQ\">Palestinian</a> <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/09/israel-palestine-gaza-hamas-invasion-genocide-united-states/\">scholars</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/muhammadshehad2/status/1719844970734002487\">repeatedly</a> cited Palestinians\u2019 lack of freedom as crucial to understanding Hamas\u2019s attack. In the 51 Sunday television segments that Youmans analyzed, the word \u201coccupation\u201d was mentioned only 15 times. The word \u201cblockade\u201d was mentioned four times. By contrast, Iran was cited 356 times, even though both <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/politics/us-intelligence-iran-hamas-doubt/index.html\">US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/no-evidence-yet-of-iran-link-to-hamas-attack-says-israeli-military\">Israeli</a> intelligence concluded that Tehran played no direct role in 7 October. Why the discrepancy? Because Republicans used Hamas\u2019s onslaught to demand a tougher policy on Tehran. In Washington after 7 October, Iran was a subject of fierce partisan debate. The occupation was not.</p> <p>Not only did the mainstream media mostly ignore Israel\u2019s denial of Palestinian freedom, it also mostly ignored the contradictions in Israel\u2019s military strategy. From the beginning of the war, Israeli officials <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/gallant-tells-families-all-for-all-hostage-offer-phony-pushes-military-pressure/\">insisted</a> that only military pressure would convince Hamas to return the hostages it had abducted. And, from the beginning, many Palestinian commentators disagreed. In October, the Palestinian author Iyad el-Baghdadi <a href=\"https://x.com/iyad_elbaghdadi/status/1716532883261722677\">warned</a> that Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza would \u201csacrifice the hostages\u201d. In January, the Gaza-born writer Muhammad Shehada <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2024-01-30/ty-article-opinion/.premium/theres-only-one-way-to-end-hamas-grip-on-power/0000018d-5571-d8cc-a1fd-577fdb630000\">argued</a> that \u201ca permanent ceasefire\u201d was \u201cthe only way to free the hostages alive\u201d. Many hostage families agreed. In late October, the Times of Israel <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/meeting-netanyahu-families-of-gaza-hostages-urge-all-for-all-prisoner-swap/\">reported</a> that representatives of the hostages had urged Netanyahu to accept Hamas\u2019s offer to return all the captives in exchange for all the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.</p> <p>It\u2019s now clear that Baghdadi, Shehada and the hostage families were right. Israel has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-bombs-destruction-death-toll-scope-419488c511f83c85baea22458472a796\">destroyed a higher percentage</a> of the buildings in Gaza since 7 October than the Allies destroyed in Germany in the second world war. Yet, it has not forced Hamas to relinquish the remaining hostages. In August, Amos Harel, the longtime defense analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-31/ty-article/.premium/the-claim-that-only-military-force-can-free-hostages-was-always-wrong-now-its-shattered/00000191-a9e6-d453-ab9f-f9ee87e90000\">declared</a>, The Claim That Only Israeli Military Pressure Can Free Hostages Was Always Wrong. Many Palestinians and Israelis knew that all along. But they had little influence in official Washington. Which meant they had little voice in the American public debate.</p> <p>Some may argue that the mainstream media didn\u2019t platform anti-war voices after 7 October because the anti-war movement marginalized itself. In some cases, that may be true. Networks had every right to avoid commentators who justified the 7 October massacre. And they understandably wanted guests who could not only criticize the war, but provide an alternative course of action, something some leftists failed to do. Still, it was not hard to find observers who knew Gaza intimately, opposed Hamas\u2019s taking of civilian life, and advocated a political, rather than military, response to 7 October. On 1 November, Shehada outlined a <a href=\"https://x.com/muhammadshehad2/status/1719843073067233377\">nine-part thread</a> on X that explicitly answered the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you were in Israel\u2019s shoes &amp; your people were attacked?\u201d Except for Democracy Now, no American television program has interviewed him since 7 October. Baghdadi told me that \u201cDespite my posts garnering millions of views \u2013 and the fact that I\u2019m followed by numerous US journalists, analysts, and policymakers \u2013 I received no invitations to appear on US cable or network news\u201d after the attack.</p> <p>Journalists aren\u2019t wrong to interview people in power. But when that\u2019s all they do, they let power \u2013 rather than expertise \u2013 define the boundaries of legitimate public debate. Again and again in American history, those terms have proved disastrously narrow. Still, not only do powerful officials continue to dominate the airwaves, they are rarely asked to account for their past errors. In the months after 7 October, the most common guest on the Sunday shows was the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. No senator appeared more frequently than South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham. On 22 October, Blinken said the Biden administration was \u201cnot in the business of second guessing\u201d Israel\u2019s war. On 15 October , Graham declared nine separate times that Israel must \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas. Neither man\u2019s statements have aged well.</p> <p>Although no interviewer raised the subject, Blinken and Graham have something in common, which viewers analyzing their statements about Gaza might have found useful to know. They were both prominent supporters of America\u2019s invasion of Iraq.</p> <ul> <li><p>Peter Beinart (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterBeinart\">@PeterBeinart</a>) is a professor at the <a href=\"https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/\">Newmark School of Journalism</a> at the City University of New York, an editor at large of <a href=\"https://jewishcurrents.org/\">Jewish Currents</a> and writes <a href=\"https://peterbeinart.substack.com/\">The Beinart Notebook</a>, a weekly newsletter.

In June, Israel\u2019s own top military spokesman, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, declared, \u201cAnyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\u201d Unfortunately, the American media never gave Abusalim a megaphone. He appeared on network and cable television only once in the six months following 7 October, and even then, it was only to detail his family\u2019s suffering, not to analyze the war. That was typical. According to a study by George Washington University\u2019s William Youmans, America\u2019s four flagship Sunday talkshows \u2013 Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week and Fox News Sunday \u2013 collectively interviewed 140 outside guests on camera between 8 October 2023 and 14 January 2024. Only one was Palestinian. Who did the Sunday shows interview instead? For the most part, Washington insiders. In those early months of the war, more than 80% of the Sunday show guests were current and former US government officials. Few knew much about Gaza, and few questioned Israel\u2019s actions. On 5 November, for instance, Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, told Fox News Sunday that the US would help Israel \u201cdefeat Hamas\u201d. The network then turned to Jack Reed, a Democratic senator, who vowed to help Israel \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas. It might seem natural that the networks responded to 7 October by platforming people who knew Washington, rather than people who knew Gaza. But by doing so, they replicated the media\u2019s failure after 9/11. In 2007, three academics set out to understand why, in the run-up to the Iraq war, the US media largely failed to surface the critiques being made by academic experts and observers abroad. Their answer: the US media takes its cues from America\u2019s two political parties. In their book, When the Press Fails: Political Power and the News Media from Iraq to Katrina, W Lance Bennett, Regina Lawrence and Steven Livingston concluded that when the US \u201cgovernment is already weighing competing initiatives\u201d, the media invites perspectives from both sides. But when official Washington decides that there is only one side \u2013 when \u201cpolicy decisions of dubious wisdom go unchallenged within government arenas\u201d \u2013 the mainstream media doesn\u2019t challenge them either. If Johnson and Reed agree that the US must help Israel destroy Hamas, then Fox News Sunday concludes that those are the terms of legitimate debate. The problem with this dynamic is that ruinous foreign policy decisions often enjoy bipartisan support, at least initially. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Lyndon Johnson the authority to escalate America\u2019s intervention in Vietnam, passed the Senate 88-2 and the House 416-0. In 2002, many prominent congressional Democrats \u2013 including Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Tom Daschle, then Senate majority leader, and Richard Gephardt, then House minority leader \u2013 voted to authorize George W Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq. And after 7 October, Biden and his Republican opponents vied to show who supported Israel\u2019s war more emphatically. Not only did leaders of both parties support the war. They both largely ignored the conditions under which Palestinians live. In his speech from the Oval Office on 20 October, the president used the word \u201coccupied\u201d to describe Russia\u2019s control over parts of Ukraine but not Israel\u2019s control over the West Bank. In neither that speech nor the one he delivered two days earlier in Tel Aviv, did Biden acknowledge that Palestinians in Gaza have lived for decades under blockade. As a result, the mainstream media largely ignored these realities too \u2013 even though Palestinian scholars repeatedly cited Palestinians\u2019 lack of freedom as crucial to understanding Hamas\u2019s attack. In the 51 Sunday television segments that Youmans analyzed, the word \u201coccupation\u201d was mentioned only 15 times. The word \u201cblockade\u201d was mentioned four times. By contrast, Iran was cited 356 times, even though both US and Israeli intelligence concluded that Tehran played no direct role in 7 October. Why the discrepancy? Because Republicans used Hamas\u2019s onslaught to demand a tougher policy on Tehran. In Washington after 7 October, Iran was a subject of fierce partisan debate. The occupation was not. Not only did the mainstream media mostly ignore Israel\u2019s denial of Palestinian freedom, it also mostly ignored the contradictions in Israel\u2019s military strategy. From the beginning of the war, Israeli officials insisted that only military pressure would convince Hamas to return the hostages it had abducted. And, from the beginning, many Palestinian commentators disagreed. In October, the Palestinian author Iyad el-Baghdadi warned that Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza would \u201csacrifice the hostages\u201d. In January, the Gaza-born writer Muhammad Shehada argued that \u201ca permanent ceasefire\u201d was \u201cthe only way to free the hostages alive\u201d. Many hostage families agreed. In late October, the Times of Israel reported that representatives of the hostages had urged Netanyahu to accept Hamas\u2019s offer to return all the captives in exchange for all the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. It\u2019s now clear that Baghdadi, Shehada and the hostage families were right. Israel has destroyed a higher percentage of the buildings in Gaza since 7 October than the Allies destroyed in Germany in the second world war. Yet, it has not forced Hamas to relinquish the remaining hostages. In August, Amos Harel, the longtime defense analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, declared, The Claim That Only Israeli Military Pressure Can Free Hostages Was Always Wrong. Many Palestinians and Israelis knew that all along. But they had little influence in official Washington. Which meant they had little voice in the American public debate. Some may argue that the mainstream media didn\u2019t platform anti-war voices after 7 October because the anti-war movement marginalized itself. In some cases, that may be true. Networks had every right to avoid commentators who justified the 7 October massacre. And they understandably wanted guests who could not only criticize the war, but provide an alternative course of action, something some leftists failed to do. Still, it was not hard to find observers who knew Gaza intimately, opposed Hamas\u2019s taking of civilian life, and advocated a political, rather than military, response to 7 October. On 1 November, Shehada outlined a nine-part thread on X that explicitly answered the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you were in Israel\u2019s shoes &amp; your people were attacked?\u201d Except for Democracy Now, no American television program has interviewed him since 7 October. Baghdadi told me that \u201cDespite my posts garnering millions of views \u2013 and the fact that I\u2019m followed by numerous US journalists, analysts, and policymakers \u2013 I received no invitations to appear on US cable or network news\u201d after the attack. Journalists aren\u2019t wrong to interview people in power. But when that\u2019s all they do, they let power \u2013 rather than expertise \u2013 define the boundaries of legitimate public debate. Again and again in American history, those terms have proved disastrously narrow. Still, not only do powerful officials continue to dominate the airwaves, they are rarely asked to account for their past errors. In the months after 7 October, the most common guest on the Sunday shows was the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. No senator appeared more frequently than South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham. On 22 October, Blinken said the Biden administration was \u201cnot in the business of second guessing\u201d Israel\u2019s war. On 15 October , Graham declared nine separate times that Israel must \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas. Neither man\u2019s statements have aged well. Although no interviewer raised the subject, Blinken and Graham have something in common, which viewers analyzing their statements about Gaza might have found useful to know. They were both prominent supporters of America\u2019s invasion of Iraq.

      "bodyText": "The UK government\u2019s move to award \u00a322bn in subsidies to carbon capture projects followed a sharp increase in lobbying by the fossil fuel industry, it can be revealed. Oil and gas giants such as Equinor, BP, and ExxonMobil attended 24 of 44 external ministerial meetings to discuss carbon capture and storage (CCS) in 2023, according to official transparency records. That represented a surge in activity relative to 2020-22, when ministers held about half as many meetings to discuss the technology, and oil and gas companies would attend seven to 10 of these discussions each year. During a call in December with three Equinor executives, one of the company\u2019s team told Jeremy Allen, then director of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), that Equinor \u201cappreciate[d] the \u2026 collaborative approach to policy development\u201d. In a meeting in March last year, an ExxonMobil executive from the company\u2019s \u201clow carbon solutions\u201d division \u201cspoke of the outstanding need for oil and gas, at the same time as needing to lower emissions\u201d, according to meeting notes obtained by environmental journalism site DeSmog through freedom of information requests. The growing engagement by oil and gas companies has sharpened concerns among climate advocates that industry is skewing the UK\u2019s carbon capture strategy to preserve demand for fossil gas \u2013 a significant source of planet-heating carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane emissions. \u201cFossil fuel companies often have the engineering knowhow to build these projects, so the government naturally has to meet with them,\u201d said Laurie Laybourn, an environmental policy researcher and associate fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank. \u201cBut that might create a risk whereby these companies unduly influence policy and rollout in a way that benefits them.\u201d Other sectors engaging frequently with ministers on CCS policy include heavy manufacturing companies, CCS technology firms, lobby groups and investment funds.

BP, ExxonMobil, Scottish power company SSE, and Drax, a biomass power plant that is one of the UK\u2019s biggest emitters, also attended nine meetings each during the same period. The new Labour government announced plans last week to extend \u00a322bn in subsidies for carbon capture over 25 years, saying the strategy can help meet the country\u2019s climate targets and support broader revitalisation of British industry. The policy builds on the previous Conservative government\u2019s plans to establish four CCS \u201cclusters\u201d, where carbon capture would be used to trap some of the CO2 emitted by fossil-fuel burning factories and power plants.

The government\u2019s plans include proposals by Equinor and BP \u2013 two of the companies that have met ministers most frequently since January 2020 \u2013 to build new \u201clow-carbon\u201d gas-fired power stations fitted with carbon capture units, which are slated to be among the first to receive state support.

However, many environmental groups are sceptical. Researchers point to the frequent failure of projects to meet carbon capture targets, cost-overruns, the need for multi-billion dollar subsidies, and the tendency of the oil and gas industry to use the technology to justify investments in new fossil fuel projects \u2014 rather than focus on cleaning up existing dirty industries. Nevertheless, oil and gas companies have continued to press the case to ministers that gas-fired power plants fitted with carbon capture can be a climate solution. The surge in lobbying coincided with the previous Conservative administration\u2019s pledge in March 2023 of \u00a320bn in subsidies for carbon capture projects, which have struggled to prove economical without state support. Three months after the pledge was announced, lobby group the CCSA told ministers its members were concerned about delays and there was a \u201cstruggle to keep investors upbeat\u201d, according to meeting notes. The CCSA has attended 20 government carbon capture meetings, more than any other organisation since January 2020, including two meetings between January and March 2024, the latest period for which records are available. When asked to comment on concerns that their CCS projects may \u201clock in\u201d fossil fuel dependency, BP and Equinor gave an almost identical statement, saying that CCS was essential for the UK\u2019s transition to net zero and would create jobs. DESNZ said CCS would play a \u201cvital role\u201d in its plans for a clean energy system by 2030. The department also pointed to independent government adviser the Climate Change Committee\u2019s description of carbon capture as a \u201cnecessity, not an option\u201d. The CCSA did not respond to requests for comment. Two meetings with ExxonMobil designated for the discussion of \u201ccarbon solutions\u201d were used by both the company and the then senior DESNZ minister Graham Stuart to reaffirm the need for continued oil and gas production in the UK, meeting notes show. Stuart told attenders at a meeting on 15 June \u201cthat the UK government has championed the need for new oil and gas licences\u201d.

Before we go, let\u2019s recap the big headlines: Albanese joins Jewish community for Melbourne vigil Dutton arrives to cheers at Sydney vigil Tony Abbott tells Canberra rally 7 October attack perpetrators \u2018should be utterly destroyed\u2019 Federal government \u2018makes no apology\u2019 after Iran summons ambassador Albanese calls on Fatima Payman to hand Senate seat back to Labor Mona\u2019s Ladies Lounge seemingly denies reports the installation will close next month Bill Shorten backs permit system for Victorian protestors BoM predicts wild weather for Queensland Thank you for spending your day with us. We will be back tomorrow to do it all again. The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, drew a loud cheer from the crowd when he took to the stage and faced the 12,000-strong crowd. He said that antisemitism had taken grip since the \u201chorrors and heartbreak\u201d of 7 October. \u201cThat day of depravity, the greatest loss of Jewish life on a single day since the Holocaust, awoke and exposed an antisemitic rot afflicting western democracies,\u201d he said, describing it as the \u201cmost shocking period of our country in my lifetime\u201d. He said \u201criver to the sea\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cjust a rhetorical chant of radical university students. It is a stated intent to wipe Israel and the Jewish people off the map.\u201d He said that there had been a vacuum of leadership in Australia in the wake of 7 October, referencing antisemitic chants heard on the steps of the Sydney Opera House on 9 October last year. The last 12 months constitute one of the most difficult periods for Jewish Australians in our nation\u2019s history. So in the interest of moral clarity, let me be clear, Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats, from Hamas, from Hezbollah, from the Houthis and from the Iranian regime, which sponsors them all. Together today we pray for the hostages still held by Hamas. Together today we grieve for the families who have lost those dearest to them. Hundreds of Australians fleeing Lebanon have touched down in Sydney on the first of two flights organised by the Australian government. More to come. Crowd applauds criticism of government\u2019s \u2018weak\u2019 stance on conflict Yossi Goldfarb, the president of Zionism Victoria, which organised tonight\u2019s event in Melbourne, has accused the federal government of being \u201cweak and ambiguous\u201d on the conflict in the Middle East. Goldfarb told the thousands-strong crowd there should be \u201cno doubt about the enemy\u201d after Iran\u2019s latest attack on Israel: \u201cIran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, these enemies of Israel, these enemies of Western Liberal democracies, are a pernicious threat that can no longer be ignored.\u201d Goldfarb said those groups must be defeated. He described the rise of antisemitism in Australia as \u201csimply out of control\u201d: \u201c[It is] a threat to everything that makes our country unique and great. There is a permissiveness that has led antisemitism fester, a permissiveness encouraged by weak and ambiguous expositions of our foreign policy. This line received the biggest applause from the crowd, which includes the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Goldfarb went on: \u201cIn our community\u2019s view, they have weakened our social cohesion, leaving us to feel the state of Israel has been abandoned as a natural ally of the Australian people.\u201d Minns: \u2018great sadness\u2019 tempered by hope Premier Chris Minns has told the crowd that the \u201cgreat sadness\u201d of the evening was tempered by hope. He said it would ordinarily be his job this week to tell Jewish people to have a happy New Year, but \u201cwe have come together not to celebrate but to grieve\u201d. Speaking about the antisemitism that is on the rise in Australia, Minns said: We can\u2019t change the hate in people\u2019s hearts but we can call it for what it is and that is racism. We can\u2019t lose hope. Nova festival-goer, Michal Ohana, described hiding under an IDF tank for seven hours while bleeding from a gunshot wound a year ago. She lost 10 friends that day. A 21-year-old IDF soldier Yuval told the crowd that he was called to respond to Hamas attacks and almost lost a leg when his vehicle was hit by a rocket. The leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, is expected to address the crowd shortly. In park in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, thousands of people have come together for a community commemoration organised by the Zionist Council of NSW and the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies. About 7,000 seats were taken with many more standing inside the venue and around the outside of the park as the sun set and a violin solo began the service. A loud cheer went up when leader of the opposition Peter Dutton arrived. Also among the dignitaries is the NSW premier, Chris Minns; health minister, Mark Butler; and the leader of the state opposition, Mark Speakman. A heavy security and police presence is surrounding the venue, with the community determined to gather despite concerns about the risk of antisemitism. \u201cTikvah\u201d (hope) is a theme of the evening, says the Zionist Council of NSW. Thousands of members of Melbourne\u2019s Jewish community have gathered in Moorabbin this evening to mark a year since the 7 October Hamas attacks. The event began with a procession of hand-painted lanterns, each dedicated to one of the victims of the past 12 months. Among those participating in the procession are Anthony Albanese; his attorney general, Mark Dreyfus; the Macnamara MP, Josh Burns; the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, and her deputy Ben Carroll. Albanese walked with rabbi Gabi Kaltmann. State and federal MPs from across party lines are also at the event, including independents Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan. Albanese and Allan aren\u2019t expected to speak this evening, instead the commemoration will feature personal reflections from members of the community and performances from school and shule choirs. We\u2019ve just heard a rendition of The Beatles\u2019 Let It Be from students of Beth Rivkah Ladies College orchestra. The Melbourne vigil is also getting under way as protesters prepare to march to Parliament House. Before a crowd of all ages, the vigil in Sydney began with a minute\u2019s silence followed by multi-faith prayers from members of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities. A Kaddish, a Jewish prayer often said in memory of the dead, was read first. Then Costandi Bastoli, director of Palestinian Christians in Australia, spoke before beginning his prayer. \u201cWe refuse to let unforgiveness and hatred to take hold,\u201d he said. \u201cMay we preserve our hearts from hatred and cultivate a desire for good, for all. \u201cWe lift up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, acknowledging the suffering of the Palestinian people under occupation and the Lebanese people under attack. Yet we remember that our enemy is not the Jewish people, as we just saw, but rather the systems of oppression and injustice.\u201d Ahmed Ouf, a councillor with Cumberland council, asked the crowd to raise their hands. He recited supplications in Arabic \u201cfor the kids, the women, the men, the people\u201d of Gaza, Palestine and Lebanon. An 82-year-old woman has been charged with allegedly making harassing phone calls to a mosque in south Sydney. About 6.30pm on Friday, police attended the Masjid Arrahman mosque in Kingsgrove, Sydney after receiving reports of two allegedly offensive calls made on Tuesday, 1 October and Friday, 4 October. Following investigations, police visited a home in Five Dock and spoke with the woman, who was issued a court notice for the alleged offence of using carriage service to menace, harass and/or offend. She will appear before Bankstown local court on Wednesday, 27 November. The mosque has received media attention for holding a commemoration ceremony for the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah and labelling fighters of the group, listed as a terrorist organisation in Australia since 2021, as \u201cmartyrs\u201d. There is a heavy police presence at Sydney town hall ahead of tonight\u2019s interfaith vigil. A sombre crowd has gathered near the building\u2019s steps, facing a row of Palestinian and Lebanese flags. Waiting with a Palestinian flag around his neck, Joseph, a Palestinian-Australian, said there \u201cwas too much suffering going on\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of relatives who have been displaced in Gaza, the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been one year. Too many dead. We don\u2019t want this to spread even further.\u201d And we have some photos of people starting to arrive for the Palestinian vigil in Sydney this evening: There is a strong police presence outside the town hall: And our reporter Ariel Bogle is on the ground at Sydney Town Hall, where there is a large number of police: Someone in the crowd at Lakemba mosque has snapped this photo of the vigil tonight. We will have more soon: Australian markets buoyed up by strong US jobs report The local share market has had a positive start to the week after a strong US jobs report over the weekend allayed fears the world\u2019s biggest economy was headed into recession, AAP reports. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Monday finished up 55.4 points, or 0.68%, to 8,205.4, while the broader All Ordinaries climbed 62.4 points, or 0.74%, to 8,479.0. The Australian dollar had dropped to a nearly three-week low of 68.04 US cents, from 68.42 US cents at Friday\u2019s ASX close. A man has died after a unit fire in the Lismore area yesterday. NSW police have released a statement: About 1am yesterday (Sunday 6 October 2024), emergency services were called to a unit on Anstey Street, Girards Hill, following reports of a house fire. Officers attached to Richmond police district arrived and found a unit well alight. Fire and Rescue NSW attended and extinguished the blaze before recovering the body of a man and a dog from inside the home. The man is yet to be formally identified. There were no other reports of injuries. Police have established a crime scene and have commenced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident. There are thunderstorm warnings for parts of QLD and NSW: Some big records for solar across NSW and QLD over the weekend: Bridget McKenzie addresses rally Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie is speaking in lieu of Peter Dutton at the 7 October rally at Parliament House today. McKenzie said \u201cIsrael has a right to exist. Israel has a right to self-defence, and we should not be calling for ceasefire every time she seeks to do that\u201d. She said it was time for Jewish Australians to hit the streets and speak out. We\u2019ve heard a lot about the silent Australians. The time for silence is over. It is time to stand up, to speak out, to take action on our streets, to gather in suburbs, in communities right across the country, as so many of our Jewish Australian community is today. Rally at Parliament House marks anniversary of terrorist attacks on Israel On the windy lawns outside Parliament House, a rally of hundreds has gathered on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks by Palestinian militant group, Hamas, against southern Israel. The rally has been organised by Christian organisation, Never Again Is Now, but the crowd here on a public holiday in Canberra is a broad church. A number of federal politicians were spotted in the crowd, including Coalition members, Jane Hume, Michaelia Cash, Simon Birmingham and Bridget McKenzie, as well as former Labor MP Mike Kelly. Others included cross-benchers Bob Katter and Russell Broadbent. The Israeli ambassador Amir Maimon joined former prime minister, Tony Abbott, on a row of seats in front of the stage. Israeli and Australian flags were carried by many in the crowd but dispersed between them were some Pahlavi Iranian flags \u2013 the ruling government in Iran prior to the Islamic Revolution \u2013 as well as the Eureka flag. Speeches, which included some from the Australian Christian Lobby\u2019s chief executive and members of other right-wing and fringe religious groups, were broken up by religious musical performances. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Cait Kelly will guide you through the rest of our rolling coverage \u2013 take care. Children at school could be searched by police under legislation expected to be passed when the Northern Territory parliament resumes, AAP reports. Chief minister Lia Finocchiaro said Declan\u2019s Law, a bail amendment bill set to be introduced when parliament resumes on 15 October, will extend police powers to search and seize weapons in more places. Finocchiaro said the government had made the authorisation of wanding (using a metal detector to search people) easier for police, and expanded the areas where wands can be used to places including schools and public transport. This starts a movement for change right across the territory. The CLP [Country Liberal party] has a mandate to deliver this amongst other law reform, and we will not apologise to anyone for getting on with the job of delivering it. If the NT government \u2013 which has 17 of 25 seats in the parliament \u2013 successfully lowers the age of criminal responsibility to 10 and passes the laws, as Finocchiaro has promised, technically primary schoolchildren could be searched by police and prosecuted. The Greens member for Nightcliff, Kat McNamara, said the proposed changes are \u201cregressive\u201d and that the CLP \u201cwants to give police the power to wand children in primary school, turning our places of learning into airport security checkpoints.\u201d The Bureau of Meteorology has published a severe weather update, with thunderstorms forecast for northeast NSW and southeast Queensland. The former prime minister, Tony Abbott, has told a rally at Parliament House those behind the 7 October attacks against Israel \u201cshould be utterly destroyed\u201d. The rally, organised by Christian organisation Never Again Is Now, is being held a year on from the attacks led by Palestinian militant group, Hamas, against civilians in southern Israel. More than 1,200 Israelis were reportedly killed during the 7 October attacks and subsequent military confrontation. Since then, Israel\u2019s response in Gaza has reportedly killed more 40,000 \u2013 with around half being women and children. Abbott, who is a patron of the Christian organisation, said the \u201cmurderers and the organisations\u201d behind the attacks on Israel \u201cshould be utterly destroyed and that\u2019s exactly what the Israeli government has been doing ever since\u201d. And sure, we lament the civilian casualties, and we admire the way that Israel has been so incredibly fastidious in trying to avoid them, and we admire the extraordinarily clever and successful way in which the Israeli military and government have fought back. Payman says today is \u2018powerful reminder to renew commitment to standing for justice\u2019 Senator Fatima Payman has issued a statement to mark 7 October, stating that today is \u201ca powerful reminder why we need to renew our commitment to standing for justice and upholding human rights for all.\u201d Payman quit Labor in July to sit on the crossbench after crossing the floor to vote for a Greens motion in the Senate to recognise Palestine. In a statement posted to social media today, she said: As an Australian, as a Muslim, and as a humanitarian, the bloodshed of any human being is against the core principles of my identity. Today is a powerful reminder why we need to renew our commitment to standing for justice and upholding human rights for all. Payman said that \u201cnothing justifies\u201d the killing of civilians and children, \u201capartheid\u201d and \u201coccupation\u201d. My thoughts and prayers go out to all who are suffering the loss of loved ones and grieving the genocide. Parties issued dueling health policies in second week of Queensland election campaign Meanwhile, the LNP has promised to reduce hospital ambulance ramping to \u201cbelow 30%\u201d by 2028, if elected this month. Leader David Crisafulli and health spokesperson Roz Bates launched a $590m healthcare policy today, though Labor criticised the plan for lacking detail. One specific was the ramping target. It would mean a substantial reduction from the latest statistics. Released in September, they show ramping was at 43.1% in July and August. The party committed to complete all the new projects budgeted by Labor earlier this year, but not to build any new ones. Instead they promised to adopt better technology and conduct a \u201cSystemwide health workforce plan\u201d to make the existing system work more efficiently. They also promised to reopen maternity services at Biloela and Cooktown and to hire 34,200 extra clinicians by 2032, including 18,700 nurses and midwives. Crisafulli said: We will roll out a roadmap with yearly stepping stones to get there, but after a decade of the ambulance ramping increasing year on year, this is a plan to turn it around. It\u2019s nearly one in two at the moment, and we believe we can get that below one in three with this detailed plan. Within 12 months, the escalation of people waiting for surgery will be a thing of the past, and again, that figure has more than doubled since this government came to office. Fentiman said, \u201cThis is such an undercooked, under-resourced plan, no wonder he described it as a genesis of a plan (in the debate last week).\u201d Labor announced the extension of a GP hospital registrar incentive, and a target of 3400 additional hospital beds. Queensland opposition leader won\u2019t rule out conscience vote for abortion repeal Queensland\u2019s LNP opposition leader has refused to rule out allowing a conscience vote for his party members on a bill re-banning abortion. At a press conference in Brisbane, David Crisafulli repeated \u201cthere will be no change\u201d twelve times, but didn\u2019t address comments by former colleague Jann Stuckey. There will be no change. There will be no change and Queenslanders need to know, despite the government scare campaign, there will be no change. Stuckey suggested that the party leader would not be able to prevent party members voting for a bill put up by a minor party, like Katter\u2019s Australian Party. She was one of just four LNP MPs to vote for the legalisation of abortion in 2018, with Crisafulli and deputy Jarrod Bleijie voting no. In 2022 Crisafulli said he believed matters of life and death should always be a conscience vote. He also voted against Labor\u2019s 2021 voluntary assisted dying legislation. Agriculture spokesperson Tony Perrett told an audience in his electorate in Gympie that he continued to believe abortion was wrong, last week. Labor health minister Shannon Fentiman said: Jann Stuckey doesn\u2019t believe him, and she knows the LNP and David Crisafulli better than anyone. And so if she doesn\u2019t believe him, then I don\u2019t think anyone in Queensland can believe him. So those Queenslanders that fought hard to get voluntary assisted dying as part of our health scheme, should be really worried today. And all of those women and girls who have fought hard for years to see legal and safe and affordable access to termination of pregnancy should be really scared today. Babysitter still missing after Queensland house fire Queensland police say they are yet to locate a woman, 31, believed to have died in a fire alongside an eight-year-old girl at Thorneside, south of Brisbane. As AAP reports, it is understood the missing woman was babysitting the girl at the townhouse in Bayside Court when the fire broke out, about 7am on Sunday morning. The incident has been \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d for the local community, the Redlands City mayor Jos Mitchell says. Continue reading below: Anthony Albanese has said Senator Fatima Payman should hand back her seat to Labor and contest the next election along with other candidates from her new party. In an interview with the Financial Review, the prime minister responded to reports Payman was planning to announce her new party this week \u2013 and said she should use this as an opportunity to test her own popularity: Senator Payman should test democratic support for her actions by contesting the next election herself under the banner of her new political party. As Paul Karp reports, Payman quit Labor in July to sit on the crossbench after crossing the floor to vote for a Greens motion in the Senate to recognise Palestine. Payman has discouraged Muslim Australians from creating a religious political party, arguing a new movement would need a \u201cbroader base\u201d to succeed. You can read more below: The Australian government says it \u201cmakes no apology\u201d for its comments about Iran, after the Australian ambassador in Tehran was summoned to a meeting with the Iranian foreign ministry. The Australian ambassador to Iran, Ian McConville, was reportedly summoned to a meeting over the weekend in which the Iranian foreign ministry protested what it labelled as Australia\u2019s \u201cbiased stance\u201d, including over Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. Iran has said this missile attack was in response to the deaths of the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, in southern Beirut and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran. The Australian government has previously said it called the Iranian ambassador to Australia, Ahmad Sadeghi, in to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra on Friday to protest his \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d tweets in support of Hezbollah. This afternoon, a spokesperson for Dfat responded to the summoning of McConville with the following statement: Australia makes no apology for the views it has expressed about Iran\u2019s actions or the actions of its ambassador to Australia. The Australian government condemned Iran\u2019s reckless missile strikes on Israel. They were a dangerous escalation and increased the risks of a wider regional war. The Australian government continues to call on all parties to exercise restraint and de-escalate. The destructive cycle of violence in the region must stop. Final hearings in no-grounds evictions trial in Western Australia In final hearings today, the WA supreme court will hear cases launched against the Western Australian government by two public housing tenants, whose lawyers argue the Department of Communities\u2019 use of no-grounds evictions and fixed-term public housing tenancies is unlawful because it denies procedural fairness and is legally unreasonable. In a joint hearing last month, the WA supreme court heard a case reserved to it by a Perth magistrate on questions of law involving the attempted \u201cno-grounds\u201d eviction of a WA public housing tenant and simultaneously heard a second judicial review case for a WA family facing eviction at the end of a fixed-term public housing tenancy. After hearing last month from the tenants\u2019 lawyers and from lawyers for the WA Department of Communities, Justice Howard adjourned the matter to this morning to complete submissions and reply, noting that this case is \u201cimportant to a lot of people, it\u2019s an important case, and it\u2019s going to take some consideration\u201d. More on this to come. \u2018Let this day be a day of mourning and commemoration to the Jewish people,\u2019 says Alex Ryvchin Alex Ryvchin from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry held a press conference a little earlier today from Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs to mark the 7 October anniversary. Ryvchin was joined at the press conference by a number of community members who held posters of the hostages who remain captured or have died during the war. Ryvchin said: The fact that over 100 people remain in captivity, it\u2019s a national tragedy for the Jewish people. And the fact that a year has passed and so much has occurred for us as a community, so much has happened in our own personal lives, and all the while, these people are languishing in hell, second by second, minute by minute, and frankly, nothing is being done for them. Ryvchin, after being asked if he thinks Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza, has gone \u201ctoo far\u201d, said, \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on Israeli\u2019s to do what they can to destroy Hamas military capacity.\u201d He said he agreed with the Israeli ambassador\u2019s statement that the conflict in Gaza and Lebanon was a \u201cbattle for the free world\u201d. Many of the questions at the press conference focused on Ryvchin\u2019s thoughts about the Palestine and Lebanon rally held on Sunday, and on the candlelight vigil planned for this evening. Ryvchin said the council does not oppose the right for Australians to assemble and express political views, but asked people to \u201cleave this one day alone\u201d and \u201cto let this day be a day of mourning and commemoration to the Jewish people\u201d. The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting thunderstorms in north-west, central and south-east parts of Queensland today. It said severe storms are possible in the south-east, with damaging wind gusts, large hail and heavy rainfall. Ahead of the vigils and solemn ceremonies set to be held across Australia today, the NSW police has reissued its message for attendees not to display the Hezbollah flag. The message \u2013 which was broadcast on LED screens at a pro-Palestine rally in Sydney yesterday \u2013 reads: The Hezbollah flag, symbols and portraits of Hassan Nasrallah should not be displayed at the public assembly as this may amount to a criminal offence.

The survey of more than 3,000 people revealed 46% respondents experienced financial concerns at least once a week. About 1 in 5 people say their savings are going backwards, while 29% said they haven\u2019t been able to save as much as they used to 15% are in debt \u2013 or seeing existing debt grow. Grocery prices were the biggest pain point and mortgage repayments were the top concern for middle to high income earners. The survey found that the median grocery spent was up 33% in August compared with January, with electricity bills surging from $300 to $350 in the same period. Compare the Market\u2019s economic director, David Koch, said: Most people aren\u2019t overstretching or living beyond their means, they are just trying to get by, but it\u2019s the rising cost of essential items that is killing them. Industry leaders need to sit up and listen to the people that are hurting. No one has been immune to the impact of inflation but price hikes are not something to be taken lightly and I think we need to see a more proportionate approach to pricing. Australian ambassador in Iran summoned over country\u2019s \u2018biased stance\u2019, reports indicate We are chasing a response from the Australian government to reports that Iran summoned the Australian ambassador in Tehran over the weekend. Reuters cites the Iranian news agency Tasnim as reporting that the Australian ambassador, Ian McConville, was summoned to a meeting for the Iranian foreign ministry to protest what it labelled as Australia\u2019s \u201cbiased stance\u201d, including on Iran\u2019s response to Israel. The Israeli military is planning for a \u201csignificant and serious\u201d response to Iran for last week\u2019s large-scale ballistic missile attack on Israel. On Friday Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, defended what he described as the \u201clegal and legitimate\u201d ballistic missile attack on Israel. Iran has said the action was in response to the deaths of the Hezbollah secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, in southern Beirut and the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The Australian government has previously said that the Iranian ambassador to Australia was called in to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Friday to protest his \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d tweets in support of Hezbollah. We have asked Dfat for a response to the subsequent call-in of the Australian ambassador in Tehran. We will bring you comments as soon as we receive them. Foreign minister and shadow foreign minister release 7 October statements The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has released a statement on the anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel. She wrote, \u201cWe mourn for the innocent lives taken and our thoughts are with the hostages still being held.\u201d Wong also said that \u201cwe stand resolutely against antisemitism and all forms of prejudice\u201d, stating: We recognise the distress the conflict has caused here in Australia. The loss of civilian life in this conflict is devastating. The need for peace has never been greater. The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, also released a statement, saying: We mourn every innocent death. There is no place for terrorism [and] can be no tolerance of it. Remembering October 7th is not just about the pain [and] loss. We must also hold on to hope for healing [and] peace. Above all else, our thoughts today are with families [and] loved ones whose pain will forever remain. \u2018Don\u2019t protest\u2019: Jacinta Allan on pro-Palestine procession planned for today The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has reiterated calls for pro-Palestine activists not to hold a procession for Gaza on the one-year anniversary of the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. Speaking to reporters, Allan says the anniversary is a \u201cnot a day to add to grief and trauma. Today is very much a day of profound grief and trauma and deep, deep sadness for Melbourne and Victoria\u2019s Jewish community. They are grieving and they have been grieving for a full year now. Activist group, Free Palestine Coalition Naarm, is due to hold a vigil and silence procession for the lives lost in Gaza tonight. Asked about the event, Allan says \u201cdon\u2019t protest\u201d: Consider that pain and grief. Consider what today means. Just show some respect. Shares in lithium company surge amid Rio Tinto interest Shares in Arcadium Lithium shot up 50% in early trading today after Rio Tinto confirmed it had made a non-binding approach to buy the dual-listed miner. A successful acquisition would transform Rio Tinto into one of the world\u2019s biggest lithium suppliers ahead of an anticipated surge in demand for lithium-ion batteries, used to power electric vehicles. The approach comes at a time of deeply depressed lithium prices, caused by an oversupply. Rio Tinto said in a statement to the ASX today that its approach was \u201cnon-binding and there is no certainty that any transaction will be agreed to or will proceed\u201d. Arcadium has lithium operations around the world, and is dual-listed in Australia and the US. Its ASX-listed shares surged as high as $6.29 on Monday morning, after trading most of last week at around the $4.20 mark. Shares in other ASX-listed lithium companies, including IGO and Liontown Resources, were also up strongly early on Monday as investors interpreted the Rio Tinto approach as a positive sign for the wider sector. Qantas has provided an update on assisted departure flights from Cyprus, where Australians and their families have been staying in temporary accommodation after leaving Lebanon before their connecting flights back to Australia. Qantas said its 787 Dreamliner left Sydney for Cyprus this morning, the first of two assisted departure flights bringing Australians home. In addition to the flight and cabin crew, Qantas said a dedicated team will be on board \u2013 including \u201cground personnel, medical personnel, engineers and a specialised toolkit and parts in case they are required to help dispatch the aircraft in Larnaca\u201d. Flight ASY1258 is expected to depart Larnaca on Monday evening, with up to 220 passengers on board, arriving back to Sydney on Tuesday evening. Qantas will then fly passengers to their nearest home domestic airport that the airline operates to, at no cost \u2026 The total distance of the flight is around 15,890 km, slightly exceeding the distance of our Perth-London service, which is the longest on our network. Qantas said the Australian Red Cross will be at Sydney airport to provide psychological first aid and referral support for those returning. The second flight, ASY1270, is expected to depart Larnaca on Wednesday evening and arrive back in Australia on Thursday evening. Save the Children Australia urges immediate ceasefire on 7 October anniversary Aid and development agency Save the Children Australia has released a statement on the 7 October anniversary, calling for an immediate ceasefire. The statement said that over the last 12 months, childhoods have been \u201cshattered\u201d across the region: Over 14,000 children in Gaza have been killed. Thousands are lost under the rubble. A year ago today, 37 Israeli children were killed during the 7 Oct[ober] attacks by Palestinian armed groups, and 36 Israeli children were taken hostage. It\u2019s been a year of bombs, airstrikes, and bullets. A year of living in fear, with no safe place to hide. Every war is a war on children. We need a Ceasefire NOW to protect the lives of all children and guarantee the return of all children taken hostage and detained. Alex Ryvchin from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry has been speaking to the media from one of the 7 October anniversary events taking place today. He said the organisation has reported more than 1,800 incidents of antisemitism over the past year \u2013 an increase of more than 300% on the previous year. It is incumbent upon all Australians to fight this hatred, it cannot be on the Jewish community alone standing up to this. This is a national problem which requires a national solution. Adam Bandt releases statement on eve of October 7 attacks The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, has also released a statement to mark the 7 October anniversary. He said the 7 October attacks, the \u201ckilling and traumatising of civilians\u201d and the taking of hostages were \u201cappalling\u201d. The stories from that day are truly horrific and deserve nothing less than our most full condemnation as a community \u2026 Among those whose lives were taken were older people in their homes, young people enjoying music festivals and children who knew little of the history of a conflict that had far predated them. He reiterated calls for the unconditional release of hostages, \u201cjust as we call for the release of the many thousands of Palestinians held as political prisoners in Israeli prisons.\u201d Turning to Israel\u2019s retaliation in Gaza, Bandt said that more than 40,000 have been killed, \u201centire communities\u201d reduced to rubble and millions displaced. He said that Israel\u2019s \u201ccontinued violation of international law in the West Bank\u201d has led to the \u201clargest levels of forced relocations and illegal settlements in the country\u2019s history\u201d, and that in Lebanon, a \u201crelentless campaign of bombardment\u201d is occurring with \u201cno regard for civilians\u201d. Australia is not just a bystander in this conflict. By refusing to support UN resolutions on Palestinian statehood, refusing to support South Africa\u2019s International Court of Justice case on the genocide in Gaza, refusing to sanction the extremist Netanyahu government, by continuing to import Israeli weapons used on Palestinians and to export weapons parts including for the F35 fighter jet to be used by the Israeli military, Australia is complicit in this appalling conflict. Tony Abbott opposes calls for ceasefire in statement claiming \u2018Islamism is coming for all of us\u2019 The former prime minister Tony Abbott has released a statement on the 7 October anniversary, opposing calls for a ceasefire and declaring that \u201ctoo many people in Australia are on the wrong side of this fight between good and evil\u201d. In the statement published to X, Abbott argued that \u201ctoo many leaders have double standards when it comes to Israel\u201d and that \u201cIslamism is potentially coming for all of us\u201d: Since October 7, while Western leaders have conceded Israel\u2019s right to self-defence, they\u2019ve almost always urged that it not be exercised. There\u2019ve been constant demands for \u2018ceasefires\u2019 and for \u2018de-escalation\u2019 which could only benefit terrorist groups. Abbott implied that Israel should attack Iranian nuclear facilities, arguing that these are \u201cprecursors to nuclear weapons\u201d and that \u201cthe world would be much better off if the Iranian nuclear programme were terminated\u201d. The former PM said the \u201cwell-being of mankind\u201d is \u201cthreatened by a new axis of dictatorships united only by their hatred of the West\u201d, and wrote: Israel, indeed, has shown the rest of us how to fight and how to win. On 7 October, Hamas attacked Israel and 1,450 people were killed or kidnapped. Shortly after, Israel began a retaliation campaign in Gaza that has resulted in at least 41,000 people \u2013 mostly civilians and many children \u2013 being killed. Farmers bolster biosecurity in face of deadly bird flu Victorian farmers are preparing for the potential arrival of a new strain of deadly bird flu, AAP reports, which has the power to devastate the state\u2019s poultry industry. More than 1 million birds have been destroyed due to an H7N3 outbreak at seven Victorian poultry and duck farms this year, but the Victorian Farmers Federation says farmers are now preparing for the potential arrival of the H5N1 strain. The deadliest strain of the flu, H5N1 \u2013 also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza \u2013 primarily affects animals \u2013 but of 900 human infections across the globe, more than half were fatal, according to the World Health Organisation. It has also led to an unprecedented number of deaths in wild birds and poultry across the globe. The current H7N3 outbreak is mainly concentrated in the Golden Plains region, in the state\u2019s north-east, that produces a quarter of Victoria\u2019s eggs. The Victorian Farmers Federation\u2019s vice-president, Danyel Cucinotta, said additional urgent action was needed to bolster biosecurity measures to protect the state\u2019s poultry farmers from the new strain. It\u2019s believed the H5N1 virus will enter Australia through wild birds. No cases of H5N1 avian influenza have yet been detected in Australian animals but there are concerns it could cause significant damage to native wildlife and poultry. Here\u2019s a look at the national weather forecast across Australia\u2019s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Calls for NSW to scrap approvals system for protests and legislate human rights act Circling back to news that the NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has suggested Victoria should consider a permit system for protests similar to those in NSW: Our own Catie McLeod has written an explainer, speaking to a legal expert who says protest organisers in NSW would be less likely to end up fighting police in court for permission to hold rallies if the state had a charter of human rights instead of its \u201cundemocratic\u201d approvals system. This came as organisers of Sydney\u2019s weekly pro-Palestine rallies were in the supreme court on Thursday fighting NSW police\u2019s attempt to stop them from holding a protest yesterday, and another event scheduled for tonight. Thursday\u2019s court action \u2013 not the first time protest organisers have ended up in a last-minute standoff with police \u2013 prompted renewed calls for the NSW government to scrap the current approvals system and legislate a human rights act. You can read the full piece below: Ambassador to Lebanon shares photos of assisted departure flight Australia\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon, Andrew Barnes, has shared some photos from one of the assisted departure flights out of Lebanon. He wrote in a post to X: It was wonderful to be able to give a young [Australian] her first passport (&amp; a koala!) at Beirut airport so she could depart on one of our assisted departure flights. A big thanks to all the [Lebanese] staff at the airport for assisting us in getting nearly 900 [Australians] back home. More to come! Independent politicians reflect on October 7 attacks Independent politicians have also been sharing statements to mark 7 October. Mackellar MP Sophie Scamps said her thoughts were with all those impacted, acknowledging \u201cthe anguish of those whose loved ones remain as hostages.\u201d Sending love, healing and hope for a better future for all. Curtin MP Kate Chaney said that one year on, \u201cit seems like a peaceful solution is further away than ever\u201d: Today, I am thinking of the victims of the terrorist attack in Israel and the hostages who are still not home. I am thinking of the many Palestinians who have been injured, killed or displaced following the attack. I am thinking of those now impacted as the conflict broadens. The independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, said he continues to join with the government in calling for the immediate release of all remaining hostages \u2013 and that \u201cthis is a day to commemorate those lives\u201d: Without diminishing their grief, I also recognise the pain, suffering and mourning of Palestinians. In the year since Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack, the IDF has killed over 40,000 people in Gaza, including women, children, aid workers and journalists. Their attacks have caused one of the greatest humanitarian catastrophes of our generation and it must end. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has released a statement to mark one year since the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel. He said the last 12 months constitute \u201cone of the most difficult periods for Jewish Australians in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and today is about respecting the memories of the 1,200 killed, and praying for the hostages. Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats. The Coalition stands with our ally Israel \u2013 rather than treating her like an adversary. We support Australians of Jewish faith \u2013 because you are cherished Australian citizens. That same spirit will see the Jewish people today \u2013 in Israel, in Australia, and around the world \u2013 prevail over present ordeals. The enemies of Israel and the peddlars of Jewish hate will never win. Katy Perry reportedly paid $1.4m AUD for AFL grand final performance 3AW Radio\u2019s \u201crumour file\u201d segment has heard that US pop star Katy Perry was paid $1.4m AUD for her AFL grand final performance \u2013 rather than the widely reported $5m figure. As Katie Cunningham reports, Perry fought to get her new album on the setlist for the performance. Woman\u2019s World, her first single in three years, failed to make any significant impact on the charts and was widely derided as a years-too-late attempt at cashing in on girlboss feminism (the Guardian review gave it one star). The new album that followed, 143, earned the dubious distinction of becoming the worst-rated album on review aggregator Metacritic for almost 15 years. Of the nine tracks Perry performed during her pre-game show at Melbourne\u2019s MCG, just two came from the new album \u2013 and neither was Woman\u2019s World. Perry is due to tour Australia next year, and has so far sold out three concerts in Adelaide. She is visiting the city four times, compared with two concerts each for Sydney, Brisbane and Perth and three for Melbourne. 904 Australians and their immediate family members have now left Lebanon on assisted-departure flights \u2013 in addition to those who left on partner and commercial flights. 407 Australians left on 5 October, and 448 on 6 October. Two more flights are scheduled to leave Beirut today, and further flights are planned \u2013 pending demand, operational capacity and the security situation. Australians and their families are also staying in temporary accomodation in Larnaca, Cyprus and are set to return to Australia on connecting flights. The first was due to land in Sydney this morning, with 349 on board. 3,756 Australians and their immediate family are registered to depart Lebanon. Mark Dreyfus on the 7 October anniversary The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has penned an article for Guardian Australia to mark the 7 October anniversary. Responding to commentary that he has been silent on the war, he wrote: Why so silent, Mark? This, I have been asked a lot. I have thought about it a lot too. I have said little in public about the Hamas-Israel war because I am not the foreign affairs minister. I am Australia\u2019s first law officer. A minister, not a commentator. Just because I\u2019m not talking doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand. You can read the piece in its entirety below: Julian Leeser claims antisemitism going \u2018unanswered\u2019 on university campuses Julian Leeser argued that there hasn\u2019t been enough action on addressing antisemitism in Australia. He told ABC RN that \u201ctoo many people in positions of leadership [have] turned a blind eye to it\u201d, and said that \u201cpoliticians have been equivocal\u201d in certain instances. I think the worst place this is occurring is on university campuses, where we\u2019re supposed to be training the next generation of leaders \u2026 but instead, they\u2019re being confronted by antisemitism that too often has been unanswered and condoned, rather than enormously condemned as it should be. Josh Burns said that Jewish students \u201care either hiding their identity or not going to university at all, which is a completely unacceptable situation\u201d: So how we manage that is something that\u2019s that\u2019s a real constant challenge, and we have to do more to tackle it. And I think you\u2019ll see more from government on that. Burns said another area that needs addressing is the online space, where he argued \u201cso much of the hate and so much of the discrimination and vilification is occurring\u201d: I look forward to working with Julian and the Coalition and any other member of parliament who wants to try and ensure that there is more respect and [being] online is a safer place for all people \u2026 Julian Leeser and Josh Burns discuss 7 October anniversary Liberal MP Julian Leeser and Labor MP Josh Burns, both members of the Jewish community, spoke with ABC RN just earlier to reflect on the one year anniversary of October 7. Burns said that \u201cgrief is not a competition\u201d but today, the Jewish community \u201cneeds a bit of space \u2026 to reflect and to mourn\u201d. He said: I recognise that if [you have family] in Gaza or in Lebanon, these times have been extremely difficult for you, and to look at footage of your family \u2026 having to flee their homes, I mean, it\u2019s just devastating. And I don\u2019t have any anything other than sympathy and compassion for other people. And I think it\u2019s really important that people hold space for each other to feel the devastation of this conflict. And today, the Jewish community needs a bit of space. It needs time to reflect and to mourn and to mark the loss of life of family, of friends, of innocent people. And I don\u2019t think grief is a competition. I think it\u2019s something where, as Australians, we have to hold space for each other and we have to seek empathy for each other. Because if we don\u2019t do that for each other, and if we don\u2019t hold compassion and space for one another, how on earth can we expect people in the region to, [and] how on earth can we expect that there\u2019ll be a more peaceful future? We have to have a shared humanity here, and as Australians, we have to be able to move through this together. The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has suggested Victoria should consider a permit system for protests. In NSW people who wish to stage a protest must lodge paperwork known as \u201cform 1\u201d or a \u201cnotice of intention to hold a public assembly\u201d with the police commissioner in advance of the demonstration for it to be considered lawful. Victoria does not have this same rule. But on Sunrise, Shorten said \u201cperhaps it is time for Victoria to consider a permit system.\u201d How the permit system works is it doesn\u2019t stop people protesting, but the purpose of it is looked at, the circumstance, [how] it\u2019s done \u2026 The police in NSW use this power sparingly. I don\u2019t necessarily think it should apply to industrial relations, but for some of these protests we have seen week in, week out, I do think that having a permit system would at least straighten it up. The great cities of the world have it. American cities, London. They still have protests. Perhaps it is time to reconsider. I have read what the secretary of the police association said in Victoria, he thought that there was probably some merit in considering this idea. I think there probably is. Shorten said it was \u201ctasteless\u201d for pro-Palestine protesters to demonstrate on the eve, and day of, 7 October. The ABC has reported that the Mona\u2019s Ladies\u2019 Lounge is set to close next month. However, the museum\u2019s curator, Kirsha Kaechele, has seemingly denied this in a post to social media. The ABC reported Kaechele as saying the lounge had \u201crun its course\u201d with a \u201cbig celebration\u201d sometime in November, after which the space will close: So there\u2019ll be a big celebration, I\u2019ll open it for a period of time, and then really we\u2019ll just go all out \u2013 and then close the artwork. However, in a post to Instagram, Kaechele said: \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d I said something on the radio and somehow ended up with a headline: \u2018Mona Ladies Lounge to Close\u2019 (eye-roll) Who knows what I actually said (well, they do, they recorded it) \u2013 bad idea, being recorded at 7:30am on your birthday \u2026 The Ladies Lounge is closed to men. Forever. It may change locations, you know, go on tour, we all love an adventure. And I love Paris. Maybe the Ladies Lounge should visit the Pompidou! Do you hear that Laurent? Last month, the Ladies Lounge won an appeal in the state\u2019s supreme court to continue barring men from entering the installation. You can read the full story on this from Kelly Burke below: More details on vigils and rallies to mark 7 October anniversary AAP has more details on the vigils and solemn ceremonies set to be held across Australia today, marking one year since the Hamas attacks in Israel. Candlelight vigils will be held across many Australian cities today, after members of the Jewish community joined the Israeli ambassador, Amir Maimon, at a commemoration in Sydney yesterday evening. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will attend an event in Melbourne today. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, and the health minister, Mark Butler, will attend a community vigil in Sydney. Pro-Palestinian rallies will also take place on the anniversary, with as many as 2,000 people expected at a resilience rally at Lakemba mosque in Sydney\u2019s south, which has not been authorised by NSW police. And as we flagged just a moment ago, a pro-Palestine vigil is also expected to take place in Sydney\u2019s Town Hall. A pro-Palestine vigil is expected to take place tonight in Sydney, from 6pm at Town Hall in the CBD. At a press conference yesterday afternoon, the assistant commissioner, Peter McKenna, said there was no form 1 in place but police would \u201cstill be negotiating heavily with the organisers\u201d. As Catie McLeod reported last week, in NSW people who wish to stage a protest must lodge paperwork known as \u201cform 1\u201d or a \u201cnotice of intention to hold a public assembly\u201d with the police commissioner in advance of the demonstration for it to be considered lawful. McKenna told reporters on Sunday: If you come along and do the right thing \u2013 don\u2019t commit offences, don\u2019t obstruct people, don\u2019t obstruct roadways \u2026 then there\u2019ll be no need for us to intercede. If, however, people commit offences \u2013 criminal offences, or antisocial behaviour, or do anything that we think puts anyone in harm\u2019s way \u2013 we won\u2019t hesitate to take action if they do. Asked what the police response would be if those at the vigil decide to march, McKenna said it would depend on whether they obstruct people or traffic. People are allowed to walk around the CBD, people are allowed to hold public assemblies. They\u2019ve got a democratic right to protest in Australia. Anthony Albanese has released a statement on the one-year anniversary of the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, where 1,450 people were killed or kidnapped. The prime minister said 7 October is a day that \u201ccarries terrible pain\u201d, marking the largest loss of Jewish life on any single day since the Holocaust. Albanese said it was also a day to think of the hostages \u201cwhose lives remain suspended in the fear and isolation of captivity\u201d: For their loved ones, this past year must have felt like an eternity \u2013 the agony of waiting and not knowing, or of having the terrible truth confirmed. Albanese said that since 7 October, Jewish Australians have \u201cfelt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day\u201d and \u201cas a nation we say never again\u201d. We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith \u2026 We recognise the distress the conflict has caused here in Australia \u2026 The number of civilians who have lost their lives is a devastating tragedy. Today, we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people. Good morning, and welcome to the Australia news live blog this Monday morning. My name is Emily Wind, and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage for most of the day. Today marks one year since the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, where 1,450 people were killed or kidnapped. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has released a statement condemning \u201call prejudice and hatred\u201d \u2013 and acknowledging the terrible pain that the anniversary brings. A number of vigils are planned for today to mark the anniversary, as well as one year since Israel\u2019s ongoing retaliation in Gaza that has resulted in at least 41,000 people \u2013 mostly civilians and many children \u2013 being killed. NSW police assistant commissioner Peter McKenna said there was no form 1 in place for a pro-Palestine vigil in Sydney but police would \u201cstill be negotiating heavily with the organisers\u201d. We\u2019ll bring you more in a moment. The ABC yesterday reported that the Mona\u2019s Ladies Lounge, infamously known for barring men from entry, is closing next month. But curator Kirsha Kaechele seemingly denied this in a post to Instagram, writing: \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d It\u2019s also a public holiday in NSW, the ACT and South Australia today. We\u2019ll bring you more on these stories in a moment.

      "body": "<p>Hofesh Shechter walks out of Paris\u2019s Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville, where people are gathered on the pavements, full of post-show chatter. They notice him with a flutter of excitement. Inside the foyer two women linger, self-consciously clutching programmes for the show, Theatre of Dreams, for him to sign.</p> <p>It\u2019s like being with a celebrity, not so common in the world of contemporary dance. Shechter tells me he never gets this reaction in London, where he\u2019s been based for the last 22 years, but Paris has clearly fallen for the Israeli choreographer big time. His company is premiering Theatre of Dreams here, with a three-week run. Backstage we meet one of the musicians, who tells us a woman came up to him at breakfast, crying. She\u2019d seen the show the night before. \u201cI now know what to do,\u201d she told him. That\u2019s powerful stuff.</p> <p>Why do you think the work connects with people, I ask Shechter over lunch a couple of weeks later at London\u2019s Groucho Club (he\u2019s an honorary member \u2013 not a complete nobody here, it turns out). \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, with characteristic bemusement. \u201cI think the simple answer is because the work is about people. It\u2019s not about dance,\u201d he says. \u201cDance and music are tools [to get to] something that matters much more, which is the human experience.\u201d Connection itself is the point. \u201cIn the end we\u2019re having a visceral experience for an hour and a half and feeling like we went through something.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4N0tAbDxPY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B4N0tAbDxPY?start=2&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=2\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Visceral is the right sort of word for Shechter\u2019s shows. As well as creating the dance, he writes the music, often played loud enough to vibrate your seat. It\u2019s dance that wants to physically move you, grab you by the collar and pull you into its maelstrom. The world of Theatre of Dreams morphs continually, and uses a recurring device of theatre curtains that open and close, revealing and subverting what\u2019s behind them. You get inklings of themes: the act of watching, conventions of theatre, dreams, memories, the creative process itself, all with Shechter\u2019s muscular, rhythmic, protean movement \u2013 sometimes frantic, sometimes slo-mo, both heavy and soft. It escalates to a sense of ecstatic experience, the dancers\u2019 bodies moving in sync, faces raised to the ceiling; part intellectual deep-dive, part rave in a field.</p> <p>Shechter admits that what he likes about dance is \u201cthe weirdness of it. The ceremonial, ancient thing.\u201d And much like dreams, watching dance might give rise to strong feelings, but we often struggle to find words for it afterwards. What his intentions were when he made the work, well, don\u2019t read too much into that, he says. \u201cMaking a piece is an associative experience.\u201d He started with poetry, why some words move us and others don\u2019t. He thought about expectations in the theatre, and how what we think is \u201cgood\u201d is formed by our education and values and a kind of cultural agreement. He was thinking about how the world is only made up of what we can imagine. \u201cThe beautiful things and the horrible things are all a projection of that and we have no one to blame but ourselves.\u201d But none of those things matter, he says, it\u2019s just a starting point when he gets in the studio. \u201cIt\u2019s like the beginning of a football match. You kick the ball. And then you see what happens. And the idea is \u2026 to win?\u201d he laughs. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>    <p>Three or four months into the making of the piece, Shechter\u2019s laptop was stolen from his car; it contained all the music he\u2019d made for it and videos of choreography from the studio. After a few days he realised he hadn\u2019t been in love with what he\u2019d made, but had not admitted that to himself. Now he was forced to start again. So he\u2019s not angry with the thief. \u201cI hope they got a good price for it!\u201d</p> <p>Over time Shechter has managed to separate himself from other people\u2019s reactions to his work. \u201cI put my heart on a plate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in the end, the dance is just what happened. I know I was driving the bus. I was doing my best and the intentions were good. And if you enjoyed it, great for you. And if you hated it, I apologise on behalf of the universe.\u201d After all: \u201cWaking up in the morning and putting anything out there is really tough. That\u2019s an act of bravery on its own.\u201d</p> <p>Part of what Shechter is really trying to do on stage is capture some of the intensity of feeling that overwhelms us when we first discover great music, art or film, and connect to a bigger world outside our own. Growing up in Jerusalem, he spent a lot of time on his own after school, avoiding doing his piano practice and putting on headphones to listen to his dad\u2019s record collection: Chopin, Bach, Queen and especially Pink Floyd. \u201cThis was what really marked me. Being transported to another time and space.\u201d Unexpectedly, Shechter also namechecks The Goonies, Gremlins and Back to the Future, all the elements of a 1980s childhood that were as much an influence on him as dance, which he came to relatively late, in his teens. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever really grew up beyond 16,\u201d says the 49-year-old.</p>    <p>When Shechter first came to the UK he was drumming in a band. \u201cI wanted to be a rockstar,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the biggest insult that I\u2019ve received over and over is that I\u2019m \u2018the rockstar of contemporary dance\u2019. Ah dude, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d he laughs. That label stuck after he staged one of his biggest successes, Political Mother, at Brixton Academy in 2015, complete with moshing audience. But his work has taken him to all kinds of theatres around the world, to film \u2013 he and his company appeared in the 2022 film En Corps, about an injured ballerina who finds a new identity in contemporary dance \u2013 and to Broadway, where he choreographed the 2015 revival of Fiddler on the Roof and earned a Tony nomination for it.</p> <p>Since 2018, alongside his main company he has been running Shechter II, a dynamite group of recent graduates who are now touring the piece From England With Love, a biting satire on English identity. Next on Shechter\u2019s to-do list is a new version of Oedipus with co-director Matthew Warchus, starring Rami Malek, which opens at the Old Vic in January. And he\u2019s making his first full-evening piece for the Paris Opera Ballet.</p> <p>The projects are wide-ranging, but there\u2019s always something recognisable about Shechter\u2019s choreography, even when it\u2019s on a ballet company, and in the mood on stage too, I suggest to him: a sense of heaviness and bleakness, especially when it comes to human nature and power and control. \u201cI suppose I look at this period in time and all I have to say is, I rest my case,\u201d he says. He still has family in Israel and we talk about Gaza, his feelings of horror and helplessness. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is that they [Israelis and Palestinians] will have to live together. There\u2019s just no other way. It\u2019s like your children: they\u2019re fighting a lot, but they will have to learn to live together,\u201d he says. \u201cI really try not to speak about politics, but I will say the problem is the leaders.\u201d He can\u2019t lose faith in human nature. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to die and they don\u2019t want to kill.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes Shechter struggles with questioning what he\u2019s doing: what does anything matter amid the horrors we\u2019re witnessing, what good can it do, \u201cshouting dancers into the void\u201d? \u201cBut I\u2019m clear about my choice in life,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s to make dance and music, because I believe those things make the world a better place. I believe that.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 Theatre of Dreams is at <a href=\"https://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/hofesh-shechter-company-new-creation/\">Sadler\u2019s Wells, London</a>, 9-12 October<br>\u2022 Lyndsey Winship\u2019s trip to Paris was provided by Hofesh Shechter Company</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hofesh Shechter walks out of Paris\u2019s Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville, where people are gathered on the pavements, full of post-show chatter. They notice him with a flutter of excitement. Inside the foyer two women linger, self-consciously clutching programmes for the show, Theatre of Dreams, for him to sign. It\u2019s like being with a celebrity, not so common in the world of contemporary dance. Shechter tells me he never gets this reaction in London, where he\u2019s been based for the last 22 years, but Paris has clearly fallen for the Israeli choreographer big time. His company is premiering Theatre of Dreams here, with a three-week run. Backstage we meet one of the musicians, who tells us a woman came up to him at breakfast, crying. She\u2019d seen the show the night before. \u201cI now know what to do,\u201d she told him. That\u2019s powerful stuff. Why do you think the work connects with people, I ask Shechter over lunch a couple of weeks later at London\u2019s Groucho Club (he\u2019s an honorary member \u2013 not a complete nobody here, it turns out). \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, with characteristic bemusement. \u201cI think the simple answer is because the work is about people. It\u2019s not about dance,\u201d he says. \u201cDance and music are tools [to get to] something that matters much more, which is the human experience.\u201d Connection itself is the point. \u201cIn the end we\u2019re having a visceral experience for an hour and a half and feeling like we went through something.\u201d Visceral is the right sort of word for Shechter\u2019s shows. As well as creating the dance, he writes the music, often played loud enough to vibrate your seat. It\u2019s dance that wants to physically move you, grab you by the collar and pull you into its maelstrom. The world of Theatre of Dreams morphs continually, and uses a recurring device of theatre curtains that open and close, revealing and subverting what\u2019s behind them. You get inklings of themes: the act of watching, conventions of theatre, dreams, memories, the creative process itself, all with Shechter\u2019s muscular, rhythmic, protean movement \u2013 sometimes frantic, sometimes slo-mo, both heavy and soft. It escalates to a sense of ecstatic experience, the dancers\u2019 bodies moving in sync, faces raised to the ceiling; part intellectual deep-dive, part rave in a field. Shechter admits that what he likes about dance is \u201cthe weirdness of it. The ceremonial, ancient thing.\u201d And much like dreams, watching dance might give rise to strong feelings, but we often struggle to find words for it afterwards. What his intentions were when he made the work, well, don\u2019t read too much into that, he says. \u201cMaking a piece is an associative experience.\u201d He started with poetry, why some words move us and others don\u2019t. He thought about expectations in the theatre, and how what we think is \u201cgood\u201d is formed by our education and values and a kind of cultural agreement. He was thinking about how the world is only made up of what we can imagine. \u201cThe beautiful things and the horrible things are all a projection of that and we have no one to blame but ourselves.\u201d But none of those things matter, he says, it\u2019s just a starting point when he gets in the studio. \u201cIt\u2019s like the beginning of a football match. You kick the ball. And then you see what happens. And the idea is \u2026 to win?\u201d he laughs. \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d Three or four months into the making of the piece, Shechter\u2019s laptop was stolen from his car; it contained all the music he\u2019d made for it and videos of choreography from the studio. After a few days he realised he hadn\u2019t been in love with what he\u2019d made, but had not admitted that to himself. Now he was forced to start again. So he\u2019s not angry with the thief. \u201cI hope they got a good price for it!\u201d Over time Shechter has managed to separate himself from other people\u2019s reactions to his work. \u201cI put my heart on a plate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in the end, the dance is just what happened. I know I was driving the bus. I was doing my best and the intentions were good. And if you enjoyed it, great for you. And if you hated it, I apologise on behalf of the universe.\u201d After all: \u201cWaking up in the morning and putting anything out there is really tough. That\u2019s an act of bravery on its own.\u201d Part of what Shechter is really trying to do on stage is capture some of the intensity of feeling that overwhelms us when we first discover great music, art or film, and connect to a bigger world outside our own. Growing up in Jerusalem, he spent a lot of time on his own after school, avoiding doing his piano practice and putting on headphones to listen to his dad\u2019s record collection: Chopin, Bach, Queen and especially Pink Floyd. \u201cThis was what really marked me. Being transported to another time and space.\u201d Unexpectedly, Shechter also namechecks The Goonies, Gremlins and Back to the Future, all the elements of a 1980s childhood that were as much an influence on him as dance, which he came to relatively late, in his teens. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever really grew up beyond 16,\u201d says the 49-year-old. When Shechter first came to the UK he was drumming in a band. \u201cI wanted to be a rockstar,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the biggest insult that I\u2019ve received over and over is that I\u2019m \u2018the rockstar of contemporary dance\u2019. Ah dude, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d he laughs. That label stuck after he staged one of his biggest successes, Political Mother, at Brixton Academy in 2015, complete with moshing audience. But his work has taken him to all kinds of theatres around the world, to film \u2013 he and his company appeared in the 2022 film En Corps, about an injured ballerina who finds a new identity in contemporary dance \u2013 and to Broadway, where he choreographed the 2015 revival of Fiddler on the Roof and earned a Tony nomination for it. Since 2018, alongside his main company he has been running Shechter II, a dynamite group of recent graduates who are now touring the piece From England With Love, a biting satire on English identity. Next on Shechter\u2019s to-do list is a new version of Oedipus with co-director Matthew Warchus, starring Rami Malek, which opens at the Old Vic in January. And he\u2019s making his first full-evening piece for the Paris Opera Ballet. The projects are wide-ranging, but there\u2019s always something recognisable about Shechter\u2019s choreography, even when it\u2019s on a ballet company, and in the mood on stage too, I suggest to him: a sense of heaviness and bleakness, especially when it comes to human nature and power and control. \u201cI suppose I look at this period in time and all I have to say is, I rest my case,\u201d he says. He still has family in Israel and we talk about Gaza, his feelings of horror and helplessness. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is that they [Israelis and Palestinians] will have to live together. There\u2019s just no other way. It\u2019s like your children: they\u2019re fighting a lot, but they will have to learn to live together,\u201d he says. \u201cI really try not to speak about politics, but I will say the problem is the leaders.\u201d He can\u2019t lose faith in human nature. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to die and they don\u2019t want to kill.\u201d Sometimes Shechter struggles with questioning what he\u2019s doing: what does anything matter amid the horrors we\u2019re witnessing, what good can it do, \u201cshouting dancers into the void\u201d? \u201cBut I\u2019m clear about my choice in life,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s to make dance and music, because I believe those things make the world a better place. I believe that.\u201d \u2022 Theatre of Dreams is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 9-12 October \u2022 Lyndsey Winship\u2019s trip to Paris was provided by Hofesh Shechter Company",

This was similar in 2022 and 2021. Areas facing severe drought and low river discharge conditions included large territories of North, Central and South America; for instance, the Amazon and Mississippi rivers had record low water levels. On the other side of the globe, in Asia and Oceania, the large Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mekong river basins experienced lower-than-normal conditions almost over the entire basin territories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/24/devastating-drought-in-amazon-result-of-climate-crisis-study-shows\">Devastating drought in Amazon result of climate crisis, study shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Climate breakdown appears to be changing where water goes, and helping to cause extreme floods and droughts. 2023 was the hottest year on record, with rivers running low and countries facing droughts, but it also brought devastating floods across the globe.</p> <p>The extremes were also influenced, according to the WMO, by the transition from La Ni\u00f1a to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/elnino\">El Ni\u00f1o </a>in mid-2023. These are naturally occurring weather patterns; El Ni\u00f1o refers to the above-average sea-surface temperatures that periodically develop across the east-central equatorial Pacific, while La Ni\u00f1a refers to the periodic cooling in those areas. However, scientists say climate breakdown is exacerbating the impacts of these weather phenomena and making them more difficult to predict.</p> <p>Areas that faced flooding included the east coast of Africa, the North Island of New Zealand, and the Philippines.</p> <p>In the UK, Ireland, Finland and Sweden, there was above-normal discharge, which is the volume of water flowing through a river at a given point in time.</p> <p>\u201cWater is the canary in the coalmine of climate change,\u201d said the WMO secretary general, Celeste Saulo. \u201cWe receive distress signals in the form of increasingly extreme rainfall, floods and droughts which wreak a heavy toll on lives, ecosystems and economies. Melting ice and glaciers threaten long-term water security for many millions of people. And yet we are not taking the necessary urgent action.</p> <p>\u201cAs a result of rising temperatures, the hydrological cycle has accelerated. It has also become more erratic and unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or too little water. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which is conducive to heavy rainfall. More rapid evaporation and drying of soils worsen drought conditions,\u201d she added.</p> <p>These extreme water conditions put supply at risk. Currently, 3.6 billion people face inadequate access to water for at least one month a year, and this is expected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050, according to UN Water.</p> <p>Glaciers also fared badly last year, losing more than 600 gigatonnes of water, the highest figure in 50 years of observations, according to the WMO\u2019s preliminary data for September 2022 to August 2023. Mountains in western North America and the European Alps faced extreme melting. Switzerland\u2019s Alps lost about 10% of their remaining volume over the past two years.</p> <p>\u201cFar too little is known about the true state of the world\u2019s freshwater resources. We cannot manage what we do not measure. This report seeks to contribute to improved monitoring, data-sharing, cross-border collaboration and assessments,\u201d said Saulo. \u201cThis is urgently needed.\u201d</p>",

Over the past five years, there have been lower-than-average river levels across the globe and reservoirs have also been low, according to the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s (WMO) State of Global Water Resources report. In 2023, more than 50% of global river catchment areas showed abnormal conditions, with most being in deficit. This was similar in 2022 and 2021. Areas facing severe drought and low river discharge conditions included large territories of North, Central and South America; for instance, the Amazon and Mississippi rivers had record low water levels. On the other side of the globe, in Asia and Oceania, the large Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mekong river basins experienced lower-than-normal conditions almost over the entire basin territories. Climate breakdown appears to be changing where water goes, and helping to cause extreme floods and droughts. 2023 was the hottest year on record, with rivers running low and countries facing droughts, but it also brought devastating floods across the globe. The extremes were also influenced, according to the WMO, by the transition from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o in mid-2023. These are naturally occurring weather patterns; El Ni\u00f1o refers to the above-average sea-surface temperatures that periodically develop across the east-central equatorial Pacific, while La Ni\u00f1a refers to the periodic cooling in those areas. However, scientists say climate breakdown is exacerbating the impacts of these weather phenomena and making them more difficult to predict. Areas that faced flooding included the east coast of Africa, the North Island of New Zealand, and the Philippines. In the UK, Ireland, Finland and Sweden, there was above-normal discharge, which is the volume of water flowing through a river at a given point in time. \u201cWater is the canary in the coalmine of climate change,\u201d said the WMO secretary general, Celeste Saulo. \u201cWe receive distress signals in the form of increasingly extreme rainfall, floods and droughts which wreak a heavy toll on lives, ecosystems and economies. Melting ice and glaciers threaten long-term water security for many millions of people. And yet we are not taking the necessary urgent action. \u201cAs a result of rising temperatures, the hydrological cycle has accelerated. It has also become more erratic and unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or too little water. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which is conducive to heavy rainfall. More rapid evaporation and drying of soils worsen drought conditions,\u201d she added. These extreme water conditions put supply at risk. Currently, 3.6 billion people face inadequate access to water for at least one month a year, and this is expected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050, according to UN Water. Glaciers also fared badly last year, losing more than 600 gigatonnes of water, the highest figure in 50 years of observations, according to the WMO\u2019s preliminary data for September 2022 to August 2023. Mountains in western North America and the European Alps faced extreme melting. Switzerland\u2019s Alps lost about 10% of their remaining volume over the past two years. \u201cFar too little is known about the true state of the world\u2019s freshwater resources. We cannot manage what we do not measure. This report seeks to contribute to improved monitoring, data-sharing, cross-border collaboration and assessments,\u201d said Saulo. \u201cThis is urgently needed.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When someone told me that <em>World Without End</em> by Jean-Marc Jancovici and Christophe Blain outsold <em>Asterix</em> when it was published in France in 2021, I was sceptical to put it mildly. If I know how attached the French are to their beloved <em>bandes dessin\u00e9es</em><em>,</em> I also know how much they love their brie and beef bourguignon; it seemed a bit unlikely they would take to their hearts a book whose alternative title might be: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Climate Change But Were Too Afraid to Ask.</p> <p>But there it is. The title was indeed a word-of-mouth sensation, and now it has been translated into English (by Edward Gauvin) ahead of publication in the UK and the US, where the Pulitzer prize-winning author of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sixth-extinction-10th-anniversary-edition-9781250887313/\">The Sixth Extinction</a></em>, Elizabeth Kolbert, has already asked, only half jokingly, if it might not save the planet. So what\u2019s its secret? In the end, I think, it\u2019s that Jancovici and Blain come at their subject with such a lack of dogmatism. In many respects, their message is extremely bleak: if, for instance, average temperatures rose by 4C compared with today (we\u2019ve already had such increases during heatwaves), people born today could find themselves in a place where it would be impossible to survive outdoors before their lifespan is up. But Jancovici, in particular, is determined to remain hopeful and realistic. Eat your cheese, he says. Enjoy your (rare) burgers. But let these things be treats, not the stuff of every dejeuner.</p> <p>In 2018, Blain, an award-winning cartoonist, was beginning to feel anxious. For a long time global warming had seemed an abstract concept, but now, sweating in his little hatchback on his way to the Breton coast, he felt he could ignore it no longer. What to do? On the urging of his brother, who told him to take action rather than just to mope, he set up a meeting with <a href=\"https://jancovici.com/en/\">Jancovici</a>, a science communicator with an engineering background who in the early 00s had developed a protocol that gave rise to the global standard for measuring greenhouse emissions. <em>World Without End</em> is the result of the collaboration on which they eventually embarked, Jancovici having provided the facts and clever concepts, and Blain the angst, the jokes and the occasional superhero (energy provides human beings with any number of special powers, from flying to communicating with fellow members of the species on the other side of the world).</p>    <p>It isn\u2019t, be warned, an easy read.

      "body": "<p>UK house prices climbed for the third month in a row in September to about \u00a3100 short of a record high as rising worker pay and falling interest rates helped make mortgages more affordable for some homebuyers, according to a leading index.</p> <p>Data released by Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, showed that prices climbed by 0.3% last month, extending a streak of rising prices that began in July. The month-on-month increase matches the 0.3% rise recorded in August.</p> <p>It means that the price tag of the typical UK home edged higher by \u00a3859 in cash terms to \u00a3293,399 \u2013 just shy of the \u00a3293,507 peak set in June 2022, three months before the then prime minister Liz Truss\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/20/the-mini-budget-that-broke-britain-and-liz-truss\">disastrous mini-budget</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/oct/07/uk-house-prices-rise-close-to-record-high-pound-ftse-eurozone-confidence-business-live\">UK house prices rise for third month running, close to record high \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On an annual basis, prices rose 4.7%. That is slightly higher than the 4.3% recorded in August, but still the highest rate of growth since November 2022.</p> <p>The housing market has been given a leg-up by the Bank of England, which in August slashed interest rates for the first time in four-and-a half years from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/01/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates\">5.25% to 5%</a>. It has led to a renewed mortgage price war among commercial lenders, which have been cutting their own mortgage rates in a bid to capture a larger share of the market after months of relatively sluggish growth.</p> <p>Some, such as Nationwide building society, are also raising the borrowing cap for first-time buyers, allowing some to take on mortgages worth up to six times their earnings, in order to attract new customers.</p> <p>\u201cMarket conditions have steadily improved over the summer and into early autumn. Mortgage affordability has been easing thanks to strong wage growth and falling interest rates,\u201d said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax. \u201cThis has boosted confidence among potential buyers, with the number of mortgages agreed up more than 40% in the last year and now at their highest level since July 2022.\u201d</p> <p>However, Bryden said it was unlikely to shift the dial for most prospective homebuyers, who are still priced out of the market.

      "bodyText": "UK house prices climbed for the third month in a row in September to about \u00a3100 short of a record high as rising worker pay and falling interest rates helped make mortgages more affordable for some homebuyers, according to a leading index. Data released by Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, showed that prices climbed by 0.3% last month, extending a streak of rising prices that began in July. The month-on-month increase matches the 0.3% rise recorded in August. It means that the price tag of the typical UK home edged higher by \u00a3859 in cash terms to \u00a3293,399 \u2013 just shy of the \u00a3293,507 peak set in June 2022, three months before the then prime minister Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget. On an annual basis, prices rose 4.7%. That is slightly higher than the 4.3% recorded in August, but still the highest rate of growth since November 2022. The housing market has been given a leg-up by the Bank of England, which in August slashed interest rates for the first time in four-and-a half years from 5.25% to 5%. It has led to a renewed mortgage price war among commercial lenders, which have been cutting their own mortgage rates in a bid to capture a larger share of the market after months of relatively sluggish growth. Some, such as Nationwide building society, are also raising the borrowing cap for first-time buyers, allowing some to take on mortgages worth up to six times their earnings, in order to attract new customers. \u201cMarket conditions have steadily improved over the summer and into early autumn. Mortgage affordability has been easing thanks to strong wage growth and falling interest rates,\u201d said Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax. \u201cThis has boosted confidence among potential buyers, with the number of mortgages agreed up more than 40% in the last year and now at their highest level since July 2022.\u201d However, Bryden said it was unlikely to shift the dial for most prospective homebuyers, who are still priced out of the market. She warned that property prices would remain subdued into 2025. \u201cWhile improved mortgage affordability should continue to support buyer activity \u2013 boosted by anticipated further cuts to interest rates \u2013 housing costs remain a challenge for many. As a result we expect property price growth over the rest of this year and into next to remain modest,\u201d Bryden added. Separate research by the estate agent Hamptons published on Monday laid bare the challenges facing young homebuyers. Average mortgage payments for generation Z \u2013 those born in the late 1990s \u2013 are poised to be roughly double the total paid by previous generations when they first go on the property ladder, at \u00a31,739 a month. That compares with millennials, who were born in the 1980s and early 1990s, who have been paying an average \u00a3863 a month. Meanwhile, a first-time generation X buyer paid about \u00a3923 a month, while baby boomers paid \u00a3775.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s official: Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals is one of the unluckiest quarterbacks we\u2019ve ever seen. The Bengals <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671626\">lost 41-38 to the Baltimore Ravens</a> in overtime on Sunday, sending Cincinnati to 1-4 on the season. It certainly hasn\u2019t been Burrow\u2019s fault \u2013 through the first five games of the season, Burrow has completed 125 of 173 passes (a 72.3% completion rate) for 1,370 yards (7.9 yards per attempt), 12 touchdowns, two interceptions, and an outstanding passer rating of 113.6 (his QBR of 73.6 is <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/qbr\">the second-best in the league</a>).</p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t been enough to stop the Bengals slipping out of the playoff race \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not a championship-level team right now,\u201d was Burrow\u2019s brutal conclusion after Sunday\u2019s loss. Most of Cincinnati\u2019s issues center around a defense that has been especially awful against the run, and has forced Burrow to make as many big plays as possible just to keep his team in games \u2013 which he is certainly capable of doing.</p> <p>On Sunday, Burrow completed 30 of 39 passes for 392 yards, five touchdowns, one interception, and a passer rating of 137.0. It was one of the best quarterback performances of the season, and it helped the Bengals to leads of 24-14 in the third quarter, and 38-28 in the fourth. But the Bengals\u2019 defense grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory once again, allowing Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to do their collective things late in regulation and into overtime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/austingayle_/status/1843111254090736016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Bengals&#39; offense is averaging 0.94 EPA per drive and 2.94 actual points (AP??) per drive; both numbers are the best for the franchise in Weeks 1-5 since at least 2000.<br><br>The Bengals&#39; defense is allowing 2.73 points per drive, the worst number for the franchise in Weeks 1-5\u2026</p>&mdash; Austin Gayle (@austingayle_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/austingayle_/status/1843111254090736016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 7, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>It also didn\u2019t help that when Jackson fumbled the ball to the Bengals with 6:37 left in overtime, the decision was made to run the ball three straight times for a total of three yards, which led to a missed 53-yard field goal attempt \u2013 on a bad hold \u2013 by kicker Evan McPherson. One play later, the Ravens put the boot in (we\u2019ll get to the specifics in just a minute), and once again, Burrow\u2019s outstanding performance was for nothing. He became the 10th quarterback in NFL history with more than 390 passing yards, at least five touchdown passes, and a completion percentage higher than 75%, and none of it meant anything.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/oct/05/nfl-dynamic-kickoff-rules-analysis-results\">Are the NFL\u2019s reimagined kickoff rules working? The early returns are mixed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burrow isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 he threw a killer interception with 3:05 left in the fourth quarter that allowed the Ravens to tie the game in regulation. But the Bengals\u2019 four losses have been by a total margin of 15 points. All is not lost here, but it\u2019s tough to tell anybody on the team that.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just winning a lot of our one-on-one coverages,\u201d Bengals receiver Tee Higgins said after the loss. \u201cWe knew that was going to be big for this game.

If you extrapolate it out to a full season, it\u2019s nearly impossible to have things go this dramatically against you when you\u2019re playing this well. In pro football history, there\u2019s been exactly one quarterback to start at least 10 games, have a passer rating of at least 100.0, and to be involved in four or fewer wins: <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;order_by=pass_rating&amp;year_min=1950&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=lt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=4&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=qb_w&amp;ccomp%5B2%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B2%5D=100&amp;cstat%5B2%5D=pass_rating&amp;ccomp%5B3%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B3%5D=10&amp;cstat%5B3%5D=games_started\">Deshaun Watson of the 2020 Houston Texans</a>. Believe it or not, Watson played at a MVP level for a 4-12 Texans team that fired head coach Bill O\u2019Brien after an 0-4 start, and maintained mediocrity with interim head coach Romeo Crennel.</p> <p>Of course, we do <em>not</em> expect things to fall apart for Burrow as they subsequently have for Watson, for all the obvious possible reasons.</p> <h2>MVP of the week</h2>    <p><strong>Derrick Henry, running back, Baltimore Ravens.</strong> It was quite a day for Mr Henry, who reached 10,000 career rushing yards and 100 career scrimmage touchdowns in the Ravens\u2019 win. As to how Henry put the boot in, that happened one play after the Bengals\u2019 three-ill-fated rushing attempts and missed field goal in overtime. Henry took the ball at the Baltimore 43-yard line, and rumbled 51 yards to the Cincinnati six-yard line. That set up Justin Tucker for the game-winning field goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1843025877925314720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DERRICK HENRY THE KING.<br><br>THIS.

He also attended Oklahoma Baptist University where he played basketball for the Bison. Not only is he in the OBU Hall of Fame for his basketball accomplishments, he is also in the Tulsa Public Schools Hall of Fame for the same reasons.</em></p> <h2>Stat of the week</h2> <p><strong>Three minutes, 26 seconds.</strong> That\u2019s how long the 5-0 Minnesota Vikings have trailed in the entire 2024 season. And that happened in the first quarter of their first game. Their opponent on Sunday, the New York Jets, did make it interesting by fighting back from a 17-0 second-quarter deficit \u2013 the second time in two games that Minnesota have allowed a bunch of points in the second half \u2013 but the Vikings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/nfl-london-minnesota-vikings-new-york-jets-aaron-rodgers\">still ran out 23-17 winners</a>.</p> <h2>Elsewhere around the league</h2> <p>\u2022 For the most part, athletes are better conditioned than ever, allowing them to play well into their 30s \u2026 and sometimes beyond. So, when the Green Bay Packers traded Aaron Rodgers to the Jets in April 2023, despite the fact that he was 39, few people gave it a second thought. Rodgers in his prime may have been the best pure thrower in football history, and he was still more than adequate in his final season with the Green Bay Packers, so why shouldn\u2019t the Jets try to end their decades-long quarterback drought?</p>    <p>It appears that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/nfl-london-minnesota-vikings-new-york-jets-aaron-rodgers\">we now know why not</a>. On Sunday, Rodgers had three picks and a passer rating of 54.9 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RodgAa00/gamelog/\">his fifth-worst career passer rating</a> in a game where he\u2019s attempted at least 20 passes. Since the 2022 season, Rodgers has one game with three touchdown passes, and two games with three interceptions.</p> <p>Not that it\u2019s all Rodgers\u2019s fault. The Jets are deficient almost everywhere, from offensive coaching to the offensive line to the skill position players, but there are NFL quarterbacks more than capable of transcending those negative factors, and Rodgers used to be one of them.</p> <p>The only quarterback who has given Father Time a real run for his money is Tom Brady, who somehow threw <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=player_season_combined&amp;order_by=pass_att&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_att&amp;age_min=40&amp;age_max=48\">more touchdown passes in his 40s</a> (193) <a href=\"https://stathead.com/football/player-season-finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=player_season_combined&amp;order_by=pass_att&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_att&amp;age_min=20&amp;age_max=29\">than he did in his 20s</a> (147). Outside Brady, there are a lot of guys who should have gone into broadcasting or philanthropy sooner than they did. It may be that Rogers is one of them.</p> <p>\u2022 Of course, if you\u2019re Joe Flacco, you\u2019re advancing on Father Time with an impish grin on your face. After his performance in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671633\">a 37-34 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars</a> on Sunday \u2013 he completed 33 of 44 passes for 359 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions \u2013 the 39-year-old leads the NFL in passer rating at 115.6. Not bad for a guy who was signed up to be Anthony Richardson\u2019s backup in Indianapolis. Which has come in handy, as the injury-prone Richardson has been out the last two games.</p> <p>Flacco is also the oldest player in NFL history to record five consecutive starts with at least 300 passing yards and two touchdown passes. So, who knows? Maybe Flacco will be the next one to beat the age curse, and wouldn\u2019t that be unexpected?</p> <p>\u2022 Coming into Week 5, Trevor Lawrence and Caleb Williams were having very rough starts. Lawrence, selected with the first overall pick in the 2021 draft, had a passer rating of 78.9 (eighth-worst in the NFL), and a Passing EPA per dropback of -0.19 (seventh-worst in the league). Williams, selected first overall in the 2024 draft, had a passer rating of 72.0 (fourth-worst in the NFL), and a Passing EPA per dropback of -0.28 (tied for fourth-worst in the NFL).</p> <p>But on Sunday, both men got a reprieve from their troubles. In the Jags\u2019 win over the Colts, which took Jacksonville to their first win of the season, Lawrence completed 28 of 34 passes for 374 yards, two touchdowns, one interception, and a passer rating of 119.5. Lawrence, whose throwing mechanics had been disastrous this season, looked far more composed and in control here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1842986259439890721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BRIAN THOMAS, JR. 85-YARD TD<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/INDvsJAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#INDvsJAX</a> on CBS/Paramount+<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG\">https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bfK2p2TlaB\">pic.twitter.com/bfK2p2TlaB</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1842986259439890721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>And in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401671872\">a 36-10 thrashing of the Carolina Panthers</a>, Williams completed 20 of 29 passes for 304 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 126.2.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s official: Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals is one of the unluckiest quarterbacks we\u2019ve ever seen. The Bengals lost 41-38 to the Baltimore Ravens in overtime on Sunday, sending Cincinnati to 1-4 on the season. It certainly hasn\u2019t been Burrow\u2019s fault \u2013 through the first five games of the season, Burrow has completed 125 of 173 passes (a 72.3% completion rate) for 1,370 yards (7.9 yards per attempt), 12 touchdowns, two interceptions, and an outstanding passer rating of 113.6 (his QBR of 73.6 is the second-best in the league). But that hasn\u2019t been enough to stop the Bengals slipping out of the playoff race \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re not a championship-level team right now,\u201d was Burrow\u2019s brutal conclusion after Sunday\u2019s loss. Most of Cincinnati\u2019s issues center around a defense that has been especially awful against the run, and has forced Burrow to make as many big plays as possible just to keep his team in games \u2013 which he is certainly capable of doing. On Sunday, Burrow completed 30 of 39 passes for 392 yards, five touchdowns, one interception, and a passer rating of 137.0. It was one of the best quarterback performances of the season, and it helped the Bengals to leads of 24-14 in the third quarter, and 38-28 in the fourth. But the Bengals\u2019 defense grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory once again, allowing Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to do their collective things late in regulation and into overtime. It also didn\u2019t help that when Jackson fumbled the ball to the Bengals with 6:37 left in overtime, the decision was made to run the ball three straight times for a total of three yards, which led to a missed 53-yard field goal attempt \u2013 on a bad hold \u2013 by kicker Evan McPherson. One play later, the Ravens put the boot in (we\u2019ll get to the specifics in just a minute), and once again, Burrow\u2019s outstanding performance was for nothing. He became the 10th quarterback in NFL history with more than 390 passing yards, at least five touchdown passes, and a completion percentage higher than 75%, and none of it meant anything. Burrow isn\u2019t perfect \u2013 he threw a killer interception with 3:05 left in the fourth quarter that allowed the Ravens to tie the game in regulation. But the Bengals\u2019 four losses have been by a total margin of 15 points. All is not lost here, but it\u2019s tough to tell anybody on the team that. \u201cIt was just winning a lot of our one-on-one coverages,\u201d Bengals receiver Tee Higgins said after the loss. \u201cWe knew that was going to be big for this game. We knew that was our mentality, to come in and win those one-on-ones. It just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d How rare is Burrow\u2019s bad luck? If you extrapolate it out to a full season, it\u2019s nearly impossible to have things go this dramatically against you when you\u2019re playing this well. In pro football history, there\u2019s been exactly one quarterback to start at least 10 games, have a passer rating of at least 100.0, and to be involved in four or fewer wins: Deshaun Watson of the 2020 Houston Texans. Believe it or not, Watson played at a MVP level for a 4-12 Texans team that fired head coach Bill O\u2019Brien after an 0-4 start, and maintained mediocrity with interim head coach Romeo Crennel. Of course, we do not expect things to fall apart for Burrow as they subsequently have for Watson, for all the obvious possible reasons. MVP of the week Derrick Henry, running back, Baltimore Ravens. It was quite a day for Mr Henry, who reached 10,000 career rushing yards and 100 career scrimmage touchdowns in the Ravens\u2019 win. As to how Henry put the boot in, that happened one play after the Bengals\u2019 three-ill-fated rushing attempts and missed field goal in overtime. Henry took the ball at the Baltimore 43-yard line, and rumbled 51 yards to the Cincinnati six-yard line. That set up Justin Tucker for the game-winning field goal. When will we see another running back exceed 10,000 rushing yards and 100 rushing touchdowns? It may be quite a while. Most teams don\u2019t lean on their running backs as the Tennessee Titans did with Henry when he was with them from 2016 to 2023, or as the Ravens do now. Video of the week What referee Clay Martin did in the first quarter of Sunday\u2019s game between the Houston Texans and the Buffalo Bills had a lot of people shaking their heads. Martin was attempting to clarify a non-fumble, but he got his sports confused for a second. To be fair, Martin has been quite accomplished as a basketball guy. From his Wikipedia: Outside of his NFL duties, Martin works as a high school basketball coach at Jenks High School in Jenks, Oklahoma. He also attended Oklahoma Baptist University where he played basketball for the Bison. Not only is he in the OBU Hall of Fame for his basketball accomplishments, he is also in the Tulsa Public Schools Hall of Fame for the same reasons. Stat of the week Three minutes, 26 seconds. That\u2019s how long the 5-0 Minnesota Vikings have trailed in the entire 2024 season. And that happened in the first quarter of their first game. Their opponent on Sunday, the New York Jets, did make it interesting by fighting back from a 17-0 second-quarter deficit \u2013 the second time in two games that Minnesota have allowed a bunch of points in the second half \u2013 but the Vikings still ran out 23-17 winners. Elsewhere around the league \u2022 For the most part, athletes are better conditioned than ever, allowing them to play well into their 30s \u2026 and sometimes beyond. So, when the Green Bay Packers traded Aaron Rodgers to the Jets in April 2023, despite the fact that he was 39, few people gave it a second thought. Rodgers in his prime may have been the best pure thrower in football history, and he was still more than adequate in his final season with the Green Bay Packers, so why shouldn\u2019t the Jets try to end their decades-long quarterback drought? It appears that we now know why not. On Sunday, Rodgers had three picks and a passer rating of 54.9 \u2013 his fifth-worst career passer rating in a game where he\u2019s attempted at least 20 passes. Since the 2022 season, Rodgers has one game with three touchdown passes, and two games with three interceptions. Not that it\u2019s all Rodgers\u2019s fault. The Jets are deficient almost everywhere, from offensive coaching to the offensive line to the skill position players, but there are NFL quarterbacks more than capable of transcending those negative factors, and Rodgers used to be one of them. The only quarterback who has given Father Time a real run for his money is Tom Brady, who somehow threw more touchdown passes in his 40s (193) than he did in his 20s (147). Outside Brady, there are a lot of guys who should have gone into broadcasting or philanthropy sooner than they did. It may be that Rogers is one of them. \u2022 Of course, if you\u2019re Joe Flacco, you\u2019re advancing on Father Time with an impish grin on your face. After his performance in a 37-34 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday \u2013 he completed 33 of 44 passes for 359 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions \u2013 the 39-year-old leads the NFL in passer rating at 115.6. Not bad for a guy who was signed up to be Anthony Richardson\u2019s backup in Indianapolis. Which has come in handy, as the injury-prone Richardson has been out the last two games. Flacco is also the oldest player in NFL history to record five consecutive starts with at least 300 passing yards and two touchdown passes. So, who knows? Maybe Flacco will be the next one to beat the age curse, and wouldn\u2019t that be unexpected? \u2022 Coming into Week 5, Trevor Lawrence and Caleb Williams were having very rough starts. Lawrence, selected with the first overall pick in the 2021 draft, had a passer rating of 78.9 (eighth-worst in the NFL), and a Passing EPA per dropback of -0.19 (seventh-worst in the league). Williams, selected first overall in the 2024 draft, had a passer rating of 72.0 (fourth-worst in the NFL), and a Passing EPA per dropback of -0.28 (tied for fourth-worst in the NFL). But on Sunday, both men got a reprieve from their troubles. In the Jags\u2019 win over the Colts, which took Jacksonville to their first win of the season, Lawrence completed 28 of 34 passes for 374 yards, two touchdowns, one interception, and a passer rating of 119.5. Lawrence, whose throwing mechanics had been disastrous this season, looked far more composed and in control here. And in a 36-10 thrashing of the Carolina Panthers, Williams completed 20 of 29 passes for 304 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 126.2. Williams was in command of the passing game, and far less frenetic in the pocket than he had been behind Chicago\u2019s leaky offensive line. The Bears game was so out of hand in Chicago\u2019s favor that Panthers backup quarterback Bryce Young, selected with the first overall pick in the 2023 draft, actually got some garbage time to work on the issues that got him benched in favor of Andy Dalton three weeks ago. A pretty good week for first overall picks then, except for Burrow. \u2022 Coaching is a tough job, and even the most underqualified coach knows a great deal more about football than your average analyst, this one included. So, we are not generally in the habit of questioning (or outright bashing) decisions unless they\u2019re particularly egregious, and cost teams games. Which takes us to what Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott did late in the game against the Houston Texans. With the score tied 20-20, the Texans downed a punt at the Buffalo three-yard line. Houston had all three of their timeouts left, and the correct thing to do was to run the ball three times, force the Texans to use those timeouts, and punt the ball away. Especially with just 32 seconds remaining. Instead, the Bills called three passes from Josh Allen, who had an unusually bad game, and appeared to suffer a head injury earlier in the fourth quarter.

When you possess the ball for just 16 seconds when it\u2019s crucial to put your opponent in a time crunch, you have committed coaching malpractice. Scott Hanson, the outstanding host of the NFL\u2019s indispensable Red Zone channel, spoke for most of us. \u201cIt\u2019s on me, the end of game situation on offense,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cThey\u2019re holding three timeouts, and they\u2019ve got a good \u2026 kicker. We needed to run the clock and move the chains, and that\u2019s on me.

That had never happened before. There was Seattle safety Rayshawn Jenkins recovering and returning this fumble for a 102-yard touchdown (the Seahawks later corrected their tweet regarding the yardage) \u2026 \u2026 and there was Denver Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II returning this pass by Las Vegas\u2019s Gardner Minshew 100 yards in the other direction. That\u2019s a lot of twos, and two very big plays on the day.",

When puberty starts, hormone levels shift and the skin sometimes becomes oilier and more acne-prone. \u201cThe oil can mix with dead skin cells and bacteria which can clog pores, leading to pimples, blackheads, inflammation and acne,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Anna Protasova at <a href=\"https://evoclinic.ae/\">Evolution Aesthetics Clinic</a>.</p> <p>The ideal is to balance your skin\u2019s oil production, so using a gentle cleanser, a lightweight moisturiser and sunscreen of SPF30 or above is key. \u201cChoose a cleanser that is mild and right for your skin type. Use it morning, evening and after strenuous exercise,\u201d Protasova adds. Applying acne products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can be helpful. Follow this with a light moisturiser with SPF.</p> <p>Avoid strong skincare products like retinoids, high concentrations of acids and powerful anti-ageing products, Protasova says.</p> <p>Brands such as <a href=\"https://www.beautypie.com/products/teen-and-tween-skincare-trio?ref=pla_g&amp;amp;memb=60ft&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=PMX_[Performance_Max_generic]_(G-United_Kingdom)_(PT3-Test_SKUs)_(PT4-Member_Pricing_Test)&amp;amp;utm_id=20409474193&amp;amp;utm_content=e2etest&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwq_G1BhCSARIsACc7NxpHerEk51fYVZaKxjsVfvKRcqPbwhHj5xUantvYraNDikJhNWYmFYsaAgomEALw_wcB\">Beauty Pie</a> and <a href=\"https://indu.me/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwq_G1BhCSARIsACc7NxqP2wcCwrTMdjvYYtJO9Tu3Mu4BYqvLCF2XQaUY0fiOTm0LFByiR6IaAsLzEALw_wcB\">Indu</a> have ranges for teens.

      "bodyText": "There is so much confusing information on social media about skincare, but it\u2019s crucial to get advice from experts. When puberty starts, hormone levels shift and the skin sometimes becomes oilier and more acne-prone. \u201cThe oil can mix with dead skin cells and bacteria which can clog pores, leading to pimples, blackheads, inflammation and acne,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Anna Protasova at Evolution Aesthetics Clinic. The ideal is to balance your skin\u2019s oil production, so using a gentle cleanser, a lightweight moisturiser and sunscreen of SPF30 or above is key. \u201cChoose a cleanser that is mild and right for your skin type. Use it morning, evening and after strenuous exercise,\u201d Protasova adds. Applying acne products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can be helpful. Follow this with a light moisturiser with SPF. Avoid strong skincare products like retinoids, high concentrations of acids and powerful anti-ageing products, Protasova says. Brands such as Beauty Pie and Indu have ranges for teens. La Roche-Posay and Av\u00e8ne are also great options. You might also like Starface Pimple Patches, to help any spots heal. Acne can be really tough, so if you\u2019re struggling, speak to somebody you trust. And if you\u2019re having any serious skin worries, see your doctor or a dermatologist for advice.

One of them, Antoine Griezmann, trotted around the whole periphery of the pitch on his own to applaud the crowd. We did not know then, as he must have done, that his 136th appearance for <em>Les Bleus</em> \u2013 there\u2019d be a 137th three days later in Lyon, an 11-minute cameo against Belgium \u2013 was his last chance to say <em>adieu</em> in the French capital. There was no need for fireworks. No video of his finest moments in blue would be shown on a giant screen, no memento would be given to him in the centre circle. All he desired was a last, private moment of communion with a French public to whom he\u2019d given so much, but which is only starting to appreciate how good he was. No, not \u201chow good\u201d. How great.</p> <p>This will seem absurd. France have taken part in three major finals over the past eight years, and Griezmann could lay a claim to have been the best player \u2013 not just for France, but overall \u2013 in each of these tournaments. Yet fewer French people than you think would put him in the top five of the men who put on the blue jersey. Zinedine Zidane would be fighting for top spot with Michel Platini, which seems about right, given how both came to be associated with the first triumphs of the national team they captained.

I doubt it, even if the <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/sports/article/2024/09/30/france-s-antoine-griezmann-retires-from-international-football_6727757_9.html\">announcement of his international retirement</a> will have given us a chance to pause, reflect and reconsider. One of the main reasons for this bizarre lack of appreciation is that everything he achieved, and that is plenty, he had to fight for. Usually, triers who \u201cmake it\u201d get the popular vote. But Griezmann is unique in that it\u2019s not the lack of talent, or skill, which made him a \u201ctrier\u201d. Heaven knows he had talent and skill to spare, and more besides. It is that, in his mind, his personal achievements always came second to the achievements of the team he\u2019d fought to be in. He was too good to be a trier, yet a trier he was and he remains to the day Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s most prolific goalscorer. It is one of the many paradoxes which Griezmann managed to reconcile throughout his career, but which affected the perception and judgment of others.</p> <p>Here is another of those paradoxes. The two managers with whom he\u2019ll always be associated, Deschamps and Diego Simeone, place tactical discipline and combativeness at the very top of footballing virtues. Yet Griezmann, the most agile of minds to go with the nimblest of feet, never rebelled against their rule, when others would have felt it stifled their creativity. More than that: he found joy in playing an attritional style which he admitted \u2013 with a smile, as usual \u2013 was \u201ca pain in the \u2026 to watch\u201d (\u201c<em>on est chiants \u00e0 regarder\u201d</em>). If there was joy to be found, and none was obviously at hand, he\u2019d bring it to the table himself.</p>    <p>He also played his football in an age when it became normative, and you can\u2019t paint a Griezmann by numbers. No metrics have been defined which can gauge a player\u2019s intelligence or commitment. Statisticians, as well as a growing number of fans, focus instead on the measurable impact of both qualities on the pitch. Interceptions, assists, blocks, goals, high-intensity sprints? Griezmann was never found wanting in any of these departments, but it mattered less than the rest, what made Grizi, Grizi.</p> <p>He was capable of the most delightful touches, but eschewed the spectacular if the mundane would bring a better outcome. He could do everything; he could play in any position. He took France to the finals of Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup first as a right-winger, then as a second striker, and, in Qatar, morphed into a deep-lying playmaker of such grit, imagination and radiance that you wondered if it shouldn\u2019t have been his role all along. Not even Olivier Giroud headed the ball as hard and as precisely; and no one in the French camp struck it as sweetly \u2013 and powerfully \u2013 as he did with the outside of his right boot, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. If every ball is a question, almost every time Griezmann found the answer.</p> <p>But he was more than all this. He lit up French football when it was still struggling to emerge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/15/world-cup-stunning-moments-france-implode\">from the darkness of Knysna</a> at the 2010 World Cup. Together with Hugo Lloris, Giroud, the Paul Pogba of <em>Les Bleus</em>, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Rapha\u00ebl Varane, he made disillusioned fans fall in love with their national team again. It is fitting that the record he set, surely never to be beaten, is to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/25/france-flounder-antoine-griezmann-seven-years-world-record\">played 84 consecutive games for France</a>, between August 2017 and November 2023, because there could be no better demonstration of his absolute dedication to the cause.</p> <p>But that race is now run. There will be no 138th cap and no 45th goal for France, when it was taken for granted that Griezmann would carry on and turn up for his fourth World Cup in 2026. Perhaps he felt that, having started the semi-final of Euro 2024 against Spain on the bench, he no longer was an automatic starter for Deschamps. Perhaps being overlooked for the captaincy when Lloris retired and Mbapp\u00e9 was picked instead played its part. The only certainty is that France have just lost one of their all-time greats and will now find out what <a href=\"https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/equipe-de-france/equipe-de-france-deschamps-estime-que-griezmann-n-a-pas-la-reconnaissance-qu-il-meriterait_AV-202311120256.html\">Deschamps really meant when he said</a> that while \u201cno one [was] irreplaceable\u201d, Griezmann \u201cover the years, had ensured he would be indispensable\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Harry Agius had been DJing in clubs for almost a decade, but in 2019 something switched. After a summer spent at NYC Downlow, the LGBTQ+ dance space at Glastonbury, and Honcho Campout, a queer festival in Pennsylvania, the DJ-producer better known as Midland finally felt as if he had tapped into his \u201cauthentic self\u201d. Tracing his formative years at drum\u2019n\u2019bass and dubstep nights, he tells me: \u201cFor a long while, I would feel like the only gay person in those spaces. I came out of the summer of 2019 feeling like: I can\u2019t really go back.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the pandemic. With all live shows pulled and time on his hands, Agius began to reflect on that transformative year and the \u201cdual void\u201d he had been living in beforehand, something he had managed to ignore by being so busy (at one point, he was playing more than 100 gigs a year). Born in Epsom, Surrey, in 1986, Agius had grown up in the shadow of section 28, which prohibited the \u201cpromotion of homosexuality\u201d in schools and by local authorities; meanwhile, HIV and Aids had always felt close to home: his childhood nanny had died of an Aids-related illness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really created with intent \u2013 not just thought: \u2018Oh, this is a track I will play in a club\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though Agius came out at university in Leeds, around the same time he started DJing (his alias is a reference to the street he lived on there), there was a lot he was yet to unpack. \u201cI realised I had just grown up in this total silence,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up as a gay teenager, you are always hiding yourself.\u201d It was within this period of introspection that the seeds of his debut album <a href=\"https://thesoundofvinyl.com/products/fragments-of-us-vinyl-lp?srsltid=AfmBOop0-F7N2FGpt2NCM5Iw8frGg8KKb6V1LMVzB6lIrEzLsoKeC1S9\">Fragments of Us</a> began to grow; an attempt to fill, and reclaim, that silence.</p> <p>Agius has reached many milestones in his 14-year career \u2013 amassing an international following in the underground dance music scene; launching three record labels; taking on remixes for artists including Dua Lipa and the Chemical Brothers \u2013 but his upcoming album feels like his biggest achievement yet. Fragments of Us is a deeply personal documentation of his gradual queer reckoning, told through the voices and spaces that have helped him along the way. It represents a shift, not just in format \u2013 and sound \u2013 but also ambition: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really created with intent, not just: oh, this is a track I\u2019m going to play in a club,\u201d he says. \u201cEach track on the album has a very specific world.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mDWyBPtejc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6mDWyBPtejc?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Welding bubbling synths and vocoder-heavy vocals with archival and field recordings, he tells the story of the Aids crisis in uninhibited detail.

      "bodyText": "Harry Agius had been DJing in clubs for almost a decade, but in 2019 something switched. After a summer spent at NYC Downlow, the LGBTQ+ dance space at Glastonbury, and Honcho Campout, a queer festival in Pennsylvania, the DJ-producer better known as Midland finally felt as if he had tapped into his \u201cauthentic self\u201d. Tracing his formative years at drum\u2019n\u2019bass and dubstep nights, he tells me: \u201cFor a long while, I would feel like the only gay person in those spaces. I came out of the summer of 2019 feeling like: I can\u2019t really go back.\u201d Then came the pandemic. With all live shows pulled and time on his hands, Agius began to reflect on that transformative year and the \u201cdual void\u201d he had been living in beforehand, something he had managed to ignore by being so busy (at one point, he was playing more than 100 gigs a year). Born in Epsom, Surrey, in 1986, Agius had grown up in the shadow of section 28, which prohibited the \u201cpromotion of homosexuality\u201d in schools and by local authorities; meanwhile, HIV and Aids had always felt close to home: his childhood nanny had died of an Aids-related illness. Though Agius came out at university in Leeds, around the same time he started DJing (his alias is a reference to the street he lived on there), there was a lot he was yet to unpack. \u201cI realised I had just grown up in this total silence,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up as a gay teenager, you are always hiding yourself.\u201d It was within this period of introspection that the seeds of his debut album Fragments of Us began to grow; an attempt to fill, and reclaim, that silence. Agius has reached many milestones in his 14-year career \u2013 amassing an international following in the underground dance music scene; launching three record labels; taking on remixes for artists including Dua Lipa and the Chemical Brothers \u2013 but his upcoming album feels like his biggest achievement yet. Fragments of Us is a deeply personal documentation of his gradual queer reckoning, told through the voices and spaces that have helped him along the way. It represents a shift, not just in format \u2013 and sound \u2013 but also ambition: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really created with intent, not just: oh, this is a track I\u2019m going to play in a club,\u201d he says. \u201cEach track on the album has a very specific world.\u201d Welding bubbling synths and vocoder-heavy vocals with archival and field recordings, he tells the story of the Aids crisis in uninhibited detail. On David\u2019s Dream, we hear an excerpt from the American artist and activist David Wojnarowicz\u2019s 1989 tape journals, in which he ponders the prospect of his own death. A little later, Marlon Riggs, a Black gay film-maker, explores the intersections of race and sexuality, urging his community to connect with one another and \u201cconstruct our own salvation\u201d. While making the album, Agius realised he was the same age \u2013 37 \u2013 as both Wojnarowicz and Riggs when they died. \u201cIt was weird to feel at this point in my life where I\u2019m finally making art that I am really proud of, and knowing what it must have been like for them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just reminded me to not wait until you have a deadline.\u201d Other nods to LGBTQ+ culture can be found throughout the record: Ritual samples the dreamy vocals of Arthur Russell and Agius cites synth pop pioneer Patrick Cowley as an influence on the moody instrumental Never Enough. Meanwhile, the title of Omi Palone, the opening track, draws from Polari, a clandestine gay language that came to prominence in the mid-20th century. \u201cI liked the idea of starting with this thing that existed before me, but is still a part of the community,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily still talk in Polari, but there\u2019s a kind of genetic link to how we share information and how we protect ourselves.\u201d Though Aids is a focal point, Agius was determined to uphold a sense of hope on the album.

      "body": "<h2>Ederson proves his value to City</h2> <p>After Ederson made several vital saves to deny Fulham \u2013 and particularly Adama Traor\u00e9 \u2013 Pep Guardiola revealed that summer interest from Saudi clubs for the Manchester City No 1 was never firmed up. \u201cHe knew from day one I didn\u2019t want it, we didn\u2019t want it,\u201d said the City manager. \u201cBut the offer didn\u2019t come \u2013 the real offer. Because they [Al-Nassr] made an offer, but for the keeper, for the team who won four Premier Leagues in a row, he has a value, a price. Otherwise, he cannot leave.\u201d Guardiola praised the Brazilian for regaining his focus after the uncertainty. \u201cEderson is so strong: in one second, he says: \u2018OK, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m going to do my best.\u2019\u201d Guardiola also believes the presence of Stefan Ortega has pushed his first-choice keeper. \u201cSometimes Ederson has to have the feeling that he has to perform well, otherwise Stefan can play. And this healthy competition, because they respect [each other] and have an incredible relationship, makes our team better.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/manchester-city-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City 3-2 Fulham</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>United need to click quickly</h2> <p>The interminable debate, of course, revolves around the future of Erik ten Hag. Manchester United\u2019s stalemate at Aston Villa was symptomatic of his reign, a result built entirely on moments, near-misses both for and against. Bruno Fernandes cracked a free-kick against the bar, Diogo Dalot turned his back and prevented Jaden Philogene from scoring what would probably have been a stoppage-time winner, and surely the end for Ten Hag. Afterwards the Dutchman clung to mild positives but mediocrity cannot wash much longer. The sight of big-money signings limbering up on the sidelines at Villa Park served to ram home the financial misspend. The pre-match focus centred on Jonny Evans, who turns 37 in January, keeping Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez out of the team but United\u2019s biggest concerns lie in attack, having scored five goals in seven matches. Joshua Zirkzee, who replaced Rasmus H\u00f8jlund midway through the second half, got one of those but the early evidence is the \u00a336.5m buy from Bologna is another poor signing. \u201cWe trust the players and one day it will click,\u201d Ten Hag said. United cannot wait much longer. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Aston Villa 0-0 Manchester United</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Saints have hope before crunch games</h2> <p>Southampton may have ended up losing both matches by the same scoreline but there was no doubt Russell Martin was much happier with his side\u2019s performance against Arsenal on Saturday than he had been five days earlier against Bournemouth. Cameron Archer briefly offered hope they could conjure a surprise first league win of the season at the Emirates before the Southampton defence was eventually overwhelmed. But with home fixtures against Leicester and Everton and away trips to Manchester City and Wolves to come after the international break, Martin acknowledged it was against the teams around them in the table that Southampton must improve. \u201cThe games that define us are coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have three of them in the next block of four games. We have to do better in those games.\u201d <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/arsenal-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal 3-1 Southampton</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Suspensions unlikely to hurt Chelsea</h2> <p>Enzo Maresca\u2019s blase reaction to two Chelsea players becoming the first in the Premier League to reach five bookings shows that disciplinary laws will always hurt the small clubs harder than the big ones. Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella will miss the trip to face Liverpool on 20 October after getting yellow cards in all bar two of the club\u2019s first seven games. But when you\u2019ve had a \u00a3220m investment on players and can afford to change your entire team after a tiring Conference League game, that sort of a sanction does not seem to hit as hard as it might. Maresca, after praising his players for their team spirit after they joined a 20-man brawl with Forest at Stamford Bridge, was relaxed about travelling to Anfield without two key men. \u201cWe have an international break to prepare and we will just use players who were not in the first XI,\u201d he said. <strong>Matthew Dunn</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/chelsea-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 1-1 Nottingham Forest</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Welbeck embodies sage Seagulls</h2> <p>Four years ago this month, the out-of-contract Danny Welbeck was signed to fill out a Brighton squad short on forwards. He reaches 34 next month and last played for England in 2018, but remains a player who has never let down managers ranging from Sir Alex Ferguson to Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, who is two years younger than him. Welbeck was never a pure marksman, but the intelligence of his running and link-up play made Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Roy Hodgson confirmed admirers. Brighton now benefit from his experience and continued adeptness in stretching play, adding coherence to their zippy forward line. He led the second-half revival that sank Spurs, scoring the winner. H\u00fcrzeler is a young manager but he appears not to fear having senior, older professionals around. Welbeck revealed that the non-playing veterans Jason Steele and James Milner had reminded their colleagues at half-time of the need to take the fight back to Tottenham. Welbeck then embodied that fight. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Brighton 3-2 Tottenham</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Pickford silences the boo-boys again</h2> <p>There were obvious targets for both sections of the crowd at Goodison Park, but while Anthony Gordon struggled in front of goal against his former club, Jordan Pickford thrived amid the usual Newcastle hostilities. There was a time when the Sunderland-born keeper would have risen to the bait but, as he said after Everton\u2019s first Premier League clean sheet of the season: \u201cI just crack on with my game. I learned from the past, I stay focused and I want to do my best for the badge. They can give me stick, I\u2019m only up the road from them.\u201d Pickford\u2019s penalty save from Gordon may have been the standout moment but there was a noticeable improvement in the Everton goalkeeper\u2019s command of his area in comparison with recent performances. In a defence again disrupted by injuries \u2013 in which the stand-ins James Garner and Michael Keane flourished \u2013 Pickford\u2019s sense of responsibility proved infectious. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/everton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 0-0 Newcastle</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Slot\u2019s machine making the right noises</h2> <p>The striking thing about Liverpool under Arne Slot is there have already been improvements made to various departments. Too often under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Liverpool would concede goals that took time and effort to recover from. Virgil van Dijk looks close to his best again and is no longer left so exposed, with Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 getting a long run beside him. Ryan Gravenberch looks like a stroller and pinpoint passer in the mould of John Barnes and Jan Molby, but with a modern physique suited to the pressing game. \u201cHe\u2019s tall, and he\u2019s strong in duels,\u201d noted Slot. Cody Gakpo supplied Diogo Jota\u2019s goal and is far more comfortable on the flanks than a central role. The downsides? In the tougher tests to come, the tempo may have to lift; Chelsea, Arsenal and City are unlikely to grant Slot\u2019s players so much time. And if Mohamed Salah has continued to score goals, his individualism \u2013 and wastefulness \u2013 can jar when compared with his teammates\u2019 embracing of the system. <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Hammers hit their attacking stride</h2> <p>Before Saturday\u2019s 4-1 victory over Ipswich, the goal output from West Ham\u2019s starting front four in their opening six Premier League games was one Jarrod Bowen strike and a Lucas Paquet\u00e1 penalty. Not quite the abundant yield expected under the new manager, Julen Lopetegui \u2013 but, aided by some woefully soft Ipswich defending, Saturday provided the first glimpse of the entertaining, expansive style the fans crave after the often tedious David Moyes era. The hosts\u2019 13 shots on target were their most in a Premier League game in the 19 years since records began, and all four attacking players \u2013 Michail Antonio, Mohammed Kudus, Bowen and Paquet\u00e1 \u2013 scored. With Niclas F\u00fcllkrug battling injury and Crysencio Summerville yet to fight his way into the reckoning since his summer move, it falls to a familiar quartet to deliver goals. They managed it against a side who will do well to stay up on this evidence; the Hammers\u2019 next two games, against Tottenham and Manchester United, will provide a tougher test. <strong>Ben Bloom</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/west-ham-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 4-1 Ipswich</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Cooper keeps it low-key after first win</h2> <p>After Steve Cooper recorded his first league win of the season, there was no grandstanding but rather, together with his Leicester players, a low-key lap of appreciation for the support of those in the stands. It is not even a fortnight since some fans directed their anger at Cooper after his side squeezed past Walsall in a Carabao Cup penalty shootout. While Cooper was in charge of Nottingham Forest, the sight of him punching the air after wins became commonplace. Victory against Bournemouth means Leicester enter the international break with the monkey off their back but Cooper knows more is required. \u201cI\u2019ve got to build trust here,\u201d the Welshman said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019ve got work to do in terms of people really believing in me. That\u2019s my real big motivation because it allows me to show how much I want to get this job right with this set of players who are so committed. I have got a lot of work to do here to really be the team we want, really be connected, and to become a force.\u201d <strong>BF</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/leicester-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Time ticking for O\u2019Neil at Molineux?</h2> <p>If Wolves failed the weekly test of Brentford\u2019s onslaught from the kick-off, conceding after 76 seconds, it got far, far worse after that. Their pain was largely self-inflicted, Mario Lemina ill-disciplined in fouling Nathan Collins for the penalty that put Brentford 2-1 up, while the defending that followed was hopeless. The rumbles of discontent that began when Wolves beat only Luton in their final 10 Premier League matches of last season became howls of insurrection against Gary O\u2019Neil as Brentford ran riot. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d chanted fans in the away end. \u201cCrazy, crazy goals we gave away,\u201d said the Wolves manger, echoing his words in August when Chelsea won 6-2 at Molineux. Underlying numbers and flashes of the residual talent within O\u2019Neil\u2019s squad seem unlikely to save him. No clean sheet in the league since February \u2013 against Sheffield United \u2013 is a stark statistic. \u201cNo idea,\u201d said O\u2019Neil on his future. \u201cAt some point, someone will tell me to stop and I will stop.\u201d <strong>JB</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/brentford-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford

      "bodyText": "Ederson proves his value to City After Ederson made several vital saves to deny Fulham \u2013 and particularly Adama Traor\u00e9 \u2013 Pep Guardiola revealed that summer interest from Saudi clubs for the Manchester City No 1 was never firmed up. \u201cHe knew from day one I didn\u2019t want it, we didn\u2019t want it,\u201d said the City manager. \u201cBut the offer didn\u2019t come \u2013 the real offer. Because they [Al-Nassr] made an offer, but for the keeper, for the team who won four Premier Leagues in a row, he has a value, a price. Otherwise, he cannot leave.\u201d Guardiola praised the Brazilian for regaining his focus after the uncertainty. \u201cEderson is so strong: in one second, he says: \u2018OK, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m going to do my best.\u2019\u201d Guardiola also believes the presence of Stefan Ortega has pushed his first-choice keeper. \u201cSometimes Ederson has to have the feeling that he has to perform well, otherwise Stefan can play. And this healthy competition, because they respect [each other] and have an incredible relationship, makes our team better.\u201d Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester City 3-2 Fulham United need to click quickly The interminable debate, of course, revolves around the future of Erik ten Hag. Manchester United\u2019s stalemate at Aston Villa was symptomatic of his reign, a result built entirely on moments, near-misses both for and against. Bruno Fernandes cracked a free-kick against the bar, Diogo Dalot turned his back and prevented Jaden Philogene from scoring what would probably have been a stoppage-time winner, and surely the end for Ten Hag. Afterwards the Dutchman clung to mild positives but mediocrity cannot wash much longer. The sight of big-money signings limbering up on the sidelines at Villa Park served to ram home the financial misspend. The pre-match focus centred on Jonny Evans, who turns 37 in January, keeping Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez out of the team but United\u2019s biggest concerns lie in attack, having scored five goals in seven matches. Joshua Zirkzee, who replaced Rasmus H\u00f8jlund midway through the second half, got one of those but the early evidence is the \u00a336.5m buy from Bologna is another poor signing. \u201cWe trust the players and one day it will click,\u201d Ten Hag said. United cannot wait much longer. Ben Fisher Match report: Aston Villa 0-0 Manchester United Saints have hope before crunch games Southampton may have ended up losing both matches by the same scoreline but there was no doubt Russell Martin was much happier with his side\u2019s performance against Arsenal on Saturday than he had been five days earlier against Bournemouth. Cameron Archer briefly offered hope they could conjure a surprise first league win of the season at the Emirates before the Southampton defence was eventually overwhelmed. But with home fixtures against Leicester and Everton and away trips to Manchester City and Wolves to come after the international break, Martin acknowledged it was against the teams around them in the table that Southampton must improve. \u201cThe games that define us are coming up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have three of them in the next block of four games. We have to do better in those games.\u201d Ed Aarons Match report: Arsenal 3-1 Southampton Suspensions unlikely to hurt Chelsea Enzo Maresca\u2019s blase reaction to two Chelsea players becoming the first in the Premier League to reach five bookings shows that disciplinary laws will always hurt the small clubs harder than the big ones. Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella will miss the trip to face Liverpool on 20 October after getting yellow cards in all bar two of the club\u2019s first seven games. But when you\u2019ve had a \u00a3220m investment on players and can afford to change your entire team after a tiring Conference League game, that sort of a sanction does not seem to hit as hard as it might. Maresca, after praising his players for their team spirit after they joined a 20-man brawl with Forest at Stamford Bridge, was relaxed about travelling to Anfield without two key men. \u201cWe have an international break to prepare and we will just use players who were not in the first XI,\u201d he said. Matthew Dunn Match report: Chelsea 1-1 Nottingham Forest Welbeck embodies sage Seagulls Four years ago this month, the out-of-contract Danny Welbeck was signed to fill out a Brighton squad short on forwards. He reaches 34 next month and last played for England in 2018, but remains a player who has never let down managers ranging from Sir Alex Ferguson to Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, who is two years younger than him. Welbeck was never a pure marksman, but the intelligence of his running and link-up play made Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Roy Hodgson confirmed admirers. Brighton now benefit from his experience and continued adeptness in stretching play, adding coherence to their zippy forward line. He led the second-half revival that sank Spurs, scoring the winner. H\u00fcrzeler is a young manager but he appears not to fear having senior, older professionals around. Welbeck revealed that the non-playing veterans Jason Steele and James Milner had reminded their colleagues at half-time of the need to take the fight back to Tottenham. Welbeck then embodied that fight. John Brewin Match report: Brighton 3-2 Tottenham Pickford silences the boo-boys again There were obvious targets for both sections of the crowd at Goodison Park, but while Anthony Gordon struggled in front of goal against his former club, Jordan Pickford thrived amid the usual Newcastle hostilities. There was a time when the Sunderland-born keeper would have risen to the bait but, as he said after Everton\u2019s first Premier League clean sheet of the season: \u201cI just crack on with my game. I learned from the past, I stay focused and I want to do my best for the badge. They can give me stick, I\u2019m only up the road from them.\u201d Pickford\u2019s penalty save from Gordon may have been the standout moment but there was a noticeable improvement in the Everton goalkeeper\u2019s command of his area in comparison with recent performances. In a defence again disrupted by injuries \u2013 in which the stand-ins James Garner and Michael Keane flourished \u2013 Pickford\u2019s sense of responsibility proved infectious. Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 0-0 Newcastle Slot\u2019s machine making the right noises The striking thing about Liverpool under Arne Slot is there have already been improvements made to various departments. Too often under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Liverpool would concede goals that took time and effort to recover from. Virgil van Dijk looks close to his best again and is no longer left so exposed, with Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 getting a long run beside him. Ryan Gravenberch looks like a stroller and pinpoint passer in the mould of John Barnes and Jan Molby, but with a modern physique suited to the pressing game. \u201cHe\u2019s tall, and he\u2019s strong in duels,\u201d noted Slot. Cody Gakpo supplied Diogo Jota\u2019s goal and is far more comfortable on the flanks than a central role. The downsides? In the tougher tests to come, the tempo may have to lift; Chelsea, Arsenal and City are unlikely to grant Slot\u2019s players so much time. And if Mohamed Salah has continued to score goals, his individualism \u2013 and wastefulness \u2013 can jar when compared with his teammates\u2019 embracing of the system. JB Match report: Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool Hammers hit their attacking stride Before Saturday\u2019s 4-1 victory over Ipswich, the goal output from West Ham\u2019s starting front four in their opening six Premier League games was one Jarrod Bowen strike and a Lucas Paquet\u00e1 penalty. Not quite the abundant yield expected under the new manager, Julen Lopetegui \u2013 but, aided by some woefully soft Ipswich defending, Saturday provided the first glimpse of the entertaining, expansive style the fans crave after the often tedious David Moyes era. The hosts\u2019 13 shots on target were their most in a Premier League game in the 19 years since records began, and all four attacking players \u2013 Michail Antonio, Mohammed Kudus, Bowen and Paquet\u00e1 \u2013 scored. With Niclas F\u00fcllkrug battling injury and Crysencio Summerville yet to fight his way into the reckoning since his summer move, it falls to a familiar quartet to deliver goals. They managed it against a side who will do well to stay up on this evidence; the Hammers\u2019 next two games, against Tottenham and Manchester United, will provide a tougher test. Ben Bloom Match report: West Ham 4-1 Ipswich Cooper keeps it low-key after first win After Steve Cooper recorded his first league win of the season, there was no grandstanding but rather, together with his Leicester players, a low-key lap of appreciation for the support of those in the stands. It is not even a fortnight since some fans directed their anger at Cooper after his side squeezed past Walsall in a Carabao Cup penalty shootout. While Cooper was in charge of Nottingham Forest, the sight of him punching the air after wins became commonplace. Victory against Bournemouth means Leicester enter the international break with the monkey off their back but Cooper knows more is required. \u201cI\u2019ve got to build trust here,\u201d the Welshman said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019ve got work to do in terms of people really believing in me. That\u2019s my real big motivation because it allows me to show how much I want to get this job right with this set of players who are so committed. I have got a lot of work to do here to really be the team we want, really be connected, and to become a force.\u201d BF Match report: Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Time ticking for O\u2019Neil at Molineux? If Wolves failed the weekly test of Brentford\u2019s onslaught from the kick-off, conceding after 76 seconds, it got far, far worse after that. Their pain was largely self-inflicted, Mario Lemina ill-disciplined in fouling Nathan Collins for the penalty that put Brentford 2-1 up, while the defending that followed was hopeless. The rumbles of discontent that began when Wolves beat only Luton in their final 10 Premier League matches of last season became howls of insurrection against Gary O\u2019Neil as Brentford ran riot. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d chanted fans in the away end. \u201cCrazy, crazy goals we gave away,\u201d said the Wolves manger, echoing his words in August when Chelsea won 6-2 at Molineux. Underlying numbers and flashes of the residual talent within O\u2019Neil\u2019s squad seem unlikely to save him. No clean sheet in the league since February \u2013 against Sheffield United \u2013 is a stark statistic. \u201cNo idea,\u201d said O\u2019Neil on his future. \u201cAt some point, someone will tell me to stop and I will stop.\u201d JB Match report: Brentford 5-3 Wolves",

The Ukrainian ambassador to the Holy See, Andrii Yurash, called it \u201cincredible news\u201d that \u201cUkraine received a cardinal\u201d. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference president, Perth archbishop Timothy Costelloe, congratulated Bychok, saying he had \u201cwon the affection and admiration not only of his own people but also of the bishops of Australia\u201d. \u201cAs we congratulate him on this new appointment we are reminded again of the terrible suffering of the people of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThis appointment will bring great joy to Ukrainian Catholics here in Australia and indeed throughout the world. We unite with them in praying for an end to the war in their homeland and for the establishment of a just peace.\u201d",

Bangkok and provinces in the central region of Thailand have also been warned of possible floods due to rising water levels in the Chao Phraya River. Residents in parts of Nonthaburi, which borders Bangkok, have been advised to move their belongings to higher grounds and use sandbags to protect their homes.",

Three years after spotting the job posting from the European Space Agency, McFall is now on track to become the world\u2019s first astronaut with a disability.</p> <p>After losing his right leg at the age of 19 following a motorcycle accident, the Briton went on to become a Paralympian sprinter, winning bronze in Beijing, and later becoming a<strong> </strong>trauma and orthopaedic surgeon.</p> <p>McFall threw himself into the agency\u2019s gruelling selection process, making it through the six stages that ranged from hours-long psychomotor tests to panel interviews. In 2022 the agency announced he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/23/paralympic-athlete-from-uk-in-latest-intake-of-esa-astronauts\">join them</a> in seeking to push the boundaries of space exploration by signing on to their years-long effort delving into whether someone with a physical disability can live and work in space.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said McFall, 43, in an interview. \u201cA common response is \u2018why hasn\u2019t this been done sooner?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no guarantee that McFall will get to go into space. Instead the agency has methodically been putting him through the requirements of a six-month mission to the International Space Station. \u201cWe have to provide data to demonstrate that it is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like people have said, \u2018you can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s not possible\u2019. It\u2019s more \u2018we don\u2019t doubt that this is possible, it\u2019s just that no one has done it\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>As space operations were designed for able-bodied people, the tests are aimed at exploring questions such as how McFall would move and stabilise himself in microgravity and how conditions in space would affect his prosthesis.</p> <p>So far, all signs have suggested that space flight is feasible for McFall, sparking hope that he \u2013 or someone with a similar disability \u2013 could eventually train for an upcoming mission. \u201cI would hope that between 2027 and the end of this decade, we\u2019ll see a European astronaut with a physical disability as part of the International Space Station crew.\u201d</p> <p>While the agency\u2019s findings are specific to McFall, part of the project\u2019s aim is to blaze a path so that others with disabilities \u2013 whether similar to McFall\u2019s or not \u2013 could potentially follow in his path.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re challenging the narrative surrounding physical disability,\u201d said McFall. \u201cAnd doing that creates discussion and breaks down stigma.\u201d</p> <p>That discussion includes the question of how exactly to refer to McFall. Since starting with the European Space Agency, he\u2019s sought to gently push back against the widely-used title of parastronaut. \u201cI think it\u2019s useful to have a conversation about it. What does it mean?\u201d McFall asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a para-surgeon, I\u2019m a surgeon. I\u2019m not a para-dad, I\u2019m a dad,\u201d he said, describing it as a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to add para in front of anything done by someone with a physical disability. \u201cAnd I think that if we continue to use it, it probably continues to create a divide, which isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a view that hints at the wider repercussions of his boundary-pushing efforts, which come as many with disabilities around the world continue to face deep discrimination. Data from across the EU suggests that people with disabilities <a href=\"https://www.edf-feph.org/publications/human-rights-report-2023-the-right-to-work/\">are more likely</a> to be unemployed and <a href=\"https://www.edf-feph.org/publications/european-human-rights-report-2/\">live</a> below the poverty line.</p> <p>In challenging people\u2019s perception of what an astronaut looks like, McFall is hoping to chip away at some of this. \u201cBy doing this, it\u2019s an opportunity to create more opportunities for people with disabilities in a number of different professional fields,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy job is to make sure people have a well-rounded and informed definition of disability and what being disabled means,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of 1950s, 1920s version of being disabled, you know?\u201d</p>",

In 2022 the agency announced he would join them in seeking to push the boundaries of space exploration by signing on to their years-long effort delving into whether someone with a physical disability can live and work in space. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said McFall, 43, in an interview. \u201cA common response is \u2018why hasn\u2019t this been done sooner?\u2019\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee that McFall will get to go into space. Instead the agency has methodically been putting him through the requirements of a six-month mission to the International Space Station. \u201cWe have to provide data to demonstrate that it is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like people have said, \u2018you can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s not possible\u2019. It\u2019s more \u2018we don\u2019t doubt that this is possible, it\u2019s just that no one has done it\u2019.\u201d As space operations were designed for able-bodied people, the tests are aimed at exploring questions such as how McFall would move and stabilise himself in microgravity and how conditions in space would affect his prosthesis. So far, all signs have suggested that space flight is feasible for McFall, sparking hope that he \u2013 or someone with a similar disability \u2013 could eventually train for an upcoming mission. \u201cI would hope that between 2027 and the end of this decade, we\u2019ll see a European astronaut with a physical disability as part of the International Space Station crew.\u201d While the agency\u2019s findings are specific to McFall, part of the project\u2019s aim is to blaze a path so that others with disabilities \u2013 whether similar to McFall\u2019s or not \u2013 could potentially follow in his path. \u201cWe\u2019re challenging the narrative surrounding physical disability,\u201d said McFall. \u201cAnd doing that creates discussion and breaks down stigma.\u201d That discussion includes the question of how exactly to refer to McFall. Since starting with the European Space Agency, he\u2019s sought to gently push back against the widely-used title of parastronaut. \u201cI think it\u2019s useful to have a conversation about it. What does it mean?\u201d McFall asked. \u201cI\u2019m not a para-surgeon, I\u2019m a surgeon. I\u2019m not a para-dad, I\u2019m a dad,\u201d he said, describing it as a \u201cslippery slope\u201d to add para in front of anything done by someone with a physical disability. \u201cAnd I think that if we continue to use it, it probably continues to create a divide, which isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d It\u2019s a view that hints at the wider repercussions of his boundary-pushing efforts, which come as many with disabilities around the world continue to face deep discrimination. Data from across the EU suggests that people with disabilities are more likely to be unemployed and live below the poverty line. In challenging people\u2019s perception of what an astronaut looks like, McFall is hoping to chip away at some of this. \u201cBy doing this, it\u2019s an opportunity to create more opportunities for people with disabilities in a number of different professional fields,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to make sure people have a well-rounded and informed definition of disability and what being disabled means,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of 1950s, 1920s version of being disabled, you know?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Not so long ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/30/rupert-everett-uncle-vanya-theatre-royal-bath\">Rupert Everett</a> was sitting outside Bar Italia in Frith Street in Soho when the conga line of Hare Krishnas that frequents this part of London appeared from around a corner, jingling their bells like \u201ctranscendental morris dancers\u201d. In days gone by, Everett would sometimes recognise a face en route to nirvana: \u201cclub world crashes\u201d of his acquaintance often repaired to the Krishnas\u2019 cafeteria, the better, as he puts it, to swap their methamphetamine for cucumber raita. But on this afternoon, he saw no one familiar until, just as the line was about to disappear again, he suddenly caught sight of a producer he\u2019d last seen at the London office of a Hollywood studio.</p> <p>\u201cRupert!\u201d exclaimed this man, tambourine in hand. And then: \u201cHare, hare, hare!\u201d \u2013 words that could hardly have been more doleful in context. The fellow in question, a straight white guy of a certain age, had been fired by the studio and, at a complete loss as to what to do next, had duly taken his place in this apricot-tinged, dhoti-wearing human caravan, eager to help broadcast its message of peace, love and saag aloo. Briefly, the two of them talked of a script of Everett\u2019s \u2013 it had been rejected by the same studio \u2013 and then the line moved off again, until it was only a \u201cswaying smudge\u201d heading towards Chinatown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His feeling for failure is a writerly gift, throwing a navy shadow over even his funniest and most scabrous lines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everett\u2019s account of this encounter appears at the beginning of his new book, and it\u2019s full of kindness, even tenderness (\u201coff he ran, backpack bouncing, tiny ankles in large trainers\u2026\u201d). At this point, you realise, his feeling for failure is a writerly gift, throwing a navy shadow over even his funniest and most scabrous lines, with the result that the reader may not know whether to laugh or to cry. But then, as anyone who has read his three memoirs will know, he\u2019s hardly a stranger to disappointment, its cruelty as familiar to the actor and director by now as wig glue and first-night nerves.</p> <p>He had the idea for his new book in the long moments after the Hare Krishnas passed by. Feeling somewhat on the scrapheap himself, it occurred to him that he might as well turn a few of the ideas he\u2019d pitched down the years \u2013 ideas that never got the green light \u2013 into short stories. But what is an \u201cAmerican no\u201d? The collection is named after a term, invented by a pal, for the emotionally evasive but nonetheless brutal way Hollywood types have with those who are in search of a commission. In the flesh, they love-bomb you, telling you how \u201cpsyched\u201d they are. Once you\u2019re safely elsewhere, however, you\u2019ll never hear from them again \u2013 the American no. As titles go, it\u2019s quite perfect. An uncanny bleakness rises from this book, one that brings to mind not only Scott Fitzgerald and Shirley Conran\u2019s <em>Lace</em>, but also the empty, agonising feeling of having been ghosted by a guy you <em>really</em> liked.</p> <p>It comprises seven stories and a script (the last of which, extraordinarily, is for a TV series based on Proust\u2019s <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>). One has to do with a Paris funeral gone badly wrong, another with a Russian countess, a third with the deathbed confession of a woman who upped and left for India in the 1850s. But the crazed masterpiece of the collection is a long story \u2013 almost a novella \u2013 called Cuddles and Associates, about a group of struggling actors in 80s Hollywood and what they\u2019ll do (anything!) to survive.

      "bodyText": "Not so long ago, Rupert Everett was sitting outside Bar Italia in Frith Street in Soho when the conga line of Hare Krishnas that frequents this part of London appeared from around a corner, jingling their bells like \u201ctranscendental morris dancers\u201d. In days gone by, Everett would sometimes recognise a face en route to nirvana: \u201cclub world crashes\u201d of his acquaintance often repaired to the Krishnas\u2019 cafeteria, the better, as he puts it, to swap their methamphetamine for cucumber raita. But on this afternoon, he saw no one familiar until, just as the line was about to disappear again, he suddenly caught sight of a producer he\u2019d last seen at the London office of a Hollywood studio. \u201cRupert!\u201d exclaimed this man, tambourine in hand. And then: \u201cHare, hare, hare!\u201d \u2013 words that could hardly have been more doleful in context. The fellow in question, a straight white guy of a certain age, had been fired by the studio and, at a complete loss as to what to do next, had duly taken his place in this apricot-tinged, dhoti-wearing human caravan, eager to help broadcast its message of peace, love and saag aloo. Briefly, the two of them talked of a script of Everett\u2019s \u2013 it had been rejected by the same studio \u2013 and then the line moved off again, until it was only a \u201cswaying smudge\u201d heading towards Chinatown. Everett\u2019s account of this encounter appears at the beginning of his new book, and it\u2019s full of kindness, even tenderness (\u201coff he ran, backpack bouncing, tiny ankles in large trainers\u2026\u201d). At this point, you realise, his feeling for failure is a writerly gift, throwing a navy shadow over even his funniest and most scabrous lines, with the result that the reader may not know whether to laugh or to cry. But then, as anyone who has read his three memoirs will know, he\u2019s hardly a stranger to disappointment, its cruelty as familiar to the actor and director by now as wig glue and first-night nerves. He had the idea for his new book in the long moments after the Hare Krishnas passed by. Feeling somewhat on the scrapheap himself, it occurred to him that he might as well turn a few of the ideas he\u2019d pitched down the years \u2013 ideas that never got the green light \u2013 into short stories. But what is an \u201cAmerican no\u201d? The collection is named after a term, invented by a pal, for the emotionally evasive but nonetheless brutal way Hollywood types have with those who are in search of a commission. In the flesh, they love-bomb you, telling you how \u201cpsyched\u201d they are. Once you\u2019re safely elsewhere, however, you\u2019ll never hear from them again \u2013 the American no. As titles go, it\u2019s quite perfect. An uncanny bleakness rises from this book, one that brings to mind not only Scott Fitzgerald and Shirley Conran\u2019s Lace, but also the empty, agonising feeling of having been ghosted by a guy you really liked. It comprises seven stories and a script (the last of which, extraordinarily, is for a TV series based on Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time). One has to do with a Paris funeral gone badly wrong, another with a Russian countess, a third with the deathbed confession of a woman who upped and left for India in the 1850s. But the crazed masterpiece of the collection is a long story \u2013 almost a novella \u2013 called Cuddles and Associates, about a group of struggling actors in 80s Hollywood and what they\u2019ll do (anything!) to survive. If Netflix doesn\u2019t turn it into six episodes, there\u2019s no justice. Think Succession, only with agents and the threat of straight-to-video hanging over everything like LA smog. In the end, though, I didn\u2019t read The American No for these stories so much as for the bursts of pure Everett, revealed as he introduces each one. Here he is talking to John Schlesinger about what went on in a certain hotel room during the filming of Midnight Cowboy (\u201cI was in heaven\u201d); and here he is fighting for the rights to Graham Greene\u2019s Travels With My Aunt (\u201ceach time I inquire of the hard-headed agent I get the same rebuff, while she distributes Greene\u2019s work with abandon for interesting reinterpretations \u2013 I\u2019m being polite \u2013 like Brighton Rock\u201d). My love for Everett\u2019s books is hardly a secret (I\u2019m quoted praising him, I notice, on the jacket of this new book and I\u2019m wondering if I can somehow parlay this into an intense new friendship).

      "bodyText": "When Dr Ammar Darwish went to Gaza in January 2024 as a volunteer medic, his team narrowly escaped an Israeli airstrike on their accommodation. By the time he returned in August, the level of destruction, the severity of patient injuries and the lack of essentials in the territory had significantly worsened. \u201cGaza is one of the worst missions that I\u2019ve done, especially this time around. It has affected me and affected the whole team,\u201d said Darwish, a general and major trauma surgeon from Manchester who has also worked in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. \u201cSaving one life is a good enough reason to go back,\u201d said Darwish, who returned from a volunteer mission with Medical Aid for Palestine (MAP) in Gaza last month. Nearly a year into the war \u2013 which began after the 7 October assault by Hamas militants on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians \u2013 the Guardian spoke to volunteer healthcare workers from the UK who had travelled to Gaza in recent months. They called on the British government to evacuate patients, apply pressure for an immediate ceasefire, and push for the opening of aid corridors as essential supplies remain at the Egyptian border. At overcrowded hospitals, medics report operating without essentials such as surgical gowns and gauze. Malnutrition is also a huge problem, according to doctors, along with worsening sanitation and the limited access to water. Polio vaccinations started last month but a brutal reality, Darwish said, is that some of the children being vaccinated will be seen as casualties in the evening. \u201cI really cannot imagine how things will become in two months\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter what I\u2019ve seen there, I would really ask our UK government, our prime minister, to push forward and put pressure on all sides to have an immediate permanent ceasefire [and] to allow medical aid. \u201cAnd also to protect civilians, and protect medics and medical facilities. They\u2019re unprotected, they\u2019re unsafe.\u201d A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: \u201cA resolution to this conflict, the release of all hostages still cruelly detained by Hamas, better protection for civilians, aid and medical workers, and much more aid entering Gaza has been a priority since day one of this government.\u201d Dr Ana Jeelani, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon from Liverpool who travelled to Gaza\u2019s al-Aqsa hospital in March, says the government has failed to recognise the \u201cactual concerns that we have as humanitarian aid workers\u201d. Jeelani said the UK had failed to take a single patient from Gaza. The United Arab Emirates, Spain and the European Union have evacuated severely sick and injured patients, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). \u201cI work in a trust that openly accepted Ukrainian refugees and provided them cancer care, NHS care, and we have been told that we cannot accept patients from Gaza because the government have not allowed this,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can we be a developed country and not allow a single patient into our hospitals when there is such a massive man-made catastrophe happening?\u201d Aid and health workers account for at least 765 of the more than 41,000 people killed in Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, according to the WHO and the Palestinian health ministry. Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, 32 are damaged and 17 are partially functioning, according to the WHO. Hospitals have been battlegrounds since the start of the Israeli offensive. The IDF, which has been approached for comment, previously said Hamas \u201csystematically\u201d uses hospitals and medical centres to conduct terror activities. Hamas denies the claims. With trucks loaded with life-saving essentials in a backlog of lorries unable to enter from Egypt, aid groups have warned more than a million people in Gaza will not have enough food this month. In September, 1,386 humanitarian trucks entered Gaza according to Unrwa data, largely through the Erez crossing, compared with 3,096 trucks in August and 4,681 trucks in July. Dr Yassar Qureshi, an oesophago-gastric cancer and general surgeon from London, who travelled to Gaza in April with MAP, said: \u201cThere were plenty of patients who simply died because we didn\u2019t have appropriate specialists or medications or equipment.\u201d Working at al-Aqsa hospital, Qureshi described operating on patients who would days later return to the operating theatre with worsened conditions as a result of malnutrition. \u201cYou go in with high hopes of helping people and saving lives, but the reality is that actually, we\u2019re just prolonging the misery.

      "body": "<p>This tale of two islands \u2013 and a city \u2013 was not the usual Croatian island-hopping experience, say, from Split to Hvar and Bra\u010d. I set out to enjoy a quieter, more laid-back alternative farther north, where the overlooked city of \u0160ibenik is the jumping-off point to a very different side of the Adriatic.</p> <p>First there\u2019s \u0160ibenik itself, which is still relatively devoid of the crowds you see in Croatia\u2019s other coastal cities. Here you naturally gravitate towards the magnificent Unesco-listed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0ibenik_Cathedral\">St James Cathedral</a> before checking out the cafe terraces on the Riva waterfront and the bars beside the fishing boats moored further up the quayside. Medieval <a href=\"https://www.tvrdjava-kulture.hr/en/home/\">St Michael\u2019s Fortress</a> and its 17th-century Venetian neighbours, St John\u2019s and Barone, loom over the city, the latter two built to protect against Ottoman attacks. They have all been transformed into important cultural institutions \u2013 St Michael\u2019s into an amphitheatre for concerts, <a href=\"https://www.tvrdjava-kulture.hr/en/st-johns-fortress/plan-your-visit/\">St John\u2019s</a> an educational centre and cafe and <a href=\"https://www.tvrdjava-kulture.hr/en/barone-fortress/plan-your-visit/\">Barone</a> an open-air cinema with augmented-reality displays. Views of the city became even more impressive the higher I climbed to each fortress.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/embed-1-zip/giv-4559rpnKrtD1oJBe/\" data-alt=\"Croatia map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/embed-1-zip/giv-4559rpnKrtD1oJBe/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It was fear of the Ottoman Turks that led many \u0160iben\u010dani to flee to the islands beyond St Anthony\u2019s channel, which shelters the city from the Adriatic Sea. Nowadays, it\u2019s a more carefree \u2013 and car-free \u2013 experience here in the \u0160ibenik archipelago. After a night in the city, I took the 25-minute <a href=\"https://www.jadrolinija.hr/en\">Jadrolinija</a> ferry to Zlarin, one of the archipelago\u2019s six inhabited islands and measuring all of 3 square miles. Zlarin village, curving round the bijou port, is the only one on the island, and cars have been banned for decades (apart from the fire brigade, the occasional builder\u2019s van and, during our visit, a Zagreb film crew making a children\u2019s movie). Otherwise, it\u2019s golf buggies, bicycles and the odd scooter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Zlarin village, curving round the bijou port, is the only village on the island, and cars have been banned for decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are no hotels either, just private flats and houses whose owners wait at the jetty in their golf carts to lift you and your luggage. They included Karla and Nik\u0161a, whose airy apartment we were renting. It had a large terrace above the western side of the V-shaped bay and a tumbling garden overflowing with pomegranate, fig and olive trees. It didn\u2019t take long to fall in love with the view of that vividly blue sea, terracotta rooftops and deep green of the Aleppo pines that cover most of the island.</p>    <p>When I had briefly docked here a few months ago on a sailing trip, I felt I hadn\u2019t seen enough of either Zlarin or its tinier neighbour, Prvi\u0107. Something about these small island communities intrigued me, especially this pair with their unusual histories, natural beauty and the sort of mellow lifestyle I wanted to savour at the tail end of summer.</p> <p>Zlarin had all the requisites for a lazy island escape: a little harbour with fishing boats, sailboats and speedboats, including one transporting a vital supply of O\u017eujsko beer. Two of Zlarin\u2019s handful of bars were right by the jetty where the ferry and boat excursions from \u0160ibenik docked, making the village gently fizz with daytrippers gossiping over coffee in the sunshine. Pebbly beaches ran along the eastern side of the bay, whose clear waters were 24C in September, as were those off the beach outside our flat where I had my morning swim. Those carless roads made hiking a breeze, including a 40-minute walk to the northern coast\u2019s secluded Boci cove. And the restaurants, particularly <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/konobaaldura/?locale=en_GB\">Konoba Aldura</a> in the port and Restoran Prslika higher up in the village, served superior seafood in suitably rustic settings of chunky wooden tables and exposed stone walls.</p> <p>Along the harbour and tucked into lanes were attractive 19th-century stone houses, and it was in the 1820s home of the <a href=\"https://hckz.hr/en/o-hrvatskom-centru-koralja-zlarin-english/\">Croatian Coral Centre</a> that I learned more about why Zlarin was more than just a pleasantly sleepy island.

      "bodyText": "This tale of two islands \u2013 and a city \u2013 was not the usual Croatian island-hopping experience, say, from Split to Hvar and Bra\u010d. I set out to enjoy a quieter, more laid-back alternative farther north, where the overlooked city of \u0160ibenik is the jumping-off point to a very different side of the Adriatic. First there\u2019s \u0160ibenik itself, which is still relatively devoid of the crowds you see in Croatia\u2019s other coastal cities. Here you naturally gravitate towards the magnificent Unesco-listed St James Cathedral before checking out the cafe terraces on the Riva waterfront and the bars beside the fishing boats moored further up the quayside. Medieval St Michael\u2019s Fortress and its 17th-century Venetian neighbours, St John\u2019s and Barone, loom over the city, the latter two built to protect against Ottoman attacks. They have all been transformed into important cultural institutions \u2013 St Michael\u2019s into an amphitheatre for concerts, St John\u2019s an educational centre and cafe and Barone an open-air cinema with augmented-reality displays. Views of the city became even more impressive the higher I climbed to each fortress. It was fear of the Ottoman Turks that led many \u0160iben\u010dani to flee to the islands beyond St Anthony\u2019s channel, which shelters the city from the Adriatic Sea. Nowadays, it\u2019s a more carefree \u2013 and car-free \u2013 experience here in the \u0160ibenik archipelago. After a night in the city, I took the 25-minute Jadrolinija ferry to Zlarin, one of the archipelago\u2019s six inhabited islands and measuring all of 3 square miles. Zlarin village, curving round the bijou port, is the only one on the island, and cars have been banned for decades (apart from the fire brigade, the occasional builder\u2019s van and, during our visit, a Zagreb film crew making a children\u2019s movie). Otherwise, it\u2019s golf buggies, bicycles and the odd scooter. There are no hotels either, just private flats and houses whose owners wait at the jetty in their golf carts to lift you and your luggage. They included Karla and Nik\u0161a, whose airy apartment we were renting. It had a large terrace above the western side of the V-shaped bay and a tumbling garden overflowing with pomegranate, fig and olive trees. It didn\u2019t take long to fall in love with the view of that vividly blue sea, terracotta rooftops and deep green of the Aleppo pines that cover most of the island. When I had briefly docked here a few months ago on a sailing trip, I felt I hadn\u2019t seen enough of either Zlarin or its tinier neighbour, Prvi\u0107. Something about these small island communities intrigued me, especially this pair with their unusual histories, natural beauty and the sort of mellow lifestyle I wanted to savour at the tail end of summer. Zlarin had all the requisites for a lazy island escape: a little harbour with fishing boats, sailboats and speedboats, including one transporting a vital supply of O\u017eujsko beer. Two of Zlarin\u2019s handful of bars were right by the jetty where the ferry and boat excursions from \u0160ibenik docked, making the village gently fizz with daytrippers gossiping over coffee in the sunshine. Pebbly beaches ran along the eastern side of the bay, whose clear waters were 24C in September, as were those off the beach outside our flat where I had my morning swim. Those carless roads made hiking a breeze, including a 40-minute walk to the northern coast\u2019s secluded Boci cove. And the restaurants, particularly Konoba Aldura in the port and Restoran Prslika higher up in the village, served superior seafood in suitably rustic settings of chunky wooden tables and exposed stone walls. Along the harbour and tucked into lanes were attractive 19th-century stone houses, and it was in the 1820s home of the Croatian Coral Centre that I learned more about why Zlarin was more than just a pleasantly sleepy island. For centuries, its men had harvested red coral, providing the means to build those lovely stone houses and turning tiny Zlarin into Croatia\u2019s biggest coral producer. But, as the imaginative multimedia displays showed, it wasn\u2019t environmental concerns that led to the end of Zlarin\u2019s trade in the 1970s. The Italians, the biggest buyers, had stumbled upon their own supply of coral near Sicily and business dried up. Tourism has stepped in since then, swelling the usual population of fewer than 300 people to nearly 10 times that in high season. On this quiet September weekend, however, Zlarin was as tranquil as I\u2019d hoped. Too soon, though, it was time to take another 25-minute ferry north to Prvi\u0107. About a third the size of Zlarin, Prvi\u0107 squeezes in two villages, Prvi\u0107 Luka and \u0160epurine, and a population closer to 400, but there\u2019s still room for countless olive, pomegranate and fig trees among the Aleppo pines and cypresses.

Cars aren\u2019t allowed here either, so people buzz about on mini-tractors and three-wheeled Piaggio Apes as well as golf carts and bikes. Our flat in \u0160epurine was in one of those picture-perfect, blue-shuttered houses overlooking the village square and fishing port. The nearest of the island\u2019s many pebbly beaches was four minutes away, and there were a healthy number of bars and restaurants, including the popular Konoba Bare next door, creating a cheerful bustle.

      "body": "<p>I began to write this column last week in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. I started it several times, both on the page and in my head, as I travelled between occupied territories. In every location I started the column again, then failed to capture what is unfolding and has been for years. So maybe I will just start at what seems like the beginning, with the killing of Israeli civilians on<strong> </strong>7<strong> </strong>October \u2013 a year ago today.</p> <p>I say \u201cseems\u201d, because that is not really the beginning, but just another beginning as far as Palestinians are concerned. Another date after which conditions worsened and occupation and illegal settlements became more brutal. Because as the world\u2019s attention has rightly been on Gaza \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/30/with-gaza-in-ruins-and-lebanon-under-siege-what-defence-remains-for-israels-actions\">then Lebanon</a>, then, last week, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/02/this-terrifying-tit-for-tat-between-israel-iran-and-its-proxies-will-only-bring-more-death-and-disaster\">escalating conflict between Iran and Israel</a> \u2013 Israeli authorities and settlers have, under cover of war, intensified their assault on Palestinians with renewed licence and relish. Again, that summation seems inadequate, a poor attempt at describing a reality that is nothing short of a living nightmare. The violation of Palestinians is so colossal in scale that I began to speak to the readers of this column in my head. I kept saying: I wish you could see.</p> <p>I wish you could see parts of the old city of Hebron, its historic streets and markets emptied, its buildings crumbling, its paths blocked to Palestinians since before 7 October. Palestinians are not allowed to walk on those roads, but settlers can, with machine guns casually hoisted over their shoulders. Israeli soldiers protect them on the ground, at checkpoints and from turrets. They man a giant and expanding settlement that bears down on the populace below, over a community that has been ejected from shops and family homes without explanation or notice. Even more traders have been expelled in the past year, and the new stalls they set up are empty. Shoppers have been scared off by the guns and soldiers. Fear and expulsion leads people to vacate areas into which the occupying forces then expand.</p> <p>I wish you could see the Palestinian man in Silwan, East Jerusalem, living next to the rubble of the home in which he was born. In February, his house was demolished by Israeli authorities for not having a building \u201clicence\u201d, even though the house was built before East Jerusalem was even under Israeli authorities. The bulldozer came with a canine unit and armed enforcers, who manhandled and shoved his elderly wife into the walls as they dragged them out of the property. He pleaded with them to retrieve one picture, the only one he had, of him and his mother. Instead, it was taken and shattered on the ground before him. <a href=\"https://imemc.org/article/israel-orders-demolition-of-37-homes-commercial-structures-in-silwan/\">Thirty-seven houses</a> in the area have been demolished since 7 October. When the homeowners leave, settlers, of which there are now a growing number in Silwan, move in. Those settlers were celebrating the holidays last week, the butts of the fathers\u2019 rifles at the eye level of toddlers who skipped through the streets that had been closed to Palestinian traffic for the day.</p> <p>I wish you could see the rocky desert hamlets of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/west-bank-palestinian-villages-israeli-army-settlers\">Masafer Yatta</a>, which in the past year have suffered increasing violence as residents have been attacked, their homes raided and their livestock stolen by frontier settlers who can only be described as rabid. Just the sight of settlers walking down a hill path sets off panic, and warnings are sent to others to stay put or seek a different route in case they are attacked. Some of the villages are about 5,000 years old. Those that have not been emptied over the past decade are damaged and cut off, forced to go without water, electricity or paved roads. When one small community erected solar panels, they were torn down by the settlers, from whom there is no legal protection. Often, one village elder told me, the police who are called in are settlers themselves \u2013 they are the \u201cjudge and the soldier and the police officer\u201d.</p> <p>I wish you could see the giant white boulders and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sakiyaorg/?hl=en\">painstakingly restored</a> historic homes, canals and graves of mystics in the hilltops of Ein Qiniya.

      "bodyText": "I began to write this column last week in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. I started it several times, both on the page and in my head, as I travelled between occupied territories. In every location I started the column again, then failed to capture what is unfolding and has been for years. So maybe I will just start at what seems like the beginning, with the killing of Israeli civilians on 7 October \u2013 a year ago today. I say \u201cseems\u201d, because that is not really the beginning, but just another beginning as far as Palestinians are concerned. Another date after which conditions worsened and occupation and illegal settlements became more brutal. Because as the world\u2019s attention has rightly been on Gaza \u2013 then Lebanon, then, last week, the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel \u2013 Israeli authorities and settlers have, under cover of war, intensified their assault on Palestinians with renewed licence and relish. Again, that summation seems inadequate, a poor attempt at describing a reality that is nothing short of a living nightmare. The violation of Palestinians is so colossal in scale that I began to speak to the readers of this column in my head. I kept saying: I wish you could see. I wish you could see parts of the old city of Hebron, its historic streets and markets emptied, its buildings crumbling, its paths blocked to Palestinians since before 7 October. Palestinians are not allowed to walk on those roads, but settlers can, with machine guns casually hoisted over their shoulders. Israeli soldiers protect them on the ground, at checkpoints and from turrets. They man a giant and expanding settlement that bears down on the populace below, over a community that has been ejected from shops and family homes without explanation or notice. Even more traders have been expelled in the past year, and the new stalls they set up are empty. Shoppers have been scared off by the guns and soldiers. Fear and expulsion leads people to vacate areas into which the occupying forces then expand. I wish you could see the Palestinian man in Silwan, East Jerusalem, living next to the rubble of the home in which he was born. In February, his house was demolished by Israeli authorities for not having a building \u201clicence\u201d, even though the house was built before East Jerusalem was even under Israeli authorities. The bulldozer came with a canine unit and armed enforcers, who manhandled and shoved his elderly wife into the walls as they dragged them out of the property. He pleaded with them to retrieve one picture, the only one he had, of him and his mother. Instead, it was taken and shattered on the ground before him. Thirty-seven houses in the area have been demolished since 7 October. When the homeowners leave, settlers, of which there are now a growing number in Silwan, move in. Those settlers were celebrating the holidays last week, the butts of the fathers\u2019 rifles at the eye level of toddlers who skipped through the streets that had been closed to Palestinian traffic for the day. I wish you could see the rocky desert hamlets of Masafer Yatta, which in the past year have suffered increasing violence as residents have been attacked, their homes raided and their livestock stolen by frontier settlers who can only be described as rabid. Just the sight of settlers walking down a hill path sets off panic, and warnings are sent to others to stay put or seek a different route in case they are attacked. Some of the villages are about 5,000 years old. Those that have not been emptied over the past decade are damaged and cut off, forced to go without water, electricity or paved roads. When one small community erected solar panels, they were torn down by the settlers, from whom there is no legal protection. Often, one village elder told me, the police who are called in are settlers themselves \u2013 they are the \u201cjudge and the soldier and the police officer\u201d. I wish you could see the giant white boulders and painstakingly restored historic homes, canals and graves of mystics in the hilltops of Ein Qiniya. They are overlooked by large settlements beaming bright white lights through the night. Attached to these lights are machine guns. The settlers regularly make the hike up to the historic site with their children in a sort of pilgrimage of hate. A witness told me they goad their children to break and smash what they can, initiating them into the tradition of the holy work of removing Palestinians from a location that is the site of precious structures and trees that predate even monotheism. Along with such violent efforts at ethnic cleansing, I wish you could see the conditions in which those communities live. In the West Bank, the prison population has swelled over the past year, doubling to almost 10,000 people, about 250 of whom are children. One-third of these prisoners are under \u201cadministrative detention\u201d, a sentence that can be renewed indefinitely without charge, legal representation or family visitation. I wish you could see how even time belongs to the Israeli government, as it shuts checkpoints and roads without notice or explanation, as it did after the Iranian missile attack, stopping people from moving through occupied territories. These barriers block or kettle people on a whim, leaving them with no choice but to change plans, find new routes to their destination, or remain stuck. Among all of this, millions of Palestinians still live a life that is insistently fuller than can be humanly expected under such conditions, a life both banal and miraculous in its normality. But it is squeezed at the edges by a constant and building pressure. And all of that is only the blunt edges of occupation. I wish you could see it all, but really, what more do we need to see beyond what is happening at the sharpest end in Gaza? The problem isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t know, but that so little changes despite our knowledge. All the tools at the disposal of those who want the world to act \u2013 journalism, protests, outcry and outrage \u2013 cannot end this catastrophe, nor even capture its gravity. It did not start with the tragedy of 7 October. And it will not end, not only for Palestinians, but also for those Israelis who have been corrupted by entitlement and impunity. Until those who have the power to determine who deserves to live in safety and dignity understand that you cannot deny those rights to Palestinians and expect them to underwrite peace and stability by submitting to their fate as subhuman, this will not end.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. A year ago today, Hamas launched a brutal surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people. A further 251 were taken hostage.</p> <p>At about 6.30am on 7 October 2023, the last day of the Jewish holy day of Shabbat and the holiday of Simchat Torah, a barrage of rockets was launched from Gaza into Israel. Thousands of armed men then entered Israeli territory, in what Hamas called Operation al-Aqsa Flood, to launch the most deadly attack in Israel\u2019s history.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch, an international NGO, found that the militia group targeted at least 19 kibbutzim and five moshavim (cooperative communities), the cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals and a beach party, and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/17/october-7-crimes-against-humanity-war-crimes-hamas-led-groups\">concluded in a report</a> that Hamas-led groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity towards civilians during the assault. There was unified international condemnation.</p> <p>The magnitude of the massacre and the scale of the brutality came as a tremendous shock to Israeli society, which has still not recovered. After 7 October, Israel launched a bloody war on Gaza that has killed 41,500 Palestinians and continues today.</p> <p>As Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, wrote: \u201cThe Hamas assault forever changed the region and the world. Its consequences are yet to fully unfold or be understood.\u201d For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with <em><strong>journalist Ruth Michaelson</strong></em> about 7 October and the war on Gaza that has followed.

Tens of thousands of Israelis remain displaced. And while half of the hostages were released during a short ceasefire in November, 70 are dead (the remains of 33 of the deceased are still in Gaza). Israel believes 64 are still alive in captivity. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to capture the gravity of that day and how much people were just completely engulfed by shock, trauma and fear,\u201d Ruth says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A lack of safety</strong></p> <p>The 7 October attack was a \u201csingular event\u201d for Israeli society, she says. The massacre shattered a sense of security that had built up in Israeli society over the past three decades of relative peace. \u201cAll of a sudden, the public felt vulnerable to what they saw as threats from outside and that will take a very long time to go away, if it ever will,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>The attack \u201cbroke a fundamental social contract the Israeli citizens had with their government\u201d, Ruth says, which they felt failed to anticipate Hamas\u2019s operation and reacted inadequately to the attack once it had started. Israelis expected immediate help from the military or police if something like this were to ever happen \u2013 instead<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-04-24/ty-article-magazine/.premium/how-could-israels-army-abandon-this-kibbutz-for-seven-hours-on-october-7/0000018f-0076-db42-a99f-adff41440000\"> the response was terrifyingly slow</a>. The reports and inquiries since have highlighted the array of operational and intelligence lapses that led to such an inadequate response, which has only further degraded the sense of trust between the public and the state.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The fate of the hostages</strong></p> <p>Though there is disagreement about the best way to free those still held captive in Gaza, the fate of the hostages has been a steadfastly unifying issue in Israel.</p> <p>Initially, families and loved ones of the hostages were careful not to be critical of the government, which they wanted to keep on side. That relationship has fundamentally changed in the past year, as they have become increasingly vocal in criticising the government for not prioritising the return of their loved ones. This discontent turned into regular protests, which melded with an anti-government movement that existed before 7 October.</p> <p>A significant section of Israeli society has been shocked by what they see as an unwillingness from the government to prioritise civilian lives over continuing the war in Gaza. Reports of further hostage deaths in August prompted an outcry for the government to do more to bring home those still trapped.</p> <p>Many now believe that Benjamin Netanyahu is prioritising his own political future over the safety of the hostages. While the country remains at war, his position as prime minister remains untouchable. Earlier this year, Ruth spoke to a woman who has two brothers-in-law who are still being held in Gaza, and she said she believes that \u201cNetanyahu is fine with them coming home in body bags\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Deepening divisions</strong></p>    <p>Before the attack, Israel was a divided country, and these divisions have deepened. \u201cIsrael is a deeply traumatised society, without question,\u201d Ruth says. Israelis have been living in a war economy for the past year, the cost of living is through the roof, and a new generation has been involved in active conflict.</p> <p>In the extremist ultranationalist and settler movements, the 7 October attack is viewed as confirmation of their worldview and an endorsement of their methods. \u201cSettlers view settlement as security, and so, in their eyes, they have to increase claiming land and displacing Palestinians from that land,\u201d Ruth says. These views have become more entrenched, emboldened and extreme, with some within the movement pushing an agenda to resettle Gaza. <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-calls-to-encourage-emigration-resettle-gaza-at-ultra-nationalist-rally/\">During an ultranationalist march earlier this year, </a>cabinet ministers called for the rebuilding of Jewish settlements in the region.</p> <p>\u201cThe gap between the ultranationalists and settlers \u2013 who see all of this as an endorsement of their extremist viewpoint \u2013 and the more liberal Israelis \u2013 who were already deeply concerned by the changes that Netanyahu has made to their country \u2013 is only going to get wider,\u201d Ruth says.</p> <p>These schisms are not just political \u2013 they represent a significant difference of opinion on how Israeli society should respond to a shock of this kind. \u201cThe solution for some is to get rid of Netanyahu and to have a different government. The solution for others is a continuation of the war. It is a fundamentally divided set of perspectives on what needs to happen next,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The war in Gaza</strong></p> <p>Gaza has experienced periods of intense violence in the past and life in the territory has long been difficult for Palestinians because of Israel\u2019s blockade. But the devastation that has been wrought on the strip in reaction to the 7 October attack is unprecedented.</p> <p>\u201cThe fear is that Gaza has been destroyed in a way that is permanent,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cGaza has endured bombardment and war before and has managed to rebuild, but this destruction is not just of the physical structures, it is also of the social fabric.\u201d</p> <p>By this, she is referring to the destruction of universities, places of worship, hospitals and schools \u2013 the places that create a functioning society. Where they once stood, there is now just rubble. Those who have lived in Gaza their whole life are not only unable to live in it safely any more, they cannot even recognise which street they are standing on. An Associated Press investigation in June found at least <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-palestinians-families-israel-war-deaths-a9f8bcfe402c17f1f78903eae67b7a7d\">60 Palestinian families who had lost at least 25 people</a> \u2013 sometimes four generations from the same bloodline \u2013 in bombings between October and December alone. This kind of killing has left a rupture in the social fabric of Gaza.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/02/dozens-killed-in-israeli-strikes-and-ground-operations-in-southern-gaza\">41,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed since 7 October according to local health authorities, 11,355 of whom were children. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/idf-airstrike-gaza-school-nuseirat-refugee-shelter-six-un-unrwa-workers-among-dead#:~:text=An%20estimated%2090%25%20of%20people,to%20try%20to%20stay%20alive.&amp;text=Israel%20said%20the%20strike%20targeted,not%20provide%20evidence%20or%20details.\">90% of the population</a> is estimated to be displaced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/we-cannot-protect-our-children-parents-in-gaza-face-new-threat-of-polio#:~:text=About%2090%25%20of%20the%202.3,already%20rife%2C%20the%20WHO%20said.\">Disease</a> is rampant. <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154001#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20people%20experiencing%20catastrophic%20hunger%20has%20surged%20more,by%20the%20UN%20on%20Thursday.\">V\u00edctor Aguayo, UNICEF Director of Child Nutrition, </a>described the situation in Gaza as one of the most severe food and nutrition crises in history. <a href=\"https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports-briefs/untangling-the-reality-of-famine-in-gaza/\">Refugees International </a>found that the \u201cebbs and flows in hunger conditions are closely linked to Israeli government restrictions and concessions on aid access, and to the conduct of the Israeli military\u201d.</p> <p>Outside Gaza, there is also a sense that the rules of engagement have changed in the other occupied territories. During her reporting, Ruth found that there was even more willingness to use lethal force against Palestinian civilians, including children, during night raids and at checkpoints. \u201cPalestinians talk about adaptability and resilience in the face of tragedy, but I think this war has absolutely tested the limits of that,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cThis is a level of loss that people from Gaza are struggling to comprehend and there is a sense from displaced people that I\u2019ve spoken that there is nothing to return back to for them.\u201d</p> <p>Violence has now spread far beyond Israel\u2019s borders, beyond Gaza, to Lebanon, Syria and Iran. One year on, it is clear the 7 October attack and the Israeli reaction to it will scar the Middle East for many years to come.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/time-stopped-here-on-7-october-life-in-kibbutz-that-endured-unimaginable-loss-one-year-ago\">Bethan McKernan </a>visited <strong>Nir Oz Kibbutz</strong> and spoke to one resident about the profound loss his community has endured and how it has been irrevocably changed since the attack on 7 October.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/daughter-hostage-hamas-family-pain-and-trauma-sharone-lifschitz\">Neha Gohil interviewed </a>Sharone Lifschitz, whose <strong>parents were taken hostage</strong> by Hamas.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. A year ago today, Hamas launched a brutal surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people. A further 251 were taken hostage. At about 6.30am on 7 October 2023, the last day of the Jewish holy day of Shabbat and the holiday of Simchat Torah, a barrage of rockets was launched from Gaza into Israel. Thousands of armed men then entered Israeli territory, in what Hamas called Operation al-Aqsa Flood, to launch the most deadly attack in Israel\u2019s history. Human Rights Watch, an international NGO, found that the militia group targeted at least 19 kibbutzim and five moshavim (cooperative communities), the cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals and a beach party, and concluded in a report that Hamas-led groups committed numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity towards civilians during the assault. There was unified international condemnation. The magnitude of the massacre and the scale of the brutality came as a tremendous shock to Israeli society, which has still not recovered. After 7 October, Israel launched a bloody war on Gaza that has killed 41,500 Palestinians and continues today. As Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, wrote: \u201cThe Hamas assault forever changed the region and the world. Its consequences are yet to fully unfold or be understood.\u201d For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke with journalist Ruth Michaelson about 7 October and the war on Gaza that has followed. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Politics | Sue Gray has resigned from her position as Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff after finding herself at the centre of a political storm since Labour came into power. Gray will be replaced by Morgan McSweeney, the party\u2019s election guru who masterminded Starmer\u2019s succession from Jeremy Corbyn, and with whom Gray is said to have found herself at odds in government. Local councils | Derbyshire county council is considering charging parents of children taken into local authority care half of the weekly cost of looking after them. The cash-strapped county council said \u201cunprecedented financial challenges\u201d meant it had little option but to \u201cmaximise alternative sources of income\u201d to try to reduce the strain on its children\u2019s services. The weekly charge would range from \u00a390 to \u00a3113 depending on the child\u2019s age. Scotland | An explosion has ripped through a block of flats in Scotland, leaving one man dead and several others injured. Business | The UK steel industry has called for the government to consider further protectionist trade measures as it braces for a flood of imported steel amid a global glut driven by China. Health | NHS maternity staff will take part in a mandatory training programme to improve patient safety after a damning report by the health regulator said that poor care and harm in childbirth were in danger of becoming \u201cnormalised\u201d. In depth: A \u2018singular event\u2019 for Israeli society When Ruth arrived in Jerusalem, less than two days after the attack by Hamas, she was struck by the silence that had descended on a typically very loud city. \u201cI remember how fearful the people I spoke to were when I arrived, how some in West Jerusalem told me they were only leaving the house to go to funerals,\u201d she says. \u201cI also remember that Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank were deeply fearful too about what was to come.\u201d The impact of the attack on Israeli society is deep and will be long-lasting, not just because of the horrific massacre itself but the ongoing issues that Israeli society is still grappling with. Tens of thousands of Israelis remain displaced. And while half of the hostages were released during a short ceasefire in November, 70 are dead (the remains of 33 of the deceased are still in Gaza). Israel believes 64 are still alive in captivity. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to capture the gravity of that day and how much people were just completely engulfed by shock, trauma and fear,\u201d Ruth says. *** A lack of safety The 7 October attack was a \u201csingular event\u201d for Israeli society, she says. The massacre shattered a sense of security that had built up in Israeli society over the past three decades of relative peace. \u201cAll of a sudden, the public felt vulnerable to what they saw as threats from outside and that will take a very long time to go away, if it ever will,\u201d she adds. The attack \u201cbroke a fundamental social contract the Israeli citizens had with their government\u201d, Ruth says, which they felt failed to anticipate Hamas\u2019s operation and reacted inadequately to the attack once it had started. Israelis expected immediate help from the military or police if something like this were to ever happen \u2013 instead the response was terrifyingly slow. The reports and inquiries since have highlighted the array of operational and intelligence lapses that led to such an inadequate response, which has only further degraded the sense of trust between the public and the state. *** The fate of the hostages Though there is disagreement about the best way to free those still held captive in Gaza, the fate of the hostages has been a steadfastly unifying issue in Israel. Initially, families and loved ones of the hostages were careful not to be critical of the government, which they wanted to keep on side. That relationship has fundamentally changed in the past year, as they have become increasingly vocal in criticising the government for not prioritising the return of their loved ones. This discontent turned into regular protests, which melded with an anti-government movement that existed before 7 October. A significant section of Israeli society has been shocked by what they see as an unwillingness from the government to prioritise civilian lives over continuing the war in Gaza. Reports of further hostage deaths in August prompted an outcry for the government to do more to bring home those still trapped. Many now believe that Benjamin Netanyahu is prioritising his own political future over the safety of the hostages. While the country remains at war, his position as prime minister remains untouchable. Earlier this year, Ruth spoke to a woman who has two brothers-in-law who are still being held in Gaza, and she said she believes that \u201cNetanyahu is fine with them coming home in body bags\u201d. *** Deepening divisions Before the attack, Israel was a divided country, and these divisions have deepened. \u201cIsrael is a deeply traumatised society, without question,\u201d Ruth says. Israelis have been living in a war economy for the past year, the cost of living is through the roof, and a new generation has been involved in active conflict. In the extremist ultranationalist and settler movements, the 7 October attack is viewed as confirmation of their worldview and an endorsement of their methods. \u201cSettlers view settlement as security, and so, in their eyes, they have to increase claiming land and displacing Palestinians from that land,\u201d Ruth says. These views have become more entrenched, emboldened and extreme, with some within the movement pushing an agenda to resettle Gaza. During an ultranationalist march earlier this year, cabinet ministers called for the rebuilding of Jewish settlements in the region. \u201cThe gap between the ultranationalists and settlers \u2013 who see all of this as an endorsement of their extremist viewpoint \u2013 and the more liberal Israelis \u2013 who were already deeply concerned by the changes that Netanyahu has made to their country \u2013 is only going to get wider,\u201d Ruth says. These schisms are not just political \u2013 they represent a significant difference of opinion on how Israeli society should respond to a shock of this kind. \u201cThe solution for some is to get rid of Netanyahu and to have a different government. The solution for others is a continuation of the war. It is a fundamentally divided set of perspectives on what needs to happen next,\u201d she adds. *** The war in Gaza Gaza has experienced periods of intense violence in the past and life in the territory has long been difficult for Palestinians because of Israel\u2019s blockade. But the devastation that has been wrought on the strip in reaction to the 7 October attack is unprecedented. \u201cThe fear is that Gaza has been destroyed in a way that is permanent,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cGaza has endured bombardment and war before and has managed to rebuild, but this destruction is not just of the physical structures, it is also of the social fabric.\u201d By this, she is referring to the destruction of universities, places of worship, hospitals and schools \u2013 the places that create a functioning society. Where they once stood, there is now just rubble. Those who have lived in Gaza their whole life are not only unable to live in it safely any more, they cannot even recognise which street they are standing on. An Associated Press investigation in June found at least 60 Palestinian families who had lost at least 25 people \u2013 sometimes four generations from the same bloodline \u2013 in bombings between October and December alone. This kind of killing has left a rupture in the social fabric of Gaza. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October according to local health authorities, 11,355 of whom were children. 90% of the population is estimated to be displaced. Disease is rampant. V\u00edctor Aguayo, UNICEF Director of Child Nutrition, described the situation in Gaza as one of the most severe food and nutrition crises in history. Refugees International found that the \u201cebbs and flows in hunger conditions are closely linked to Israeli government restrictions and concessions on aid access, and to the conduct of the Israeli military\u201d. Outside Gaza, there is also a sense that the rules of engagement have changed in the other occupied territories. During her reporting, Ruth found that there was even more willingness to use lethal force against Palestinian civilians, including children, during night raids and at checkpoints. \u201cPalestinians talk about adaptability and resilience in the face of tragedy, but I think this war has absolutely tested the limits of that,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cThis is a level of loss that people from Gaza are struggling to comprehend and there is a sense from displaced people that I\u2019ve spoken that there is nothing to return back to for them.\u201d Violence has now spread far beyond Israel\u2019s borders, beyond Gaza, to Lebanon, Syria and Iran. One year on, it is clear the 7 October attack and the Israeli reaction to it will scar the Middle East for many years to come. *** Read more Bethan McKernan visited Nir Oz Kibbutz and spoke to one resident about the profound loss his community has endured and how it has been irrevocably changed since the attack on 7 October. Neha Gohil interviewed Sharone Lifschitz, whose parents were taken hostage by Hamas. While her mother was released two weeks after being captured, her father is still being held. Lifschitz spoke about the unimaginable pain and trauma her family have experienced. Peter Beaumont and Quique Kierszenbaum spoke with other relatives of hostages about their suffering and scepticism that the government is doing everything it can to bring their loved ones back. Patrick Wintour\u2019s analysis lays out how a year of war has left the country more isolated than ever before. Naomi Klein\u2019s insightful reflection on how the Israeli state has transformed a national trauma into a \u201cweapon of war\u201d is challenging but essential reading. She asks: \u201cWhat is the line between commemorating trauma and cynically exploiting it? Between memorialisation and weaponisation?\u201d Ali Jadallah\u2019s photo essay, showcasing his most powerful work documenting the war in Gaza, serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of the relentless violence inflicted by Israel on the small strip of land. Jason Burke and Malak A Tantesh spoke with the Palestinian families about their lives before the war and the level of loss they have experienced in the last year. What else we\u2019ve been reading Though Donald Trump was always known for his acerbic and offensive tone, his rambling speeches have become even more incoherent and profane, raising concerns about his cognitive ability.

Nimo Emily Atack is frank and funny in this interview with Zoe Williams, discussing her role in the hotly anticipated adaptation of Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals and the downside of her early appearances in the Inbetweeners: \u201cI\u2019d never even given it thought that I was overweight. I was a child, really. I was tiny. I must have been a size eight\u201d. Toby Moses, head of newsletters Eva Wiseman\u2019s interview with Stanley Tucci (pictured above) is as delightful and thoughtful as you would think. The pair discuss Tucci\u2019s status as an online sex symbol, his cancer diagnosis and his new book What I Ate in One Year. Nimo Emma Beddington writes about the complicated feelings stirred up by the possibility of a cure for her alopecia: \u201cBeing bald hasn\u2019t felt like a big deal for ages. Now, though, I\u2019m thinking about it all the time, wondering about the alternative.\u201d Toby On the 20th anniversary of Parkrun, Tim Lewis tracks how this event went from a small gathering of casual runners to a global phenomenon.

Darker than a lot of Studio Ghibli\u2019s output, it is a mind-bending exploration of a young boy\u2019s grief, complete with wizards, giant fish, man-eating parrots and, yes, a talking heron (voiced in the English dub by Robert Pattinson). It might be a tall order for a family movie night, but this is the sort of film in which you can luxuriate. <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Men\u2019s Test cricket: </strong><strong>Pakistan v England</strong> 5.30am, Sky Sports Cricket.

It begins with a look at the inner life of volcanic planets and their moons, from hotspots such as Mars and Jupiter\u2019s satellite Io to some very cool cryovolcanoes further afield. Graeme Virtue The Penguin 9pm, Sky Atlantic An unrecognisable Colin Farrell is rightly getting plaudits for embodying the ambitious gangster Oz Cobb, but this Batman prequel is only as strong as Farrell\u2019s antagonist \u2013 and Cristin Milioti is up to the task as the fire-eyed Sofia Falcone. Knives are drawn and bullets sprayed this week as the stakes ratchet up. Jack Seale Secret Amazon: Into the Wild 10pm, Channel 4 A thrilling two-parter (with the episodes shown consecutively) in which the explorer Lucy Shepherd and her Indigenous team embark on a 50-day trek through untouched but threatened Amazon rainforest, battling giant wasps, venomous snakes and wild animals. Making life-or-death decisions, will they make it or will the Amazon literally eat them alive? Ali Catterall Will &amp; Ralf Should Know Better 10pm, U&amp;Dave Here we go again: another middle-aged TV star bromance out on the road. Thankfully, Two Pints of Lager pals Will Mellor and Ralf Little are at least an amiable pair. First up, they meet the world\u2019s strongest woman, accuse a monk of falling asleep during meditation and do an explosive hostile-environment training drill. HR Bump 11.25pm, BBC One This popular Aussie comedy drama \u2013 which started life as a story about a school teen (Oly, played by Nathalie Morris) unexpectedly giving birth \u2013 returns for a fourth season. Oly is now juggling motherhood and her career, but a week off work proves that things are just as exhausting at home with her own mum. HR Film choice The Boy and the Heron (Hayao Miyazaki, 2023), Netflix We are living through a golden age of animation, but it\u2019s nice to be reminded of the power of the old master. Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s The Boy and the Heron \u2013 the most expensive Japanese film ever made, hand-drawn by a team of 60 animators over seven years \u2013 is a masterpiece. Darker than a lot of Studio Ghibli\u2019s output, it is a mind-bending exploration of a young boy\u2019s grief, complete with wizards, giant fish, man-eating parrots and, yes, a talking heron (voiced in the English dub by Robert Pattinson). It might be a tall order for a family movie night, but this is the sort of film in which you can luxuriate.

On that day, time collapsed. When we measure a year in the context of a baby growing up, we may see them learning to walk, learning to speak and beginning to be purposefully playful. But we\u2019ve been measuring time in the context of war, and babies are continuing to die. A year has passed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/daughter-hostage-hamas-family-pain-and-trauma-sharone-lifschitz\">hostages are still in Gaza</a>, Palestinians are still hungry and being bombarded, the displaced on both sides have yet to return home, and other fronts continue to escalate. How do our leaders measure time?</p> <p>The attack of 7 October didn\u2019t start time. It happened in a context of prolonged occupation and conflict, of an ongoing process of dehumanisation of both sides. It didn\u2019t start time, but it changed the course of my life. It has woken me from what I call my political coma, from the fantasy that we can lead normal lives in a place where life itself isn\u2019t sustainable. Facing my own helplessness that day, having said goodbye to my mother while she was being murdered on the other side of the phone line, pushed me into a kind of manic phase of activism.

There is no wall high enough to make Israelis secure, no amount of violence that will liberate Palestinians. The sole way to achieve security and liberation is to transform your enemy into your partner.

We might be small in number, but our convictions are stronger than ever. With that being said, I\u2019m aware there is a glass ceiling on the impact we can have in civil society. We need movement in the political sphere. There, we are faced with the problem of Jewish and Muslim radicalism that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/netanyahu-buoyed-by-far-right-support-for-israeli-land-operations-in-lebanon\">gripped governments</a> on both sides. In Israel, the occupation has become a blind spot. The occupation and conflict are the root problems, and insecurity and oppression are the symptoms. That\u2019s where the international community is supposed to step up. Offering unconditional support for our symptoms and no relief for our core problems is counterproductive.

      "bodyText": "Scotland\u2019s health boards have paid hundreds of pounds an hour for locum psychiatrists to help cope with a deepening staff shortage crisis in mental health services. They have been charged more than \u00a3130m by dozens of private health care companies to provide temporary psychiatrists over the past five years, including one firm now owned by two billionaires from Texas. The Royal College of Psychiatrists and NHS executives said mental health services in Scotland were now at breaking point because of severe staff shortages, which was damaging patient care and causing experienced consultants to quit. Scottish hospitals are now so reliant on agency locums to ensure their mental health services function, that health boards are forced to pay hourly rates significantly higher than the salaries of NHS consultants. Dr Jane Morris, chair of the college\u2019s Scottish arm, said adult psychiatry was the worst affected branch of the NHS, with a 25% vacancy rate across Scotland. \u201cThere simply aren\u2019t enough of us,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the whole agency locum question is a reflection of a real crisis in the Scottish psychiatric workforce.\u201d The soaring costs of locums led to a \u201cvicious circle\u201d, she said. It put NHS consultants under greater pressure to manage services and take on heavier caseloads; they felt overworked and undervalued, so resigned, worsening the crisis. A joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC Scotland has found: Annual spending by Scotland\u2019s 14 health boards on locum psychiatrists reached nearly \u00a335m last year, up from \u00a320m five years ago. NHS Tayside has spent more than \u00a330m since 2019, and NHS Fife nearly \u00a326m. NHS Western Isles paid \u00a327,000 for one week of round-the-clock cover in April 2023. NHS executives said hospitals and GP surgeries often needed locums to cover staff holidays or sickness, or in emergencies. In some cases, that was provided by NHS staff who were paid overtime or for working during their holidays. Agencies charge hourly rates ranging from \u00a385 to as much as \u00a3473. That included administration and professional fees, and VAT at 20%. By comparison, a junior NHS consultant would earn about \u00a350 an hour. One company, Brookson Solutions, which was bought by two US billionaire investors, David Bonderman and James Coulter, in 2022, has been paid more than \u00a319m to provide locums to NHS Tayside and NHS Fife. It said it provided payroll and compliance services, and did not directly recruit the locums Tayside used. Morris said Scotland\u2019s hospitals were so dependent on locums in some cases they hired psychiatrists who were not fully qualified or who were not members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the profession\u2019s governing body. Some locums gave remote consultations online from cities outside Scotland, in Britain or abroad, including in India \u2013 a service the royal college regards as substandard unless it includes face-to-face follow-ups. Dr Amanda Cotton, the associate medical director for mental health in NHS Borders and a spokesperson for the Senior Medical Managers in Psychiatry group, said the shortage of staff psychiatrists raised serious questions about hospitals\u2019 ability to provide cover. \u201cThe cracks are absolutely starting to show,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that we are seeing the locum bills increase, because we\u2019re faced with a stark choice. Do we see posts go unfilled and then see services aren\u2019t sustainable, or do we bring these doctors into post despite that enormous cost?\u201d Gordon Jamieson, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles, one of Scotland\u2019s smallest boards, said locums were the single greatest pressure on his budget and his board had diverted money from other parts of its budget to pay for them. Some charges were \u201ceye-wateringly high\u201d, he said. \u201cIf you go into the locum market, then it\u2019s such a volatile market that really you find yourself at the mercy of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t respond to the market cost you have no service.\u201d Cotton and Morris said it was essential the Scottish government reversed its cuts to mental health funding.

If I was a subpostmaster I would have been horrified \u2013 with my remuneration going up 1% or 2%, costs going up more, many losing money \u2013 to see discussion of moving [Read\u2019s] pay to \u00a31.1m just for hitting target, let alone the amount he would have got for good performance.\u201d</p> <p>Jane Davies, the former people officer at the Post Office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/23/post-office-boss-obsessed-with-his-pay-claims-former-hr-director\">bluntly called it an \u201cobsession\u201d</a>, while Amanda Burton, the chair of the Post Office\u2019s remuneration committee, said she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/27/post-office-boss-asked-about-his-pay-more-than-expected-board-member\">surprised at how often the topic of Read wanting a pay increase</a> was raised.</p>   <h2>The \u2018untouchables\u2019</h2>  <p>The inquiry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/01/post-office-had-no-interest-in-exonerating-operators-says-former-chair\">heard a lot about \u201cuntouchables\u201d</a> within the Post Office.</p> <p>The phrase, which has been attributed to Read, refers to a group of the organisation\u2019s investigators involved in the pursuit of post office operators who would never face disciplinary action over the Horizon IT scandal.</p> <p>Saf Ismail, one of two subpostmasters who sit on the board of the Post Office, has also referred to a \u201cred\u201d list of 23 other employees deemed high risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or another, none of whom have even been suspended.</p> <p>The former chair Staunton went as far as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/01/post-office-had-no-interest-in-exonerating-operators-says-former-chair\">warning of another Horizon-style scandal</a> if the \u201cuntouchables\u201d were not removed by the time the new IT system, called NBIT, was finally rolled out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Millions of pounds remain in dispute between post office operators and what is on their records and what is in the Post Office main accounts.</p> <p>\u201cThey are people that were involved in prosecuting postmasters previously and are still in their roles,\u201d Staunton told the inquiry. \u201cI am very afraid. [They] would be involved in any future investigations \u2026 and that seems utterly wrong.\u201d</p> <h2>Cultural change at the Post Office  </h2>  <p>A key theme of the final phase of the inquiry is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/22/post-office-inquiry-poised-to-hear-present-day-staff-deliver-their-verdict\">examine the cultural change at the Post Office</a>, in the years since the 2019 high court victory led by Alan Bates uncovered the appalling treatment of post office operators and the behaviour of executives.</p> <p>Outside the inquiry Read has been embroiled in a reputational crisis after allegations of bullying, and questions about the departure of Alisdair Cameron, who officially left the company in June after a year of sick leave.</p> <p>Cameron told the inquiry that Read prefers to work with teams of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/02/post-office-ceo-nick-read-prefers-teams-of-younger-deferential-males-inquiry-told\">\u201cyounger, deferential males\u201d</a> and \u201cvery few senior and independent-minded colleagues, especially female\u201d have thrived at the Post Office.</p> <p>The inquiry has also heard that it appears that little has changed in how Post Office executives view post office operators.</p> <p>Staunton gave testimony that Ben Foat, the general counsel at the Post Office, told him that the organisation doesn\u2019t owe the same duty of care to operators as its own employees.</p> <p>Ismail and a fellow subpostmaster non-executive director member of the Post Office board have told the inquiry that there is an attitude that post office operators are \u201con the take\u201d and assumed to be guilty until proven innocent.</p>    <p>Both have found themselves the subsequent subjects of investigations by the Post Office since joining the board in 2021.</p> <p>Ismail told the inquiry that after their appointment to the board, a measure designed to better relations with operators and improve the running of the organisation, executives at the Post Office weren\u2019t welcoming and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/23/post-office-operators-horizon-it-problems-shortfall\">\u201cmade it difficult\u201d</a>.</p> <p>He said he was told that Read was not happy with post office operators being on the board and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/23/post-office-operators-horizon-it-problems-shortfall\">\u201cwanted that to be reversed\u201d</a>. They were also blocked or excluded from attending certain meetings, such as those around bonuses and pay.</p> <p>A survey conducted on behalf of the inquiry also found that post office operators from a minority ethnic background <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/23/post-office-operators-horizon-it-problems-shortfall\">were more likely to have been threatened with suspension than those from a white background.</a></p> <h2>The spat with Fujitsu over the use of Horizon IT data in cases against post office operators</h2>  <p>The inquiry heard that earlier this year, an email was sent by John Bartlett, the head of investigations at the Post Office, to Fujitsu asking for a witness statement relating to Horizon data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/24/post-office-inquiry-horizon-it-data-criminal-case\">for use in a criminal case against a post office operator</a> in which the Post Office was the \u201cpotential victim\u201d.</p> <p>The issue was rapidly escalated to Paul Patterson, the chief executive of Fujitsu Europe, who wrote directly to Read.</p> <p>He said the request was \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d given judicial findings against the Post Office and Horizon data, adding that it was clear the \u201cPost Office continues to have significant cultural problems\u201d.</p> <p>Read did not take up the offer of a meeting with Patterson to discuss the matter \u201cCEO to CEO\u201d.</p> <h2>The replacement of the Horizon IT system</h2>  <p>The supposed replacement for Horizon \u2013 the New Branch IT system (NBIT) \u2013 continues to be beset by delays and bugs and has seen its projected cost balloon from \u00a3180m to \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>The Post Office originally said that NBIT would be deployed by March 2025.</p> <p>However, Chris Brocklesby, who left his role as chief transformation officer last month, told the inquiry that upon his arrival in 2023 there was \u201cno credible plan\u201d for that ever to be met.</p> <p>NBIT is being tested in only a handful of branches and the timeline is for it to be ready to be deployed by mid-2026, with all branches online by the end of 2028.</p> <p>The Post Office has already been forced to extend its contract with Fujitsu twice, at a total cost of \u00a395.6m, but it comes up for renewal again on 1 April 2025.</p> <p>The inquiry has seen documents that show the Post Office is going to be forced to extend the contract in a further five-year deal, <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366587174/Fujitsu-set-for-further-180m-deal-as-Post-Office-Horizon-replacement-delayed\">reportedly at a cost of \u00a3180m</a>.</p>",

The executive, who has given himself 88 days to prepare for his appearance, has been on the receiving end of heavy criticism from witnesses and become embroiled in a reputational crisis of his own. Here are some of the key issues the judge-led inquiry is likely to ask him to explain. Read\u2019s \u2018obsession\u2019 with pay and bonuses Henry Staunton, the former chair of the Post Office, twice asked the government for Read\u2019s pay to be doubled, and has told the inquiry that Read had threatened to leave over the issue. Staunton, who was sacked in January by the then business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, said that he put forward the requests only because he knew that the government would refuse. \u201cIt was astonishing,\u201d Staunton told the inquiry last month. \u201cIt was taking up a disproportionate amount of my time. If I was a subpostmaster I would have been horrified \u2013 with my remuneration going up 1% or 2%, costs going up more, many losing money \u2013 to see discussion of moving [Read\u2019s] pay to \u00a31.1m just for hitting target, let alone the amount he would have got for good performance.\u201d Jane Davies, the former people officer at the Post Office, bluntly called it an \u201cobsession\u201d, while Amanda Burton, the chair of the Post Office\u2019s remuneration committee, said she was surprised at how often the topic of Read wanting a pay increase was raised. The \u2018untouchables\u2019 The inquiry has heard a lot about \u201cuntouchables\u201d within the Post Office. The phrase, which has been attributed to Read, refers to a group of the organisation\u2019s investigators involved in the pursuit of post office operators who would never face disciplinary action over the Horizon IT scandal. Saf Ismail, one of two subpostmasters who sit on the board of the Post Office, has also referred to a \u201cred\u201d list of 23 other employees deemed high risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or another, none of whom have even been suspended. The former chair Staunton went as far as warning of another Horizon-style scandal if the \u201cuntouchables\u201d were not removed by the time the new IT system, called NBIT, was finally rolled out. Millions of pounds remain in dispute between post office operators and what is on their records and what is in the Post Office main accounts. \u201cThey are people that were involved in prosecuting postmasters previously and are still in their roles,\u201d Staunton told the inquiry. \u201cI am very afraid. [They] would be involved in any future investigations \u2026 and that seems utterly wrong.\u201d Cultural change at the Post Office A key theme of the final phase of the inquiry is to examine the cultural change at the Post Office, in the years since the 2019 high court victory led by Alan Bates uncovered the appalling treatment of post office operators and the behaviour of executives. Outside the inquiry Read has been embroiled in a reputational crisis after allegations of bullying, and questions about the departure of Alisdair Cameron, who officially left the company in June after a year of sick leave. Cameron told the inquiry that Read prefers to work with teams of \u201cyounger, deferential males\u201d and \u201cvery few senior and independent-minded colleagues, especially female\u201d have thrived at the Post Office. The inquiry has also heard that it appears that little has changed in how Post Office executives view post office operators. Staunton gave testimony that Ben Foat, the general counsel at the Post Office, told him that the organisation doesn\u2019t owe the same duty of care to operators as its own employees. Ismail and a fellow subpostmaster non-executive director member of the Post Office board have told the inquiry that there is an attitude that post office operators are \u201con the take\u201d and assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. Both have found themselves the subsequent subjects of investigations by the Post Office since joining the board in 2021. Ismail told the inquiry that after their appointment to the board, a measure designed to better relations with operators and improve the running of the organisation, executives at the Post Office weren\u2019t welcoming and \u201cmade it difficult\u201d. He said he was told that Read was not happy with post office operators being on the board and \u201cwanted that to be reversed\u201d. They were also blocked or excluded from attending certain meetings, such as those around bonuses and pay. A survey conducted on behalf of the inquiry also found that post office operators from a minority ethnic background were more likely to have been threatened with suspension than those from a white background. The spat with Fujitsu over the use of Horizon IT data in cases against post office operators The inquiry heard that earlier this year, an email was sent by John Bartlett, the head of investigations at the Post Office, to Fujitsu asking for a witness statement relating to Horizon data for use in a criminal case against a post office operator in which the Post Office was the \u201cpotential victim\u201d. The issue was rapidly escalated to Paul Patterson, the chief executive of Fujitsu Europe, who wrote directly to Read. He said the request was \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d given judicial findings against the Post Office and Horizon data, adding that it was clear the \u201cPost Office continues to have significant cultural problems\u201d. Read did not take up the offer of a meeting with Patterson to discuss the matter \u201cCEO to CEO\u201d. The replacement of the Horizon IT system The supposed replacement for Horizon \u2013 the New Branch IT system (NBIT) \u2013 continues to be beset by delays and bugs and has seen its projected cost balloon from \u00a3180m to \u00a31.1bn. The Post Office originally said that NBIT would be deployed by March 2025. However, Chris Brocklesby, who left his role as chief transformation officer last month, told the inquiry that upon his arrival in 2023 there was \u201cno credible plan\u201d for that ever to be met. NBIT is being tested in only a handful of branches and the timeline is for it to be ready to be deployed by mid-2026, with all branches online by the end of 2028. The Post Office has already been forced to extend its contract with Fujitsu twice, at a total cost of \u00a395.6m, but it comes up for renewal again on 1 April 2025. The inquiry has seen documents that show the Post Office is going to be forced to extend the contract in a further five-year deal, reportedly at a cost of \u00a3180m.",

That was four months ago. I\u2019ve had no contact from my mental health team since then.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://voxscotland.org.uk/\">Vox Scotland</a> surveyed patients after hearing of repeated cases of poor experiences with locums, the agency psychiatrists on whom Scotland\u2019s mental health services increasingly depend.</p> <p>For some, the anger is palpable. \u201cThere is no care left in people or the system and it\u2019s criminal what they have been allowed to do, especially over these last few years taking everything online,\u201d one respondent said. \u201cOnline appointments are not accessible to many neurodivergent people like me. Suicidal? Nothing says care like a five-minute Zoom and a prescription 20 miles away with nobody to collect it.\u201d</p> <p>The Vox respondents testified about experiences with all 14 Scottish health boards, which have spent \u00a3134m on locum psychiatrists since 2019.</p> <p>Nearly a third said all or most of their care came from locums, of whom half were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the overall quality of care. A fifth of those polled said they did not know whether they were seen by locums or NHS psychiatrists.</p> <p>\u201cEvery new locum has new ideas, medication changes, but are never here long enough to see the medication work or not. Then the cycle begins with the new one,\u201d another said.</p> <p>\u201cEach time you see someone different you have to pour your heart and soul out,\u201d said another. \u201cThere is no rapport or relationship with locum psychiatrists for vulnerable people \u2013 it is impossible to do from receiving notes from the last person.\u201d</p> <p>These findings, now being collated by Vox for a report due out this year, bolster growing concerns among senior psychiatrists that the system is in crisis. Spending on mental health has been cut, even while overall health spending has grown. Over the last five years, the number of NHS psychiatrists has fallen by 17% in Scotland, or 130 people, to 651 full-time posts.</p> <p>Dr Amanda Cotton, a spokesperson for the Senior Medical Managers in Psychiatry group, said NHS staff were \u201cstretching further and further to try to continue to deliver the services that people expect, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that the cracks are absolutely starting to show\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Jane Morris, the Scottish chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, believes the trends raise very difficult questions. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a scaremonger but we could see ourselves as an NHS that purely exists to purchase professionals from locum agencies,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNot only would that be a very expensive way of spending taxpayers\u2019 money but it would lose a great many of the checks and balances, quality assurances and that sort of sense of belonging. The NHS still in Scotland does have a sentimental tug on people. We still want to work for it. People still want to be cocooned by it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re too late to make that happen again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The complaints about locum psychiatrists have a clear pattern. Patients say they routinely experience inconsistent care or get contradictory advice. Some describe an indifference that borders on box-ticking. \u201cI had 14 locums [and] they all had different views and opinions on my care,\u201d said one respondent to a survey of 469 patients by the advocacy group Vox Scotland. \u201cThe last locum did not bother to call me back. That was four months ago. I\u2019ve had no contact from my mental health team since then.\u201d Vox Scotland surveyed patients after hearing of repeated cases of poor experiences with locums, the agency psychiatrists on whom Scotland\u2019s mental health services increasingly depend. For some, the anger is palpable. \u201cThere is no care left in people or the system and it\u2019s criminal what they have been allowed to do, especially over these last few years taking everything online,\u201d one respondent said. \u201cOnline appointments are not accessible to many neurodivergent people like me. Suicidal? Nothing says care like a five-minute Zoom and a prescription 20 miles away with nobody to collect it.\u201d The Vox respondents testified about experiences with all 14 Scottish health boards, which have spent \u00a3134m on locum psychiatrists since 2019. Nearly a third said all or most of their care came from locums, of whom half were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the overall quality of care. A fifth of those polled said they did not know whether they were seen by locums or NHS psychiatrists. \u201cEvery new locum has new ideas, medication changes, but are never here long enough to see the medication work or not. Then the cycle begins with the new one,\u201d another said. \u201cEach time you see someone different you have to pour your heart and soul out,\u201d said another. \u201cThere is no rapport or relationship with locum psychiatrists for vulnerable people \u2013 it is impossible to do from receiving notes from the last person.\u201d These findings, now being collated by Vox for a report due out this year, bolster growing concerns among senior psychiatrists that the system is in crisis. Spending on mental health has been cut, even while overall health spending has grown. Over the last five years, the number of NHS psychiatrists has fallen by 17% in Scotland, or 130 people, to 651 full-time posts. Dr Amanda Cotton, a spokesperson for the Senior Medical Managers in Psychiatry group, said NHS staff were \u201cstretching further and further to try to continue to deliver the services that people expect, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that the cracks are absolutely starting to show\u201d. Dr Jane Morris, the Scottish chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, believes the trends raise very difficult questions. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a scaremonger but we could see ourselves as an NHS that purely exists to purchase professionals from locum agencies,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only would that be a very expensive way of spending taxpayers\u2019 money but it would lose a great many of the checks and balances, quality assurances and that sort of sense of belonging. The NHS still in Scotland does have a sentimental tug on people. We still want to work for it. People still want to be cocooned by it, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re too late to make that happen again.\u201d",

They were brought in in 2018 to prevent the diversion of Chinese steel after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/08/donald-trump-metal-tariffs-trade-war\">Donald Trump imposed tariffs</a> on imports to the US.

However, the industry wants the UK to consider protecting its steel industry regardless.</p> <p>Russell Codling, the director of marketing and business development in the UK for Tata Steel, said: \u201cThe scale of excess supply to the global market from China is just swamping every corner. The trade protection mechanisms that are in place aren\u2019t sufficient to deal with these circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Lower prices benefit steel users, including construction projects and major infrastructure.

Other countries \u2013 notably the US \u2013 have essentially ignored the WTO, while pressure is building within the EU to push the boundaries of what the rules allow.</p> <p>UK Steel argued that Britain will face greater trade diversion if it does not act.

      "bodyText": "The UK steel industry has called for the government to consider further protectionist trade measures as it braces for a flood of imported steel amid a global glut driven by China. UK Steel, a lobby group, said the global industry has 543m tonnes of excess steel, 70 times more than the UK uses each year, in analysis published on Monday. It said the UK faces a \u201ccliff edge\u201d in 2026 when current protections run out. China\u2019s steel industry is going through a brutal recession amid a years-long crisis in the country\u2019s property industry that has dragged down domestic steel demand. In August, the chief executive of the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker, China Baowu Steel, said the industry was going through a \u201charsh winter\u201d that could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis or the 2015 crash in demand, when thousands of British steel jobs were cut. The Chinese glut has resulted in falling prices around the world. Gareth Stace, UK Steel\u2019s director general, said the UK needed to \u201cbalance international obligations with the national interest\u201d and act to protect the industry, or else face the prospect of recent British investments in the steel industry being \u201call for naught\u201d. The UK currently has so-called steel safeguards in place that limit the diversion of cheap steel to Britain. They were brought in in 2018 to prevent the diversion of Chinese steel after Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imports to the US. However, the safeguards expire in 2026, and may not be extended under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. However, the industry wants the UK to consider protecting its steel industry regardless. Russell Codling, the director of marketing and business development in the UK for Tata Steel, said: \u201cThe scale of excess supply to the global market from China is just swamping every corner. The trade protection mechanisms that are in place aren\u2019t sufficient to deal with these circumstances.\u201d Lower prices benefit steel users, including construction projects and major infrastructure. However, steel industries tend to be politically influential and the ability to produce steel domestically is also prized as an indicator of industrial strength and geopolitical power. The UK government under the Conservatives and now Labour has committed \u00a3500m towards the switch from blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces at Tata Steel\u2019s plant in Port Talbot, south Wales. Indian-owned Tata shut down its last blast furnace last week, with the loss of 1,900 jobs, but the government argues that its investment will help sustain a British steel industry. Chinese-owned British Steel is also trying to negotiate state support to switch to electric arc furnaces. Deciding whether to impose protectionist measures could prove tricky for the Labour government. Other countries \u2013 notably the US \u2013 have essentially ignored the WTO, while pressure is building within the EU to push the boundaries of what the rules allow. UK Steel argued that Britain will face greater trade diversion if it does not act. It suggested that the UK should consider imposing tariffs on steel imports above a certain level. Carbon border adjustments, which put a price on carbon emissions from dirty blast furnaces, could also help the UK industry, it said. \u201cRising global excess capacity driven and sustained by non-market forces is one of the biggest challenges of our time for the global steel industry,\u201d said Stace. \u201cIt has the potential to redraw the map of global steelmaking, as there is no longer fair competition.\u201d",

Guardian Australia revealed in July that the Melbourne woman is being held at Thomas Embling hospital, a secure forensic mental health facility, after being found not guilty because of mental impairment on assault charges in 2015. The woman, whose identity is suppressed, was formally placed on a custodial supervision order for charges of recklessly causing injury and common law assault. Each charge has a maximum penalty of five years in prison. But the woman has instead spent much of the past nine years in seclusion at Thomas Embling. Judge Nola Karapanagiotidis said in the county court on Monday that she was concerned more progress had not been made in \u201cde-seclusioning\u201d the woman since she heard the case three months earlier.

Is he safe? Is he still alive? How is he eating? How is he sleeping?\u201d asks Wiwwaeo, 53.

At first, she would ask whether her father was still working and when he would return. \u201cShe watches the news, and her friends at school ask her about it, and so we told her the truth: that her father was captured, but he is still alive. He\u2019s not dead,\u201d says Wiwwaeo. Someday, they hope, he will come back to pick her up and take her to school again.</p> <p>Irada\u2019s grandfather, Tom, had been taking her to school while her father was away working, but the stress of the past year has exacerbated his ill health, and the family was forced to move her to a new school closer to their village.</p> <p>Tom, 58, has been admitted to hospital three times since 7 October, after experiencing a stroke, lung infection, and muscle weakness. \u201cWe thought he wouldn\u2019t survive. It was very, very bad,\u201d says Wiwwaeo. He began to experience memory loss. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t remember his family \u2013 his children, his grandchildren \u2013 he couldn\u2019t remember anyone.

Irada spoke at her mother\u2019s funeral, and sang a special song, but did not cry, says Wiwwaeo. \u201cShe is strong.\u201d <br><br>Despite everything, Irada had adapted to her new school and made friends, and has helped her grandmother, who is less confident with technology, to use her phone to stay in touch with contacts in Israel as they try to gather updates.</p> <p>Watchara moved to work in Israel three years ago, aged 31, with his younger brother. They were determined to save up money and pay off the family\u2019s debts. They wanted their parents not to have to worry about money any more, and hoped for a fresh start for their own families. The salaries in Israel, between 40,000 and 60,000 baht (about \u00a3920-\u00a31,380), were double what they could make back home on their family\u2019s rubber plantation.

A team of doctors reviewed hundreds of cases to identify patients they believed might have \u201cdied an unnatural death as a result of Ian Paterson\u2019s actions\u201d.

A report published in 2020 found that Paterson subjected more than 1,000 NHS and private healthcare patients in the West Midlands to unnecessary and damaging operations over 14 years before he was stopped. This included convincing patients to undergo surgery by exaggerating the risk of breast cancer, and performing unrecognised cleavage-sparing operations that left patients at risk of their cancer returning.

The family had already begun to have suspicions when the investigation into Paterson, and his subsequent conviction in 2017 for carrying out unnecessary and damaging operations, were reported widely in the media. \u201cWe initially didn\u2019t realise that leaving breast tissue behind could have led to recurrence [of cancer], or even a situation of secondary cancer,\u201d said Stuart Coyne. \u201cIt was only when that was explained in the press and on TV that it started to run through our minds: \u2018Well, could it be the case that, because she didn\u2019t have all the breast tissue removed, that led to the secondary cancer?\u201d Catherine, a data protection officer for Birmingham city council, was described by her husband as a \u201cvery likable, bubbly character\u201d. \u201cShe was the sort of person who, if you sat next to her on the bus, five minutes later she\u2019d be talking to you and exchanging details,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a very open, lively person, but she was also very determined and single-minded, and obviously that helped her to get through all the treatments she had.\u201d He fondly recalled a time when, while working as a classroom helper at her son\u2019s school, she \u201cgot a bee in her bonnet\u201d about the lack of equipment for left-handed children and successfully pushed for more to be provided. Her death came suddenly after her liver cancer diagnosis, and was a shock to the family including her two children, who were 13 and 17 at the time. \u201cIt was a difficult time for us all,\u201d said Coyne. \u201cAnd over the years, our concerns about what happened to her have just grown greater. What will come out of the inquest, I\u2019m sure, is a lot of information that people will be highly concerned about. \u201cAs the families and loved ones, we\u2019re looking for answers.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThese were appalling crimes and we are assisting his majesty\u2019s coroner with the inquests concerning the tragic deaths of patients previously treated by Ian Paterson. \u201cWe understand families\u2019 frustration and recognise that significant improvements to patient safety are required. This government is working urgently to ensure all lessons from this terrible case are being learned.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Remember,\u201d Emily Atack addresses herself, mock-solemnly, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a therapy session. This <em>isn\u2019t</em> a therapy session.\u201d She\u2019s fresh from a photoshoot and looks exactly like her character in the TV adaptation of Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals: lush, blown-out, long blond hair, huge features gleaming with gloss and sparkle, a fitted black suit straight out of the 80s, pointy shoes \u2026 \u201cCan I take my shoes off?\u201d<em> </em>Of<em> course </em>you can take your shoes off, I say. Of <em>course </em>I would like nothing more than for you to treat this like a therapy session.</p> <p>Atack had a baby boy three months ago, and yesterday, she says, \u201cI left my partner and Barney sleeping in the morning, day one of the promo, and it was so beautiful and calm, my beautiful baby and lovely partner, and I thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know if it gets much better than this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As adorable as her new-mother softness is, first we need to rewind to a year ago, and the set of Rivals. At that point, she hadn\u2019t even got together with her partner, the nuclear physicist Alistair Garner, though they did know each other from childhood. She was playing Sarah Stratton, a classic Jilly Cooper heroine/antiheroine. The sexual and class politics of Cooper\u2019s writing are complicated: Stratton is a young woman in a hurry, who lures a loathsome Tory MP out of his marriage then cheats on him constantly, with the ex-world showjumping champion Rupert Campbell-Black, naturally (keep up, non-Cooper-fans \u2013 this is stuff you\u2019re going to need to know).</p> <p>\u201cWomen like her have been villainised for ever,\u201d says Atack. \u201cIf they\u2019re the mistress, they\u2019re a slut, they\u2019re thick, they\u2019ve got nothing to offer but their boobs, their sexuality.\u201d In Cooper\u2019s books, though, Stratton (and others like her \u2013 there are heaps of mistresses) is neither villainised nor mocked, even while all the touchstones for mockery seem to be in place (she\u2019s constantly getting caught naked, for instance). You can see she\u2019s on the make, but you\u2019re rooting for her anyway. Atack is perfect in the role, with her unusual mix of guilelessness and self-awareness; indeed, the casting is wall-to-wall brilliant, from David Tennant\u2019s slimy Tony Baddingham to Bella Maclean\u2019s Taggie. \u201cIt was the best job I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d Atack says. </p>    <p>Nevertheless, looking at the 80s through a modern lens is a tricky business. \u201cYou have to do it right; you have to do it carefully,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said yes to it if I didn\u2019t feel it was going to comfortably portray these situations.\u201d In Rivals \u2013 indeed, across the whole Campbell-Black saga \u2013 men sexually assault women, and yet those same women immediately fall in love with them; even the most sympathetic, non-predatory men are still a patriarchal nightmare, and you\u2019ll really ruin it for yourself if you think too hard about the limits of female solidarity and the expectation of its non-existence. Rivals works because of the performances, Dominic Treadwell-Collins\u2019s whip-smart script and also, because there\u2019s no point pretending the 80s weren\u2019t like that. \u201cThere\u2019s a generation of people my mum\u2019s sort of age who say, \u2018Oh yeah, I got groped all the time,\u2019 for whom that is completely normal behaviour,\u201d Atack says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult sometimes to discuss it with your parents \u2013 for me personally, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Atack, 34, grew up in Bedfordshire, somewhere between showbiz aristocracy and royalty \u2013 her mother, Kate Robbins, is a singer and actor; her dad, Keith Atack, a singer with the 70s band Child. Paul McCartney is a cousin twice removed; her aunt is Amy Robbins, who\u2019s been in pretty much every British TV show you could name. \u201cWe grew up in privilege, you know: we had this huge house. But we went to just a regular school, and we hung around with boys, smoking and drinking, with my parents\u2019 celeb mates going: \u2018Why aren\u2019t you sending them to a private school?\u2019 My parents really didn\u2019t want that. They wanted us to be classless. Do people say working-class any more? I went to school with working-class people, so in my head I was working class. Driving around in a shit Nova with naughty boys, I was known as the posh girl, but I was not posh.\u201d</p>    <p>In 2007, when she was 16, her parents had a \u201creally awful divorce \u2013 we lost everything. They\u2019re best mates now, so it all had a happy ending, but at the time, it was really, really difficult. We lost the house, my brother had to go live with my aunt and uncle. I dropped out of school. Me and my sister [Martha] moved to London, lived in a flat on our own and we didn\u2019t see our parents very much for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving school was not a big deal to Atack. \u201cI knew what I wanted to do, and I knew I didn\u2019t need a maths GCSE for it,\u201d and anyway, she says disarmingly, \u201call I was interested in was snogging boys. They literally took over my life, they were all I could think about. I was quite vain.\u201d She landed a part, almost immediately, in a show called Blue Murder, \u201cplaying a footballer\u2019s girlfriend, a bit naughty, a bit boisterous and aggressive. Fine, just put loads of makeup on.\u201d</p> <p>And then The Inbetweeners: it\u2019s arguably even more bizarre to look at this show, and Atack\u2019s role, from a modern vantage point, because it wasn\u2019t even that long ago (it was broadcast between 2008 and 2010). I\u2019m struggling to imagine a role in a family-ish show, now, being called Charlotte \u201cBig Jugs\u201d Hinchcliffe; as winningly as Atack plays her, the character had no arc of her own and existed purely as a vehicle to lampoon the hapless sexual awakening of the four male leads. But she fought hard for that part: \u201cI was a very vulnerable teenager, but there was an air of kind of naive confidence in me. I thought, \u2018I need this job, I need to pay my rent.\u2019 And from there, my life changed for ever.\u201d</p> <p>The Inbetweeners was an immediate success, and Atack was welcome everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden, I was getting recognised in the street; when I went to clubs and bars with my fake ID, because I was on TV, they\u2019d let me in, bring over a big bottle with a firework in it, because you\u2019re the girl from The Inbetweeners. I really enjoyed that people were really fun and nice to me.</p> <p>\u201cThis is where I get confused,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd I was confused then. I didn\u2019t have a clue. I was told, \u2018You\u2019ve got a photoshoot today\u2019 and it would be for Loaded magazine, or for FHM to promote series two of The Inbetweeners. So I was all, \u2018Yep, clothes off, bikini on. Whatever.\u2019 Genuinely, I had no problems with that \u2013 I enjoyed those shoots. I was celebrating my youth and my sexuality in beautiful locations, wearing gorgeous underwear, with lovely crews of people and photographers, and I fucking loved it. It was great. I naively didn\u2019t think what narrative was being painted for me.\u201d</p> <p>What came next, as she detailed in the 2020 BBC documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/31/emily-atack-asking-for-it-review-a-truly-sickening-look-at-the-torrent-of-sexual-images-online\">Asking For It</a>, was a torrent of online harassment and abuse, from fat-shaming to cyber-flashing. \u201cPeople go, \u2018How can you not expect it? You\u2019re stood up there in your pants, going, \u2018Look at me!\u2019 But in my head, I wasn\u2019t doing that. I wasn\u2019t putting myself out there in an overtly sexual way. Genuinely, I was just doing a photoshoot to promote my work.\u201d</p>    <p>In a pattern that will be familiar to observers of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, for whom dog-whistle racism in the tabloids turned into an onslaught of racial harassment on social media, the red tops would write an article about Atack\u2019s character, or her dating life, or her weight, and it would unleash hell (back in the 00s, on chat forums; later, on Instagram and Twitter). \u201cI\u2019d never had an issue with my weight before,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI\u2019d never even given it thought that I was overweight. I was a child, really. I was tiny. I must have been a size eight. And there was an article saying that I was overweight, then another, saying, \u2018But it is good that, for once, we\u2019re seeing a curvier girl playing one of the sexy roles.\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Am I curvy?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it was even a topic.\u201d Then screeds of people would be saying, \u201c\u2018She\u2019s clearly very overweight, this girl\u2019, \u2018She needs to lay off the bacon sandwiches.\u2019 All of a sudden, my weight was a thing. And since then, my weight has always been a thing.\u201d</p> <p>It made her insecure, \u201cbut the word I always land on\u201d, she says, \u201cis \u2018confused\u2019. When it came to press and headlines, I was either \u2018flaunting my ample assets\u2019, or they\u2019d deliberately try to get the most hideous photo of me with chins, bending over, so they\u2019d say, \u2018Pals fear for Emily as she gains weight.\u2019 But then, on the other hand, I was being put on the front cover of FHM as the sexiest woman in Britain. I just didn\u2019t get it. I didn\u2019t know if I was really beautiful or really ugly. The thing I was seeing in the mirror started to disintegrate and change. I\u2019d obviously been seeing something different to everybody else. I just didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>It was the same pattern with her love life \u2013 the 2010s featured endless round-ups of her dating history, always slightly insinuating. Did she know about so-and-so when she was seen with Seann Walsh; did she think Jack Grealish was single when they exchanged numbers? It was all sour, antiquated, scarlet-woman stuff, and even when she started dating Garner, \u201cthere were so many articles which were really hurtful, trying to make out there was something untoward about my relationship. There were headlines saying that I was dating my cousin, which is very damaging, very awful. We\u2019re not related in any way. I think some family members found that very tough.\u201d (Garner is Atack\u2019s aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s son by a previous marriage; so technically a step-cousin, if that\u2019s even a thing.)</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s anger towards women,\u201d she concludes. \u201cMen are so angry with sexy women. It\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019ll give you a little bit of power, but not too much. Here, you look nice on this front cover, but also, you\u2019re a fat, ugly pig.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>After The Inbetweeners, she did 13 films at a lick, \u201cplaying very similar roles: I was always the bit of totty.\u201d She was living in Kentish Town in north London with a gang of friends who had regular jobs, and felt blessed: still with the fireworks in a bottle whenever she went to a club, \u201ca jobbing actress, living off cheese boards and cheap red wine\u201d. These mainly British caper movies (Get Lucky, Outside Bet) \u201calways promised, \u2018This is going to be the film that will change your life for ever, that will send you to Hollywood,\u2019\u201d but Los Angeles was pretty brutal. \u201cI remember I went to one meeting and she said to me: we\u2019re not even going to think about seeing you again until you\u2019re a size two [the UK equivalent of a size six]. I was so thin, and I was so hungry, and it wasn\u2019t good enough. So I thought, \u2018I need to go home and have a cheeseburger.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Appearing on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! in 2018 was a turning point, and not just because, as she describes, \u201cnot too many people thought I was a bell-end, so I did really well in the jungle\u201d (she was the runner-up the year Harry Redknapp won). That led her to write a one-woman standup show, and landed her a TV comedy series, The Emily Atack Show.</p>    <p>\u201cEven though that was one of the best times of my life, I still got torn apart by men saying, \u2018Women aren\u2019t funny.\u2019 You think people don\u2019t say that any more; well, they do. If you look like me, if you wear fake tan and eyelashes and you watch Love Island, you can\u2019t do comedy, you know? But that\u2019s why I did my one-woman show, Talk 30 to Me, because I wanted to create comedy for those girls. It was for the false-eyelash-wearing, Love Island-watching, prosecco girls. There was no comedy for them.\u201d</p> <p>No question, Atack has come out on top. Rivals is the show of the year (for my money), work life is great, home life is great, her eyelashes are great \u2013 but what a trial she\u2019s had to get here. \u201cI\u2019m really standing firm in saying there is a massive issue here: misogyny isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she says. If living well is the best revenge, the best revenge against ambient, broad spectrum misogyny has to be living well as the bombshell in Rivals, surely?</p> <p>\u2022 Rivals is available exclusively on Disney+ from 18 October.</p>",

I\u2019m struggling to imagine a role in a family-ish show, now, being called Charlotte \u201cBig Jugs\u201d Hinchcliffe; as winningly as Atack plays her, the character had no arc of her own and existed purely as a vehicle to lampoon the hapless sexual awakening of the four male leads. But she fought hard for that part: \u201cI was a very vulnerable teenager, but there was an air of kind of naive confidence in me. I thought, \u2018I need this job, I need to pay my rent.\u2019 And from there, my life changed for ever.\u201d The Inbetweeners was an immediate success, and Atack was welcome everywhere. \u201cAll of a sudden, I was getting recognised in the street; when I went to clubs and bars with my fake ID, because I was on TV, they\u2019d let me in, bring over a big bottle with a firework in it, because you\u2019re the girl from The Inbetweeners. I really enjoyed that people were really fun and nice to me. \u201cThis is where I get confused,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd I was confused then. I didn\u2019t have a clue. I was told, \u2018You\u2019ve got a photoshoot today\u2019 and it would be for Loaded magazine, or for FHM to promote series two of The Inbetweeners. So I was all, \u2018Yep, clothes off, bikini on. Whatever.\u2019 Genuinely, I had no problems with that \u2013 I enjoyed those shoots. I was celebrating my youth and my sexuality in beautiful locations, wearing gorgeous underwear, with lovely crews of people and photographers, and I fucking loved it. It was great. I naively didn\u2019t think what narrative was being painted for me.\u201d What came next, as she detailed in the 2020 BBC documentary Asking For It, was a torrent of online harassment and abuse, from fat-shaming to cyber-flashing. \u201cPeople go, \u2018How can you not expect it? You\u2019re stood up there in your pants, going, \u2018Look at me!\u2019 But in my head, I wasn\u2019t doing that. I wasn\u2019t putting myself out there in an overtly sexual way. Genuinely, I was just doing a photoshoot to promote my work.\u201d In a pattern that will be familiar to observers of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, for whom dog-whistle racism in the tabloids turned into an onslaught of racial harassment on social media, the red tops would write an article about Atack\u2019s character, or her dating life, or her weight, and it would unleash hell (back in the 00s, on chat forums; later, on Instagram and Twitter). \u201cI\u2019d never had an issue with my weight before,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI\u2019d never even given it thought that I was overweight. I was a child, really. I was tiny. I must have been a size eight. And there was an article saying that I was overweight, then another, saying, \u2018But it is good that, for once, we\u2019re seeing a curvier girl playing one of the sexy roles.\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Am I curvy?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it was even a topic.\u201d Then screeds of people would be saying, \u201c\u2018She\u2019s clearly very overweight, this girl\u2019, \u2018She needs to lay off the bacon sandwiches.\u2019 All of a sudden, my weight was a thing. And since then, my weight has always been a thing.\u201d It made her insecure, \u201cbut the word I always land on\u201d, she says, \u201cis \u2018confused\u2019. When it came to press and headlines, I was either \u2018flaunting my ample assets\u2019, or they\u2019d deliberately try to get the most hideous photo of me with chins, bending over, so they\u2019d say, \u2018Pals fear for Emily as she gains weight.\u2019 But then, on the other hand, I was being put on the front cover of FHM as the sexiest woman in Britain. I just didn\u2019t get it. I didn\u2019t know if I was really beautiful or really ugly. The thing I was seeing in the mirror started to disintegrate and change. I\u2019d obviously been seeing something different to everybody else. I just didn\u2019t understand.\u201d It was the same pattern with her love life \u2013 the 2010s featured endless round-ups of her dating history, always slightly insinuating. Did she know about so-and-so when she was seen with Seann Walsh; did she think Jack Grealish was single when they exchanged numbers? It was all sour, antiquated, scarlet-woman stuff, and even when she started dating Garner, \u201cthere were so many articles which were really hurtful, trying to make out there was something untoward about my relationship. There were headlines saying that I was dating my cousin, which is very damaging, very awful. We\u2019re not related in any way. I think some family members found that very tough.\u201d (Garner is Atack\u2019s aunt\u2019s husband\u2019s son by a previous marriage; so technically a step-cousin, if that\u2019s even a thing.) \u201cIt\u2019s anger towards women,\u201d she concludes. \u201cMen are so angry with sexy women. It\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019ll give you a little bit of power, but not too much. Here, you look nice on this front cover, but also, you\u2019re a fat, ugly pig.\u2019\u201d After The Inbetweeners, she did 13 films at a lick, \u201cplaying very similar roles: I was always the bit of totty.\u201d She was living in Kentish Town in north London with a gang of friends who had regular jobs, and felt blessed: still with the fireworks in a bottle whenever she went to a club, \u201ca jobbing actress, living off cheese boards and cheap red wine\u201d. These mainly British caper movies (Get Lucky, Outside Bet) \u201calways promised, \u2018This is going to be the film that will change your life for ever, that will send you to Hollywood,\u2019\u201d but Los Angeles was pretty brutal. \u201cI remember I went to one meeting and she said to me: we\u2019re not even going to think about seeing you again until you\u2019re a size two [the UK equivalent of a size six]. I was so thin, and I was so hungry, and it wasn\u2019t good enough. So I thought, \u2018I need to go home and have a cheeseburger.\u2019\u201d Appearing on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! in 2018 was a turning point, and not just because, as she describes, \u201cnot too many people thought I was a bell-end, so I did really well in the jungle\u201d (she was the runner-up the year Harry Redknapp won). That led her to write a one-woman standup show, and landed her a TV comedy series, The Emily Atack Show. \u201cEven though that was one of the best times of my life, I still got torn apart by men saying, \u2018Women aren\u2019t funny.\u2019 You think people don\u2019t say that any more; well, they do. If you look like me, if you wear fake tan and eyelashes and you watch Love Island, you can\u2019t do comedy, you know? But that\u2019s why I did my one-woman show, Talk 30 to Me, because I wanted to create comedy for those girls. It was for the false-eyelash-wearing, Love Island-watching, prosecco girls. There was no comedy for them.\u201d No question, Atack has come out on top. Rivals is the show of the year (for my money), work life is great, home life is great, her eyelashes are great \u2013 but what a trial she\u2019s had to get here. \u201cI\u2019m really standing firm in saying there is a massive issue here: misogyny isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she says. If living well is the best revenge, the best revenge against ambient, broad spectrum misogyny has to be living well as the bombshell in Rivals, surely? \u2022 Rivals is available exclusively on Disney+ from 18 October.",

      "body": "<p>Eli Albag had been fighting for the release of his daughter from captivity in Gaza for almost a year when he was pelted with eggs and verbally abused.</p> <p>The father of Liri Albag, who is held hostage by Hamas, was protesting recently outside a political event attended by Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the coastal city of Netanya.</p> <p>There, he was attacked and shouted at by rightwing activists. \u201cYou\u2019ve made enough noise, be quiet,\u201d one told him. \u201cYou are cancer in the country,\u201d another called as he was accused of being \u201cfunded by Hamas\u201d.</p> <p>Now a full year into Israel\u2019s hostage crisis and war against Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on border communities during which 251 Israeli and other citizens were abducted, advocacy for the remaining captives has become more politicised as their situation has become ever more fraught.</p> <p>Incidents such as the targeting of Albag are rare amid broad support for the hostages\u2019 families, but relatives have watched as the focus has shifted from the Israeli operation against Gaza to the conflict with Hezbollah in the north, with no movement on those still held by Hamas.</p> <p>Over a long year, the hopes raised by the release of 117 hostages early in the war, including 105 in an exchange during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, have dissipated as the offensive has dragged on and more dead hostages than alive have been found during Israeli operations.</p> <p>The grim news over the fate of hostages found killed has punctuated the glacial pace of negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal that critics say Netanyahu has been in no hurry to advance. Some relatives of the remaining hostages have compared their situation with being trapped in a swamp, unable to move forward.</p> <p>In her new home in a kibbutz near Netanya, Batsheva Yahalomi knows what it is to see a child released, but also to have a husband who remains missing.</p> <p>They had lived in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/04/time-stopped-here-on-7-october-life-in-kibbutz-that-endured-unimaginable-loss-one-year-ago\">Nir Oz kibbutz</a>, where a quarter of the residents were killed or kidnapped. Batsheva\u2019s husband, Ohad, was wounded in the initial attack. In the chaos Batsheva and her two daughters were separated from her teenage son, Eitan, and taken towards the Gaza border by motorbike. She and her daughters managed to escape, but Eitan and Ohad were abducted by different groups of men.</p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning of war, I think the fact of the kidnappings and that children and women were taken was so shocking for everyone that it was urgent to get them out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Like many among the families of the remaining hostages, Batsheva has detected a subtle change in attitudes after the impetus for a deal under which more than 100 hostages were released. Support remains still strong, but momentum has faded as other considerations have crept in.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people, I think a small group of people in Israel, radical people, who have accepted situation that the hostages are there and think that there are bigger goals. But most people are supportive.</p>    <p>\u201cWe are all surprised how long the war in Gaza has gone on. It\u2019s terrifying, we know each day the hell the hostages are going through. The hardest thing is to understand how they are treated. Not humanely. But worse. Thinking that they are losing hope.\u201d</p> <p>Her son, who was released after 16 days alone with his captors, has started to lose his hair and has begun sleepwalking as a result of the stress he endured.</p> <p>\u201cThe children have so many questions about Ohad. Why is it taking so long? Will he come back? Is he alive, and if he is alive, how has he been treated?\u201d</p> <p>The last news she had of Ohad was in January. Since then there have been claims from inside Gaza that he was killed. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m really hopeful. And days when I\u2019m losing hope. But the longer it goes in on the more difficult it is to be hopeful,\u201d Batsheva said.</p> <p>Despite the continuing agony of not knowing, she is acutely conscious that some in Israeli society have misgivings about a hostage deal even if she is desperate for one to happen.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people in Israel still believe the country should pay even a big price to get the hostages back,\u201d she said. \u201cThe difference today is that there are small and more radical groups who you didn\u2019t hear from before in the immediate trauma of 7 October. Now you hear some people saying if you pay that price it can encourage the same thing to happen again.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation in Israel is very complicated, but I still hope that in closed rooms that everyone is doing their best. I prefer to be naive. I don\u2019t want to confront government because it does not help bring about a solution.\u201d</p> <p>In the headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Tel Aviv, Noam Peri, whose father, Chaim, a veteran peace activist, was kidnapped in Nir Oz aged 79, recently heard the news she hoped her family would be spared, that he had died in a cramped tunnel 20 metres underground.</p> <p>The posters of the hostages in the office of the forum dramatise the different outcomes in recent months annotated with a black marker pen, \u201cmurdered\u201d written on several, and on only one the words \u201cwelcome home\u201d.</p> <p>From the testimonies of released hostages and other information, Noam knows that her father probably survived in Gaza for at least four months. She also believes that opportunities were missed that could have saved him.</p>    <p>\u201cHe was a peace activist. He believed in humankind. I spoke yesterday with my mother, wondering if what he went through had changed how he felt. I think probably not. But I can\u2019t imagine what he went through. The parts I know are horrible.

      "bodyText": "Eli Albag had been fighting for the release of his daughter from captivity in Gaza for almost a year when he was pelted with eggs and verbally abused. The father of Liri Albag, who is held hostage by Hamas, was protesting recently outside a political event attended by Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in the coastal city of Netanya. There, he was attacked and shouted at by rightwing activists. \u201cYou\u2019ve made enough noise, be quiet,\u201d one told him. \u201cYou are cancer in the country,\u201d another called as he was accused of being \u201cfunded by Hamas\u201d. Now a full year into Israel\u2019s hostage crisis and war against Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on border communities during which 251 Israeli and other citizens were abducted, advocacy for the remaining captives has become more politicised as their situation has become ever more fraught. Incidents such as the targeting of Albag are rare amid broad support for the hostages\u2019 families, but relatives have watched as the focus has shifted from the Israeli operation against Gaza to the conflict with Hezbollah in the north, with no movement on those still held by Hamas. Over a long year, the hopes raised by the release of 117 hostages early in the war, including 105 in an exchange during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, have dissipated as the offensive has dragged on and more dead hostages than alive have been found during Israeli operations. The grim news over the fate of hostages found killed has punctuated the glacial pace of negotiations for a ceasefire-for-hostages deal that critics say Netanyahu has been in no hurry to advance. Some relatives of the remaining hostages have compared their situation with being trapped in a swamp, unable to move forward. In her new home in a kibbutz near Netanya, Batsheva Yahalomi knows what it is to see a child released, but also to have a husband who remains missing. They had lived in Nir Oz kibbutz, where a quarter of the residents were killed or kidnapped. Batsheva\u2019s husband, Ohad, was wounded in the initial attack. In the chaos Batsheva and her two daughters were separated from her teenage son, Eitan, and taken towards the Gaza border by motorbike. She and her daughters managed to escape, but Eitan and Ohad were abducted by different groups of men. \u201cAt the beginning of war, I think the fact of the kidnappings and that children and women were taken was so shocking for everyone that it was urgent to get them out,\u201d she said. Like many among the families of the remaining hostages, Batsheva has detected a subtle change in attitudes after the impetus for a deal under which more than 100 hostages were released. Support remains still strong, but momentum has faded as other considerations have crept in. \u201cThere are people, I think a small group of people in Israel, radical people, who have accepted situation that the hostages are there and think that there are bigger goals. But most people are supportive. \u201cWe are all surprised how long the war in Gaza has gone on. It\u2019s terrifying, we know each day the hell the hostages are going through. The hardest thing is to understand how they are treated. Not humanely. But worse. Thinking that they are losing hope.\u201d Her son, who was released after 16 days alone with his captors, has started to lose his hair and has begun sleepwalking as a result of the stress he endured. \u201cThe children have so many questions about Ohad. Why is it taking so long? Will he come back? Is he alive, and if he is alive, how has he been treated?\u201d The last news she had of Ohad was in January. Since then there have been claims from inside Gaza that he was killed. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m really hopeful. And days when I\u2019m losing hope. But the longer it goes in on the more difficult it is to be hopeful,\u201d Batsheva said. Despite the continuing agony of not knowing, she is acutely conscious that some in Israeli society have misgivings about a hostage deal even if she is desperate for one to happen. \u201cI think most people in Israel still believe the country should pay even a big price to get the hostages back,\u201d she said. \u201cThe difference today is that there are small and more radical groups who you didn\u2019t hear from before in the immediate trauma of 7 October. Now you hear some people saying if you pay that price it can encourage the same thing to happen again. \u201cThe situation in Israel is very complicated, but I still hope that in closed rooms that everyone is doing their best. I prefer to be naive. I don\u2019t want to confront government because it does not help bring about a solution.\u201d In the headquarters of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Tel Aviv, Noam Peri, whose father, Chaim, a veteran peace activist, was kidnapped in Nir Oz aged 79, recently heard the news she hoped her family would be spared, that he had died in a cramped tunnel 20 metres underground. The posters of the hostages in the office of the forum dramatise the different outcomes in recent months annotated with a black marker pen, \u201cmurdered\u201d written on several, and on only one the words \u201cwelcome home\u201d. From the testimonies of released hostages and other information, Noam knows that her father probably survived in Gaza for at least four months. She also believes that opportunities were missed that could have saved him. \u201cHe was a peace activist. He believed in humankind. I spoke yesterday with my mother, wondering if what he went through had changed how he felt. I think probably not. But I can\u2019t imagine what he went through. The parts I know are horrible. I know he was taken alive. I know he was beaten on the motorcycle that took him. I know he was taken to the tunnels. 18 December was the last sign of life. Then on 3 June we were informed he was killed in captivity. \u201cIt is a fact my father and those he was with were alive for a long period. I won\u2019t pretend that I know about specific actions, opportunities and what was on the table, but I know that there were opportunities.\u201d Noam describes meetings with diplomats and officials, including with Netanyahu. \u201cThe only person I haven\u2019t met is [the Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar. If I am mad at the Israeli side, it is because it is the only side I can have expectations of.\u201d For Noam, if there was a missed opportunity it was in the weeks after the negotiated release of hostages in November. \u201cI think we were a bit naive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could see the release had happened and thought if we just work a bit more, if there is a bit more military pressure then we can go back to the negotiating.\u201d On the issue of military pressure, Noam is conflicted. \u201cI think we believed that military pressure was a necessary condition and of course we were frightened about military activity and rightly so because we know the results. Now I am angry because of the result of that pressure \u2026 yes, it killed my father. I can\u2019t not be angry because my father and most of the other hostages who were murdered, that was related directly or indirectly\u201d to that pressure. For Aviva Siegel, who was held hostage for 51 days before being released as part of the November exchange, the knowledge that her husband, Keith, is still captive is painfully and visibly raw. \u201cTime is just going by. It\u2019s running out. Every day he is losing more weight and losing hope. It\u2019s just cruel to think of the terrible conditions. I was there 51 days and I lost 10 kilos. We don\u2019t know anything. I don\u2019t know if he is alone. \u201cI\u2019m still in Gaza.

Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel launched fresh strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Sunday, a day after heavy consecutive strikes on the Lebanese capital. </strong>Israeli jets launched a strike targeting the Saint Therese area, and a second targeting the Burj al-Barajneh area, Lebanese state media reported, as well as two additional strikes, including one it described as \u201cviolent\u201d. Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh were keeping rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night\u2019s attack.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hezbollah said it targeted an Israeli military base near the northern city of Haifa late on Sunday, the third attack on a military position in the area in one day. </strong>Five people were wounded in the rocket attack, the Times of Israel reported. Police said that some buildings and properties were damaged.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d around three towns on the border with Lebanon and issued new evacuation orders for areas in southern Lebanon on Sunday. </strong>In a statement, the IDF said it is \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d to enter the communities of Manara, Yiftach, and Malkia. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered residents of about 25 areas in southern Lebanon to head immediately to the north of the Awali river.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel expanded its actions in Lebanon, making its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli on Saturday, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south. </strong>A Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday\u2019s strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as <strong>Saeed Atallah.</strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN\u2019s peacekeeping force in Lebanon (Unifil) has said it is deeply concerned by what it called Israel\u2019s \u201crecent activities\u201d adjacent to the mission\u2019s position inside Lebanon. </strong>Unifil said on Sunday that the activities by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are an \u201cextremely dangerous development\u201d as it \u201curgently\u201d reminded all actors of \u201ctheir obligations to protect UN personnel and property.\u201d Ireland\u2019s president, <strong>Michael D Higgins,</strong> said it is \u201coutrageous\u201d for the IDF to have \u201cthreatened\u201d Unifil.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon nearly a year of fighting, most of them in the past two weeks,</strong> according to the Lebanese health ministry. The ministry said on Sunday 23 people had been killed on Saturday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The latest Israeli strikes on Beirut came after days of Israeli bombing that killed the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor, Hashem Safieddine.</strong> A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Safieddine had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city\u2019s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have shattered Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. On Sunday, the Israeli foreign ministry said its air force killed Hezbollah commander, <strong>Hader Ali Taweel</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza since 7 October,</strong> according to latest figures released by Gaza\u2019s health ministry on Sunday. The health ministry also reported at least 97,166 people have been injured. Thousands more are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel issued a new blanket evacuation order for all of the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday,</strong> <strong>where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain</strong>. \u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the Israeli military said in leaflets dropped over the area. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million people fleeing to the south, even though people say there is nowhere safe to go.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>For the first time in months, Israel sent a column of tanks into northern Gaza and launched major operations there, surrounding Jabalia, the largest of strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. </strong>Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 24 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, was being used to house displaced people. The Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Palestinians across northern Gaza have been told to flee to al-Mawasi on the southern coast, a so-called \u201chumanitarian area\u201d where an estimated one million displaced people are sheltering</strong>. Mawasi, which has been the target of deadly Israeli airstrikes, is severely overcrowded and aid agencies struggle to provide even the most basic services. In May, an aid worker described to the Guardian the \u201chorrific and dehumanising\u201d conditions, with limited food, filthy and scarce water, overwhelmed healthcare facilities and almost no sanitation.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said that Lebanon is seeing a \u201cmajor displacement crisis\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s escalating airstrikes, some of which have violated international law. </strong>About 40% of Lebanon\u2019s 1.25 million school pupils have become displaced by ongoing Israeli attacks, Lebanon\u2019s director general of education, <strong>Imad Achkar</strong>, said. The Lebanese government has said schools will postpone the start of the academic year due to intensifying Israeli airstrikes. Israeli strikes have forced 1.2 million people \u2013 almost a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population \u2013 from their homes, officials say. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been forcibly displaced by Israeli airstrikes on camps in Lebanon.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli authorities said they were on the lookout for attacks timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks on Monday. </strong>One woman was killed and 10 people were wounded in the suspected terror attack on Sunday at the central bus station in Be\u2019er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert in southern Israel, the second attack in the last week. Israel\u2019s military reportedly said it anticipates possible long-range rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Syria\u2019s defence ministry said Israel launched airstrikes on military positions in central Syria on Sunday, causing \u201cmaterial damage\u201d. </strong>\u201cIsraeli strikes\u201d targeted a \u201cweapons depot south of Homs and a rockets depot in the eastern Hama countryside,\u201d <strong>Rami Abdel Rahman,</strong> head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights War Monitor, told AFP.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran,</strong> but that Israel will make its own independent decisions about how to retaliate. Despite the US having made clear that it opposes a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Gallant told CNN on Sunday that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. Gallant is expected to visit the US this coming week where he is scheduled to meet with the US defense secretary, <strong>Lloyd Austin. </strong>In a statement on Sunday, Gallant warned Iran that it may end up like Gaza or Beirut if it attempts to harm Israel.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said Washington will not stop putting pressure on Israel and Arab leaders during ongoing diplomatic efforts</strong>. Harris was asked, in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d if the US has a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Netanyahu, to which she responded: \u201cThe better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? The answer to that question is yes.\u201d</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The last currently scheduled plane for British nationals leaving Lebanon landed in Birmingham airport on Sunday night. </strong>The flight was the fourth charter flight to have left Beirut for the UK. There are no further flights scheduled, the UK Foreign Office said, citing a reduction in demand but it said the situation will be \u201cclosely\u201d monitored. In addition, the UK has advised its citizens on Sunday against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UK government is advising Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d as Keir Starmer warned that \u201csparks\u201d\u2019 from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d. Peter Kyle</strong>, a UK cabinet minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/uk-urges-israel-to-show-restraint-amid-fears-middle-east-conflict-could-spread\">did not rule out</a> the possibility of the UK military helping Israel attack Iran, but noted any \u201coperational decision to be taken\u201d would be based on \u201cdelicate negotiations\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A call by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for a halt in arms supplies to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with an angry rebuttal from Benjamin Netanyahu. </strong>\u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. The pair spoke on Sunday in a call that the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace described as \u201cfrank\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Thousands of protesters took to the streets in major cities around the world for a second day on Sunday</strong> to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza and the wider Middle East as the start of Israel\u2019s war in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila, Cape Town, New York City, Sydney and Melbourne.</p></li> \n   <li><p><em>This post was amended on 7 October 2024.

Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel issued a new blanket evacuation order for all of the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday,</strong> <strong>where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain</strong>. \u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the Israeli military said in leaflets dropped over the area. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million people fleeing to the south, even though people say there is nowhere safe to go.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>For the first time in months, Israel sent a column of tanks into northern Gaza and launched major operations there, surrounding Jabalia, the largest of strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. </strong>Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 24 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, was being used to house displaced people. The Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre. </p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Palestinians across northern Gaza have been told to flee to al-Mawasi on the southern coast, a so-called \u201chumanitarian area\u201d where an estimated one million displaced people are sheltering</strong>. Mawasi, which has been the target of deadly Israeli airstrikes, is severely overcrowded and aid agencies struggle to provide even the most basic services. In May, an aid worker described to the Guardian the \u201chorrific and dehumanising\u201d conditions, with limited food, filthy and scarce water, overwhelmed healthcare facilities and almost no sanitation.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza since 7 October,</strong> according to latest figures released by Gaza\u2019s health ministry on Sunday. The health ministry also reported at least 97,166 people have been injured. Thousands more are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon nearly a year of fighting, most of them in the past two weeks,</strong> according to the Lebanese health ministry. The ministry said on Sunday 23 people had been killed on Saturday. </p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d around three towns on the border with Lebanon and issued new evacuation orders for areas in southern Lebanon on Sunday. </strong>In a statement, the IDF said it is \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d to enter the communities of Manara, Yiftach, and Malkia. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered residents of about 25 areas in southern Lebanon to head immediately to the north of the Awali river. Israel\u2019s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu,</strong> visited troops along the border with Lebanon on Sunday, where he told them that \u201cTogether we will fight, and together we will win.\u201d</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN\u2019s peacekeeping force in Lebanon (Unifil) has said it is deeply concerned by what it called Israel\u2019s \u201crecent activities\u201d adjacent to the mission\u2019s position inside Lebanon. </strong>Unifil said on Sunday that the activities by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are an \u201cextremely dangerous development\u201d as it \u201curgently\u201d reminded all actors of \u201ctheir obligations to protect UN personnel and property.\u201d Ireland\u2019s president, <strong>Michael D Higgins,</strong> said it is \u201coutrageous\u201d for the IDF to have \u201cthreatened\u201d Unifil.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Heavy consecutive Israeli strikes on Saturday night sent shock waves across the Lebanese capital, following days of Israeli bombing in suburbs of the city that are thought to be Hezbollah strongholds. </strong>In the Lebanese capital, the Israeli strikes sent booms across the city and sparked flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometres away. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency called it the \u201cmost severe\u201d bombing of the war. Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh were keeping rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night\u2019s attack. </p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Israeli strikes on Beirut came after days of Israeli bombing that killed the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor, Hashem Safieddine.</strong> A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Safieddine had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city\u2019s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have shattered Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. On Sunday, the Israeli foreign ministry said its air force killed Hezbollah commander, <strong>Hader Ali Taweel</strong>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel expanded its actions in Lebanon, making its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli on Saturday, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south. </strong>A Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday\u2019s strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as <strong>Saeed Atallah.</strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>In northern Israel, air raid sirens on Saturday sent people running for shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon.</strong> Hezbollah said it had fired missiles at what it called \u201cATA company for military industries near Sakhnin base\u201d, close to Haifa.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said that Lebanon is seeing a \u201cmajor displacement crisis\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s escalating airstrikes, some of which have violated international law. </strong>About 40% of Lebanon\u2019s 1.25 million school pupils have become displaced by ongoing Israeli attacks, Lebanon\u2019s director general of education, <strong>Imad Achkar</strong>, said. The Lebanese government has said schools will postpone the start of the academic year due to intensifying Israeli airstrikes. Israeli strikes have forced 1.2 million people \u2013 almost a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population \u2013 from their homes, officials say. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been forcibly displaced by Israeli airstrikes on camps in Lebanon.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli authorities said they were on the lookout for attacks timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks on Monday. </strong>One woman was killed and 10 people were wounded in the suspected terror attack on Sunday at the central bus station in Be\u2019er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert in southern Israel, the second attack in the last week. Israel\u2019s military reportedly said it anticipates possible long-range rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Najib Mikati, the caretaker Lebanese prime minister, said that his government continues to support the \u201cjoint call for a ceasefire\u201d</strong> which was launched last week by France and the US. Mikati said a diplomatic end to the escalating war would be a \u201cwin-win\u201d for Israel and Lebanon and that \u201call parties\u201d would respect such a deal. He said he hoped to deploy 10,000 Lebanese army troops in the south if a ceasefire is agreed.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Syria\u2019s defence ministry said Israel launched airstrikes on military positions in central Syria on Sunday, causing \u201cmaterial damage\u201d. </strong>\u201cIsraeli strikes\u201d targeted a \u201cweapons depot south of Homs and a rockets depot in the eastern Hama countryside,\u201d <strong>Rami Abdel Rahman,</strong> head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights War Monitor, told AFP.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran,</strong> but that Tel Aviv will make its own independent decisions about how to retaliate. Despite the US having made clear that it opposes a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Gallant told CNN on Sunday that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. Gallant is expected to visit the US this coming week where he is scheduled to meet with the US defense secretary, <strong>Lloyd Austin. </strong>In a statement on Sunday, Gallant warned Iran that it may end up like Gaza or Beirut if it attempts to harm Israel.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said Washington will not stop putting pressure on Israel and Arab leaders during ongoing diplomatic efforts</strong>. Harris was asked, in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d if the US has a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Netanyahu, to which she responded: \u201cThe better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? The answer to that question is yes.\u201d</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UK government is advising Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d as Keir Starmer warned that \u201csparks\u201d\u2019 from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d. Peter Kyle</strong>, a UK cabinet minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/06/uk-urges-israel-to-show-restraint-amid-fears-middle-east-conflict-could-spread\">did not rule out</a> the possibility of the UK military helping Israel attack Iran, but noted any \u201coperational decision to be taken\u201d would be based on \u201cdelicate negotiations\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A call by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for a halt in arms supplies to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with an angry rebuttal from Benjamin Netanyahu. </strong>\u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. The pair spoke on Sunday in a call that the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace described as \u201cfrank\u201d.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Thousands of protesters took to the streets in major cities around the world for a second day on Sunday</strong> to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza and the wider Middle East as the start of Israel\u2019s war in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila, Cape Town, New York City, Sydney and Melbourne.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6702edfa8f0809b6ab31bcc6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-06T20:13:48.555Z\">9.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Israeli airstrikes hit central Syria, says Syrian defence ministry</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Syria</strong>\u2019s defence ministry said <strong>Israel l</strong>aunched airstrikes on military positions in central Syria on Sunday, causing \u201cmaterial damage\u201d.</p> \n  <p>A statement by the Syrian defence ministry said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At approximately 20:05 (17:05 GMT) the Israeli enemy launched an air aggression coming from the direction of north Lebanon, which targeted military sites in the central region, causing material losses.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Syrian state media earlier reported that Syrian air defences were intercepting \u201chostile targets\u201d in central Syria.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIsraeli strikes\u201d targeted a \u201cweapons depot south of Homs and a rockets depot in the eastern Hama countryside,\u201d <strong>Rami Abdel Rahman,</strong> head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights War Monitor, told AFP.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6702e9de8f0818b7c81cddc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ruth-michaelson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-06T19:52:38.304Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As a powerful barrage of <strong>Israel</strong>i airstrikes pummelled <strong>Beirut</strong>\u2019s southern suburbs overnight, cousins <strong>Nader Ismail</strong> and <strong>Lyne Nassar</strong> sat on a balcony in a nearby Baabda overwhelmed with shock. </p> \n  <p>Ismail said the terror made him freeze where he sat, while Nassar said she stood up suddenly before sitting down and attempting to calm herself about what is now a near nightly occurrence.

Iranian authorities have confirmed the resumption of air traffic after flight cancellations at some airports over \u201coperational restrictions\u201d, state media is reporting according to AFP. Flights have been operational again since 11pm (1930 GMT) on Sunday and were being \u201ccarried out in accordance with the flight schedule\u201d, said Jafar Yazarloo, spokesman for Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation, quoted by the Irna state news agency. The Israeli military\u2019s blanket call for civilians to evacuate from northern Gaza may be part of a plan published by retired military commanders last month to put Hamas militants who remain in the area under siege in order to force the release of hostages. The Likud MP Avichai Boaron told the Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo last month that the plan was being evaluated by the government. He said: According to the plan, the IDF will evacuate all the civilians who are in the north of Gaza, from the border to the Gaza River \u2026 And after they will evacuate, the IDF will assume that only the terrorists will remain. When the civilians population has left, you can find and kill all the terrorists without harming the civilians. The plan does not tackle the question of what would happen to Palestinian civilians who are unable or unwilling to leave, or how it will help with releasing the hostages. Between 300,000 and 500,000 Palestinians are though to remain in northern Gaza under increasingly ire humanitarian conditions, though exact circumstances are difficult to verify as Israel does not allow in foreign journalists. You can read Lorenzo\u2019s full report here: And some pictures from Haifa, where at least five people were injured in a rocket attack launched from Lebanon: Some more footage from the scene of one of the rocket explosions in Haifa: One person is in a \u201cmoderate to serious\u201d condition following a rocket attack launched from Lebanon on the northern Israeli city of Tiberias, the Times of Israel is reporting, citing a local ambulance service. Israeli media reported that several explosions had taken place in the city, citing police. The Israeli military has claimed in a statement that its latest attacks on Beirut targeted Hezbollah\u2019s headquarters as well as the militant organisation\u2019s \u201cmunitions warehouses in the Beirut area\u201d. It claimed that secondary explosions in the areas targeted indicated the presence of weapons. It also said its warplanes were continuing to attack targets in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa valley region, about 30km east of Beirut, \u201c including munitions warehouses, military buildings, a headquarters and a launcher\u201d. \u201cFighter planes continue to attack Lebanon even at this time,\u201d it said in a post on X. It\u2019s 1.30am in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israel launched fresh strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Sunday, a day after heavy consecutive strikes on the Lebanese capital. Israeli jets launched a strike targeting the Saint Therese area, and a second targeting the Burj al-Barajneh area, Lebanese state media reported, as well as two additional strikes, including one it described as \u201cviolent\u201d. Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh were keeping rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night\u2019s attack. Hezbollah said it targeted an Israeli military base near the northern city of Haifa late on Sunday, the third attack on a military position in the area in one day. Five people were wounded in the rocket attack, the Times of Israel reported. Police said that some buildings and properties were damaged. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d around three towns on the border with Lebanon and issued new evacuation orders for areas in southern Lebanon on Sunday. In a statement, the IDF said it is \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d to enter the communities of Manara, Yiftach, and Malkia. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered residents of about 25 areas in southern Lebanon to head immediately to the north of the Awali river. Israel expanded its actions in Lebanon, making its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli on Saturday, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday\u2019s strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as Saeed Atallah. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping force in Lebanon (Unifil) has said it is deeply concerned by what it called Israel\u2019s \u201crecent activities\u201d adjacent to the mission\u2019s position inside Lebanon. Unifil said on Sunday that the activities by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are an \u201cextremely dangerous development\u201d as it \u201curgently\u201d reminded all actors of \u201ctheir obligations to protect UN personnel and property.\u201d Ireland\u2019s president, Michael D Higgins, said it is \u201coutrageous\u201d for the IDF to have \u201cthreatened\u201d Unifil. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon nearly a year of fighting, most of them in the past two weeks, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The ministry said on Sunday 23 people had been killed on Saturday. The latest Israeli strikes on Beirut came after days of Israeli bombing that killed the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor, Hashem Safieddine. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Safieddine had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city\u2019s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have shattered Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. On Sunday, the Israeli foreign ministry said its air force killed Hezbollah commander, Hader Ali Taweel. At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza since 7 October, according to latest figures released by Gaza\u2019s health ministry on Sunday. The health ministry also reported at least 97,166 people have been injured. Thousands more are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. Israel issued a new blanket evacuation order for all of the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain. \u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the Israeli military said in leaflets dropped over the area. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million people fleeing to the south, even though people say there is nowhere safe to go. For the first time in months, Israel sent a column of tanks into northern Gaza and launched major operations there, surrounding Jabalia, the largest of strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 24 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, was being used to house displaced people. The Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre. Palestinians across northern Gaza have been told to flee to al-Mawasi on the southern coast, a so-called \u201chumanitarian area\u201d where an estimated one million displaced people are sheltering. Mawasi, which has been the target of deadly Israeli airstrikes, is severely overcrowded and aid agencies struggle to provide even the most basic services. In May, an aid worker described to the Guardian the \u201chorrific and dehumanising\u201d conditions, with limited food, filthy and scarce water, overwhelmed healthcare facilities and almost no sanitation. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said that Lebanon is seeing a \u201cmajor displacement crisis\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s escalating airstrikes, some of which have violated international law. About 40% of Lebanon\u2019s 1.25 million school pupils have become displaced by ongoing Israeli attacks, Lebanon\u2019s director general of education, Imad Achkar, said. The Lebanese government has said schools will postpone the start of the academic year due to intensifying Israeli airstrikes. Israeli strikes have forced 1.2 million people \u2013 almost a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population \u2013 from their homes, officials say. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been forcibly displaced by Israeli airstrikes on camps in Lebanon. Israeli authorities said they were on the lookout for attacks timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks on Monday. One woman was killed and 10 people were wounded in the suspected terror attack on Sunday at the central bus station in Be\u2019er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert in southern Israel, the second attack in the last week. Israel\u2019s military reportedly said it anticipates possible long-range rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. Syria\u2019s defence ministry said Israel launched airstrikes on military positions in central Syria on Sunday, causing \u201cmaterial damage\u201d. \u201cIsraeli strikes\u201d targeted a \u201cweapons depot south of Homs and a rockets depot in the eastern Hama countryside,\u201d Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights War Monitor, told AFP. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but that Israel will make its own independent decisions about how to retaliate. Despite the US having made clear that it opposes a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Gallant told CNN on Sunday that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. Gallant is expected to visit the US this coming week where he is scheduled to meet with the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. In a statement on Sunday, Gallant warned Iran that it may end up like Gaza or Beirut if it attempts to harm Israel. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said Washington will not stop putting pressure on Israel and Arab leaders during ongoing diplomatic efforts. Harris was asked, in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d if the US has a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Netanyahu, to which she responded: \u201cThe better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? The answer to that question is yes.\u201d The last currently scheduled plane for British nationals leaving Lebanon landed in Birmingham airport on Sunday night. The flight was the fourth charter flight to have left Beirut for the UK. There are no further flights scheduled, the UK Foreign Office said, citing a reduction in demand but it said the situation will be \u201cclosely\u201d monitored. In addition, the UK has advised its citizens on Sunday against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The UK government is advising Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d as Keir Starmer warned that \u201csparks\u201d\u2019 from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d. Peter Kyle, a UK cabinet minister, did not rule out the possibility of the UK military helping Israel attack Iran, but noted any \u201coperational decision to be taken\u201d would be based on \u201cdelicate negotiations\u201d. A call by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for a halt in arms supplies to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with an angry rebuttal from Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. The pair spoke on Sunday in a call that the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace described as \u201cfrank\u201d. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in major cities around the world for a second day on Sunday to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza and the wider Middle East as the start of Israel\u2019s war in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila, Cape Town, New York City, Sydney and Melbourne. This post was amended on 7 October 2024. An earlier version said \u201cTel Aviv\u201d would decide on how to retaliate against Iran: Israel\u2019s seat of government is in Jerusalem. Israel launched four strikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Sunday, according to Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency (NNA). Israeli jets launched a strike targeting the Saint Therese area, and a second targeting the Burj al-Barajneh area, it reported. It later reported two additional strikes, including one it described as \u201cviolent\u201d. The strikes came shortly after an Israeli military spokesperson issued immediate evacuation orders to residents of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, added: You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, and the IDF (Israeli military) will operate against them in the near future. The latest strikes came after Israel launched airstrikes in the night from Saturday to Sunday in what NNA called the \u201cmost severe\u201d bombing of the war. The last currently scheduled plane for British nationals leaving Lebanon has landed in Birmingham airport. The flight was the fourth charter flight to have left Beirut for the UK. There are no further flights scheduled, the UK Foreign Office said, citing a reduction in demand but it said the situation will be \u201cclosely\u201d monitored. It said that the UK has \u201chelped over 430 people to leave Lebanon\u201d over the last week. British nationals who remain in Lebanon are advised to register their presence to receive up-to-date information, and to take the \u201cnext available commercial flight\u201d. Hezbollah said it targeted an Israeli military base near the northern city of Haifa, the third attack on a military position in the area in one day. Hezbollah fighters launched \u201ca salvo of Fadi 1 rockets at the Carmel base south of Haifa,\u201d the group said in a statement, AFP reported. Five people were wounded in the rocket attack, the Times of Israel reported, citing Ramban hospital. The UK has advised its citizens on Sunday against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories due to a heightened state of tension and violent clashes in the region. A statement from the Foreign Office said it \u201cadvises against all travel to the area close to the border with Gaza and all but essential travel to the rest of Israel and the OPTs.\u201d Here are some of the latest images from the newswires from Beirut, after Israel launched fresh strikes on the Lebanese capital\u2019s southern suburbs. A Hezbollah official has accused Israel of obstructing search and rescue efforts in an area where senior Hezbollah leader, Hashem Safieddine, is thought to have been during Israeli airstrikes on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs on Thursday. Safieddine, the most likely candidate to replace Hassan Nasrallah as leader of Hezbollah and the head of its executive council, was the target of one of the most intense Israeli bombardments on the city since the campaign began last week. Safieddine\u2019s fate remains unclear. Mahmolud Qmati, a senior Hezbollah political official, told Iraqi state media that Israel should \u201clet rescue teams do their work, Reuters reported. Hezbollah was now being jointly led until it could pick a new leader, which would take time, he saidm adding: The method of choosing a replacement for the secretary-general takes time and requires appropriate circumstances, and for that reason we suffice today with temporary joint command. Qmati said Nasrallah\u2019s body remained in Lebanon and that he would be laid to rest in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, when conditions allowed. Israeli strikes have struck Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs late on Sunday. Loud blasts were heard and fireballs seen above the darkened skyline, according to Reuters\u2019 Timour Azhari. We reported earlier that Iran\u2019s aviation body announced the cancellation of flights at the country\u2019s airports, citing \u201coperational restrictions\u201d. Flight restrictions have now been lifted after ensuring safe conditions, according to state media reports. Two airports in the capital Tehran \u2013 Mehrabad and Imam Khomeini \u2013 have resumed flights, the BBC reported. It\u2019s nearly midnight in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Israel issued a new blanket evacuation order for all of the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, where hundreds of thousands of civilians remain. \u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the Israeli military said in leaflets dropped over the area. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million people fleeing to the south, even though people say there is nowhere safe to go. For the first time in months, Israel sent a column of tanks into northern Gaza and launched major operations there, surrounding Jabalia, the largest of strip\u2019s eight historic refugee camps. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 24 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, was being used to house displaced people. The Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre. Palestinians across northern Gaza have been told to flee to al-Mawasi on the southern coast, a so-called \u201chumanitarian area\u201d where an estimated one million displaced people are sheltering. Mawasi, which has been the target of deadly Israeli airstrikes, is severely overcrowded and aid agencies struggle to provide even the most basic services. In May, an aid worker described to the Guardian the \u201chorrific and dehumanising\u201d conditions, with limited food, filthy and scarce water, overwhelmed healthcare facilities and almost no sanitation. At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza since 7 October, according to latest figures released by Gaza\u2019s health ministry on Sunday. The health ministry also reported at least 97,166 people have been injured. Thousands more are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon nearly a year of fighting, most of them in the past two weeks, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The ministry said on Sunday 23 people had been killed on Saturday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d around three towns on the border with Lebanon and issued new evacuation orders for areas in southern Lebanon on Sunday. In a statement, the IDF said it is \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d to enter the communities of Manara, Yiftach, and Malkia. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson ordered residents of about 25 areas in southern Lebanon to head immediately to the north of the Awali river. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited troops along the border with Lebanon on Sunday, where he told them that \u201cTogether we will fight, and together we will win.\u201d The UN\u2019s peacekeeping force in Lebanon (Unifil) has said it is deeply concerned by what it called Israel\u2019s \u201crecent activities\u201d adjacent to the mission\u2019s position inside Lebanon. Unifil said on Sunday that the activities by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are an \u201cextremely dangerous development\u201d as it \u201curgently\u201d reminded all actors of \u201ctheir obligations to protect UN personnel and property.\u201d Ireland\u2019s president, Michael D Higgins, said it is \u201coutrageous\u201d for the IDF to have \u201cthreatened\u201d Unifil. Heavy consecutive Israeli strikes on Saturday night sent shock waves across the Lebanese capital, following days of Israeli bombing in suburbs of the city that are thought to be Hezbollah strongholds. In the Lebanese capital, the Israeli strikes sent booms across the city and sparked flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometres away. Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency called it the \u201cmost severe\u201d bombing of the war. Lebanese security sources said Israeli strikes since Friday on Dahiyeh were keeping rescue workers from scouring the site of Thursday night\u2019s attack. The Israeli strikes on Beirut came after days of Israeli bombing that killed the Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor, Hashem Safieddine. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Safieddine had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city\u2019s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have shattered Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. On Sunday, the Israeli foreign ministry said its air force killed Hezbollah commander, Hader Ali Taweel. Israel expanded its actions in Lebanon, making its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli on Saturday, and Israeli troops launched raids in the south. A Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturday\u2019s strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing, naming him as Saeed Atallah. In northern Israel, air raid sirens on Saturday sent people running for shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon. Hezbollah said it had fired missiles at what it called \u201cATA company for military industries near Sakhnin base\u201d, close to Haifa. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said that Lebanon is seeing a \u201cmajor displacement crisis\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s escalating airstrikes, some of which have violated international law. About 40% of Lebanon\u2019s 1.25 million school pupils have become displaced by ongoing Israeli attacks, Lebanon\u2019s director general of education, Imad Achkar, said. The Lebanese government has said schools will postpone the start of the academic year due to intensifying Israeli airstrikes. Israeli strikes have forced 1.2 million people \u2013 almost a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population \u2013 from their homes, officials say. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been forcibly displaced by Israeli airstrikes on camps in Lebanon. Israeli authorities said they were on the lookout for attacks timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks on Monday. One woman was killed and 10 people were wounded in the suspected terror attack on Sunday at the central bus station in Be\u2019er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert in southern Israel, the second attack in the last week. Israel\u2019s military reportedly said it anticipates possible long-range rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. Najib Mikati, the caretaker Lebanese prime minister, said that his government continues to support the \u201cjoint call for a ceasefire\u201d which was launched last week by France and the US. Mikati said a diplomatic end to the escalating war would be a \u201cwin-win\u201d for Israel and Lebanon and that \u201call parties\u201d would respect such a deal. He said he hoped to deploy 10,000 Lebanese army troops in the south if a ceasefire is agreed. Syria\u2019s defence ministry said Israel launched airstrikes on military positions in central Syria on Sunday, causing \u201cmaterial damage\u201d. \u201cIsraeli strikes\u201d targeted a \u201cweapons depot south of Homs and a rockets depot in the eastern Hama countryside,\u201d Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights War Monitor, told AFP. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but that Tel Aviv will make its own independent decisions about how to retaliate. Despite the US having made clear that it opposes a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Gallant told CNN on Sunday that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. Gallant is expected to visit the US this coming week where he is scheduled to meet with the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. In a statement on Sunday, Gallant warned Iran that it may end up like Gaza or Beirut if it attempts to harm Israel. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said Washington will not stop putting pressure on Israel and Arab leaders during ongoing diplomatic efforts. Harris was asked, in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d if the US has a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Netanyahu, to which she responded: \u201cThe better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? The answer to that question is yes.\u201d The UK government is advising Israel to show \u201crestraint\u201d as Keir Starmer warned that \u201csparks\u201d\u2019 from the Middle East conflict could \u201clight touchpapers in our communities at home\u201d. Peter Kyle, a UK cabinet minister, did not rule out the possibility of the UK military helping Israel attack Iran, but noted any \u201coperational decision to be taken\u201d would be based on \u201cdelicate negotiations\u201d. A call by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for a halt in arms supplies to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with an angry rebuttal from Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. The pair spoke on Sunday in a call that the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace described as \u201cfrank\u201d. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in major cities around the world for a second day on Sunday to demand an end to bloodshed in Gaza and the wider Middle East as the start of Israel\u2019s war in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary. About 40,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through central London while thousands gathered in Paris, Rome, Manila, Cape Town, New York City, Sydney and Melbourne. Syria\u2019s defence ministry said Israel launched airstrikes on military positions in central Syria on Sunday, causing \u201cmaterial damage\u201d. A statement by the Syrian defence ministry said: At approximately 20:05 (17:05 GMT) the Israeli enemy launched an air aggression coming from the direction of north Lebanon, which targeted military sites in the central region, causing material losses. Syrian state media earlier reported that Syrian air defences were intercepting \u201chostile targets\u201d in central Syria. \u201cIsraeli strikes\u201d targeted a \u201cweapons depot south of Homs and a rockets depot in the eastern Hama countryside,\u201d Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights War Monitor, told AFP. As a powerful barrage of Israeli airstrikes pummelled Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs overnight, cousins Nader Ismail and Lyne Nassar sat on a balcony in a nearby Baabda overwhelmed with shock. Ismail said the terror made him freeze where he sat, while Nassar said she stood up suddenly before sitting down and attempting to calm herself about what is now a near nightly occurrence. Nassar said: It felt like we could feel the pressure waves from the bombings washing over usThe windows shook, the whole building shook. It was traumatising. The two students and their families are struggling to adapt quickly to the new reality of wartime, where the strikes have upended the lives of people across Beirut. In some parts of the city north of Dahiyeh, shops, bars and restaurants remain open but sometimes with limited hours, as people attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy and hope for a swift end to the conflict. Read the full story here: \u2018I\u2019m bracing for worse\u2019: Beirut\u2019s youth adjust to an emptied city Hamas\u2019s deputy chief in Gaza, Khalil Al-Hayya, has accused Israel of continuing to block a ceasefire agreement and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of trying to stall and undermine talks. In a speech shown on Hamas\u2019 Aqsa television on Sunday, Hayya said Hamas was not prepared to make concessions on its demands that Israel end the war, pull out its forces from Gaza, return internally displaced residents to their homes, and strike a prisoners-for-hostages deal, Reuters reported. Hayya, who is also the chief negotiator for Hamas, accused the world of double-standards over Gaza and Lebanon, which he said would lead to more disruption and instability in the region. He reaffirmed the group\u2019s standing behind the 7 October attack on Israel, saying it put the Palestinian cause on top of the world agenda. Hayya said: We can say in full confidence, that the Palestine cause has become the prime cause in the world and all parties now realize that there can be no security and no stability in the region unless our people gain their full rights. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has said his country is closely coordinating with the US as it prepares to strike back at Iran, but that Tel Aviv will make its own independent decisions about how to retaliate. Despite the US having made clear that it opposes a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Gallant told CNN on Sunday that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. He said: Israel has capabilities to hit targets near and far \u2013 we have proved it. We will respond to the Iranian attack appropriately. We will not stand by and neither should the international community. As we reported earlier, Gallant is expected to visit the US this coming week where he is scheduled to meet with the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. A US state department spokesperson has said that military pressure \u201ccan at times enable diplomacy\u201d but that it can also \u201clead to unintended consequences\u201d. In a statement reported by Reuters, the spokesperson said the US state department supported Israel going after extremist targets but did not want the targeting of civilian infrastructure, adding: Every civilian casualty is one too many. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, has said that Lebanon is seeing a \u201cmajor displacement crisis\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s escalating airstrikes, some of which have violated international law. Grandi was speaking during a visit to Beirut on Sunday, where he met with the country\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati. He also said there had been \u201cmany instances of violations of international humanitarian law in the way the airstrikes have been conducted that have destroyed or damaged civilian infrastructure.\u201d The UN agency confirmed that two of its workers were killed in Lebanon. Dina Darwiche, an UNHCR workers for 12 years, was killed when an Israeli missile hit the building where she and her husband and young children lived. Lebanese government officials estimate that 1.2 million people are now displaced. As we reported earlier, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said that 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been forcibly displaced by Israeli strikes on camps in Lebanon. Thousands of people gathered in London on Sunday to take part in a memorial for the victims of the 7 October Hamas terror attacks on southern Israel. Speakers included Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily Damari, 28, is the only British-Israeli hostage still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Speaking at the memorial, she said her her daughter\u2019s \u201cplight seems to have been forgotten\u201d. In a statement on Sunday, Israel\u2019s army chief, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said Israeli troops have \u201cdealt a severe blow to Hezbollah, which has lost all of its senior leadership.\u201d \u201cWe are not stopping,\u201d he added ahead of the anniversary of the Hamas attacks on 7 October. Halevi said: This is a long war, measured not only by capabilities but also by the willpower and perseverance over time. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping force in Lebanon (Unifil) has said it is deeply concerned by what it called Israel\u2019s \u201crecent activities\u201d adjacent to the mission\u2019s position inside Lebanon. In a statement posted to X on Sunday, Unifil said the activities by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are an \u201cextremely dangerous development\u201d, adding: It is unacceptable to compromise the safety of UN peacekeepers carrying out their Security Council-mandated tasks. The UN force \u201curgently\u201d reminded all actors of \u201ctheir obligations to protect UN personnel and property,\u201d it said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has ordered a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d around three towns on the border with Lebanon. In a statement, the IDF said it is \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d to enter the communities of Manara, Yiftach, and Malkia. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday in a phone call that the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace described as \u201cfrank\u201d. Both leaders accepted their divergence of views, as well as their desire to be well understood by each other, Macron\u2019s office said in a statement after the call. \u201cFrance\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security is unwavering,\u201d Macron was quoted as telling Netanyahu. But the French leader added that arms deliveries, the prolongation of the war in Gaza and its extension to Lebanon will not produce security for either Israelis or others living in the region. In a readout of the call by Netanyahu\u2019s office, the two leaders agreed to maintain a dialogue on the matter during a visit by France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, to Israel on Monday. France provides few arms to Israel but is keen to strengthen its longstanding influence in Lebanon by showing it wants the US to put some genuine pressure on Israel to accept a ceasefire. Washington appeared to mount little diplomatic resistance when Israel \u2013 after sending mixed signals \u2013 rejected a US-French plan for a 21 day ceasefire in Lebanon announced at the UN in New York nearly a fortnight ago. Macron\u2019s remarks, welcomed by the Lebanese, Qatari and Egyptian governments as well as the Palestinian Authority, may reflect French concern that some officials in the White House appeared to be willing to be relaxed to the point of welcoming the Israeli rejection of the French-US plan for a 21-day ceasefire. Few US officials have condemned Israel for escalating the conflict. Macron, in an interview broadcast on Saturday, also announced he was convening an international conference on aid to Lebanon and the establishment of Lebanese government armed troops on the border with Israel. A call by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, for a halt in arms supplies to Israel for use in Gaza has been met with an angry rebuttal from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The French president\u2019s comments were directed mainly at the US and were part of continuing French efforts to revive its call for a ceasefire in Lebanon. In an interview recorded on Monday, but broadcast on Saturday, Macron told France Inter radio: I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop supplying weapons to lead the fighting in Gaza. \u201cFrance is not supplying them,\u201d he immediately clarified, indirectly turning the spotlight on the US, Israel\u2019s main arms supplier. He also warned about \u201ca resentment that is being born, a hatred that is being fuelled by this\u201d . Lebanon could not be turned into another Gaza, he added. His comments brought a swift response from Netanyahu. \u201cAs Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel\u2019s side,\u201d he said in a statement. Yet, President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, will host his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, at the Pentagon on Wednesday. The pair will \u201cdiscuss ongoing Middle East security developments,\u201d the Pentagon said on Sunday. It will be Gallant\u2019s third US visit since the start of the war a year ago, after trips in March and June, the Times of Israel reports. The Israeli minister is expected to meet with other senior Biden administration officials as well, it says. As we reported earlier, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited troops along the border with Lebanon on Sunday. Netanyahu visited the Lebanon border for a situation assessment with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) northern command head, Maj Gen Uri Gordin, and division commander Brig Gen Moran Omer, his office said. \u201cA year ago we suffered a terrible blow,\u201d Netanyahu said during the visit, according to his office. He added: Over the past 12 months, we are changing reality from end to end. Netanyahu, addressing his troops, said: The whole world is amazed by the blows you are delivering to our enemies, and I salute you ... Together we will fight, and together we will win. Pope Francis issued a new appeal for peace \u201con every front\u201d in his Sunday prayer, during which he called for a day of prayer and fasting on Monday to mark the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks. \u201cBrothers and sisters, tomorrow it will be a year since the terrorist attack by Hamas against the people of Israel, to whom I renew my closeness,\u201d the pope said. He continued: From that day the Middle East has fallen into worse suffering because of destructive military actions that continue to hit the Palestinian people. It is most of all innocent civilians, they must receive the necessary humanitarian aid. He once again called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire on every front\u201d, including Lebanon, adding: Let\u2019s pray for Lebanese people, especially for the people in the south forced to leave their villages. Iran\u2019s aviation body has announced the cancellation of flights at the country\u2019s airports, citing \u201coperational restrictions\u201d, according to state media. Iran\u2019s civil organisation said that \u201cthe flights at some airports of the country will be cancelled from 21:00 tonight (1730 GMT), Sunday, 6 October, until 6:00 am tomorrow, 7 October,\u201d IRNA state news agency reported. Iran implemented flight restrictions on Tuesday when it launched ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this week, an attack that Israel has vowed to retaliate. Pro-Palestinian protests have been taking place in cities around the world ahead of the anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks on 7 October, which led to Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza. At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured in Israeli attacks on the Palestinian territory since 7 October, according to the latest figures by Gaza\u2019s health ministry. US vice-president Kamala Harris, asked if the US has a \u201creal close ally\u201d in Israel\u2019s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, replied: With all due respect, the better question is, do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? The answer to that question is yes. Kamala Harris, the US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee, discussed her country\u2019s relationship with Israel during an interview that will air in full on Monday. CBS has released a clip from the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d election special interview, which will air on the one year anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks on southern Israel. Harris was asked if the US has any sway over the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, despite Washington supplying Tel Aviv with billions of dollars in military aid and after the US pressed Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire. Harris replied that the US military aid \u201callowed Israel to defend itself\u201d against the Iranian ballistic missile attack last week that was \u201cjust meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.\u201d She added: When we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran presents, I think that it is, without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. She said the US is engaged in ongoing diplomatic efforts that \u201cinclude the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire.\u201d She added: We\u2019re not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders. We reported in an earlier post that one woman was killed and 10 other people injured in a suspected terror attack at the central bus station in Beersheba in southern Israel. In reaction to the shooting, Miri Regev, Israel\u2019s transportation minister, wrote that the family of the suspected attacker should be deported from the country. \u201cThe time has come for a deterrent punishment that prevents attacks on Israeli territory,\u201d she wrote on X. About 40% of Lebanon\u2019s 1.25 million school pupils have become displaced by ongoing Israeli attacks, director general of education Imad Achkar has said. \u201cThere are 1.25 million pupils in Lebanese schools,\u201d Achkar said, adding that \u201c40 percent of them have been displaced\u201d by Israeli bombardment. UN officials said on Friday most of Lebanon\u2019s nearly 900 shelters were full and that people fleeing Israeli military airstrikes were increasingly sleeping out in the open on the street or in public parks. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said 1.2 million people \u2013 out of Lebanon\u2019s total 2022 population of 5.49 million (according to UN data) \u2013 have been forced from their homes by Israel\u2019s intensifying air and ground attacks. The Lebanese government said earlier today that the start of the academic year will be delayed until 4 November due to \u201csecurity risks\u201d (see earlier post at 11.13 for more details). Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said Israeli air attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp have killed at least 17 people, including nine children. \u201cThere are 17 martyrs, including nine children, in Israeli air raids in Jabalia,\u201d civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmoud Basal was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said. These figures have not been independently verified yet by the Guardian. As we reported in an earlier post, the Israeli military has said its forces have surrounded the Jabalia area of northern Gaza because of what it is claiming is the presence of \u201cterrorists\u201d and their \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. Israeli forces have regularly targeted Jabalia, displacing most residents there. Hezbollah said it launched attack drones at an Israeli military base near the northern city of Haifa on Sunday. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group said it fighters \u201claunched an air assault with a squadron of attack drones on the maintenance and rehabilitation base south of Haifa\u201d. Israel has reiterated its call for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million people fleeing to the south, even though people say there is nowhere safe to go. \u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the Israeli military said in leaflets dropped over the area, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d Palestinians across northern Gaza have been told to flee to al-Mawasi on the southern coast, a so-called \u201chumanitarian area\u201d where an estimated one million displaced people are sheltering. Mawasi, which has been the target of deadly Israeli airstrikes, is severely overcrowded and aid agencies struggle to provide even the most basic services. In May, an aid worker described to the Guardian the \u201chorrific and dehumanising\u201d conditions, with limited food, filthy and scarce water, overwhelmed healthcare facilities and almost no sanitation. Another said the coast was \u201ctotally jam packed, with block after block of tents and only narrow gaps between them\u201d. \u201cThere is no infrastructure inside the camps and very limited new supplies getting in of course,\u201d he said. Police and emergency responders said at least one person was killed and 10 others injured in a shooting attack at a bus station in Israel\u2019s southern city of Beersheba. The attacker has been killed and the shooting is being treated as a \u201csuspected terrorist attack\u201d. The Israeli foreign ministry said its air force has killed Hezbollah commander, Hader Ali Taweel. The statement said Taweel, along with Mohamed Hader and Hassan Nteer el Rasheeni who were killed earlier in the week, were responsible for an anti-tank missile that hit Israel\u2019s northern border in January. The Israeli military issued new evacuation alerts for residents of about 25 areas in southern Lebanon, calling on them to head immediately to the north of the Awali river. Israel\u2019s military has said it anticipates possible long-range rocket fire from the Gaza Strip ahead of the anniversary of the Hamas-led 7 October attacks, according to reports from the Times of Israel. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said 26 people were killed by Israeli strikes on a school, and a mosque serving as a shelter in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Saturday. The ministry said at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza since last October. There were reports of intense Israeli airstrikes over Beirut from late Saturday into Sunday. The Lebanese health ministry said 23 people were killed in Israeli bombing across Lebanon yesterday, which targeted areas including those in southern Lebanon and in the eastern region of Bekaa. An Israeli airstrike targeted three cars carrying medical and relief materials in the central Syrian province of Homs, the country\u2019s state news agency reported on Sunday, adding that material damage was reported. We have some more information on the shooting in southern Israel. Police and emergency responders have said at least one person was killed and 10 others injured during the shooting in Beersheba, which is being treated as a \u201csuspected terrorist attack\u201d. The attack took place near a McDonald\u2019s inside Beersheba\u2019s central bus station terminal, BBC News reports. \u201cParamedics have pronounced a 25-year-old female deceased, and are evacuating 10 casualties,\u201d emergency service provider Magen David Adom said in a statement. \u201cA short time ago a report was received at the police headquarters about a suspected shooting incident at the central station in Beer Sheva,\u201d said a police spokesperson in a statement. \u201cA number of injured on the scene. The terrorist was neutralised at the scene and many police forces of the southern district are at the scene,\u201d the statement added. The incident comes just days after a Hamas-claimed shooting attack last week in which seven people were killed in Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv attack \u2013 one of the deadliest in the country since the 7 October Hamas attack \u2013 came as Iran fired about 200 missiles at Israel, sending hundreds of thousands of people into public shelters. A woman has been killed and several people injured in a shooting attack at a bus station in Israel\u2019s southern city of Beersheba, police have said. Police say the suspected \u201cterror attack\u201d took place in the last hour while Israel\u2019s ambulance service have now said eight people are being treated. Officers say the attacker has been killed. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited troops along the border with Lebanon on Sunday, his office has said. This comes nearly a week after the Israeli military launched ground operations against Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon and ahead of the one year anniversary of the 7 October attacks. You can read the Guardian\u2019s series marking one year since the Hamas attacks on Israel and the war in Gaza here. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has warned Iran that it may end up like Gaza or Beirut if it attempts to harm Israel, according to the AFP news agency. \u201cThe Iranians did not touch the air force\u2019s capabilities - no aircraft was damaged, no squadron was taken out of order,\u201d Gallant said in a statement, referring to Iran\u2019s recent missile strike on Israel. \u201cWhoever thinks that a mere attempt to harm us will deter us from taking action should take a look at (our achievements) in Gaza and Beirut,\u201d Gallant added. Iran said the missile strike, that hit two bases of the Israeli air force, was in response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan in a September 27 strike on Beirut. The UN has said 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been forcibly displaced by Israeli airstrikes on camps in Lebanon. The UN agency for Palestine refugees (Unrwa) said it has activated emergency shelters for over 4,300 displaced people, including Palestinian refugees, Lebanese and Syrians. \u201cWe have been preparing for this emergency for weeks and months,\u201d Dorothee Klaus, Unrwa\u2019s director in Lebanon, said. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq group has said it launched three separate attacks on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights, according to reports by the BBC. This comes after the group launched two drones at a military base in the occupied territory earlier this week, killing two Israeli soldiers and wounding 24. The Islamic Resistance is a group allied to Hezbollah and Iran who are opposed to Israel in the region. The IDF has not commented and it remains unclear if any damage has been caused. Iran\u2019s oil minister has visited an oil facility on Kharg Island amid growing concerns over possible Israeli air strikes targeting the region, according to the ministry\u2019s news agency. Israeli officials have warned the country is preparing a response after Iran launched a barrage of missiles this week. Iran said the missiles were fired in response to the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian general Abbas Nilforoushan in a September 27 strike on Beirut. Oil minister Mohsen Paknejad said on state television: \u201cWe are not afraid that our enemies will ignite a crisis, and visiting the region is a normal business trip.\u201d Kharg Island is home to Iran\u2019s largest crude oil export terminal. On Friday US president Joe Biden advised Israel against striking Iran\u2019s oil facilities, after previously stating he was in \u201cdiscussions\u201d with Israel over possible air strikes. Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi warned Iran would respond to Israeli strikes in Iran with a \u201ca proportional and similar reaction\u2026and even stronger.\u201d Lisa O\u2019Carroll is a senior correspondent for the Guardian Ireland\u2019s president has said it is \u201coutrageous\u201d for the Israeli Defence Force to have \u201cthreatened\u201d the UN peace keeping mission on the border between Lebanon and Israel. But his comments drew the ire of Israel which responded through a statement from its embassy in Dublin saying it did not threaten troops but merely asked them to move for their own safety. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending. Indeed, Israel is demanding that the entire Unifil operating under UN mandates walk away,\u201d Michael D Higgins said, in relation to the 10,000 strong peace keeping mission. The embassy said the IDF \u201cmade a request through different channels to have some Unifil troops move from areas of military activity for their own protection and safety.\u201d \u201cLet it be clear that the safety of peacekeeping forces is of immense importance to Israel. To attempt to characterise this as a threat to Unifil forces is another unfounded and inflammatory accusation levelled at Israel, as we have seen in the past months.\u201d Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has visited the Nevatim airbase, in the Negev desert, which was struck by Iranian missiles in Tehran\u2019s attack against Israel on Tuesday. He said no aircraft was damaged in last week\u2019s Iranian attack on the facility, which was directly hit at least 32 times, according to experts who analysed social media and satellite footage. Gallant was quoted by Hareetz as having said earlier today: The Iranians haven\u2019t even scratched the capabilities of the air force. There has been no disruption in our operations. Those who think that attempting to strike Israel will deter us from responding should look at what\u2019s happening in Gaza and Beirut. We are strong in both defence and offense, and we\u2019ll demonstrate this in the manner, time and place of our choosing. The Israeli foreign ministry has said its air force has killed Hezbollah commander, Hader Ali Taweel. The statement said Taweel, along with Mohamed Hader and Hassan Nteer el Rasheeni who were killed earlier in the week, were responsible for an anti-tank missile that hit Israel\u2019s northern border in January. The missile resulted in the deaths of a member of Kfar Yuval\u2019s emergency response squad, Barak Ayalon, and his 76-year-old mother. Hezbollah is yet to comment on the statement. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson has issued new evacuation alerts for residents of about 25 areas in southern Lebanon, calling on them to head immediately to the north of the Awali river (which is north of the southern Lebanese city of Sidon). \u201cAnyone who is near Hezbollah members, installations or weapons is putting his life in danger,\u201d Avichay Adraee said. \u201cVillage residents, you must evacuate your homes,\u201d he said. Houla, Meiss el-Jabal and Bilda are among the villages told to evacuate. \u201cWe will inform you of the appropriate and safe time to return to your homes,\u201d Adraee added. The UK prime minister has warned the conflict in the Middle East risks lighting the \u201ctouchpapers in our own communities\u201d and condemned the spread of \u201cvile hatred\u201d since the 7 October attacks. Writing for the Sunday Times, ahead of the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks, Keir Starmer said: The flames from this deadly conflict now threaten to consume the region. And the sparks light touchpapers in our own communities here at home. Because Israel and the Middle East are not just inseparable from our nation\u2019s history. They have a deep relationship with our multicultural society. Millions have family ties to the region \u2026 Since 7 October, we have watched vile hatred against Jews and Muslims rise in our communities. So we will not look the other way as Jewish children are afraid to wear their school uniforms, Jewish shops are defaced, or Jews targeted on the streets. And we will not ignore it when mosques are attacked, and British Muslims are assaulted or told to \u201cgo home\u201d. Any attack on a minority is an attack on our proud values of tolerance and respect. We will not stand for it. Starmer reiterated calls for the release of the hostages, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the removal of restrictions on all humanitarian aid. As we reported in an earlier post, the Israeli military has said its forces have surrounded the Jabalia area of northern Gaza because of what it is claiming is the presence of \u201cterrorists\u201d and their \u201cinfrastructure\u201d. Israeli forces have regularly targeted Jabalia, displacing most residents there. Moath al-Kahlout, reporting for Al Jazeera, was broadcasting a news update near Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia when he was interrupted by what appeared to be an airstrike. Shortly afterwards, a van rushed to the hospital bringing injured people, Al Jazeera reported. \u201cThe situation here in northern Gaza is deteriorating as the Israeli army intensifies its bombing,\u201d al-Kahlout said. He added: An entire family was killed by the Israeli army in the overnight attacks. The Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering them to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. This may lead to more civilian casualties and injured people. The Lebanese government has said schools will postpone the start of the academic year due to intensifying Israeli airstrikes against the Hezbollah militant group. Education minister, Abbas Halabi, has said the new start date for the more than one million Lebanese students will be 4 November due to \u201csecurity risks\u201d, according to news agency AFP. Israel\u2019s military has said it anticipates possible long-range rocket fire from the Gaza Strip ahead of the anniversary of the 7 October attacks, according to reports from the Times of Israel. Military sources told the newspaper it is bolstering its defences along the Gaza border and in the Netzarim Corridor area in the Strip\u2019s centre, where the IDF maintains a semi-permanent presence, in anticipation of possible attacks. The IDF said it is also coordinating with police and medical services in Israeli border towns. \u201cThe Southern Command is prepared in defence and attack for several scenarios during the coming month, along with allowing memorial events in the [Gaza border communities] to be carried out safely,\u201d the IDF said in a statement seen by the newspaper. Although much of Hamas\u2019 military organisation has been dismantled, Israeli operatives said it can still carry out rocket attacks. This week marks one year since the 7 October attacks on Israel, where Hamas militants and allied groups killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza ahead of the first anniversary of Israel\u2019s war on the territory, which broke out after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. \u201cUnfortunately, on this first anniversary of Hamas\u2019s terror attack on Israel, peace or even reconciliation in the Middle East seem more distant than ever,\u201d Scholz said in a video message. The German government \u201ccontinues to persistently advocate for a ceasefire, which must now finally come about,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are in close contact with our international partners to prevent a further escalation of the conflict,\u201d Scholz said. He went on to warn against rising anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany, which has been one of Europe\u2019s most unconditional backers of Israel since last October. \u201cIt must never be the case that Jewish citizens here in Germany have to live in fear and terror,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe will never accept antisemitism and blind hatred of Israel. The Jewish people here in Germany have the full solidarity of our state,\u201d he added. More than 5,000 antisemitic incidents were recorded in Germany in 2023, half of them after the 7 October attacks, according to Felix Klein, the government\u2019s commissioner for the fight against antisemitism. There were a record 1,926 anti-Muslim incidents registered in Germany last year by the CLAIM network of NGOs monitoring Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hatred. That marked a 114% rise on 2023, with incidents shooting up in particular after 7 October. The Israeli military are reported to have detained at least 15 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank during the last 24 hours, including a journalist and former prisoners. The arrests were made across the areas of Hebron, Bethlehem, Tulkarem and Tubas, the Palestinian Prisoner\u2019s Society and the Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs Commission said. Over 11,000 Palestinians have been detained in Israeli raids across the occupied West Bank since last October, the groups said. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the occupied West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. A member of the UK government has said it is on \u201cstandby\u201d should there be more demand for Britons to get out of Lebanon. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, science and technology secretary Peter Kyle said the government would use \u201cwhatever is needed whether it\u2019s more chartered flights or whether it\u2019s the military\u201d to get people out. Kyle said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already laid on three flights which have brought people out, there\u2019s a fourth one leaving today. And we\u2019re on standby: if the demand is there we will use whatever is needed, whether it\u2019s more chartered flights or whether it\u2019s the military.\u201d Nations around the world have begun evacuating their citizens from Lebanon due to escalating tensions and conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed movement, Hezbollah. The U.S. deployed dozens of troops to Cyprus to prepare for an evacuation of Americans. It is also working with airlines to ensure additional flights are available for Americans to leave the country. Other countries coordinating evacuation efforts include: Brazil, China, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Australia and Turkey. Gaza\u2019s health ministry has issued an update on the amount of people killed by Israeli strikes on a school, and a mosque serving as a shelter in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on Saturday. The previous death toll was 24. It has been increased to 26. Dozens of people were reported to have been injured. The Israeli military claimed it had targeted Hamas militants in the strikes. At least 23 people were killed and 93 others injured in Israeli bombing across Lebanon yesterday, the health ministry has said. Israeli raids targeted towns and villages of south Lebanon, Nabatieh, the eastern governorate of Beqaa, Baalbek-Hermel, Mount Lebanon, and the north, the ministry added in a tweet on their X account. These figures do not include casualty deaths from more recent Israeli bombardment on Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs after midnight. Since 23 September, Israeli strikes against Hezbollah across Lebanon have killed more than 1,110, according to official figures released earlier today. At least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza since 7 October, according to latest figures released by Gaza\u2019s health ministry. The health ministry also reported at least 97,166 people have been injured. The ministry previously said thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the enclave. The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke and Malak A Tantesh spoke with families in Gaza about their year of loss and displacement. You can read more about this here. Al Jazeera is reporting the Israeli military has surrounded the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. The media outlet quoted a Gaza civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal who said there were many casualties after multiple strikes rocked Jabalia through the night. The Israeli military said in a statement: \u201cThe troops of the 401st Brigade and the 460th Brigade have successfully encircled the area and are currently continuing to operate in the area.\u201d The statement added intelligence indicates the \u201cpresence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia \u2026 as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area. \u201cPrior to and during the operation, the [air force] struck dozens of military targets in the area to assist ground troops.\u201d The Jabalia refugee camp has regularly been targeted by Israeli forces since the start of the war in Gaza, displacing and killing its residents. Najib Mikati, the caretaker Lebanese prime minister, has said that his government continues to support the \u201cjoint call for a ceasefire\u201d which was launched last week by France and the US, as Israeli airstrikes continue to hit his country. The BBC are quoting him as saying earlier today that Lebanon continues to \u201cdemand that pressure be exerted on Israel to respect the ceasefire and immediately implement resolution 1701\u201d. Mikati has said that a diplomatic end to the escalating war would be a \u201cwin-win\u201d for Israel and Lebanon and \u201call parties\u201d would respect such a deal. He has said he hoped to deploy 10,000 Lebanese army troops in the south if a ceasefire is agreed. The proposal for a 21-day temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced by the US president, Joe Biden, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on 26 September 2024, to make way for broader negotiations. They urged Israel and Lebanon to back the move, which was also endorsed by the UK, Australia, Canada, the EU, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. As we have mentioned in a previous post, there have been reports of intense Israeli airstrikes over Beirut from late Saturday into Sunday. Nafiseh Kohnavard, the BBC\u2019s Middle East correspondent, who is in Beirut, described it as the worst night of attacks on the Lebanese capital and its suburbs since the start of this conflict, which began in late September (although the Israeli military and Hezbollah have been trading fire since 8 October 2023). Lebanon\u2019s official national news agency said targets included a petrol station and a warehouse for medical supplies. Lebanese media described the blasts on the Lebanese capital as \u201cvery violent\u201d, saying ambulances rushed to affected sites. Israeli attacks hit several neighbourhoods in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, as well as the road leading to the Rafic Hariri international airport, according to Al Jazeera. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, said it targeted Israeli forces with artillery after they tried to infiltrate towards Khallat Shuaib in Blida, in southern Lebanon. A statement said fighters fired rockets at Israeli troops during the evacuation of \u201cdead and wounded soldiers\u201d in the Menara border area shortly after midnight. Hezbollah also said it launched assault drones against an Israeli military base. Reporters from Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, have been told by medical sources that 23 out of 38 hospitals in the Gaza Strip are now out of service amid relentless Israeli airstrikes which have targeted healthcare facilities over the nearly year-long war. Local health authorities further reported that 986 healthcare workers have been killed during the war, with Israeli attacks reportedly rendering 130 ambulances inoperable. These figures have not been independently verified by the Guardian. The following is from a press release from Doctors without Borders published earlier this week. Citing data from a UN humanitarian update on 23 September 2024, the charity said 17 out of 36 hospitals are partially functional amid crippling shortages of fuel, medicine and essential supplies. The press release reads: As medical needs are growing exponentially, people\u2019s options for care are shrinking. Israeli forces have committed widespread and systematic attacks on Gaza\u2019s health care system and other vital civilian infrastructure. The health care system is now on the edge of collapse. Today, only 17 out of 36 hospitals are partially functional. Warring parties have conducted hostilities near medical facilities, endangering patients, caretakers, and medical staff. Six MSF colleagues have been killed. From October 2023, staff and patients from MSF have had to leave 14 different health structures, due to serious incidents and ongoing fighting. Each time a medical facility is evacuated, thousands of people lose access to lifesaving medical care. This will have consequences on people\u2019s health, not just in the immediate term, but in the weeks and months to come. Israel strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts on Saturday night, official Lebanese media reported. \u201cIsraeli enemy warplanes carried out four very violent strikes on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs, and one strike on the Chweifat\u201d area, with ambulances rushing to the site, Lebanon\u2019s National news agency said. Correspondents in Beirut reported hearing explosions, and footage from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency showed plumes of smoke rising from the targeted areas. At least 24 people have been reported killed in the strike on a school and mosque in Gaza. Eyewitnesses and a nearby hospital told news agencies that the mosque was being used to house displaced people. An Israel military spokesperson said the country would retaliate against Iran for the Iranian missile attack at \u201cthe timing which we decide\u201d. \u201cThe way in which we respond to this disgraceful attack will be in the manner, at the location and the timing which we decide, according to the political leadership\u2019s instructions,\u201d Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement on Saturday. Iran said any attack by Israel would be met with an \u201ceven stronger\u201d retaliation, as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Damascus, Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for calling for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. \u201cThe axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this [axis] call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cWell let me tell you this Israel will win with or without their support but their shame will continue long after the war is won.\u201d Macron\u2019s office responded with a statement of its own later Saturday, describing Netanyahu\u2019s reaction as \u201cexcessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel\u201d. It said France was still \u201ca steadfast friend of Israel\u201d. The president of Ireland sharply criticised Israel\u2019s demand that UN peacekeepers leave their positions in southern Lebanon. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,\u201d Michael Higgins said. The IDF had requested that peacekeepers operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights \u201crelocate\u201d. Here is our latest wrap of the events overnight. Heavy consecutive strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, witnesses said, while Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said 21 people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a mosque in central Gaza early on Sunday. The strike on the mosque, near the Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, came as the war between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian territory approaches its first anniversary on 7 October. Witnesses said the number of casualties could rise as the mosque was being used to house displaced people, while the Israeli military said it was being used as a Hamas command centre. In the Lebanese capital, the Israeli strikes sent booms across the city and sparked flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometres away. The strikes came after days of Israeli bombing of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city\u2019s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. Read more: Israel has issued new evacuation orders for Palestinians in the north of the strip. On Sunday morning it said two evacuation routes from northern Gaza have been reopened to allow for people to move to the southern \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d: one along the Salah al-Din road and the other along the Al-Rashid coastal road. A spokesperson for the military told residents that Hamas had established \u201cterrorist infrastructure in your region, exploiting the population, shelters, and health facilities as a human shield\u201d, according to Al Jazeera, and ordered people to head south ahead of continued Israeli operations in the north. The death toll from the Israeli strike on the Gaza mosque has risen to 24, according to local authorities. The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said 93 people were also wounded in the strikes on the mosque and the school, near the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. The al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital told the Associated Press that the strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people. Eyewitnesses told Reuters the same. However Israeli forces say the mosque was being used as a Hamas command and control centre \u201cto plan and carry out terrorist operations against the IDF forces and the State of Israel\u201d, and that it took steps to reduce the chance of harming civilians. An AP reporter counted 18 bodies at the hospital morgue, and said hospital records listed all those killed as men. Israel says it successfully intercepted two surface-to-surface missiles launched from Lebanese territory. Sirens were earlier reported between Haifa and Hadera along the coast. The Israeli air force has published a statement about the air strikes on Beirut, which appear to be over for the night. The statement, posted to its X account, is in full below: During the night, Air Force fighter jets under the precise intelligence guidance of the Intelligence Division, carried out a series of targeted attacks throughout Beirut against several munitions warehouses and other terrorist infrastructures in the area. Before the attacks, many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming those not involved, including advance warnings to the population in the area. The terrorist organization Hezbollah places its weapons and production sites under residential buildings in the heart of Beirut and puts the population in the area at risk. The IDF will continue to attack powerfully, damage and degrade Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities and infrastructure in Lebanon. The Australian protests on Sunday are among many held across the world this weekend. Thousands also took to the streets in the US and across Europe on Saturday. In London, thousands marched through the capital to Downing Street amid a heavy police presence. The atmosphere was tense as pro-Palestinian protesters and counter-demonstrators, some holding Israeli flags, passed one another. Scuffles broke out as police officers pushed back activists trying to get past a cordon. At least 17 people were arrested, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said. In the northern German city of Hamburg, about 950 people staged a peaceful demonstration with many waving Palestinian and Lebanese flags or chanting \u201cStop the Genocide,\u201d the DPA news agency reported, citing a count by police. Two smaller pro-Israeli counterdemonstrations took place without incident, it said. Several thousands protesters gathered peacefully at Paris\u2019 Republique Plaza in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian and Lebanese people. Many were waving Palestinian flags while holding posters reading \u201dstop the genocide,\u201d \u201cfree Palestine,\u201d and \u201chands off Lebanon.\u201d In Rome police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators after a rally turned violent. Several thousands had demonstrated peacefully Saturday afternoon until a smaller group tried to push the rally toward the centre of the city, in spite of a ban by local authorities who refused to authorise protests, citing security concerns. Some protesters, dressed in black and with their faces covered threw stones, bottles and paper bombs at the police, who responded with tear gas and water cannons, eventually dispersing the crowd. At least 30 law enforcement officers and three demonstrators were injured in the clashes, local media reported. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also gathered at New York\u2019s Times Square to call for a cease-fire, chanting \u201cGaza!\u201d to a drumbeat. Some wore keffiyeh scarfs, waved Palestinian and Lebanese flags and held a large cardboard image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with red paint symbolizing blood across his face. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency says an Israeli strike on a mosque-turned-shelter in central Deir al-Balah killed 21 people. \u201cThe number of deaths rose to 21 and a large number of wounded as a result of the occupation (Israel) bombing of a mosque sheltering displaced people in front of the gate of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip,\u201d said agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal. Israel\u2019s military has said it targeted the mosque because Hamas was using it as a command and control centre. Australian supporters of Palestine have taken to the streets in Sydney and Melbourne, a day before the first anniversary of the 7 October attacks by Hamas in Israel. Rallies were scheduled to take place in cities across Australia, with demonstrators warned not to display symbols linked to designated terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. Police in New South Wales had sought to block the Sunday rally from taking place, but an agreement reached with organisers allowed the event to go ahead with an altered route. The full story is here: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, released a video message this morning on the eve of the anniversary of the 7 October attack that sparked this latest round of extraordinary violence. He said the attacks \u201cscarred souls\u201d. \u201cOn this day we remember all those who were brutally killed and suffered unspeakable violence, including sexual violence as they were simply living their lives. This is a day for the global community to repeat in the loudest voice our utter condemnation of the abhorrent acts of Hamas including the taking of hostages.\u201d Guterres said he had met many families of hostages and \u201cshared their pain and anguish\u201d, demanding again the immediate and unconditional release. He said 7 October was \u201cnaturally a day to focus on events of the awful day\u201d. \u201cSince October 7th a wave of shocking violence and bloodshed has erupted. The war that has followed the terrible attacks of a year ago continues to shatter lives and inflict profound human suffering for Palestinians in Gaza and now the people of Lebanon. I have spoken out about this often and clearly. It is time for the release of the hostages, time to silence the guns, time to stop the suffering that has engulfed the region. Time for peace, international law and justice.\u201d He said the UN was committed to achieving the goals, and that it was important to \u201chold on to hope\u201d amidst the bloodshed. \u201cLet us never stop working for a lasting solution to the conflict, where Israel, Palestine and all other countries of the region can finally live in peace and dignity and with respect for one another.\u201d Last week Guterres spoke to the UN Security Council, demanding an end to what he called a \u201cdeadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence\u201d. It came after a statement by Israel\u2019s foreign minister declaring Guterres persona non grata and barring him from entering Israel, accusing him of failing to \u201cunequivocally\u201d condemn Iran\u2019s missile attack. The US state department has said it evacuated 145 US citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families from Lebanon on Saturday. The cohort left on two flights from Beirut to Istanbul. Each flight could take 300 passengers. A spokesperson for the state department said more than 600 people had been assisted to leave Lebanon via the government-organised flights, and more than 2,600 seats have been made available on those and commercial flights. The department has advised Americans since late September to depart Lebanon \u201cwhile commercial options still remain available,\u201d and warned those who stay to \u201cbe prepared to shelter in place should the situation deteriorate further.\u201d The death toll at the Gaza mosque strike has risen to 18, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The Israeli air strike on the Shuhada al-Aqsa mosque, near the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, also reportedly injured dozens of people. Eyewitnesses told Reuters the number of casualties could rise as the mosque was being used to house displaced people. The Israeli Air Force earlier confirmed that the mosque in Deir al-Balah was a target, saying it was being used by Hamas. It also said it struck another site \u201cthat was previously used as the Ibn Rushd school\u201d. \u201cThe command and control complexes were used by Hamas terrorists to plan and carry out terrorist operations against the IDF forces and the State of Israel,\u201d it said in a statement published on the Air Force\u2019s X account. The IAF did not detail casualties. It said that prior to the attack \u201cmany steps were taken to reduce the chance of harming civilians, including the use of precision weaponry, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information.\u201d In the last few hours Beirut has been under intense air strikes by Israeli forces. Local media have described the strikes as the most severe of the conflict so far, with some landing near the airport where flights are taking off with hundreds of foreign evacuees. Explosions have been reported and photographed across the city. Israel has also continued to target Gaza and the West Bank, with air strikes on a mosque in Gaza killing at least five people, according to Reuters. Al Jazeera reports up to 18 fatalities at the mosque, which eyewitnesses told Reuters was being used to house displaced people. The Israeli air force said the mosque was being used by Hamas as a command centre, and that it took steps to reduce harm to civilians. In other developments: Israel strikes hit south Beirut and its outskirts on Saturday night, official Lebanese media reported. \u201cIsraeli enemy warplanes carried out four very violent strikes on [Beirut\u2019s] southern suburbs, and one strike on the Chweifat\u201d area, with ambulances rushing to the site, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency said. Correspondents in Beirut reported hearing explosions, and Agence France-Presse footage showed plumes of smoke rising from the targeted areas. An Israel military spokesman said the country would retaliate against Iran for the Iranian missile attack at \u201cthe timing which we decide\u201d. \u201cThe way in which we respond to this disgraceful attack will be in the manner, at the location and the timing which we decide, according to the political leadership\u2019s instructions,\u201d Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. Iran said any attack by Israel would be met with an \u201ceven stronger\u201d retaliation, as tensions continue to rise between the two countries. \u201cOur reaction to any attack by the Zionist regime is completely clear,\u201d Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Damascus, Syria. \u201cFor every action, there will be a proportional and similar reaction from Iran, and even stronger.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu said Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for calling for a halt on arms deliveries to Israel. \u201cThe axis of terror stands together. But countries who supposedly oppose this [axis] call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said. \u201cWell let me tell you this Israel will win with or without their support but their shame will continue long after the war is won.\u201d Macron\u2019s office responded with a statement of its own later Saturday, describing Netanyahu\u2019s reaction as \u201cexcessive and detached from the friendship between France and Israel\u201d. It said France was still \u201ca steadfast friend of Israel\u201d. The president of Ireland sharply criticised Israel\u2019s demand that UN peacekeepers leave their positions in southern Lebanon. \u201cIt is outrageous that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending,\u201d Michael Higgins said. The IDF had requested that peacekeepers operating on the \u201cblue line\u201d between Israel and the Golan Heights \u201crelocate\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A Royal New Zealand Navy vessel has run aground and sunk off Samoa \u2013 the first time the navy has lost a ship since the second world war, the New Zealand Defence Force said in a statement on Sunday. Manawanui, the navy\u2019s specialist dive and hydrographic vessel, ran aground near the southern coast of Upolu on Saturday night as it was conducting a reef survey, Commodore Shane Arndell, the maritime component commander of the New Zealand Defence Force, said in a statement. All 75 crew and passengers were safe. Late on Sunday Samoa\u2019s acting prime minister said an oil spill was \u201chighly probable\u201d as a result of the sinking. Officials in Samoa were conducting an environmental impact assessment in the area where the ship sank, Tuala Tevaga Iosefo Ponifasio said in a statement. Several vessels responded and assisted in rescuing the crew and passengers who had left the ship in lifeboats, Arndell said. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-8A Poseidon was also deployed to assist in the rescue. The cause of the grounding was unknown and would need further investigation, the New Zealand Defence Force said. Video and photos published on local media showed the Manawanui, which cost the New Zealand government NZ$103m in 2018, listing heavily and with plumes of thick grey smoke rising after it ran aground. The vessel later capsized and was below the surface by 9am local time, the New Zealand Defence Force said. The agency said it was \u201cworking with authorities to understand the implications and minimise the environmental impacts\u201d. The chief of navy, Rear Adm Garin Golding, told a press conference in Auckland that a plane would leave for Samoa on Sunday to bring the rescued crew and passengers back to New Zealand. He said some of those rescued had suffered minor injuries, including from walking across a reef. The defence minister, Judith Collins, described the grounding as \u201creally challenging for everybody on board\u201d. \u201cI know that what has happened is going to take quite a bit of time to process,\u201d Collins told the press conference. \u201cI look forward to pinpointing the cause so that we can learn from it and avoid a repeat,\u201d she said, adding that an immediate focus was to salvage \u201cwhat is left\u201d of the vessel. Rescue operations were coordinated by Samoan emergency services and Australian Defence Force personnel with the assistance of the New Zealand rescue centre, according to a statement from Samoa Police, Prison and Corrections Services posted on Facebook. Manawanui is used to conduct a range of specialist diving, salvage and survey tasks around New Zealand and across the south-west Pacific. New Zealand\u2019s navy is already working at reduced capacity with three of its nine ships idle due to personnel shortages. With Reuters and Associated Press",
