      "bodyText": "Two former police officers who confessed to the murder of the Rio city councillor Marielle Franco have been sentenced to decades in prison for their part in a crime that shook Brazil and cast a harsh spotlight on the links between politics and organised crime. Ronnie Lessa admitted to firing 14 shots in the 2018 drive-by shooting that killed Franco and her driver, Anderson Gomes, 39, and was sentenced to 78 years and nine months. \u00c9lcio de Queiroz, who confessed to driving the getaway car, was sentenced to 59 years and eight months. In addition to the double homicide, they were convicted for the attempted murder of Fernanda Chaves, Franco\u2019s press officer at the time, who was in the car. Lessa and de Queiroz, who were arrested in 2019, had previously signed plea bargains, but the jury in Rio de Janeiro had the final word on their guilt. Prosecutors at the two-day trial had argued each man should be sentenced to the maximum possible 84 years. By signing plea bargains \u2013 which led to the May arrests of the masterminds: two politicians and a former police chief \u2013 the defendants will have their sentences reduced. However, prosecutors declined to specify by how much, citing confidentiality of the previously signed agreements. The crime was one of the most shocking and high-profile murders in Rio\u2019s history: Franco, a gay Black woman, was a rising political star, and an outspoken critic of police violence and corruption. Thursday\u2019s verdict offered a measure of solace to her family and supporters, but marked only the first step towards justice: a second trial is yet to come for the men accused of ordering Franco\u2019s death. The case against the alleged masterminds \u2013 two influential Rio politicians, Domingos and Chiquinho Braz\u00e3o, and Rivaldo Barbosa, a former police chief \u2013 is under way in the supreme court and no trial date has been set yet. Announcing the sentences, Judge Glioche said: \u201cThe jury is a democracy \u2013 a democracy which Marielle Franco defended.\u201d Addressing the two defendants, she said: \u201cThis sentence is directed at the defendants here, but also at the many Lessas and Queirozes who exist in Rio and remain at large.\u201d Members of the two victims\u2019 families hugged each other as the sentence was declared. At a press conference afterwards, Franco\u2019s daughter, Luyara, said the trial outcome was a \u201cvictory for Brazil\u2019s democracy\u201d. She added: \u201cThere are still many steps ahead in this case, but today the first step toward justice for them has certainly been taken, and we will keep fighting.\u201d Marielle\u2019s widow, Monica Benicio, said the convictions were \u201ca message that politicians cannot use murder as a means to conduct politics\u201d. During the trial, Lessa \u2013 whom the federal police accuse of being a contract killer \u2013 again admitted to the crime, speaking coldly about the murder. According to him, the Braz\u00e3o brothers \u2013 long accused of involvement with paramilitary mafia groups known as militias \u2013 ordered the killing after becoming frustrated by Franco\u2019s efforts to disrupt profitable housing development plans. \u201cThe masterminds saw Franco as an obstacle and wanted to deal with her at any cost,\u201d he said, at times referring to the councillor not by name, but as \u201cthe target.\u201d Lessa claimed he would receive land plots valued at 25m reais (\u00a33.3m) as payment.

Gomes\u2019s widow, \u00c1gatha Arnaus, recounted that her husband \u2013 who left behind a son who was one year and eight months old at the time of the crime \u2013 was in the final stages of a selection process to work as an aircraft mechanic, his childhood dream. The sole survivor from that night, Fernanda Chaves, also testified by video call \u2013 she had to leave Brazil in the following months, and since returning has lived outside Rio.

They [the killers and masterminds] will spend the rest of their lives in misery, having to hear \u2018Marielle lives\u2019 \u2026 and seeing her face on walls around the world,\u201d she said. Lessa and Queiroz were tried by a jury made up entirely of men (seven in total), all middle-aged. During the preliminary selection, the defence used its veto to block the only two women who had been chosen. Following the verdict, Franco\u2019s sister and Brazil\u2019s current minister for racial equality, Anielle Franco, said that \u201cpeople need to stop normalising so many bodies falling across the country\u201d. She added, \u201cWhen they murdered my sister, with those four shots to the head, they could not have imagined the strength with which this country and the world would rise up. \u201cWhat happened today is just part of the response we expect. Justice began to be served today,\u201d she said.",

The position was announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as part of Wednesday\u2019s budget statement. She said Goldstone, who will be in post for a year, would \u201chelp us realise the benefits from every pound of public spending\u201d. The position will be responsible for providing advice to the chancellor and chief secretary to the Treasury to save money by reforming systems and improving policy outcomes. \u201cI am honoured to have been appointed by the chancellor and chief secretary to this important role,\u201d said Goldstone. \u201cI look forward to working within government over the coming year to bring renewed focus to ensuring we deliver maximum value for the public in how money is spent.\u201d The role, which will be remunerated at a day rate of \u00a3950, is independent from the Treasury and Goldstone will be expected to work a monthly average of one day a week. He is also a non-executive director of the Submarine Delivery Agency and HS2 Ltd, and was previously chief executive of parliament\u2019s Restoration and Renewal Delivery Authority, as well as working as chief operating officer at the Ministry of Defence. Goldstone also oversaw the government\u2019s \u00a39.3bn investment for the 2012 Olympics, including the Olympic Park venues and infrastructure. He trained as a Cipfa accountant while at the Audit Commission before moving to Price Waterhouse and then spending 12 years \u201cin the delivery of locally based investment programmes for government\u201d. Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told journalists earlier this month that it was important to have \u201cguardrails\u201d to ensure major public works offered value for money, after years of overspending and delays in big projects. Jones contrasted Labour\u2019s creation of the new institutions to the approach taken by Truss, who made \u00a345bn of unfunded tax promises while sidelining the Office for Budget Responsibility. \u201cOne of the problems that Liz Truss had was that she disregarded independent checks and balances and expertise, borrowed loads of money for unfunded policies, and we know everything that happened next,\u201d he said. Jones said \u201cguardrails\u201d were important regardless of considerations in financial markets, to show taxpayers that public money was being well spent. \u201cThe reason I refer to the Liz Truss episode is because that\u2019s an example of when you don\u2019t have them,\u201d he added.

It\u2019s been a lot of matches in a lot of days at a high level. And that\u2019s just the nature of tennis and something I need to keep on getting better at. The best players in the world will back it up every day. And I just wasn\u2019t able to do that today.\u201d</p> <p>The defeat ends Draper\u2019s seven-match winning streak after he won the biggest title of his career <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/27/jack-draper-wins-biggest-tennis-title-of-his-career-with-victory-at-vienna-open\">on Sunday at the Vienna Open</a>, an ATP 500 event. As he set his sights on Paris, Draper was charged with adjusting to the fastest courts at Masters 1000 events this year alongside an extremely difficult draw in which he faced two top-10 opponents in his first three matches.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nuts. I\u2019ve played eight matches in 10 days and it\u2019s not easy matches,\u201d said Draper. \u201cThey are against the top players in the world. It\u2019s physical. I\u2019m giving everything for every point and then, obviously, changing surfaces, changing conditions, no real rest. It\u2019s difficult to keep on going and going and going. Also, knowing this is my last tournament of the year, it\u2019s difficult on court as well. But at the same time, I\u2019m proud of my efforts and hopefully I can continue to work hard and do better.\u201d</p>    <p>After facing two serve-dominant offensive players, Jiri Lehecka and Fritz, in his opening matches, Draper actually enjoyed having more time on the ball early on. From the beginning, he served extremely well and dominated off the ground, hammering forehands down the line throughout the set. Even when he failed to serve out the first set at 5-3, he quickly re-established his control of the exchanges and closed out the set.</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, however, De Minaur has embedded himself inside the top 10 alongside far bigger and stronger opponents in large part because of his grit and spirit. He dug deep from early in the second set and slowly began to turn the match around.</p> <p>As De Minaur served significantly better and erased the earlier unforced errors from his game, he pulled Draper into the lengthier, attritional rallies while also looking to take the ball early and impose himself when he could. Throughout the final two sets, the world No 10 never allowed Draper to regain control of the baseline, exposing the Briton\u2019s fatigue by forcing him to work hard for every single point until the end.</p> <p>\u201cTo really push [In Vienna], play great and do well was amazing,\u201d Draper said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got to back up, you\u2019ve got to go again. I fought hard yesterday, came through a tough one, and then today I think it was just a little too much for me to keep going. But I\u2019m learning all the time, I\u2019m still young. I\u2019m still trying to get over mental barriers, you know? And that\u2019s going to take time.\u201d</p> <p>With this defeat, the 22-year-old\u2019s exceptional breakout season comes to an end. He finishes the year with his first two ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna alongside his first ever grand slam semi-final at the US Open, his results propelling him into the top 15 for the first time in his career and marking him as one of the best players in the world. Most importantly, Draper has positioned himself perfectly to achieve even more in the coming years.</p> <p>After De Minaur went through, Carlos Alcaraz, the second seed, suffered a stunning defeat by Ugo Humbert. The French No 1 played an inspired match and then held his nerve to close out a 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 win.</p>    <p>\u201cI could play better, I think that\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cBut with the level that I had today, I think I competed, I gave everything. I fought until the last point. I have to congratulate Ugo. His performance has been really high.\u201d</p> <p>Alcaraz was also critical of the rapid conditions in Paris, which he struggled with. The 21-year-old believes that he needed to arrive at the tournament earlier to adjust.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I play the first match, the stats came out that it is the fastest court in the Masters 1000, probably on the tour right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is crazy. I don\u2019t know. Probably the fastest one in the last 10 years in this tournament.</p> <p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t know why they do it. I don\u2019t know why they have changed a lot the court from other tournaments \u2013 and obviously in the same tournament, comparing to other years.\u201d</p>",

Throughout the final two sets, the world No 10 never allowed Draper to regain control of the baseline, exposing the Briton\u2019s fatigue by forcing him to work hard for every single point until the end. \u201cTo really push [In Vienna], play great and do well was amazing,\u201d Draper said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got to back up, you\u2019ve got to go again. I fought hard yesterday, came through a tough one, and then today I think it was just a little too much for me to keep going. But I\u2019m learning all the time, I\u2019m still young. I\u2019m still trying to get over mental barriers, you know? And that\u2019s going to take time.\u201d With this defeat, the 22-year-old\u2019s exceptional breakout season comes to an end. He finishes the year with his first two ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna alongside his first ever grand slam semi-final at the US Open, his results propelling him into the top 15 for the first time in his career and marking him as one of the best players in the world. Most importantly, Draper has positioned himself perfectly to achieve even more in the coming years. After De Minaur went through, Carlos Alcaraz, the second seed, suffered a stunning defeat by Ugo Humbert. The French No 1 played an inspired match and then held his nerve to close out a 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 win. \u201cI could play better, I think that\u2019s obvious,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cBut with the level that I had today, I think I competed, I gave everything. I fought until the last point. I have to congratulate Ugo. His performance has been really high.\u201d Alcaraz was also critical of the rapid conditions in Paris, which he struggled with. The 21-year-old believes that he needed to arrive at the tournament earlier to adjust. \u201cWhen I play the first match, the stats came out that it is the fastest court in the Masters 1000, probably on the tour right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is crazy. I don\u2019t know. Probably the fastest one in the last 10 years in this tournament. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know why they do it. I don\u2019t know why they have changed a lot the court from other tournaments \u2013 and obviously in the same tournament, comparing to other years.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Andy Warhol\u2019s films, which tested the endurance of audiences and made icons out of the marginalised and dissolute, altered profoundly the nature of cinema. Much of the work which bore his name from the late 1960s onwards, however, was made by the writer-director Paul Morrissey, who has died aged 86. \u201cWarhol is a trade term,\u201d said Morrissey. \u201cLike Disney.\u201d </p> <p>About his famous friend and collaborator he could be comically scathing. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have many points of view,\u201d he said in 1996. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have many ideas at all, actually. Maybe three. If he made a choice, it was almost always the worst possible choice in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Koch, the author of Stargazer: The Life, World and Films of Andy Warhol (1991), called the two men \u201cmutually incompatible talents \u2026 Morrissey utterly blind to the refined complexity of Warhol\u2019s experience of the world; Warhol wholly incompetent to assemble the often beguiling commercial product Morrissey sells under Warhol\u2019s name.\u201d</p> <p>The first decade or so of Morrissey\u2019s career was given over to orchestrating and managing projects under the Warhol name: not just the films but the stewardship of the avant garde rock pioneers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/08/the-velvet-undergrounds-greatest-songs-ranked\">the Velvet Underground</a> (whom he had brought to Warhol\u2019s attention) as well as the launch in 1969 of the influential magazine Interview, which Morrissey co-founded. It sometimes seemed as though the rest of his life was spent fighting to have his contribution recognised.</p> <p>Morrissey was also Warhol\u2019s personal manager from 1965 to 1974. Asked what this entailed, he said: \u201cI had to think of things that he might do, I had to do them, and then I had to pretend that he was involved.\u201d The two men met in the early 60s when they were both showing their work in New York. After Morrissey had assisted on, and co-directed, Warhol\u2019s films for several years, a turning point arrived in 1968 in the shape of the camp western Lonesome Cowboys. </p> <p>\u201cBefore that, I had been helping Andy make the kind of movies he wanted to make, which was the kind of movie which looked like nobody had made it,\u201d Morrissey said in 1978. \u201cLonesome Cowboys was the first time we were making an effort.\u201d The characters, including gay gunslingers, were still bickering and flirting and talking about their hairdos, as they had always done, only now they were doing it outdoors in Arizona, wearing costumes and riding horses, rather than lounging around in ratty Lower East Side apartments. This combination of tones and styles (timeless genre conventions side by side with a modern, spaced-out looseness) introduced a new piquancy. </p>    <p>Morrissey achieved his most striking results with the acute, funny and freewheeling trilogy of Flesh (1968), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/sep/28/artsfeatures1\">Trash</a> (1970) and Heat (1972). Each showcased the sullen, swaggering beauty of Morrissey\u2019s discovery Joe Dallesandro (immortalised as \u201cLittle Joe\u201d in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/28/lou-reed\">Lou Reed\u2019</a>s song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6fayQBm9w\">Walk on the Wild Side</a>), alongside \u201cWarhol superstars\u201d such as Viva and Jackie Curtis, and the transgender actors Candy Darling and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/07/holly-woodlawn-dies-at-69-andy-warhol-superstar-lou-reed-walk-on-the-wild-side\">Holly Woodlawn</a>. </p> <p>The pictures presented a compassionate portrait of outsiders struggling to make and maintain emotional connections. The great director George Cukor declared himself \u201clost in admiration\u201d and even instigated a campaign, ultimately unsuccessful, to land an Oscar nomination for Woodlawn for her performance in Trash.</p> <p>The plots of these movies were threadbare \u2013 Flesh, shot over the course of five Saturday afternoons, follows a hustler trying to drum up the money for a friend\u2019s abortion \u2013 and sometimes second-hand. Heat, for instance, partially recycles Sunset Boulevard. But it was the attitude that counted, as well as the ambiguity over whether the films constituted art or reality. Though the performances could be affectless to the point of mundanity, Morrissey was adamant about the dividing line between cinema and life. \u201cIf a person is in front of a camera, they\u2019re acting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to live in front of a camera. What I always believed in was the truthfulness of artificiality.\u201d</p> <p>Born into an Irish Catholic family in New York, Paul was the son of Joseph, a lawyer, and his wife, Eleanor, and he remained a devout Catholic all his life. He was educated at Fordham preparatory school and Fordham University, where he began making 16mm films. </p> <p>His first short depicted a priest saying mass on the edge of a cliff before throwing the altar boy to his death. Another, Civilization and Its Discontents, featured \u201ca hood in a pea jacket strangling a fat albino\u201d while Like Sleep showed two drug addicts nodding off. These brought him to Warhol\u2019s attention and led to his involvement on films including My Hustler (1965) and Bike Boy (1967). His first feature-directing credit, shared with Warhol, was on the three-and-a-half hour, split-screen Chelsea Girls (1966). It was precisely the formalist experimentation of that film which some Warhol loyalists accused Morrissey of betraying when he manoeuvred the artist\u2019s brand toward the ordered narratives of Hollywood melodrama. </p> <p>While Warhol was recovering after being shot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/08/news4\">Valerie Solanas</a>, founder and sole member of the Society for Cutting Up Men (SCUM), Morrissey assumed full creative control over the films \u2013 or, rather, his creative control over them was finally made explicit. After Flesh, Trash, Heat, and Women in Revolt (1971), which included a send-up of SCUM in the shape of PIGs (Politically Involved Girls), Morrissey moved in a different direction. Taking Dallesandro with him, he made a pair of kitsch, gory but technically accomplished horror films in Italy: Flesh for Frankenstein (1973) \u2013 released in the US as Andy Warhol\u2019s Frankenstein \u2013 and Blood for Dracula (1974). \u201cI\u2019m always a little afraid of getting stuck doing one thing,\u201d he admitted. </p>    <p>No one could accuse him of that. Flesh for Frankenstein was shown initially in 3D, so that a man whose hand is sliced off seemed to bleed all over the stalls, his guts wobbling in the audience\u2019s faces on the end of a sharpened pole.</p> <p>Morrissey\u2019s next film, The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978), was even more unlikely: a madcap take on Sherlock Holmes starring much of the British comedy establishment, including <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-peter-cook-1567341.html\">Peter Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/28/guardianobituaries.media\">Dudley Moore</a> and Kenneth Williams, as well as the theatrical giant Joan Greenwood, who remarked of Morrissey: \u201cHe\u2019s a dear, really, but the first few days one didn\u2019t know where one was. One got used to him. He\u2019s jolly clever.\u201d Critics were less impressed: Time Out magazine remarked that \u201ca first-year film student would be ashamed\u201d.</p> <p>He continued making films, including Forty Deuce (1982), starring Kevin Bacon as a hustler, and Mixed Blood (1984, aka Cocaine), about Hispanic drug dealers in Manhattan, and spent most of the rest of his life talking about, and clarifying his part in, the Warhol story. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/29/paul-morrissey-death-age-86-cause-of-death-pneumonia\">Paul Morrissey, cult filmmaker and Andy Warhol collaborator, dies at 86</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He remained throughout his career proudly rightwing, outspokenly moralistic and wholly indignant, railing against everything from drugs \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no difference between a person using drugs and a piece of refuse\u201d \u2013 to method acting: \u201cWhen you see people like Daniel Day-Lewis and Ralph Fiennes screaming and hyperventilating, you\u2019re seeing the phoniest kind of bad acting.

The plots of these movies were threadbare \u2013 Flesh, shot over the course of five Saturday afternoons, follows a hustler trying to drum up the money for a friend\u2019s abortion \u2013 and sometimes second-hand. Heat, for instance, partially recycles Sunset Boulevard. But it was the attitude that counted, as well as the ambiguity over whether the films constituted art or reality. Though the performances could be affectless to the point of mundanity, Morrissey was adamant about the dividing line between cinema and life. \u201cIf a person is in front of a camera, they\u2019re acting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to live in front of a camera. What I always believed in was the truthfulness of artificiality.\u201d Born into an Irish Catholic family in New York, Paul was the son of Joseph, a lawyer, and his wife, Eleanor, and he remained a devout Catholic all his life. He was educated at Fordham preparatory school and Fordham University, where he began making 16mm films. His first short depicted a priest saying mass on the edge of a cliff before throwing the altar boy to his death. Another, Civilization and Its Discontents, featured \u201ca hood in a pea jacket strangling a fat albino\u201d while Like Sleep showed two drug addicts nodding off. These brought him to Warhol\u2019s attention and led to his involvement on films including My Hustler (1965) and Bike Boy (1967). His first feature-directing credit, shared with Warhol, was on the three-and-a-half hour, split-screen Chelsea Girls (1966). It was precisely the formalist experimentation of that film which some Warhol loyalists accused Morrissey of betraying when he manoeuvred the artist\u2019s brand toward the ordered narratives of Hollywood melodrama. While Warhol was recovering after being shot by Valerie Solanas, founder and sole member of the Society for Cutting Up Men (SCUM), Morrissey assumed full creative control over the films \u2013 or, rather, his creative control over them was finally made explicit. After Flesh, Trash, Heat, and Women in Revolt (1971), which included a send-up of SCUM in the shape of PIGs (Politically Involved Girls), Morrissey moved in a different direction. Taking Dallesandro with him, he made a pair of kitsch, gory but technically accomplished horror films in Italy: Flesh for Frankenstein (1973) \u2013 released in the US as Andy Warhol\u2019s Frankenstein \u2013 and Blood for Dracula (1974). \u201cI\u2019m always a little afraid of getting stuck doing one thing,\u201d he admitted. No one could accuse him of that. Flesh for Frankenstein was shown initially in 3D, so that a man whose hand is sliced off seemed to bleed all over the stalls, his guts wobbling in the audience\u2019s faces on the end of a sharpened pole. Morrissey\u2019s next film, The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978), was even more unlikely: a madcap take on Sherlock Holmes starring much of the British comedy establishment, including Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Kenneth Williams, as well as the theatrical giant Joan Greenwood, who remarked of Morrissey: \u201cHe\u2019s a dear, really, but the first few days one didn\u2019t know where one was. One got used to him. He\u2019s jolly clever.\u201d Critics were less impressed: Time Out magazine remarked that \u201ca first-year film student would be ashamed\u201d. He continued making films, including Forty Deuce (1982), starring Kevin Bacon as a hustler, and Mixed Blood (1984, aka Cocaine), about Hispanic drug dealers in Manhattan, and spent most of the rest of his life talking about, and clarifying his part in, the Warhol story. He remained throughout his career proudly rightwing, outspokenly moralistic and wholly indignant, railing against everything from drugs \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s no difference between a person using drugs and a piece of refuse\u201d \u2013 to method acting: \u201cWhen you see people like Daniel Day-Lewis and Ralph Fiennes screaming and hyperventilating, you\u2019re seeing the phoniest kind of bad acting. You may as well have a \u2018men at work\u2019 sign. It\u2019s not acting if you can see it.\u201d Despite the marginal nature of much of his work, he was at heart a populist. \u201cI\u2019m very traditional about everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI like action, comedy, pretty colours, pretty people. Art is a formula any idiot can manage. Competing in the marketplace is the only challenge left.\u201d He is survived by his brother, Kenneth. \u2022 Paul Morrissey, writer and film director, born 23 February 1938; died 28 October 2024",

      "body": "<p>There is more than a touch of the Jamie Vardys about Mick Appleby. Both were born in Yorkshire, both have a prolific strike-rate in their chosen professions, and in the same way that no profile of the Leicester forward was once complete without a nod to his non-league roots, Appleby is still familiar to many racing fans from his breakout seasons as the \u201cking of the sand\u201d.</p> \n<p>By Sunday morning, however, he may have earned a new title: the king of the Grade One sprinters. Big Evs, who was Appleby\u2019s first runner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/04/breeders-cup-2023-big-evs-gives-appleby-and-europeans-perfect-start\">first winner at the Breeders\u2019 Cup</a> when he took the Juvenile Turf Sprint at Santa Anita 12 months ago, is back in southern California for a crack at the Turf Sprint at Del Mar on Saturday night. And, quite remarkably, Appleby has found another lightning-fast juvenile, Big Mojo, to attempt a repeat win in the Juvenile Turf Sprint on Friday.</p> \n<p>Both Big Evs and Big Mojo race in the colours of Paul and Rachael Teasdale, who paid a relatively modest 50,000gns (\u00a352,500) for Big Evs before reinvesting 175,000gns (\u00a3183,750) of his \u00a3620,000 earnings in 2023 in Big Mojo.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/28/talking-horses-breeders-cup-frankie-dettori-all-star-cast-horse-racing-tips\">Breeders\u2019 Cup call for Dettori puts finishing touches to all-star cast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many thousands of two-year-olds are bred each year. As the hammer fell, the odds that Big Mojo would follow in Big Ev\u2019s hoofprints at the Breeders\u2019 Cup 12 months later were immense. However Appleby and his new owners saw something in Big Mojo they were determined to have.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe liked everything about him,\u201d Paul Teasdale said on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s was the standout horse at that sale for us. There was a lot of strong bidding but we stuck our neck out and said, look, we\u2019re having him. It was one of those days when we weren\u2019t going to get beat.\u201d</p> \n<p>A few years earlier, Teasdale saw something he liked in Appleby, too. \u201cWe\u2019d done a bit of research, we wanted a yard that was big enough to be professional but not so big that it wasn\u2019t really personal,\u201d he says. \u201cMick and his team have very happy horses and that goes a long way towards making them successful. A lot of people have said to Mick: you\u2019ve come from this to this. I think when you\u2019ve got the quality and class that Mick and the team have, then with the right ammunition, this is where you end up, at the Breeders\u2019 Cup.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Juvenile Turf Sprint is the first race of the meeting, and also one of the deepest and most competitive, with British bookies at least struggling to find a favourite.</p> \n<p>It also draws together many of the storylines for the weekend as a whole, as Aidan O\u2019Brien, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/sep/20/city-of-troy-wows-crowds-gathered-for-key-breeders-cup-test-at-southwell-horse-racing-tips\">saddles City Of Troy</a> in the Classic on Saturday, has two leading contenders in Whistlejacket and Ides Of March, with the latter due to be ridden by Frankie Dettori ahead of his major chance on Emily Upjohn in Saturday\u2019s Turf.</p> \n<p>The horse that may prove to be Big Mojo\u2019s biggest rival, meanwhile, is Ecoro Sieg, one of around a dozen likely runners at this year\u2019s meeting from Japan. With starters in nine of the 14 races, it feels like a statement of intent from Japan\u2019s well-resourced and ever-strengthening racing industry, and the&nbsp;squad includes Forever Young, a challenger to City Of Troy and the local hope Fierceness in the Classic.</p> \n<p>The Breeders\u2019 Cup has often been described as racing\u2019s version of the Ryder Cup, with the best of the Europeans up against the cream of American racing. But this year\u2019s meeting promises to be a genuinely global event, and <strong>Ecoro Sieg</strong> <strong>(9.45pm)</strong> appears to have an outstanding chance to get Japan\u2019s weekend off, quite literally, to a flying start.</p> \n<p>He broke a 22-year-old track record at Nakayama in September by no less than 0.6sec, taking 0.3sec off Japan\u2019s all-time six-furlong record for a juvenile in the process. And that was after having been a little slow to stride.</p> \n<p>Ecoro Sieg is, in other words, potentially something of a one off, and while a draw in stall eight is not ideal, anything close to his level of form last time could well be enough.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"caef0522-5d2c-4dca-9aa8-434e879d0b7c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Uttoxeter </b>12.20 Lookaway 12.55 Irish Chorus 1.25 Railway Bell 2.00 Diamond Dealer 2.35 Chankaya 3.10 Crystal Glance 3.45 Song Of Earth 4.22 River Rider</p>\n    <p><b>Newmarket </b>12.35 Magnetite 1.08 Marching Mac 1.43 Magic Mild 2.17 Montezuma 2.52 Claxton Bay 3.27 Swatch 4.02 On The River</p>\n    <p><b>Wetherby </b>12.45 Kart D\u2019Estruval 1.15 Cadell 1.50 Luckie Seven 2.25 Liam Swagger 3.00 Galop De Chasse (nb) 3.35 Queens Venture 4.10 Romancier</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle </b>2.30 Humble Spark 3.05 Kaleidoscope Eyes 3.40 Fastnet Jenkins 4.15 Dimsons 4.45 Calafrio 5.15 Commander Of Life 5.45 Bobby Joe Leg (nap) 6.15 Patontheback 6.45 Clotherholme</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>O\u2019Brien is two wins away from a share of the all-time record for Breeders\u2019 Cup victories and the warm favourite <strong>Lake</strong> <strong>Victoria</strong> <strong>(11.05pm</strong><strong>)</strong> could well supply one of those in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf.</p> \n<p>There is a strong European contingent in the Juvenile Turf, including New Century, Aomori City and Al&nbsp;Qudra, but <strong>Zulu Kingdom (</strong><strong>12.25am),</strong> who picked up in eye-catching fashion at Aqueduct last time, is a live runner for the home team. <strong>East Avenue (11.45pm)</strong>, owned by the Godolphin operation\u2019s US arm, and another Japanese-trained runner, <strong>American Bikini (10.25pm)</strong>, with Ryan Moore booked to ride, are also fair bets at the likely odds in the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies\u2019 respectively.</p>",

Both were born in Yorkshire, both have a prolific strike-rate in their chosen professions, and in the same way that no profile of the Leicester forward was once complete without a nod to his non-league roots, Appleby is still familiar to many racing fans from his breakout seasons as the \u201cking of the sand\u201d. By Sunday morning, however, he may have earned a new title: the king of the Grade One sprinters. Big Evs, who was Appleby\u2019s first runner and first winner at the Breeders\u2019 Cup when he took the Juvenile Turf Sprint at Santa Anita 12 months ago, is back in southern California for a crack at the Turf Sprint at Del Mar on Saturday night. And, quite remarkably, Appleby has found another lightning-fast juvenile, Big Mojo, to attempt a repeat win in the Juvenile Turf Sprint on Friday. Both Big Evs and Big Mojo race in the colours of Paul and Rachael Teasdale, who paid a relatively modest 50,000gns (\u00a352,500) for Big Evs before reinvesting 175,000gns (\u00a3183,750) of his \u00a3620,000 earnings in 2023 in Big Mojo. Many thousands of two-year-olds are bred each year. As the hammer fell, the odds that Big Mojo would follow in Big Ev\u2019s hoofprints at the Breeders\u2019 Cup 12 months later were immense. However Appleby and his new owners saw something in Big Mojo they were determined to have. \u201cWe liked everything about him,\u201d Paul Teasdale said on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s was the standout horse at that sale for us. There was a lot of strong bidding but we stuck our neck out and said, look, we\u2019re having him. It was one of those days when we weren\u2019t going to get beat.\u201d A few years earlier, Teasdale saw something he liked in Appleby, too. \u201cWe\u2019d done a bit of research, we wanted a yard that was big enough to be professional but not so big that it wasn\u2019t really personal,\u201d he says. \u201cMick and his team have very happy horses and that goes a long way towards making them successful. A lot of people have said to Mick: you\u2019ve come from this to this. I think when you\u2019ve got the quality and class that Mick and the team have, then with the right ammunition, this is where you end up, at the Breeders\u2019 Cup.\u201d The Juvenile Turf Sprint is the first race of the meeting, and also one of the deepest and most competitive, with British bookies at least struggling to find a favourite. It also draws together many of the storylines for the weekend as a whole, as Aidan O\u2019Brien, who saddles City Of Troy in the Classic on Saturday, has two leading contenders in Whistlejacket and Ides Of March, with the latter due to be ridden by Frankie Dettori ahead of his major chance on Emily Upjohn in Saturday\u2019s Turf. The horse that may prove to be Big Mojo\u2019s biggest rival, meanwhile, is Ecoro Sieg, one of around a dozen likely runners at this year\u2019s meeting from Japan. With starters in nine of the 14 races, it feels like a statement of intent from Japan\u2019s well-resourced and ever-strengthening racing industry, and the squad includes Forever Young, a challenger to City Of Troy and the local hope Fierceness in the Classic. The Breeders\u2019 Cup has often been described as racing\u2019s version of the Ryder Cup, with the best of the Europeans up against the cream of American racing. But this year\u2019s meeting promises to be a genuinely global event, and Ecoro Sieg (9.45pm) appears to have an outstanding chance to get Japan\u2019s weekend off, quite literally, to a flying start. He broke a 22-year-old track record at Nakayama in September by no less than 0.6sec, taking 0.3sec off Japan\u2019s all-time six-furlong record for a juvenile in the process. And that was after having been a little slow to stride. Ecoro Sieg is, in other words, potentially something of a one off, and while a draw in stall eight is not ideal, anything close to his level of form last time could well be enough. O\u2019Brien is two wins away from a share of the all-time record for Breeders\u2019 Cup victories and the warm favourite Lake Victoria (11.05pm) could well supply one of those in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf. There is a strong European contingent in the Juvenile Turf, including New Century, Aomori City and Al Qudra, but Zulu Kingdom (12.25am), who picked up in eye-catching fashion at Aqueduct last time, is a live runner for the home team. East Avenue (11.45pm), owned by the Godolphin operation\u2019s US arm, and another Japanese-trained runner, American Bikini (10.25pm), with Ryan Moore booked to ride, are also fair bets at the likely odds in the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies\u2019 respectively.",

Urfan Sharif was also said to have made the schoolgirl put her hands in the air after beating her so badly her stepmother, Beinash Batool, feared he would break her arms and legs. Batool had described Sharif as a \u201cpsycho\u201d who \u201cbeat the crap out of Sara\u201d in text messages to her older sister, Qandeela Saboohi, the court was told. She said Sharif had told her to cover up Sara\u2019s bruises with makeup and sunglasses after the 10-year-old\u2019s teachers became worried that she was to be homeschooled. Batool also detailed how Sharif would go \u201cballistic\u201d, spilling hot tea across the living room, smashing up photo frames and breaking the curtains, the Old Bailey heard. Sharif, 42, his wife, Batool, 30, and brother Faisal Malik, 29, are on trial accused of carrying out a violent \u201ccampaign of abuse\u201d before Sara was found dead in a bunk bed at the family home in Surrey on 10 August 2023. The defendants allegedly killed Sara on 8 August before fleeing to Pakistan, from where Sharif called police to say he had \u201cbeat her up too much\u201d.

On 21 December 2020, Batool told Saboohi that Sharif would \u201cregret\u201d it if Sara revealed he \u201chits her like crazy and all the bruises\u201d before adding: \u201cI literally have to push Urfan out the way and save Sara.\u201d Batool sent 10 photographs showing bruises, saying: \u201cThis is how bad he is beating her \u2026 I feel really sorry for her, he beats the crap out of her.\u201d The following evening, Batool told her sister that Sara had cut up Sharif\u2019s clothes and that she had a \u201cjinn in her\u201d. Her sister asked why Sara had done that, to which Batool replied: \u201cGod knows.

Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Senior US officials have held talks in Israel aimed at brokering a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. </strong>Two senior US envoys, <strong>Amos Hochstein</strong> and <strong>Brett McGurk,</strong> met Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, <strong>Antony Blinken,</strong> said negotiators made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,\u201d US defense secretary <strong>Lloyd Austin</strong> said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement \u201cin hours or days\u201d earlier on Thursday,</strong> said that Israel\u2019s \u201congoing escalation\u201d in his country \u201cdoes not inspire optimism\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the prime minister \u201cmade it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Thursday marked a day when more civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. </strong>The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp</strong>. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) said. </strong>Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It awrned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023,</strong> the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Palestinian authorities said three people had been killed in an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. </strong>The Israeli army said it was targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, and had killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israeli strikes killed five civilians on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, </strong>the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A senior Hamas official said the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire</strong>. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians,</strong> the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, <strong>Francesca Albanese,</strong> has said.

<p><strong>Lebanon</strong>\u2019s prime minister has expressed hope that a ceasefire deal with <strong>Israel</strong> could be reached within days, after <strong>Hezbollah</strong>\u2019s new leader <strong>Naim Qassem</strong> said the militant group could agree to a possible truce under certain parameters.</p> <p>In his first public comments a day after being named to replace former longtime leader <strong>Hassan Nasrallah</strong>, Qassem said however that Israel had yet to agree to any proposal that could be discussed, and that the <strong>Iran</strong>-backed group will keep fighting until it is offered terms it deems acceptable.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,\u201d Qassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. \u201cWe will not beg for a ceasefire.\u201d</p> <p>It came as Israel\u2019s security cabinet met to discuss a possible truce, but also as Israel expanded their bombardment of the group\u2019s bastions, attacking the eastern Lebanese city of <strong>Baalbek</strong>, and said it had killed another senior Hezbollah commander.</p> <p>Lebanese caretaker prime minister <strong>Najib Mikati</strong> said he had previously not believed a deal would be possible until after Tuesday\u2019s <strong>US</strong> presidential election. But he said he became cautiously optimistic after speaking on Wednesday with the <strong>Biden</strong> administration\u2019s <strong>Middle East</strong> envoy <strong>Amos Hochstein</strong>, who was due to travel to Israel on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cHochstein, during his call with me, suggested to me that we could reach an agreement before the end of the month and before November 5th,\u201d Mikati told Lebanon\u2019s Al Jadeed television.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan published what it said was a draft agreement providing for an initial 60-day truce. The document, which the broadcaster said was a leaked proposal written by <strong>Washington</strong>, said Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the 60-day ceasefire. It largely aligned with details reported earlier by Reuters.</p>    <p>Although negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah have made significant progress in the last 24 hours, the Biden administration has not reached a final agreement with either Israel or Lebanon, Axios reported citing two US officials with direct knowledge of the matter.</p> <p>The draft published by Kan was dated Saturday. When asked to comment, White House national security spokesperson <strong>Sean Savett</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are many reports and drafts circulating. They do not reflect the current state of negotiations.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Israeli army launched heavy airstrikes on the eastern city of Baalbek</strong>, famed for its Roman temples, and nearby villages. Tens of thousands of Lebanese, including many who sought shelter in Baalbek from other areas, fled after an Israeli evacuation warning.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 9.30pm in Tel Aviv, Gaza and Beirut. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Senior US officials have held talks in Israel aimed at brokering a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Two senior US envoys, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future,\u201d US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said. Lebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, who had expressed optimism of a speedy settlement \u201cin hours or days\u201d earlier on Thursday, said that Israel\u2019s \u201congoing escalation\u201d in his country \u201cdoes not inspire optimism\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the prime minister \u201cmade it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper but Israel\u2019s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes\u201d. Thursday marked a day when more civilians in both Israel and Lebanon were killed since October 2023. The Lebanese health ministry said that Israeli attacks had killed 45 people in the previous 24 hours, amid bombing in the north-east Bekaa valley and infantry battles in the south. In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site. Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) said. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It awrned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. Palestinian authorities said three people had been killed in an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. The Israeli army said it was targeting militants in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank city of Tulkarem, and had killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks. Israeli strikes killed five civilians on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said. A senior Hamas official said the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday. The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians, the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has said. The comments on Thursday came a day after she published her latest report alleging that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza, but a genocide. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. \u201cThe intention might be for the Palestinians to leave Gaza, for others to occupy it,\u201d Guterres told the Guardian. \u201cBut there has been \u2013 and I pay tribute to the courage and the resilience of the Palestinian people and to the determination of the Arab world \u2013 [an effort] to avoid the ethnic cleansing becoming a reality.\u201d A Palestinian student who was stripped of her UK student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the Home Office\u2019s decision. Israeli intelligence suggests that Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, according to an Axios report. The attack may take place before the US presidential election on 5 November, the outlet said, citing two Israeli sources. The attack is expected to be carried out from Iraq using a large number of drones and ballistic missiles, the sources said. As we reported earlier, two senior US officials, Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk, met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier on Thursday. The meetings were described as \u201csubstantive and constructive and focused on a number of issues in depth, including Iran, Lebanon, Gaza, and securing the release of hostages,\u201d a US official told the Times of Israel. The official said: There was a particular focus on efforts to secure a ceasefire deal in Lebanon that allows people on both sides of the Blue Line to return safely to their homes as well as new initiatives to secure the release of hostages, which Hamas must do without delay. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said negotiators have made \u201cgood progress\u201d toward a deal that would bring a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Washington was \u201cworking very hard\u201d on concluding arrangements on a deal that would include Hezbollah\u2019s withdrawal from the border region with Israel, Blinken said on Thursday, AFP reported. Blinken said: Based on my recent trip to the region, and the work that\u2019s ongoing right now, we have made good progress on those understandings. \u201cWe still have more work to do,\u201d he said, calling for a \u201cdiplomatic resolution, including through a ceasefire.\u201d Blinken also called for the \u201ceffective implementation\u201d of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which would calls for the disarmament of non-state groups in Lebanon and a full Israeli withdrawal from the country. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, speaking alongside Blinken, said there was an \u201copportunity\u201d in Lebanon. Austin said: We\u2019re hopeful that we will see things transition in Lebanon in a not too distant future. The UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians, the divisive special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories has said. Francesca Albanese was speaking to a UN committee on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in New York the day after she published her latest report alleging that Israel was not just committing war crimes or crimes against humanity in Gaza, but a genocide. \u201cIt is time to consider suspending the credentials of Israel as a member state of the UN,\u201d she said. I understand the sensitivity because none of you have clean hands when it comes to human rights. She added that no other country had defied so many UN resolutions for so long. In her report, Albanese claimed: Israel has pursued a pattern of conduct \u2018deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction\u2019. She is a divisive UN rapporteur, and was prevented from holding a briefing at the US Congress this week. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, described her in a tweet as unfit for office, adding: The United Nations should not tolerate antisemitism from a UN-affiliated official hired to promote human rights. Read the full story here: UN should consider suspending Israel over \u2018genocide\u2019 against Palestinians, says special rapporteur Israeli attacks killed 45 people in Lebanon in the past 24 hours, according to the latest update from the Lebanese health ministry on Thursday. It brings the total death toll in Lebanon from Israeli attacks to 2,865 since October 2023, it said. Separately, the UN children\u2019s agency (Unicef) warned that the war in Lebanon is \u201cinflicting severe physical wounds and deep emotional scars\u201d on many of the country\u2019s children. Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured. It said: Since October 4th of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily. Thousands more children who have survived the many months of constant bombings physically unscathed, are now acutely distressed by the violence and chaos around them. The agency said its teams have met children \u201cgripped by overwhelming fear and increased anxiety\u201d who are \u201chaunted by nightmares, headaches, and loss of appetite\u201d. \u201cWar tears apart the safe and nurturing environments children need,\u201d it said, adding that children who are \u201cforced to endure prolonged periods of traumatic stress\u201d will face \u201csevere health and psychological risks\u201d that can last a lifetime. The European Union condemned \u201cany attempt to abrogate the 1967 agreement between Israel and UNRWA or to otherwise attempt to obstruct its capacity to operate its mandate\u201d. The comments followed Israel\u2019s decision to adopt two controversial bills banning the UN agency for Palestinian refugees from operating inside occupied Israeli territory. \u201cIf implemented, the laws will have far-reaching consequences, stopping all UNRWA\u2019s operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, de facto preventing UNRWA\u2019s vital operations in Gaza hampering UNRWA\u2019s provision of health, education and social services in the West Bank and revoking UNRWA\u2019s diplomatic privileges and immunities in Israel,\u201d said a EU statement. \u201cAs long as there is no sustainable solution to the conflict, the mandate of UNRWA will remain vital.\u201d The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five civilians were killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. The Britain-based war monitor said the strikes targeted Qusayr, a town where Hezbollah operate. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing five civilians, the Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses and bridges according to the war monitor. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. A chief medical official at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza has described catastrophic conditions at the facility. \u201cThe hospital has no medical teams \u2013 doctors, surgeons, orthopaedics. More than 33 people, between doctors and nurses, have also been arrested,\u201d Eid Sabbah, the director of nursing at the hospital, told Al Jazeera. The IDF has destroyed oxygen and electricity stations, the hospital\u2019s main water pump and ambulances, Sabbah said. \u201cThe things that we have are things that can\u2019t keep people alive,\u201d he said. Over a hundred wounded patients are still in dire need inside the facility, but only three doctors remain on site, including junior doctors who aren\u2019t qualified to operate. Five days ago, a delegation from the World Health Organization brought a small amount of fuel for the generators to operate and some medical supplies, but \u201cimmediately after the delegation left the hospital on the same night, the Israeli army stormed the hospital, destroyed a lot of things inside, destroyed the medical supplies that we had received,\u201d he said. The Times of Israeli is reporting that the Israeli man killed alongside four foreign nationals by a Hezbollah rocket near Metula today was a 47-year-old called Omer Weinstein and he was a father of four. \u201cThe agreements, the papers, the proposals, the numbers [UN Security Council Resolution] 1509, 1701 \u2014 all these have their place, but they are not the main thing,\u201d he says, hours after meeting and making a similar point to top White House Middle East aides. \u201cThe main thing is our ability and our determination to enforce security, to thwart attacks against us and to act against the arming of our enemies as much as is necessary despite all the pressures and constraints \u2014 that is the main thing.\u201d Turning to address Iran, the prime minister says: \u201cThe brash words of the leaders of the regime in Iran cannot cover up the fact that Israel has greater freedom of action in Iran today than ever before. We can reach anywhere in Iran as needed.\u201d Netanyahu adds that the fight against the Iranian axis is guided by the \u201ctotal victory concept,\u201d but he stopped short of predicting when the war would end. In regards to the remaining hostages kept in Gaza by Hamas, the prime minister says that over half have returned home and they are working on securing safety for the rest, but says these negotiations will be kept behind the scenes. Acute food insecurity is expected to worsen in war-stricken Sudan and nearly two dozen other countries and territories in the next six months, largely as a result of conflict and violence, an analysis by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme has found. The latest edition of the twice-yearly Hunger Hotspots report, published on Thursday, provides early warnings on food crises and situations around the world where food insecurity is likely to worsen, with a focus on the most severe and deteriorating situations of acute hunger. An 18-month conflict has driven hunger in Sudan by disrupting food systems, causing displacement, and blocking access for humanitarian support. Weather extremes, such as floods, have also played a role in worsening food insecurity\u2026 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told visiting US envoy Amos Hochstein and US Middle East adviser Brett McGurk that any ceasefire deal with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah would have to guarantee Israeli security. \u201cThe prime minister specified that the main issue is not paperwork for this or that deal, but Israel\u2019s determination and capacity to ensure the deal\u2019s application and to prevent any threat to its security from Lebanon,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said after the meeting in Jerusalem. Lebanese official media reported Israeli strikes near Baalbek on Thursday, after Israel issued evacuation warnings for the main eastern city for the second day in a row. \u201cEnemy aircraft launched four strikes on the village of Douris and the surroundings of the city of Baalbek,\u201d the National News Agency said. On 1 July 2024, the European hospital in Gaza evacuated all patients and staff. On that day I should have been shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues. I should have been tending gravely injured patients. I should have been helping them to flee. On ventilators, hooked up to IV fluids, on gurneys, in and out of consciousness and clinging to life, they had done nothing to deserve their situation, and they deserved my help. Instead, I watched from my home in Texas and read messages from the other medics, as an overcrowded hospital transformed into a ghost town. With anguish, I witnessed the tragedy unfold from afar. A week earlier, I had been in Jordan with the rest of my team, preparing to cross into Gaza for our humanitarian mission. However, less than 48 hours before we attempted the Rafah border crossing, the Israeli military refused my entry \u201cdue to Palestinian roots\u201d\u2026 It has just gone 5pm in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here is a summary of the latest developments: Senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Agence France-Press (AFP) that the group rejected the idea of a short-term pause in the fighting mooted by US and Qatari mediators. Mediators had hoped that a short pause would create a window to bring in humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population and to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d he said. Senior US officials were to meet their Israeli counterparts on Thursday to discuss a possible deal to end the conflict in Lebanon and secure Israel\u2019s northern border from Hezbollah attacks. On Wednesday, Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism about a ceasefire in \u201cthe coming hours or days\u201d and Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the group would accept a truce under certain conditions. A rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel\u2019s north has killed five people, including an Israeli farmer and four Thai labourers. The incident occurred near the frontline near the border community of Metula, whose citizens largely evacuated close to a year ago and which sits in a closed military zone. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four injured in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday, included a Palestinian refugee camp. It warned it was poised to hit Hezbollah targets in those areas. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. A Lebanese security source said one person was killed on Thursday by an Israeli strike on a road where a Hezbollah van carrying munitions was hit the previous day. The drone strike hit the Araya-Kahhale road which links the capital Beirut to Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley, the source told AFP, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It targeted a Mercedes vehicle, killing the driver, the source said, without identifying the victim. Also on Thursday, an Israeli drone strike hit a motorbike near the coastal town of Naqura, the official National News Agency (NNA) reported. Another motorbike was hit in the eastern Bekaa valley, it added. The United Nations children\u2019s agency said the Israel-Hezbollah war has seen one child die a day in Lebanon over the past month. \u201cSince October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,\u201d Unicef said, adding that \u201cthe ongoing war in Lebanon is upending children\u2019s lives\u201d. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the war effort depends on the economy ahead of Israel\u2019s 2025 state budget. He said: \u201cWe cannot have a strong army if we have no way to finance it. Therefore, security depends on the economy, but the economy also depends on security. If there is an ability to damage our cities, our industry, then obviously our economic capacity would be affected.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. Guterres made his appeal at a time of mounting civilian casualties from the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza. A strike on Tuesday in Beit Lahiya district killed at least 93 people, in what the UN said was just one of at least seven \u201cmass casualty incidents\u201d across Gaza in the past week. A surge in hostilities in the Gaza Strip has raised concerns that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of famine will materialise, UN food agencies warned on Thursday. A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme estimated that 41% of the population, or 876,000 people, will face \u201cemergency\u201d levels of hunger from November until the end of April. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing three and injuring five others, the Syrian Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses near the Lebanese border and a bridge south of Qusayr, it added. Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. Only two doctors are still serving at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza after raids by Israeli forces and the detention of medical staff, aid groups say. Mahmoud Shalabi, deputy director of programmes for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said there were only two doctors and 70 nurses working in a hospital that would usually have 500 medical staff. Medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it had confirmed its employee, orthopaedic surgeon, Mohammed Obeid, was detained during a military operation on 26 October. US state department officials have identified nearly 500 potential incidents of civilian harm during Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza involving US-furnished weapons, but have not taken further action on any of them, according to three sources, including a US official familiar with the matter. Israeli police said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli couple on suspicion of spying for Iran, barely a week after two groups allegedly working for Tehran were detained. \u201cThe thwarting of Iran\u2019s efforts to recruit Israelis continues,\u201d said a statement from the police and Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet. The Irish peace-keeping force\u2019s base in Lebanon has been hit by a rocket, suspected to have been fired by Hezbollah. Nobody was injured, the chief of staff of the Irish Defence Force said on Thursday after a briefing with the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. Lt Gen Sean Clancy said it had struck an unoccupied part of Camp Shamrock, 7km from the Israeli border. Three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, the health ministry and an official said on Thursday. The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry reported \u201ctwo martyrs in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem due to the occupation\u2019s shelling\u201d. The ministry on Wednesday evening reported another death in the area, saying \u201ca martyr shot by the occupation arrived at Thabet Thabet Tulkarem government hospital\u201d. The Israeli military said its soldiers had \u201cbeen operating as part of a counter-terrorism operation in the area of Nur Shams\u201d along with police and the Shin Bet security agency. On Thursday, army said in a statement that it had \u201celiminated the terrorist Hussam Mallah\u201d, whom it identified as an important member of Hamas in the area. At least 43,204 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, and 101,641 injured, since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, under pressure from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, will sign a waiver to extend cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian banks for another month after the cabinet agreed, his spokesperson said on Thursday. Israel\u2019s military said on Thursday it shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday. Israeli officials have said during the war in Gaza that Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt\u2019s Sinai region to smuggle arms. However, Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling. A Palestinian student who was stripped of her student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the UK Home Office\u2019s decision. Dana Abu Qamar, 20, came to the attention of authorities after statements made at a university demonstration on Gaza\u2019s historical resistance to Israel\u2019s \u201coppressive regime\u201d and a subsequent interview with Sky News. Israeli emergency services said a rocket launched from Lebanon killed two people in an olive grove in northern Israel on Thursday, bringing the day\u2019s toll to seven dead, reports Agence France-Presse. Medics \u201ctreated and attempted resuscitation on a 30-year-old male and a 60-year-old female, who were then pronounced dead. A 71-year-old male with mild shrapnel injuries to his limbs was evacuated,\u201d the Magen David Adom first responders said in a statement. Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, under pressure from US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, will sign a waiver to extend cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian banks for another month after the cabinet agreed, his spokesperson said on Thursday, reports Reuters. Smotrich in June extended a waiver that allows cooperation between Israel\u2019s banking system and Palestinian banks in the West Bank, but only for four months until the end of October. The waiver allows Israeli banks to process shekel payments for services and salaries tied to the Palestinian Authority without the risk of being charged with money laundering and funding terrorism. Without it, Palestinian banks would be cut off from the Israeli financial system. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes on Syria\u2019s Qusayr region near the border with Lebanon, where Israel said it hit Hezbollah weapons depots. The UK-based war monitor said three strikes targeted the town of Qusayr and surrounding areas. One strike targeted \u201ca weapons depot and a fuel storage facility for Hezbollah in the industrial city of Qusayr\u201d, killing three and injuring five others, the Syrian Observatory said. The other strikes targeted warehouses near the Lebanese border and a bridge south of Qusayr, according to the war monitor. Agence France-Presse reports that the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said \u201cweapons depots and headquarters used by\u201d Hezbollah were hit in the Qusayr region. Adraee said the strikes sought to thwart attempts to \u201ctransfer weapons from Iran via Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon\u201d. The state news agency, Sana, reported Israeli strikes on Qusayr\u2019s industrial zone and some residential neighbourhoods, saying they caused material damage. The Irish peace-keeping force\u2019s base in Lebanon has been hit by a rocket, suspected to have been fired by Hezbollah. Nobody was injured, the chief of staff of the Irish Defence Force said on Thursday after a briefing with the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. Lt Gen Sean Clancy said it had struck an unoccupied part of Camp Shamrock, 7km from the Israeli border. The assessment was that the rocket, which was Russian made, \u201cwas travelling from north to south into Israel\u201d. There have been about 30 attacks on UN peacekeeping force bases in the blue buffer zone between Lebanon and Israel of which 20 have been attributed to the Israel Defense Forces, Unifil spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said yesterday. Israel\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 43,204 Palestinians and injured 101,641 since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday. The toll includes 41 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Only two doctors are still serving at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza after raids by Israeli forces and the detention of medical staff, aid groups say. Medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it has confirmed its employee, orthopaedic surgeon, Mohammed Obeid, was detained during a military operation on 26 October. MSF said: Dr Obeid has been working tirelessly since the beginning of the war, offering his support as a doctor to multiple hospitals in Gaza. His work has saved countless lives. We call for the safety and the protection of our colleague, and for all medical staff in Gaza who work under impossible conditions and are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care.\u201d The hospital is struggling to deal with an influx of casualties after recent Israeli operations in the Beit Lahia area of Gaza, including a strike on a block of flats that killed 93 people on Tuesday. Mahmoud Shalabi, deputy director of programmes for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said there were only two doctors and 70 nurses working in a hospital that would usually have 500 medical staff. \u201cThat place is the only place right now that is still barely functioning with very minimum resources,\u201d said Shalabi. He added: Every now and then the United Nations go and manage to evacuate around 20 patients every, like, three days, and they bring them to Gaza City \u2026 [but] there is no space to host those patients coming from the north or from any new massacre that is happening in Gaza City.\u201d The Palestinian ministry of health said Kamal Adwan hospital had been subject to \u201crepeated attacks\u201d by Israel, including a strike on Thursday that hit the hospital\u2019s third floor, which they said damaged medical stocks. Three Palestinians were killed in Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, the health ministry and an official said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry reported \u201ctwo martyrs in Nur Shams camp in Tulkarem due to the occupation\u2019s shelling\u201d. Rami Alyan of the camp\u2019s popular service committee told AFP the Israeli army raided Nur Shams camp in the northern West Bank city at 2am, local time. \u201cThe occupation forces are still conducting bulldozing operations in the streets of the camp, and there are injuries,\u201d he said. The two killed were a 16-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man, he added. According to AFP, the Israeli military said its soldiers had \u201cbeen operating as part of a counter-terrorism operation in the area of Nur Shams\u201d along with police and the Shin Bet security agency. The air force \u201cstruck an armed terrorist cell that fired at the forces\u201d during the operation, the statement added. The Palestinian health ministry on Wednesday evening reported another death in the area, saying \u201ca martyr shot by the occupation arrived at Thabet Thabet Tulkarem government hospital\u201d. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a 30-year-old man, Hossam Mallah, was killed in Tulkarem camp, the city\u2019s other refugee camp, by \u201ca special force that infiltrated the camp with a taxi and van\u201d. The army said in its Thursday statement that it had \u201celiminated the terrorist Hussam Mallah\u201d, whom it identified as an important member of Hamas in the area \u201cwho was involved in the planning of terrorist attacks within an immediate time frame\u201d. From a few points on the periphery between Israel and Gaza, it is possible to see the bombed-out ruins of the besieged Palestinian territory; every so often, the boom and thud of airstrikes and artillery fire send plumes of grey and white smoke into the wide autumn sky. For most onlookers, the scene is apocalyptic - but for rightwing Israelis who want to resettle the strip, it\u2019s a promising new horizon. Once dismissed as the pipe dream of fringe extremists, the idea is gaining momentum thanks to Israel\u2019s military success in Gaza, and political support from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition. Last week, near Be\u2019eri, a border kibbutz devastated by the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, the pro-settlement organisation Nachala held a \u201cPreparing to Resettle Gaza\u201d conference, laying out its vision for the strip\u2019s future. The event was given a green light by the Israeli military despite the fact the area is still technically a closed military zone. Several hundred people showed up, including government ministers and Knesset members\u2026 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war effort depends on the economy ahead of Israel\u2019s 2025 state budget. \u201cWe cannot have a strong army if we have no way to finance it. Therefore, security depends on the economy, but the economy also depends on security. If there is an ability to damage our cities, our industry, then obviously our economic capacity would be affected.\u201d Netanyahu claims the Israeli economy has been \u201csurprisingly resilient\u201d during the last year of war. The prime minister did caution that there would be cuts elsewhere. \u201cIf you give to one place, you unfortunately have to take from another place,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are ways to do this.\u201d Our correspondent Peter Beaumont has more detail on the attack which killed five people in northern Israel (see post at 11.31GMT). A rocket barrage fired by Hezbollah at Israel\u2019s north has killed five people, including an Israeli farmer and four Thai labourers. The incident occurred near the front line near the border community of Metula, whose citizens largely evacuated close to a year ago and which sits in a closed military zone. Despite large scale evacuations of northern Israel some agricultural activity has continued in rural areas despite the rocket fire. The deaths come as Hezbollah has shifted back to concentrating most (although not all) of its fire in a 7-10 kilometre area closest to the border. Six Lebanese health workers were killed and four wounded in Israeli strikes across south Lebanon on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement. Meanwhile, The United Nations children\u2019s agency says the Israel-Hezbollah war has seen one child die a day in Lebanon over the past month. \u201cSince October 4 of this year, at least one child has been killed and 10 injured daily,\u201d UNICEF said, adding that \u201cthe ongoing war in Lebanon is upending children\u2019s lives.\u201d Diplomatic efforts are also under way to agree a short halt to fighting in Gaza. But on Thursday, senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told Agence France-Press (AFP) that the group rejected the idea of a short-term pause in the fighting mooted by US and Qatari mediators. Mediators had hoped that a short pause would create a window to bring in humanitarian aid to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population and to negotiate a permanent ceasefire, but Hamas rejected this, reports AFP. \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d Nunu said. Any deal to stabilise Israel\u2019s front with Lebanon is likely to come first, ahead of any ceasefire for Gaza, reports AFP. Last week, Israel\u2019s chief of general staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said: In the north, there\u2019s a possibility of reaching a sharp conclusion.\u201d In his first speech since taking over, Qassem said Hezbollah could continue to resist Israeli air and ground attacks in Lebanon for months, but he also opened the door to a negotiated truce if presented with an Israeli offer. \u201cIf the Israelis decide that they want to stop the aggression, we say we accept, but under the conditions that we see as appropriate and suitable,\u201d he said. Senior US officials were to meet their Israeli counterparts on Thursday to discuss a possible deal to end the conflict in Lebanon and secure Israel\u2019s northern border from Hezbollah attacks. The US visit came as Hamas rejected separate truce plans proposed for the fighting in Gaza (see 10.32am GMT), where Israeli strikes continued overnight, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Less than a week before the US presidential election, Washington\u2019s envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk were expected in Israel. Israeli forces continued their fierce ground and air campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. On Wednesday, Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati expressed optimism about a ceasefire in \u201cthe coming hours or days\u201d and Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the group would accept a truce under certain conditions. According to Israeli media reports citing government sources, the plan brokered by the US team would see Hezbollah forces retreat about 20 miles (30 kilometres) from the border, north of the Litani river, reports AFP. Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and the Lebanese army would then take charge of the border, alongside UN peacekeepers. Lebanon would be responsible for preventing Hezbollah from rearming itself with imported weapons, and Israel would retain its rights under international law to act in self-defence. Five people were killed, including four foreign workers and one Israeli farmer, in a Hezbollah attack on Israel\u2019s northern town of Metula on Thursday, reports Reuters, citing Israel\u2019s Channel 12. UN food agencies warned on Thursday of deadly hunger levels in 16 \u201chunger hotspots\u201d in coming months, with the Palestinian territories, Sudan and South Sudan, Mali and Haiti of most concern, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Conflict is driving most of the acute food insecurity in all those areas analysed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme. Extreme weather was a major factor in other regions, while economic inequality and high debt in many developing countries are hurting governments\u2019 capacity to react, according to the joint report covering forecasts for November 2024 to May 2025. Humanitarian action was urgently needed to prevent starvation and death in the Palestinian territories, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali, said the report, based on research by experts from the two Rome-based United Nations agencies, reports AFP. \u201cWithout immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action to address severe access constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflict and insecurity, further starvation and loss of life are likely\u201d in those spots, it found. Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, along with Nigeria, Chad, Mozambique and Myanmar, are of \u201cvery high concern\u201d, it said. In all those countries, conflict was either a major driver of hunger, or a contributor. A surge in hostilities in the Gaza Strip has raised concerns that the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of famine will materialise, said the report. According to AFP, it estimated that 41% of the population, or 876,000 people, will face \u201cemergency\u201d levels of hunger from November until the end of April. Nearly 16%, or 345,000 people, will experience the most serious \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels. As of mid-October, 1.9 million people in Gaza have been displaced, it said. Conflict forces people to flee their homes, \u201cdisrupting livelihoods and income, limiting market access, and resulting in price fluctuations and erratic food production and consumption,\u201d the report said. With its focus on the most severe and worsening countries, the UN agencies said the report did not \u201crepresent all countries/territories experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity\u201d. The agencies said 2024 marked the second consecutive year of declining funding for humanitarian assistance, while 12 appeals faced funding shortfalls of more than 75%, including for Ethiopia, Yemen, Syria and Myanmar. A Palestinian student who was stripped of her student visa after remarks she made about the Israel-Gaza war has won a human rights appeal against the UK Home Office\u2019s decision. The Home Office failed to demonstrate that the presence of Dana Abu Qamar, 20, was \u201cnot conducive to public good\u201d after the law student\u2019s visa was revoked in December 2023, according to a tribunal ruling. She came to the attention of authorities after statements made at a university demonstration on Gaza\u2019s historical resistance to Israel\u2019s \u201coppressive regime\u201d and a subsequent interview with Sky News. The dual Jordanian-Canadian citizen of Palestinian origin said: For 16 years Gaza has been under blockade, and for the first time they are actively resisting, they are not on the defence, and this is truly a once in a lifetime experience.\u201d She also said: And everyone is, we are both in fear, but also in fear of what, how Israel will retaliate and how we\u2019ve seen it retaliate overnight, and the missiles that it\u2019s launched and the attacks, but also we are full of pride. We are really, really full of joy of what happened.\u201d Abu Qamar, who led the Friends of Palestine society at the University of Manchester, said she was misinterpreted and that she was seeking to support Palestinian resistance to occupation and does not condone the use of violence against civilians, nor has she expressed support for Hamas. The tribunal said the Home Office decision was a \u201cdisproportionate interference with her protected right to free speech\u201d under the European convention on human rights. It found that her statements could not be taken as support for Hamas or the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October. Syrian state media said Israeli strikes hit the town of Qusayr near the Lebanese border on Thursday, the latest in a series of raids in the area, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cAn Israeli aggression targeted the Qusayr area in the southern Homs countryside,\u201d causing \u201cmaterial damage to the industrial city and some residential neighbourhoods,\u201d the state news agency, Sana, said. A senior Hamas official said on Thursday that the group rejects any proposal for a temporary halt to more than a year of fighting in Gaza and insists on a lasting ceasefire, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe idea of a temporary pause in the war, only to resume aggression later, is something we have already expressed our position on. Hamas supports a permanent end to the war, not a temporary one,\u201d Taher al-Nunu, a senior leader of the group, told AFP. Mediators seeking to broker a Gaza ceasefire are expected to propose a truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d to Hamas, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Wednesday. Meetings between the Mossad head David Barnea, CIA director Bill Burns and Qatar\u2019s prime minister in Doha, which concluded on Monday, discussed proposing a \u201cshort-term\u201d truce of \u201cless than a month\u201d, the source told AFP on condition of anonymity because of the talks\u2019 sensitivity. The proposal involves exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinians in Israeli prisons and increasing aid to Gaza, the source added. \u201cUS officials believe that if a short-term deal can be reached, it could lead to a more permanent agreement,\u201d the source told AFP. Nunu said the group had not received any proposal so far, adding if it gets such a plan, it would respond. However, he reiterated the demands the group has been insisting on for months: \u201ca permanent ceasefire, withdrawal (of Israeli forces) from Gaza, the return of displaced people, sufficient humanitarian aid to Gaza and a serious prisoner exchange deal\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said on Thursday it shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday, reports Reuters. Israeli officials have said during the war in Gaza that Palestinian armed group Hamas used tunnels running under the border into Egypt\u2019s Sinai region to smuggle arms. However, Egypt says it destroyed tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago and created a buffer zone and border fortifications that prevent smuggling. Earlier in October, the Israeli military also said it foiled a weapon smuggling attempt from Egypt after downing a drone carrying guns and bullets, reports Reuters. Israel\u2019s military issued an evacuation order for residents in Lebanon\u2019s Baalbek city and surrounding areas on Thursday, for the second day in a row, reports Reuters. A Lebanese security source said one person was killed on Thursday by an Israeli strike on a road where a Hezbollah van carrying munitions was hit the previous day, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The drone strike hit the Araya-Kahhale road which links the capital Beirut to Lebanon\u2019s eastern Bekaa valley, the source told AFP, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. It targeted a Mercedes vehicle, killing the driver, the source said, without identifying the victim. The official National News Agency (NNA) said a \u201chostile drone\u201d targeted the car on the key road that passes through the town of Araya. On Wednesday, an Israeli strike hit a Hezbollah van carrying munitions on the same highway, according to the security source, who said the attack killed the driver. The same day, municipal authorities in Araya and Kahhale called on the Lebanese army to \u201cintervene immediately\u201d to stop the road being used to transport weapons or fighters, reports AFP. Also on Thursday, an Israeli drone strike hit a motorbike near the coastal town of Naqura, NNA said. Another motorbike was hit in the eastern Bekaa valley, it added. Reuters reports that the Israeli military said on Thursday it had shot down a drone smuggling weapons from Egyptian territory to Israel on Wednesday. No other information was provided. We will update the blog as more details come in. Israeli police said on Thursday they had arrested an Israeli couple on suspicion of spying for Iran, barely a week after two groups allegedly working for Tehran were detained, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe thwarting of Iran\u2019s efforts to recruit Israelis continues,\u201d said a statement from the police and Israel\u2019s internal security agency, Shin Bet. The two Israelis, a couple from the central city of Lod, had been involved in gathering intelligence on \u201cnational infrastructures, security sites and tracking a female academic,\u201d the statement alleged: Rafael and Lala Goliev \u2026 residents of Lod, were arrested after they carried out tasks on behalf of an Iranian cell that recruits Israelis from the Caucasus countries in Israel.\u201d According to AFP, Israeli police charged that the couple were recruited by Elshan (Elhan) Agayev, an Azerbaijani national acting on behalf of Iranian officials. It was unclear if Agayev is based in Israel. They alleged that the Golievs carried out surveillance of sensitive Israeli sites, including the headquarters of Israel\u2019s the Mossad spy agency, and collected intelligence on an academic working at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. As AFP reports, Thursday\u2019s announcement comes little more than a week after Israeli security services said they had uncovered two other suspected spy rings. The Israeli army\u2019s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday, includes a Palestinian refugee camp, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). It warned it was poised to hit Hezbollah targets in those areas. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s terrorist activities force the IDF (army) to act forcefully against it in these areas, and we do not intend to harm you,\u201d the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Al-Haush, Borgholiyeh and Ansar are among the areas in southern Lebanon ordered to evacuate, reports Al Jazeera. It cites the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee, as ordering residents of 10 towns and villages, mostly near Tyre and Nabatieh, to evacuate. He said the army would soon \u201cforcefully act\u201d against these areas. \u201cYou are prohibited from heading south. Any movement south could be dangerous to your life,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. The Israeli army has issued evacuation calls for several southern Lebanese villages, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). More details soon \u2026 A Lebanese family planning for a daughter\u2019s wedding were killed in an Israeli strike on their home, reports the Associated Press (AP). According to a report by the AP, the Gharibs\u2019 apartment in the al-Housh district of the Tyre neighbourhood was directly hit by an Israeli airstrike on 23 September. Reda Gharib, who lives in Senegal told the AP that his family in Tyre received a call from the Israeli military to evacuate or risk their lives. His aunts decided to leave for Beirut but his father, mother and three sisters remained. Gharib\u2019s father, Ahmed, a retired Lebanese army officer, his mother, Hanan, and his three sisters were all killed in the strike. \u201cThe whole apartment was gone. It is back to bare bones. As if there was nothing there,\u201d said Gharib, speaking to the AP from the Senegalese capital, Dakar, where he has been living since 2020. The Israeli military said it struck a Hezbollah site hiding rocket launchers and missiles. Gharib told the AP his family had no connection to Hezbollah. The direct hit gutted their apartment, while those above and below suffered only damage, suggesting a specific part of the building was targeted. Gharib said it was his family\u2019s home. The strike was one of more than 1,600 Israel said it carried out on 23 September, the first day of an intensified bombardment of Lebanon it has waged for the past month. More than 500 people were killed that day, a casualty figure not observed in Gaza on a single day until the second week, said Emily Tripp, director of London-based Airwars, a conflict monitoring group. Gharib told the AP that his sister Maya was engaged and planned to marry on 12 October but as tensions with Israel grew in September, Gharib\u2019s plans to come home for the wedding were uncertain. She told him she would put it off until he could get there. After the strike, her fiance, also an army officer, found her body and those of the rest of her family in a hospital morgue in Tyre. \u201cShe was not destined to have her wedding. We paraded her as a bride to paradise instead,\u201d Gharib said. US state department officials have identified nearly 500 potential incidents of civilian harm during Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza involving US-furnished weapons, but have not taken further action on any of them, according to three sources, including a US official familiar with the matter. The incidents \u2013 some of which may have violated international humanitarian law, according to the sources \u2013 have been recorded since 7 October 2023, when the Gaza war started. They are being collected by the state department\u2019s Civilian Harm Incident Response Guidance (CHIRG), a formal mechanism for tracking and assessing any reported misuse of US-origin weapons. State department officials gathered the incidents from public and non-public sources, including media reporting, civil society groups and foreign government contacts. The mechanism, which was established in August 2023 to be applied to all countries that receive US arms, has three stages: incident analysis, policy impact assessment and coordinated department action. None of the Gaza cases had yet reached the third stage of action, said a former US official familiar with the matter. Options, the former official said, could range from working with Israel\u2019s government to help mitigate harm, to suspending existing arms export licenses or withholding future approvals. The Washington Post first reported the nearly 500 incidents on Wednesday. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned Israel could carry out the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza if the international community does not make a determined stand to prevent it. Guterres made his appeal at a time of mounting civilian casualties from the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza. A strike on Tuesday in Beit Lahiya district killed at least 93 people, in what the UN said was just one of at least seven \u201cmass casualty incidents\u201d across Gaza in the past week. At the same time, aid deliveries to Gaza are reported to have fallen to their lowest level since the start of the war, leading to growing allegations that Israel\u2019s true intention is to drive the remaining Palestinian population out of at least part of Gaza. The UN secretary general, speaking on the sidelines of the COP16 biodiversity conference in Colombia, suggested that the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of Gaza had been prevented until now by its people\u2019s refusal to succumb to the intense pressure to flee their homes and by Arab resolve not to accept mass population transfers. \u201cThe intention might be for the Palestinians to leave Gaza, for others to occupy it,\u201d Guterres told the Guardian. \u201cBut there has been \u2013 and I pay tribute to the courage and the resilience of the Palestinian people and to the determination of the Arab world \u2013 [an effort] to avoid the ethnic cleansing becoming a reality.\u201d \u201cWe will do everything possible to help them remain there and to avoid ethnic cleansing that might occur if there is not strong determination from the international community,\u201d he added. You can read the full report by Patrick Greenfield in Cali, Malak A Tantesh in Gaza and Julian Borger in Jerusalem here: Israeli strikes on the West Bank\u2019s Nur Shams refugee camp on Thursday killed two Palestinians including a child, Reuters reports, citing the Palestinian health ministry. One Palestinian was shot and killed by the Israeli army overnight in West Bank\u2019s refugee camp of Tulkarm, the health ministry added. The Israeli army said on Thursday it was conducting an operation targeting \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in Nur Shams. Official Palestinian news agency Wafa said a large number of Israeli vehicles and heavy bulldozers stormed the city and headed towards the Nur Shams refugee camp. According to Reuters, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, al-Quds Brigades, said in a statement they detonated a highly explosive bomb in a military bulldozer to thwart the Israeli army\u2019s raid. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister has expressed hope that a ceasefire deal with Israel could be reached within days, after Hezbollah\u2019s new leader Naim Qassem said the militant group could agree to a possible truce under certain parameters. In his first public comments a day after being named to replace former longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, Qassem said however that Israel had yet to agree to any proposal that could be discussed, and that the Iran-backed group will keep fighting until it is offered terms it deems acceptable. \u201cIf the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,\u201d Qassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a pre-recorded televised address. \u201cWe will not beg for a ceasefire.\u201d It came as Israel\u2019s security cabinet met to discuss a possible truce, but also as Israel expanded their bombardment of the group\u2019s bastions, attacking the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, and said it had killed another senior Hezbollah commander. Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said he had previously not believed a deal would be possible until after Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. But he said he became cautiously optimistic after speaking on Wednesday with the Biden administration\u2019s Middle East envoy Amos Hochstein, who was due to travel to Israel on Thursday. \u201cHochstein, during his call with me, suggested to me that we could reach an agreement before the end of the month and before November 5th,\u201d Mikati told Lebanon\u2019s Al Jadeed television. Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan published what it said was a draft agreement providing for an initial 60-day truce. The document, which the broadcaster said was a leaked proposal written by Washington, said Israel would withdraw its forces from Lebanon within the first week of the 60-day ceasefire. It largely aligned with details reported earlier by Reuters. Although negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah have made significant progress in the last 24 hours, the Biden administration has not reached a final agreement with either Israel or Lebanon, Axios reported citing two US officials with direct knowledge of the matter. The draft published by Kan was dated Saturday. When asked to comment, White House national security spokesperson Sean Savett said: There are many reports and drafts circulating. They do not reflect the current state of negotiations.\u201d In other developments: The Israeli army launched heavy airstrikes on the eastern city of Baalbek, famed for its Roman temples, and nearby villages. Tens of thousands of Lebanese, including many who sought shelter in Baalbek from other areas, fled after an Israeli evacuation warning. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 19 people were killed in Israeli strikes on two towns in the Baalbek area on Wednesday. After the airstrikes, the Israeli military said it had targeted Hezbollah fuel reservoirs in the Bekaa valley region. In his first remarks as leader, Nassim Qassem said the series of blows dealt to the group in recent weeks had \u201churt\u201d Hezbollah, but asserted that the group had been able to reorganise its ranks swiftly after Nasrallah\u2019s death. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s capabilities are still available and compatible with a long war,\u201d he said. Qassem said he would stick to the war strategy laid out by his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month after full-scale fighting broke out. \u201cMy work programme is a continuation of the work programme of our leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,\u201d Qassem said, pledging to press on with \u201cthe war plan that he [Nasrallah] developed with the leadership\u201d of the Iran-backed group. Donald Trump promised that he will bring \u201cpeace\u201d to the Middle East, with the US Republican nominee for president making the pronouncement in a letter just six days before the US election for the White House on 5 November. \u201cDuring my administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon!\u201d he said in his letter to Lebanese Americans. At least 30 people were killed as Israel pummeled Gaza with new bombardments, Palestinian medics said. Eight of today\u2019s victims were killed in northern Gaza. The area Israel hit is near to where medics said at least 93 people had been killed or reported missing on Tuesday in an Israeli strike Washington called \u201chorrifying\u201d. The UN security council \u201cstrongly warned against any attempts to dismantle or diminish\u201d the operations and mandate of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, after Israel passed a law banning its operations. In a statement adopted by consensus, the 15-member body expressed grave concern over the legislation adopted by the Israeli parliament on Monday. The Israeli army said it had killed the deputy head of Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan force, Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, in a strike in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon. \u201cIn an intelligence-directed strike, the Israeli air force struck and eliminated Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, deputy commander of Hezbollah\u2019s Radwan forces, in the area of Nabatieh,\u201d the army said in a statement. At least 43,163 Palestinians have been killed and 101,510 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. The ministry said on Wednesday that 102 Palestinians had been killed and 287 injured in the past 24 hours. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group said it had launched drones at an Israeli base in the port city of Haifa. Hezbollah fighters \u201claunched an air attack at 7.45am (0545 GMT) \u2026 with a squadron of attack drones\u201d on a \u201cbase in southern Haifa\u201d, the group said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p>It has been almost two decades since Nicholas Ferguson, a grand figure in the private equity business, caused a storm by talking out loud about his industry\u2019s dirty little secret. It could not be right, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/05/privateequity.viewpointcolumn\">he said</a>, that highly remunerated private equity executives could pay less tax than a cleaner or other low-paid workers.</p> <p>Things have moved on a bit since 2007. So-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d, or carry \u2013 the portion of an investment profit that the private equity managers retain as a bonus for success \u2013 is now taxed at 28% under the capital gains regime; in the old days, rates in effect as low as 10% could be secured thanks to various exceptions.</p> <p>But the underlying point remains. Why on earth should a performance-related bonus be treated as a capital gain rather than as income, where it would normally be taxed at the higher rate of 45%? Bonuses in banking and other parts of the financial sector don\u2019t get the same special treatment.</p> <p>The Labour party\u2019s line in its election manifesto was admirably clear. \u201cPrivate equity is the only industry where performance-related pay is treated as capital gains. Labour will close this loophole,\u201d it said. The document even spelled out the projected extra receipts for the Treasury \u2013 \u00a3565m a year \u2013 and said where the money would be spent, notably on recruiting 8,500 mental health staff.</p> <p>But Rachel Reeves flunked it on Wednesday. Capital gains tax rates on carried interest will be merely increased to 32% from April 2025. From April 2026, carry will be taxed within the income tax framework but, critically, with \u201cbespoke rules to reflect its unique characteristics\u201d. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggested that will work out at about 34%. You can see the effect in the projections: forget \u00a3565m on extra receipts, the peak year yields \u00a3140m.</p> <p>As reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/12/private-equity-barons-lean-on-rachel-reeves-to-water-down-proposals-for-higher-taxes\">elsewhere in the Guardian</a>, this is a lobbying triumph for the buyout barons\u2019 trade body, the British Venture Capital Association, which was warning darkly that funds would skip off to the EU if the manifesto pledge was implemented. The chancellor has instead settled for a rate that, on the OBR\u2019s numbers, is similar to that in France and the Netherlands.</p> <p>The threat of a mass exodus may indeed have been real, rather than standard posturing, it should be said. It\u2019s not too much harder to run a private equity fund from Paris rather than London. As the OBR notes, even its modelling on the new rates \u201cis highly uncertain as it is driven by the behaviour of a small number of high-net-worth taxpayers\u201d.</p> <p>But the irritation factor with Reeves\u2019s fudge is still high for a number of reasons. First, that manifesto pledge was not given lightly. It was made after a three-year period in which Labour had argued consistently that it had heard the counter-arguments but still judged that private equity should not have a separate treatment.</p> <p>Second, carried interest is income on any logical interpretation because the amount of personal capital risked by partners tends to be tiny. There really aren\u2019t inherently \u201cunique characteristics\u201d that couldn\u2019t be claimed by other professionals, from software engineers to plumbers. It\u2019s just that private equity has always had special treatment going back to 1987.</p> <p>Third, even if the chancellor felt compelled by that history to compromise, she should have at least gone for a rate in the high, rather than the low, 30s. As it is, private equity practitioners cannot believe their luck.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been almost two decades since Nicholas Ferguson, a grand figure in the private equity business, caused a storm by talking out loud about his industry\u2019s dirty little secret. It could not be right, he said, that highly remunerated private equity executives could pay less tax than a cleaner or other low-paid workers. Things have moved on a bit since 2007. So-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d, or carry \u2013 the portion of an investment profit that the private equity managers retain as a bonus for success \u2013 is now taxed at 28% under the capital gains regime; in the old days, rates in effect as low as 10% could be secured thanks to various exceptions. But the underlying point remains. Why on earth should a performance-related bonus be treated as a capital gain rather than as income, where it would normally be taxed at the higher rate of 45%? Bonuses in banking and other parts of the financial sector don\u2019t get the same special treatment. The Labour party\u2019s line in its election manifesto was admirably clear. \u201cPrivate equity is the only industry where performance-related pay is treated as capital gains. Labour will close this loophole,\u201d it said. The document even spelled out the projected extra receipts for the Treasury \u2013 \u00a3565m a year \u2013 and said where the money would be spent, notably on recruiting 8,500 mental health staff. But Rachel Reeves flunked it on Wednesday. Capital gains tax rates on carried interest will be merely increased to 32% from April 2025. From April 2026, carry will be taxed within the income tax framework but, critically, with \u201cbespoke rules to reflect its unique characteristics\u201d. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggested that will work out at about 34%. You can see the effect in the projections: forget \u00a3565m on extra receipts, the peak year yields \u00a3140m. As reported elsewhere in the Guardian, this is a lobbying triumph for the buyout barons\u2019 trade body, the British Venture Capital Association, which was warning darkly that funds would skip off to the EU if the manifesto pledge was implemented. The chancellor has instead settled for a rate that, on the OBR\u2019s numbers, is similar to that in France and the Netherlands. The threat of a mass exodus may indeed have been real, rather than standard posturing, it should be said. It\u2019s not too much harder to run a private equity fund from Paris rather than London. As the OBR notes, even its modelling on the new rates \u201cis highly uncertain as it is driven by the behaviour of a small number of high-net-worth taxpayers\u201d. But the irritation factor with Reeves\u2019s fudge is still high for a number of reasons. First, that manifesto pledge was not given lightly. It was made after a three-year period in which Labour had argued consistently that it had heard the counter-arguments but still judged that private equity should not have a separate treatment. Second, carried interest is income on any logical interpretation because the amount of personal capital risked by partners tends to be tiny. There really aren\u2019t inherently \u201cunique characteristics\u201d that couldn\u2019t be claimed by other professionals, from software engineers to plumbers. It\u2019s just that private equity has always had special treatment going back to 1987. Third, even if the chancellor felt compelled by that history to compromise, she should have at least gone for a rate in the high, rather than the low, 30s. As it is, private equity practitioners cannot believe their luck.",

Many were sent to out-of-state detention centers. Nayeli was among those released that evening, allowed to return home to her son, who was nine at the time. All faced deportation.</p> \n<p>Last year, the immigrant workers <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-department-of-homeland-security-southern-poverty-law-center-tennessee-meat-processing-immigration-62974a7fee4f33d5e102121f997864be\">won a rare settlement</a> in a class-action lawsuit against the US government and federal agents, who they accused of racial profiling and excessive use of force. After a year without work, Nayeli returned to her job at the plant, Southeastern Provision, located in the small, lakeside town of Bean Station. She says she is moving forward with her life in Tennessee, where she now helps organize her community as part of a local immigrant rights coalition.</p> \n<p>But that day in April still haunts her. She fears it could happen again, to her and other immigrants if Donald Trump were to return to power.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am afraid that he may win, because I have heard that he wants deportations,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very scared of this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raids and mass deportations lie at the heart of the former president\u2019s second-term vision \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants\">a web of policies so vast</a> that critics say their collective implementation would challenge the very ideal of the United States as a nation of immigrants.</p> \n<p>Should he win in November, the Republican nominee has vowed not only to restore many of his most controversial immigration policies, but to go even further. While a number of his first-term plans were stymied by the courts and Congress, immigration rights leaders believe a second Trump administration would likely be more sophisticated and strategic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is different this time. There\u2019s a plan. There is a sense of urgency that they\u2019ve created around this issue,\u201d said Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America\u2019s Voice. \u201cAnd they know how to use the levers of government in a way they didn\u2019t in 2016.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump would also be operating in a changed political landscape. Since leaving office, the political center of gravity has <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/10/15/2024/no-matter-who-wins-the-country-is-moving-to-the-right\">shifted rightward</a>, amid a post-pandemic rise in global migration that saw a record number of people arriving at the southern border and claiming asylum. Americans have become <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/06/immigration-attitudes-and-the-2024-election/\">less tolerant</a> of illegal immigration while a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/508520/americans-value-immigration-concerns.aspx\">growing minority</a> is increasingly concerned about its impact on the country\u2019s economy and national identity.</p> \n<p>Though border crossings have plummeted this year following the president\u2019s asylum clampdown, a sense of disorder persists. Voters continue to broadly disapprove of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s handling of the situation. Trump and his team are confident immigration remains a potent political issue for voters \u2013 and one that he has long played to his <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-leads-harris-wsj-poll-779f8516?st=RAtQf6&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink?mod=WSJ_WNPOD\">advantage</a>.</p> \n<p>When Trump first descended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/donald-trump-presidential-campaign-speech-eyewitness-memories\">a golden escalator</a> in 2015, he pledged to construct a \u201cgreat wall\u201d along the south-west border with Mexico to keep out immigrants he disparaged as \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers. Now, in the final weeks of his third presidential race, Trump has again escalated his threats against immigrants, but this time he is turning his vitriol inward toward those already here.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d Trump claimed recently at a rally in Atlanta. \u201cBut on November 5, 2024, that will be liberation day in America.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Not just the bad people\u2019</h2> \n<p>Trump has vowed to stage the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d. The former president repeats the pledge so frequently, it has become a campaign rallying cry. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republican-national-convention-2024\">Republican national convention in Milwaukee</a> this summer, his supporters waved signs that read \u201cMass deportations now!\u201d and chanted: \u201cSend them back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has offered few concrete details about his plans, but in public remarks and interviews, he and his allies, including Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s harsh immigration agenda and an influential adviser, have sketched out an expansive vision that dovetails with the plans laid out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025\">Project 2025</a>, a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/project-2025-election\"> 900-plus page </a>presidential transition blueprint led by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. The strategy, as Trump has described it, may involve the extraordinary use of US troops for immigration enforcement and border security and the application of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/trump-aurora-colorado-migrant-crackdown\">18th-century wartime powers</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump has <a href=\"https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/\">likened his mass deportation plan</a> to the campaign carried out under President Dwight D Eisenhower in 1954. Known by the ethnic slur \u201c<a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/operation-wetback-eisenhower-1954-deportation\">Operation Wetback</a>\u201d, hundreds of thousands of people with Mexican ancestry, including some US citizens, were rounded up and deported. Trump\u2019s ambition is vastly more draconian, immigration advocates say.</p> \n<p>As he has sought to return to the White House, Trump has pledged to expel \u201c<a href=\"https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/\">maybe as many as 20 million</a>\u201d people from the US, though he often fails to distinguish between those who are in the country unlawfully and those who have legal residency.</p> \n<p>There were <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/\">11 million undocumented immigrants</a> living in the US as of 2022, the vast majority of whom had been in the country for more than a decade. It is estimated that more than <a href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/biden-three-immigration-record\">2 million new arrivals</a> encountered at the southern border since Biden took office remain in the country. <a href=\"https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-temporary-protected-status/\">Hundreds of thousands</a> of immigrants granted permission to temporarily live and work in the US for humanitarian reasons are also vulnerable and could see their status revoked.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe totality of it is to be so cruel and to make life so hard for immigrants today that they are left with two options: stay in the United States and be subject to presidential demagoguery \u2026 or leave their lives here, no matter how long they\u2019ve been here, and go someplace else,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group.</p> \n<p>To speed up the process, Trump has said he could invoke the archaic Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows for summary deportation of non-citizens from a foreign country with which the US is at war. In his rationale, he would use it \u201cto target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil\u201d, though it remains an open legal question as to whether the supreme court would allow a president to apply the law in this manner. His plans also include the construction of enormous detention camps that Miller, who is expected to serve in a second Trump White House, has declared would be \u201cgreater than any national infrastructure project we\u2019ve done to date\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want everybody to understand this is going to happen,\u201d Miller told rightwing activist Charlie Kirk on his podcast last year. \u201cIf President Trump is back in the Oval Office in January, this is going to commence immediately.\u201d</p> \n<p>Beyond a deportation operation, Trump has vowed to \u201cterminate\u201d every one of Biden\u2019s \u201copen-borders\u201d policies. He says he would reinstate a policy requiring people seeking asylum in the US to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed and would again invoke the emergency health authority, known as Title 42, that allows US officials to turn away asylum seekers at the border.</p> \n<p>His platform calls for reinstating a version of his controversial ban on travel from several primarily Muslim countries, which Biden called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states/\">a stain on our national conscience</a>\u201d and ended on his first day in office.</p> \n<p>Allies have circulated legal theories to support ending birthright citizenship for the US-born children of undocumented immigrants, a proposal most scholars believe to be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/birthright-citizenship-executive-order-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\">unconstitutional</a>. Trump has also stated that he would impose ideological screenings to keep \u201cChristian-hating communists, Marxists and socialists out of America\u201d. The visas of foreign students who participated in anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian protests could be rescinded.</p> \n<p>Courts have held that presidents have wide latitude to act on immigration. An emboldened Trump, with a deadlocked Congress, could dramatically reshape the immigration system, especially by restricting legal pathways. \u201cThe president\u2019s authority there is far more powerful because it is not as much a question of resources as it is a question of policy,\u201d said<strong> </strong>Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, a non-profit advocacy group.</p> \n<p>In a statement, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump spokesperson, blamed the Biden-Harris administration for creating an \u201cunprecedented immigration, humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cPresident Trump will restore his effective immigration policies, implement brand-new crackdowns that will send shockwaves to all the world\u2019s criminal smugglers, and marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers and human traffickers in American history,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Trump recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/trump-aurora-colorado-migrant-crackdown\">previewed aspects of his sprawling agenda</a> at a rally held in Aurora, Colorado \u2013 hardly a presidential battleground but a convenient backdrop to stoke fears of suburban America under siege. Aurora residents and its Republican mayor forcefully rejected Trump\u2019s portrayal of the city as a \u201cwar zone\u201d overrun by Venezuelan gang members, but it had no effect.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/us-elections-2024/stakes-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Flanked by mugshots on stage, Trump announced \u201cOperation Aurora\u201d. The crowd roared. A second Trump administration would unleash \u201celite squads\u201d of federal law enforcement officers to \u201chunt down, arrest and deport every last illegal alien gang member until there is not a single one left in this country\u201d. He also called for the death penalty for \u201cany migrant\u201d who kills an American.</p> \n<p>But the dragnet would be turned on anyone in the country unlawfully. JD Vance, his running mate, has suggested a \u201csequential approach\u201d beginning with people who have committed crimes, before expanding to all undocumented immigrants, and even those with legal but temporary status designated for people fleeing war, violence and other crises in their home countries.</p> \n<p>At a campaign stop in Arizona this month, Vance deflected a question about whether a future administration would deport Dreamers \u2013 young adults who arrived in the US as children, hundreds of thousands of whom are currently shielded from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program that Trump attempted to terminate during his first term.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe also have to deport people, not just the bad people who came into our country, but people who violated the law coming into this country,\u201d Vance told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be willing to deport them.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Logistical and economic challenges</h2> \n<p>Analysts say such an operation would face enormous logistical, legal and bureaucratic challenges, making it virtually impossible to achieve in the span of a four-year presidential term.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny president who dreams of one grand operation to round up <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/#:~:text=The%20unauthorized%20immigrant%20population%20in,trend%20from%202007%20to%202019.\">11 million people</a> is probably fooling themselves,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick said. </p> \n<p>Carrying out <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-mass-deportations-start-1-million-defends/story?id=112739447\">1m deportations</a> per year, as Vance has suggested, could cost $967.9bn over a decade, <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation\">according to an analysis</a> by the American Immigration Council published this month. Congress would have to provide a major infusion of resources, to hire tens of thousands of new government employees and law enforcement officers and greatly expand the capacity of detention facilities and immigration courts, Reichlin-Melnick said.</p> \n<p>Assuming a Republican-controlled Congress was willing to allocate the funds, the new cases would land in an already-overwhelmed immigration court system: there is currently a backlog of nearly 3.7m unresolved cases, according to Trac, a research group at Syracuse University.</p> \n<p>Sudden, large-scale deportations would fracture families \u2013 both citizens and noncitizens \u2013 deeply rooted in their communities. As many as 4.4 million children who are US citizens live with a parent who is undocumented, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>.</p> \n<p>Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, recalls children returning home from school to empty homes after their parents had been arrested in the 2018 workplace raid. The following day, more than 500 students were reported absent from school, as fear and confusion spread.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was like a bomb had gone off in this little community,\u201d she said. Teachers scrambled to comfort students, as advocates and faith leaders scrambled to set up a crisis response center. Sherman Luna recalled a sense of shock, even among residents whose families had not been directly affected.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat we discovered in Morristown was that the local community, including many non-immigrant, native Tennesseans, were really appalled by what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember clearly one of the women who had lived in Tennessee her whole life said: \u2018You know, I voted for Trump, but I never imagined that this would be the impact of that.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The economic toll could also be jarring. Researchers say mass deportations at the scale Trump is proposing risk exacerbating labor shortages and driving up inflation. The American Immigration Council report estimated that his mass deportation plan would shrink the country\u2019s gross domestic product by 4.2% to 6.8% \u2013 a level not seen since the Great Recession. Tax collections would also fall: in 2022, undocumented immigrants <a href=\"https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/\">contributed nearly $100bn</a> in federal, state and local taxes.</p> \n<p>About 8.3 million US workers were unauthorized immigrants as of 2022, according to Pew, roughly 5% of the overall workforce. They contribute to the economy by creating demand for goods and services such as cars, food and haircuts. In a <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/721152\">study of the labor market impact</a> of more than 450,000 deportations between 2008 and 2013, the researchers <a href=\"https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/secure/\">found that</a> scaling up enforcement did not improve the overall employment share and wages of US-born workers. Rather, it reduced them, particularly for low-skilled Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe idea that large-scale deportation is good for Americans has proven to be an illusion in the past and is an illusion now,\u201d Michael Ettlinger, a senior fellow at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire, told reporters.</p> \n<p>Undocumented people often fill low-wage jobs that native-born workers won\u2019t take, particularly in industries such as construction, agriculture, caregiving and service. Americans were especially grateful for their contributions during the pandemic, as millions of undocumented people worked frontline jobs, risking their health to provide essential services.</p> \n<p>During an hour-long <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3tvZi5fTZw\">Univision town hall</a> with undecided Latino voters earlier this month, Trump<a href=\"https://www.univision.com/shows/noticiero-univision/un-agricultor-a-trump-quien-cosechara-los-alimentos-si-deporta-a-los-trabajadores-indocumentados-video\"> fielded a question</a> from Jorge Vel\u00e1zquez, a farmworker from California who said he had spent years picking strawberries and cutting broccoli in the fields. Many of those workers were undocumented, he said. He wanted to know Trump\u2019s plan to fill those jobs if those workers were deported, and what that might mean for food prices.</p> \n<p>After a stream of <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jun/06/donald-trump/fact-check-trumps-ridiculous-claim-that-millions-o/\">falsehoods</a> about immigrants coming from countries that were \u201cemptying out\u201d jails and \u201cmental institutions\u201d \u2013 and no mention of his mass deportation plan \u2013 Trump stated that he supported legal immigration.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country,\u201d Trump said. His campaign did not provide details on how he might do so.</p> \n<h2>Fear-inducing rhetoric and \u2018chilling effects\u2019</h2> \n<p>In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s nakedly xenophobic rhetoric has grown ever more menacing and nativist. Impervious to facts, he has falsely blamed undocumented people for the country\u2019s woes, including inflation, urban crime and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/fema-funding-hurricane-season#:~:text=The%20US%20homeland%20security%20secretary,Hurricane%20Helene%20and%20typically%20runs\">dearth of federal funding </a>for disaster response. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining the fabric of our country,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Walker, Michigan, presenting mass deportations as a cure-all.</p> \n<p>He has even pre-emptively identified non-citizens as the culprit if he doesn\u2019t win in November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/trump-republicans-non-citizen-voters-myth-stolen-election\">amplifying baseless claims</a> that noncitizens are voting en masse. It is part of broader rightwing conspiracy theory that Democrats are allowing immigrants to flow into the country unlawfully so that they will vote and steal the election from him. (Noncitizen voting is illegal and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/noncitizens-voting-republicans-election-2024-immigration-09b86e6768f755fd875f3c51b0e8ea70\">extremely rare</a>.)</p> \n<p>Last month, Trump said removing undocumented immigrants from the country \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/first-edition-donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election\">will be a bloody story</a>\u201d. He had previously echoed Adolf Hitler, when he said undocumented immigrants were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally\">poisoning the blood of the country</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a recent interview, Trump accused those who have come to the US of having \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/376797/trump-immigrants-bad-genes-nationalism\">bad genes</a>\u201d that predispose them to commit violent acts, distorting a federal statistic in service of a groundless claim that undocumented people have driven up crime rates. And at a rally in Arizona last week, Trump likened the US to a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/trump-arizona-rally-immigration\">garbage can for the world</a>\u201d as he railed against a \u201cmigrant invasion\u201d of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have got to get those animals out of here fast,\u201d he said of immigrants who have committed crimes. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/29/truth-about-illegal-immigration-crime/\">Many studies have found</a> that immigrants \u2013 whether they have legal status or not \u2013 tend to be more law-abiding than US-born citizens.)</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump has managed to dehumanize us on such a scale that people forget \u2013 when they think about immigration, they don\u2019t think of a person anymore.

But perhaps no community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/springfield-ohio-republicans-haitian-immigrants-lies\">has been more affected</a> by Trump\u2019s latest campaign to demonize immigrants than Springfield, Ohio. From the presidential debate stage, he repeated a debunked conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating their neighbors\u2019 pets.

Vance, the state\u2019s senator, said he would not stop referring to the Haitian immigrants as \u201cillegal aliens\u201d even though most of them are in the country lawfully, having escaped political turmoil and repression.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey have no values to unite Americans, no policies to move the nation forward,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, the chief executive of the Cap Action Fund, the political arm of the liberal thinktank the Center for American Progress, who is Haitian-American. \u201cSo instead they rely on the oldest play in the book \u2013 the play that authoritarians always summon, which is hatred, fear, division and terrorism.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fear was central to Trump\u2019s first term. Advocates say even just the threat can lead to broad \u201cchilling effects\u201d. After his election in 2016, households with undocumented family members began to carefully plan routine outings, said Wendy Cervantes, the director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy (Clasp). A person with legal status would grocery shop for the entire family. Undocumented parents agonized over whether to take their children to a doctor\u2019s appointment. Some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/us/politics/trump-immigration-hunger.html\">immigrants disenrolled from public benefits</a> they or their US-citizen children were eligible for, wary it could lead to their removal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI saw families putting signs up on the front door at the kids\u2019 eye-level saying: \u2018Don\u2019t open the door,\u2019\u201d Cervantes recalled. \u201cThe climate of fear creates toxic stress, which is harmful for the entire family and in particular children.\u201d</p> \n<p>During Trump\u2019s term, his immigration policies were broadly unpalatable.

She added: \u201cIt\u2019s a warning that really all Americans should take seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Kamala Harris seeks the presidency, she has attempted to project toughness on the southern border while making the case that a second Trump term would inflict even more harm on immigrant communities.</p> \n<p>At a Venezuelan restaurant in Doral, Florida, earlier this month, the Harris campaign held an event with children who had been separated from their parents under a Trump-era deterrence policy that came to define what many advocates said was the cruelty at the heart of his hardline agenda.

As part of a contingency planning effort, groups such as the ACLU are already <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/trump-on-immigration#specific-responses\">contemplating legal action</a> against key pieces of his immigration agenda.

      "bodyText": "Every day, Nayeli arrives for work at a meat-processing plant in rural Tennessee \u2013 the same place where, on the morning of 5 April 2018, federal agents swept in, helicopters buzzing above, and took her and nearly 100 other workers into custody, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s then escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. They were rounded up and put on buses without the opportunity to explain who they were or how long they had worked there, she said. Many were sent to out-of-state detention centers. Nayeli was among those released that evening, allowed to return home to her son, who was nine at the time. All faced deportation. Last year, the immigrant workers won a rare settlement in a class-action lawsuit against the US government and federal agents, who they accused of racial profiling and excessive use of force. After a year without work, Nayeli returned to her job at the plant, Southeastern Provision, located in the small, lakeside town of Bean Station. She says she is moving forward with her life in Tennessee, where she now helps organize her community as part of a local immigrant rights coalition. But that day in April still haunts her. She fears it could happen again, to her and other immigrants if Donald Trump were to return to power. \u201cI am afraid that he may win, because I have heard that he wants deportations,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very scared of this.\u201d Raids and mass deportations lie at the heart of the former president\u2019s second-term vision \u2013 a web of policies so vast that critics say their collective implementation would challenge the very ideal of the United States as a nation of immigrants. Should he win in November, the Republican nominee has vowed not only to restore many of his most controversial immigration policies, but to go even further. While a number of his first-term plans were stymied by the courts and Congress, immigration rights leaders believe a second Trump administration would likely be more sophisticated and strategic. \u201cIt is different this time. There\u2019s a plan. There is a sense of urgency that they\u2019ve created around this issue,\u201d said Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America\u2019s Voice. \u201cAnd they know how to use the levers of government in a way they didn\u2019t in 2016.\u201d Trump would also be operating in a changed political landscape. Since leaving office, the political center of gravity has shifted rightward, amid a post-pandemic rise in global migration that saw a record number of people arriving at the southern border and claiming asylum. Americans have become less tolerant of illegal immigration while a growing minority is increasingly concerned about its impact on the country\u2019s economy and national identity. Though border crossings have plummeted this year following the president\u2019s asylum clampdown, a sense of disorder persists. Voters continue to broadly disapprove of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s handling of the situation. Trump and his team are confident immigration remains a potent political issue for voters \u2013 and one that he has long played to his advantage. When Trump first descended a golden escalator in 2015, he pledged to construct a \u201cgreat wall\u201d along the south-west border with Mexico to keep out immigrants he disparaged as \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers. Now, in the final weeks of his third presidential race, Trump has again escalated his threats against immigrants, but this time he is turning his vitriol inward toward those already here. \u201cThe United States is now an occupied country,\u201d Trump claimed recently at a rally in Atlanta. \u201cBut on November 5, 2024, that will be liberation day in America.\u201d \u2018Not just the bad people\u2019 Trump has vowed to stage the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d. The former president repeats the pledge so frequently, it has become a campaign rallying cry. At the Republican national convention in Milwaukee this summer, his supporters waved signs that read \u201cMass deportations now!\u201d and chanted: \u201cSend them back.\u201d Trump has offered few concrete details about his plans, but in public remarks and interviews, he and his allies, including Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump\u2019s harsh immigration agenda and an influential adviser, have sketched out an expansive vision that dovetails with the plans laid out in Project 2025, a 900-plus page presidential transition blueprint led by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. The strategy, as Trump has described it, may involve the extraordinary use of US troops for immigration enforcement and border security and the application of 18th-century wartime powers. Trump has likened his mass deportation plan to the campaign carried out under President Dwight D Eisenhower in 1954. Known by the ethnic slur \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d, hundreds of thousands of people with Mexican ancestry, including some US citizens, were rounded up and deported. Trump\u2019s ambition is vastly more draconian, immigration advocates say. As he has sought to return to the White House, Trump has pledged to expel \u201cmaybe as many as 20 million\u201d people from the US, though he often fails to distinguish between those who are in the country unlawfully and those who have legal residency. There were 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US as of 2022, the vast majority of whom had been in the country for more than a decade. It is estimated that more than 2 million new arrivals encountered at the southern border since Biden took office remain in the country. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants granted permission to temporarily live and work in the US for humanitarian reasons are also vulnerable and could see their status revoked. \u201cThe totality of it is to be so cruel and to make life so hard for immigrants today that they are left with two options: stay in the United States and be subject to presidential demagoguery \u2026 or leave their lives here, no matter how long they\u2019ve been here, and go someplace else,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy group. To speed up the process, Trump has said he could invoke the archaic Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows for summary deportation of non-citizens from a foreign country with which the US is at war. In his rationale, he would use it \u201cto target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil\u201d, though it remains an open legal question as to whether the supreme court would allow a president to apply the law in this manner. His plans also include the construction of enormous detention camps that Miller, who is expected to serve in a second Trump White House, has declared would be \u201cgreater than any national infrastructure project we\u2019ve done to date\u201d. \u201cI want everybody to understand this is going to happen,\u201d Miller told rightwing activist Charlie Kirk on his podcast last year. \u201cIf President Trump is back in the Oval Office in January, this is going to commence immediately.\u201d Beyond a deportation operation, Trump has vowed to \u201cterminate\u201d every one of Biden\u2019s \u201copen-borders\u201d policies. He says he would reinstate a policy requiring people seeking asylum in the US to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed and would again invoke the emergency health authority, known as Title 42, that allows US officials to turn away asylum seekers at the border. His platform calls for reinstating a version of his controversial ban on travel from several primarily Muslim countries, which Biden called \u201ca stain on our national conscience\u201d and ended on his first day in office. Allies have circulated legal theories to support ending birthright citizenship for the US-born children of undocumented immigrants, a proposal most scholars believe to be unconstitutional. Trump has also stated that he would impose ideological screenings to keep \u201cChristian-hating communists, Marxists and socialists out of America\u201d. The visas of foreign students who participated in anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian protests could be rescinded. Courts have held that presidents have wide latitude to act on immigration. An emboldened Trump, with a deadlocked Congress, could dramatically reshape the immigration system, especially by restricting legal pathways. \u201cThe president\u2019s authority there is far more powerful because it is not as much a question of resources as it is a question of policy,\u201d said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, a non-profit advocacy group. In a statement, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump spokesperson, blamed the Biden-Harris administration for creating an \u201cunprecedented immigration, humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border\u201d. \u201cPresident Trump will restore his effective immigration policies, implement brand-new crackdowns that will send shockwaves to all the world\u2019s criminal smugglers, and marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers and human traffickers in American history,\u201d she said. Trump recently previewed aspects of his sprawling agenda at a rally held in Aurora, Colorado \u2013 hardly a presidential battleground but a convenient backdrop to stoke fears of suburban America under siege. Aurora residents and its Republican mayor forcefully rejected Trump\u2019s portrayal of the city as a \u201cwar zone\u201d overrun by Venezuelan gang members, but it had no effect. Flanked by mugshots on stage, Trump announced \u201cOperation Aurora\u201d. The crowd roared. A second Trump administration would unleash \u201celite squads\u201d of federal law enforcement officers to \u201chunt down, arrest and deport every last illegal alien gang member until there is not a single one left in this country\u201d. He also called for the death penalty for \u201cany migrant\u201d who kills an American. But the dragnet would be turned on anyone in the country unlawfully. JD Vance, his running mate, has suggested a \u201csequential approach\u201d beginning with people who have committed crimes, before expanding to all undocumented immigrants, and even those with legal but temporary status designated for people fleeing war, violence and other crises in their home countries. At a campaign stop in Arizona this month, Vance deflected a question about whether a future administration would deport Dreamers \u2013 young adults who arrived in the US as children, hundreds of thousands of whom are currently shielded from deportation by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program that Trump attempted to terminate during his first term. \u201cWe also have to deport people, not just the bad people who came into our country, but people who violated the law coming into this country,\u201d Vance told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be willing to deport them.\u201d Logistical and economic challenges Analysts say such an operation would face enormous logistical, legal and bureaucratic challenges, making it virtually impossible to achieve in the span of a four-year presidential term. \u201cAny president who dreams of one grand operation to round up 11 million people is probably fooling themselves,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick said. Carrying out 1m deportations per year, as Vance has suggested, could cost $967.9bn over a decade, according to an analysis by the American Immigration Council published this month. Congress would have to provide a major infusion of resources, to hire tens of thousands of new government employees and law enforcement officers and greatly expand the capacity of detention facilities and immigration courts, Reichlin-Melnick said. Assuming a Republican-controlled Congress was willing to allocate the funds, the new cases would land in an already-overwhelmed immigration court system: there is currently a backlog of nearly 3.7m unresolved cases, according to Trac, a research group at Syracuse University. Sudden, large-scale deportations would fracture families \u2013 both citizens and noncitizens \u2013 deeply rooted in their communities. As many as 4.4 million children who are US citizens live with a parent who is undocumented, according to the Pew Research Center. Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, recalls children returning home from school to empty homes after their parents had been arrested in the 2018 workplace raid. The following day, more than 500 students were reported absent from school, as fear and confusion spread. \u201cIt was like a bomb had gone off in this little community,\u201d she said. Teachers scrambled to comfort students, as advocates and faith leaders scrambled to set up a crisis response center. Sherman Luna recalled a sense of shock, even among residents whose families had not been directly affected. \u201cWhat we discovered in Morristown was that the local community, including many non-immigrant, native Tennesseans, were really appalled by what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember clearly one of the women who had lived in Tennessee her whole life said: \u2018You know, I voted for Trump, but I never imagined that this would be the impact of that.\u2019\u201d The economic toll could also be jarring. Researchers say mass deportations at the scale Trump is proposing risk exacerbating labor shortages and driving up inflation. The American Immigration Council report estimated that his mass deportation plan would shrink the country\u2019s gross domestic product by 4.2% to 6.8% \u2013 a level not seen since the Great Recession. Tax collections would also fall: in 2022, undocumented immigrants contributed nearly $100bn in federal, state and local taxes. About 8.3 million US workers were unauthorized immigrants as of 2022, according to Pew, roughly 5% of the overall workforce. They contribute to the economy by creating demand for goods and services such as cars, food and haircuts. In a study of the labor market impact of more than 450,000 deportations between 2008 and 2013, the researchers found that scaling up enforcement did not improve the overall employment share and wages of US-born workers. Rather, it reduced them, particularly for low-skilled Americans. \u201cThe idea that large-scale deportation is good for Americans has proven to be an illusion in the past and is an illusion now,\u201d Michael Ettlinger, a senior fellow at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire, told reporters. Undocumented people often fill low-wage jobs that native-born workers won\u2019t take, particularly in industries such as construction, agriculture, caregiving and service. Americans were especially grateful for their contributions during the pandemic, as millions of undocumented people worked frontline jobs, risking their health to provide essential services. During an hour-long Univision town hall with undecided Latino voters earlier this month, Trump fielded a question from Jorge Vel\u00e1zquez, a farmworker from California who said he had spent years picking strawberries and cutting broccoli in the fields. Many of those workers were undocumented, he said. He wanted to know Trump\u2019s plan to fill those jobs if those workers were deported, and what that might mean for food prices. After a stream of falsehoods about immigrants coming from countries that were \u201cemptying out\u201d jails and \u201cmental institutions\u201d \u2013 and no mention of his mass deportation plan \u2013 Trump stated that he supported legal immigration. \u201cWe want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country,\u201d Trump said. His campaign did not provide details on how he might do so. Fear-inducing rhetoric and \u2018chilling effects\u2019 In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s nakedly xenophobic rhetoric has grown ever more menacing and nativist. Impervious to facts, he has falsely blamed undocumented people for the country\u2019s woes, including inflation, urban crime and a dearth of federal funding for disaster response. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining the fabric of our country,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Walker, Michigan, presenting mass deportations as a cure-all. He has even pre-emptively identified non-citizens as the culprit if he doesn\u2019t win in November, amplifying baseless claims that noncitizens are voting en masse. It is part of broader rightwing conspiracy theory that Democrats are allowing immigrants to flow into the country unlawfully so that they will vote and steal the election from him. (Noncitizen voting is illegal and extremely rare.) Last month, Trump said removing undocumented immigrants from the country \u201cwill be a bloody story\u201d. He had previously echoed Adolf Hitler, when he said undocumented immigrants were \u201cpoisoning the blood of the country\u201d. In a recent interview, Trump accused those who have come to the US of having \u201cbad genes\u201d that predispose them to commit violent acts, distorting a federal statistic in service of a groundless claim that undocumented people have driven up crime rates. And at a rally in Arizona last week, Trump likened the US to a \u201cgarbage can for the world\u201d as he railed against a \u201cmigrant invasion\u201d of the country. \u201cWe have got to get those animals out of here fast,\u201d he said of immigrants who have committed crimes. (Many studies have found that immigrants \u2013 whether they have legal status or not \u2013 tend to be more law-abiding than US-born citizens.) \u201cTrump has managed to dehumanize us on such a scale that people forget \u2013 when they think about immigration, they don\u2019t think of a person anymore. They think of a wall,\u201d Michelle Ming, the political director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights group. In recent months, Trump has targeted local communities such as Aurora. But perhaps no community has been more affected by Trump\u2019s latest campaign to demonize immigrants than Springfield, Ohio. From the presidential debate stage, he repeated a debunked conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating their neighbors\u2019 pets. Almost immediately, threats began pouring in, leading to school closures and forced evacuations. The city canceled its annual celebration of cultural diversity due to safety concerns. Ohio\u2019s Republican governor pleaded with Trump to stop spewing the meritless claim, but the Republican ticket doubled down. Vance, the state\u2019s senator, said he would not stop referring to the Haitian immigrants as \u201cillegal aliens\u201d even though most of them are in the country lawfully, having escaped political turmoil and repression. \u201cThey have no values to unite Americans, no policies to move the nation forward,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, the chief executive of the Cap Action Fund, the political arm of the liberal thinktank the Center for American Progress, who is Haitian-American. \u201cSo instead they rely on the oldest play in the book \u2013 the play that authoritarians always summon, which is hatred, fear, division and terrorism.\u201d Fear was central to Trump\u2019s first term. Advocates say even just the threat can lead to broad \u201cchilling effects\u201d. After his election in 2016, households with undocumented family members began to carefully plan routine outings, said Wendy Cervantes, the director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy (Clasp). A person with legal status would grocery shop for the entire family. Undocumented parents agonized over whether to take their children to a doctor\u2019s appointment. Some immigrants disenrolled from public benefits they or their US-citizen children were eligible for, wary it could lead to their removal. \u201cI saw families putting signs up on the front door at the kids\u2019 eye-level saying: \u2018Don\u2019t open the door,\u2019\u201d Cervantes recalled. \u201cThe climate of fear creates toxic stress, which is harmful for the entire family and in particular children.\u201d During Trump\u2019s term, his immigration policies were broadly unpalatable. But advocates worry in a noisy election cycle with voters concerned about border security, the sheer intensity of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda has been dulled. Surveys have found increasing public support for mass deportation of undocumented people. A national Scripps News/Ipsos poll showed that 54% of respondents agreed either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d with Trump\u2019s plan, including a quarter of Democrats. But when provided with details about Trump\u2019s plans, especially as they relate to long-settled undocumented people, a survey by the University of Maryland\u2019s Program for Public Consultation (PPC) found that majorities of voters in six swing states and nationally strongly preferred offering them an earned path to citizenship to mass deportations. \u201cIf large-scale removals of undocumented immigrants, in fact, begins to happen, it will affect all Americans because, inconveniently, undocumented people do not live in an apartment building all by themselves,\u201d said Angela Kelley, a senior policy adviser with the American Immigration Lawyers Association. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s a warning that really all Americans should take seriously.\u201d As Kamala Harris seeks the presidency, she has attempted to project toughness on the southern border while making the case that a second Trump term would inflict even more harm on immigrant communities. At a Venezuelan restaurant in Doral, Florida, earlier this month, the Harris campaign held an event with children who had been separated from their parents under a Trump-era deterrence policy that came to define what many advocates said was the cruelty at the heart of his hardline agenda. (Trump has not ruled out reinstating the policy.) Billy was just nine years old in 2018 when US immigration officials separated him from his father in an experience he said \u201cno kids should go through\u201d. Now 16, Billy said he was speaking out in advance of the election because he didn\u2019t want this to happen again. \u201cWe still fear,\u201d he said, standing beside his father at the event. \u201cI go to therapists, but I still have the fear of Trump being re-elected, and that same thing happening to me or other kids.\u201d Should Trump return to power, immigrant advocates and leaders say they are better prepared and more organized. As part of a contingency planning effort, groups such as the ACLU are already contemplating legal action against key pieces of his immigration agenda. Activists say they have learned how to quickly harness public outrage. And Dreamers say they will continue to share their stories, refusing to be pushed back into the shadows. After the 2018 Trump-era raid in Tennessee, local and national immigration leaders joined forces to develop an emergency toolkit to help advocates respond to workplace raids. With the presidential election looming, those affected by Trump\u2019s policies hope Americans consider the stakes in November \u2013 not just for immigrants such as Nayeli, who has built a life in the rolling hills of east Tennessee \u2013 but for their communities and for the entire country. \u201cThe community continues to organize and tries to raise awareness about their rights,\u201d Nayeli said. \u201cBut I think at the end of the day, those who can vote should support the working class who want to stay in this country and who only need opportunities that an administration could bring about.\u201d",

The boots were hung up long ago and he has swapped the famous red shirt for a tunic and long coat but it is like the old days as the Old Trafford fans elongate his first name. \u201cRuuuuuuuud\u201d was the chant when he left the tunnel to take charge of his first match, leading United to a much-needed 5-2 Carabao Cup victory over Leicester. United laid down a marker but with Chelsea\u2019s visit on Sunday and a first Europa League win of the season required against Paok four days later, the Dutchman knows this is not a busman\u2019s holiday, even for someone who has maintained his hero status despite an acrimonious exit in 2006. \u201cI want to help, I want to do everything I can in my abilities, as many others do, to fight for this club,\u201d said Van Nistelrooy, who returned in July as Erik ten Hag\u2019s assistant. \u201cThe club is in a difficult situation and it is not where we all want it to be. The challenge is there. \u201cEveryone is looking at Man United and the situation it is in but it is up to us as people on the ground to do the utmost, supported by fans. It is a process and it is something to work for and do everything for.\u201d With R\u00faben Amorim waiting to join from Sporting in November\u2019s international break, the caretaker manager knows his fate and timeframe, alleviating pressure.

The council, which represents more than 1,400 private schools in the UK and abroad, reached its decision after a board meeting held on Thursday. Human rights barrister David Pannick KC will lead the challenge, which will be brought on behalf of parents. It comes after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed in the budget that 20% VAT would be applied to private schools from January, with the government estimating it could raise \u00a3460m next year, potentially rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30. Julie Robinson, the chief executive of ISC, said: \u201cThis is a decision that has not been taken lightly and has been under consideration for many months. \u201cAt all points throughout this debate, our focus has been on the children in our schools who would be negatively impacted by this policy. \u201cThis focus remains and we will be defending the rights of families who have chosen independent education but who may no longer be able to do so as a direct result of an unprecedented education tax.\u201d The government predicts that private school fees could rise by an average of 10% due to the introduction of VAT. It projects that about 35,000 pupils will transfer to state schools over time, as well as an additional 2,000 students leaving private institutions, including international pupils. European diplomats have called for the international institutions to retain the exemption. The German and French ambassadors to the UK, Miguel Berger and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Duch\u00eane, said international schools were distinct from British private schools because the option of transferring to the British state sector was not always realistic for their pupils. \u201cFor expats coming here for two, three or four years wanting their children to go back to the national system, their only option is to go to these schools,\u201d Berger said. He told the Times: \u201cWe would really like to see the British government recognise the importance of these schools \u2013 not only for our political and cultural relations but also for the people this will affect.\u201d Meanwhile, a total of 37,000 pupils leaving or never entering the sector equates to about 6% of the current private school population, the government said. On Wednesday, the government said it would increase the funding allocated to the continuity of education allowance (CEA), which supports mobile military and diplomatic families with boarding school fees for their children, before the imposition of VAT on private schools next year. It came after warnings from staff they could quit the armed forces if they were not given help before the VAT changes. But the ISC remains concerned about the impact of the VAT policy on small faith schools, specialist arts and music provision and on thousands of children with special educational needs and disabilities in private schools.

      "bodyText": "An EU citizen caught up in a Home Office backlog of applications for post-Brexit residency status is to be deported by Border Force officials in Scotland. Costa Koushiappis, 39, who is Greek Cypriot, has been told to show up at Edinburgh airport at 7am on Friday to be forcibly put on a flight to Amsterdam just weeks after he received an email from the Home Office to say it could take a further 24 months to process his application for status. The case raises questions about whether the new Labour government has addressed the Home Office\u2019s hostile environment policy, introduced by Theresa May and designed to reduce immigration. Koushiappis\u2019s original application for pre-settled status given to those in the country for less than five years before Brexit was rejected but he immediately requested an administrative review. He was given an official certificate of application by the Home Office, a document that is designed to prove to employers, landlords and the NHS that the applicant has the right to work, reside and live in the country while a decision is pending. He was detained for six hours in Edinburgh on Monday night after flying in from Amsterdam after a short trip, his fingerprints were taken and he said he was told by border officials there were not sufficient grounds to be in the country. He had shown them the certificate of application and explained that he was working and living in the country for three years and was also living in the country before the Covid pandemic in 2020. \u201cThey said I didn\u2019t have enough or convincing information about my situation.

He has been helping him deal with Border Force and was on the call Koushiappis made to the Home Office earlier this week to try to resolve the issue. He said that the Home Office had given him two new share codes \u2013 the digital codes given to prove status to employers and the authorities \u2013 both of which confirmed his rights to live and work in the UK. He wrote to Border Force sharing the codes but was told that it was not good enough. \u201cAny EU/EEA national seeking permission to enter as a resident must hold valid EUSS (not pending) or a relevant entry clearance in the category for which they are seeking permission,\u201d an officer said in an email seen by the Guardian. Koushiappis\u2019s case is one of a number of similar cases in which EU citizens have been threatened with removal at the border when they show a certificate of application. In January, a Spanish woman was removed from the UK after she returned from a Christmas holiday and told she was \u201cwasting her time\u201d if she thought the Home Office documentation was sufficient. Last month a Polish man living in the UK since his childhood was given an 11th-hour reprieve after a similar incident. The Home Office has been contacted for comment.",

      "body": "<p>Rachel Reeves\u2019s first budget emphasised raising taxes to help the NHS, as the health service tries to cope with huge waiting lists and an ageing population. Funding the NHS was a top priority but people in other sectors \u2013 from universities to social care \u2013 feel the budget was a missed opportunity to tackle impending crises or introduce desperately needed reforms in their areas.</p> <h2>Social care</h2> <p>Experts have long warned that it will be difficult to fix the NHS without addressing the crisis in social care, where councils in England and Wales are struggling with meagre budgets and staff shortages. Local authorities got a \u00a3600m injection of funding for social care, which the Local Government Association said would would help \u201cmeet some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the significant pressures in adult and children\u2019s social care and homelessness support\u201d.</p> <p>But there was nothing from the government on any wider reform of the system, which is likely to be needed in the longer term. The Health Foundation thinktank said: \u201cWhile we welcome the additional \u00a3600m for social care and the reforms to carers allowance, the continued silence on wider social care reform is disappointing.\u201d </p> <p>The sector will also be hit hard by the government\u2019s rise in employer national insurance contributions, with the Liberal Democrats calling for social care to be exempted from the increase.</p> <h2>Child poverty</h2> <p>One of the biggest asks from Labour MPs since taking office has been overturning the UK-wide two-child benefit limit, which contributes to child poverty. Reeves made no mention of any ambition to scrap it in her budget speech, despite privately wanting to make the change.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves\u2019s first budget emphasised raising taxes to help the NHS, as the health service tries to cope with huge waiting lists and an ageing population. Funding the NHS was a top priority but people in other sectors \u2013 from universities to social care \u2013 feel the budget was a missed opportunity to tackle impending crises or introduce desperately needed reforms in their areas. Social care Experts have long warned that it will be difficult to fix the NHS without addressing the crisis in social care, where councils in England and Wales are struggling with meagre budgets and staff shortages. Local authorities got a \u00a3600m injection of funding for social care, which the Local Government Association said would would help \u201cmeet some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the significant pressures in adult and children\u2019s social care and homelessness support\u201d. But there was nothing from the government on any wider reform of the system, which is likely to be needed in the longer term. The Health Foundation thinktank said: \u201cWhile we welcome the additional \u00a3600m for social care and the reforms to carers allowance, the continued silence on wider social care reform is disappointing.\u201d The sector will also be hit hard by the government\u2019s rise in employer national insurance contributions, with the Liberal Democrats calling for social care to be exempted from the increase. Child poverty One of the biggest asks from Labour MPs since taking office has been overturning the UK-wide two-child benefit limit, which contributes to child poverty. Reeves made no mention of any ambition to scrap it in her budget speech, despite privately wanting to make the change. Campaigners would have liked to see a larger Gordon Brown-style focus on lifting children out of poverty. Her speech barely made any mention of child poverty, apart from in a brief paragraph on the impact of reducing the level of overpayments that can be taken from universal credit. In its response to the budget, the SNP called for the Labour government to take \u201cemergency action\u201d to tackle child poverty, with the Resolution Foundation thinktank warning that an additional 63,000 children will be hit by the two-child benefit cap by April.

      "body": "<p>The Conservative leadership contest that concludes this weekend has followed a familiar pattern. What is left of a moderate centre-right Tory tendency has failed to assert itself or even make a compelling argument.</p> <p>The One Nation caucus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/09/cock-up-rather-than-conspiracy-the-likely-cause-of-cleverlys-surprise-exit\">didn\u2019t even manage</a> to get a candidate in the final round, thus guaranteeing that the activist choice, whether it is Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick, will be from the radical right. This has been the story of Tory ideological evolution since David&nbsp;Cameron\u2019s decision to call a referendum on leaving the European Union. A gambit that was intended to silence Eurosceptic battle cries for a generation had the&nbsp;opposite effect, turning a fringe proposition into the central pillar of British foreign policy.</p> <p>Brexit is by far the biggest legacy from 14 years of Conservative government. And yet, perversely, it has not been celebrated, or even much discussed, in the leadership contest \u2013 or not in terms of economic and political fact. To the extent that \u201cEurope\u201d has featured in the debate, it is almost exclusively because Mr&nbsp;Jenrick has made quitting the European convention on human rights (ECHR) a central demand of his candidacy. Ms Badenoch is not opposed to that idea, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/17/badenoch-and-jenrick-spar-over-visions-for-future-of-tory-party-in-tv-debate\">avoids a firm commitment</a>.</p> <p>But the ECHR is not even part of the EU. The Tory obsession with it has two components. One is the claim \u2013 mistaken or dishonest \u2013 that human rights law is a significant reason why Britain has had high levels of net migration in recent years. The second is a fundamentalist view of national sovereignty that treats multilateral humanitarian treaties as instruments of foreign interference. This amounts to an argument that the UK should heed international law selectively and only if it suits the government of the day \u2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/09/uk-could-leave-european-convention-on-human-rights-to-stop-channel-migrant-boats\">ethos shared</a> by rogue regimes and dictators.</p> <p>Those arguments reflect a radicalisation of Brexit ideology well beyond the original, technical questions of EU membership.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leadership contest that concludes this weekend has followed a familiar pattern. What is left of a moderate centre-right Tory tendency has failed to assert itself or even make a compelling argument. The One Nation caucus didn\u2019t even manage to get a candidate in the final round, thus guaranteeing that the activist choice, whether it is Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick, will be from the radical right. This has been the story of Tory ideological evolution since David Cameron\u2019s decision to call a referendum on leaving the European Union. A gambit that was intended to silence Eurosceptic battle cries for a generation had the opposite effect, turning a fringe proposition into the central pillar of British foreign policy. Brexit is by far the biggest legacy from 14 years of Conservative government. And yet, perversely, it has not been celebrated, or even much discussed, in the leadership contest \u2013 or not in terms of economic and political fact. To the extent that \u201cEurope\u201d has featured in the debate, it is almost exclusively because Mr Jenrick has made quitting the European convention on human rights (ECHR) a central demand of his candidacy. Ms Badenoch is not opposed to that idea, but avoids a firm commitment. But the ECHR is not even part of the EU. The Tory obsession with it has two components. One is the claim \u2013 mistaken or dishonest \u2013 that human rights law is a significant reason why Britain has had high levels of net migration in recent years. The second is a fundamentalist view of national sovereignty that treats multilateral humanitarian treaties as instruments of foreign interference. This amounts to an argument that the UK should heed international law selectively and only if it suits the government of the day \u2013 an ethos shared by rogue regimes and dictators. Those arguments reflect a radicalisation of Brexit ideology well beyond the original, technical questions of EU membership. Once the declared goal of regulatory emancipation was achieved, the Eurosceptic movement that vilified Brussels as the centre of a bureaucratic conspiracy against British enterprise and border control mutated. It has evolved into a more wide-ranging species of illiberal nationalism. That brings the Conservatives ever closer in arguments and style to far-right parties across Europe, although the continental version targets the EU for capture and subversion from the inside rather than demanding release from its structures. Neither Mr Jenrick (who voted remain in 2016), nor Ms Badenoch (a leaver from the start) has anything practical to say about the economics of Brexit. Neither candidate makes a virtue of the trade and cooperation agreement that Boris Johnson signed. The leadership contest has avoided talking about the consequences of Mr Johnson\u2019s deal for the same reason that it was absent from the Tories\u2019 general election campaign. Anyone who understands the real-world impact knows that Brexit has been a disaster, and anyone who is determined to believe otherwise has learned to change the subject. Without any incentive to evaluate the economics of separation from Europe honestly, and having silenced internal voices that might have attempted such an audit, the Conservative party is locked into a cycle of radicalisation in the ideological spirit of Brexit. That path towards delusional nationalism and in flight from practical reality seems now unavoidable for the party, regardless of which candidate is named as leader.

Peter Lynch was jailed after being convicted of rioting outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Manvers, Rotherham. Lynch died at HMP Moorland in South Yorkshire on 19 October, Doncaster coroner\u2019s court was told on Thursday. Lynch was jailed for two years and eight months on 22 August after he was convicted of violent disorder. Sheffield crown court had heard how he was at the front of a mob that gathered outside the Holiday Inn Express on 4 August, shouting \u201cscum\u201d and \u201cchild killers\u201d at police.

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s first budget punishes the \u201cworking people\u201d they claim to support. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves promised to deliver real change to the electorate, after 14 years of Tory rule. This week, they have broken that promise. This budget is austerity by another name.</p> <p>While we welcome the government\u2019s decision to invest in school and hospital buildings, it is extremely disappointing that these investments have been undermined by a swathe of public sector cuts, cruel attacks on the worst off, and a dogmatic refusal to redistribute wealth and power. These are not \u201ctough choices\u201d for government ministers, but for ordinary people who are forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table.</p> <p>Labour is raising defence expenditure to 2.5% of GDP while telling us there is no money to lift 250,000 children out of poverty. This is a lie. There is plenty of money \u2013 it\u2019s just in the wrong hands. The richest 1% in the UK <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/richest-1-grab-nearly-twice-as-much-new-wealth-as-rest-of-the-world-put-together/\">hold more wealth than 70% of Britons</a>. By refusing to impose a wealth tax, this government has chosen to force vulnerable communities to pay the price for years of economic failure, instead of making the richest pay their fair share. Labour\u2019s first budget shows us whose side they\u2019re on.</p> <p>Years of austerity and privatisation have decimated our public services and pushed millions into poverty, disproportionately impacting women, people of colour and disabled people. Making millions of children, working, retired and disabled people poorer damages our entire economy and stretches our public services. An austerity economy is a false economy.</p> <p>We, along with nearly 100 progressive Independent and Green politicians across the country, are calling on the Labour government to:<strong> </strong>1) introduce wealth taxes; 2) abolish the two-child benefit cap and stop attacking welfare recipients; 3) reverse cuts to winter fuel; 4) restore the \u00a32 bus cap; and&nbsp;5)&nbsp;invest in a Green New Deal.</p> <p>We refuse to believe that child poverty, mass hunger and homelessness are inevitable in the sixth largest economy in the world. A progressive movement is growing up and down the country, demanding a real alternative to this race to the bottom between Labour and the Tories, which has seen the new government perpetuate decades of austerity and rampant corporate greed.</p> <p>The Tories\u2019 collapse allowed Labour to come to power with the lowest vote share ever won by any single-party majority government. Labour haemorrhaging votes to progressive independents and Greens in their heartlands should be a lesson to this government: you are wrong to believe that progressive voters have nowhere else to go. Our movement is growing every day \u2013 and you ignore the demand for a real alternative at your peril. <br><strong>Jeremy Corbyn MP</strong><strong> </strong><em>Independent</em><em>,</em> <strong>Carla Denyer&nbsp;MP</strong> <em>Green party</em> <em>co-leader</em><em>, </em><strong>Adrian Ramsay MP</strong><strong> </strong><em>Green party co-leader</em><em>, </em><strong>Sian Berry MP</strong><strong> </strong><em>Green party</em>, <strong>Ben Lake MP</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Plaid Cymru</em><em>,</em> <strong>Ann Davies MP</strong><em> Plaid Cymru</em><em>, </em><strong>Liz Saville Roberts MP</strong><em> Plaid Cymru</em><em>, </em><strong>Llinos Medi MP</strong><em> Plaid Cymru</em><em>,</em> <strong>Zack Polanski</strong><strong> </strong><em>Green party deputy leader and London assembly member</em> , <strong>Leanne&nbsp;Mohamad</strong><strong> </strong><em>Independent candidate for Ilford North</em><em>, </em><strong>Jamie Driscoll</strong><strong> </strong><em>Former North of Tyne mayor</em>, <strong>Andrew&nbsp;Feinstein</strong><strong> </strong><em>Former ANC MP</em> <em>and Independent candidate for Holborn and St Pancras</em><em>, </em><strong>Leanne Wood</strong> <em>Former leader, Plaid Cymru</em><em>, </em><strong>Beth Winter</strong><strong> </strong><em>Former Labour MP</em> <em>for Cynon Valley</em><em>, </em><strong>Hilary Schan</strong> <em>Chair, We Deserve Better</em> <em>and Independent councillor in Worthing</em><em>, </em><strong>Anthony Slaughter</strong> <em>Wales Green party</em> <em>leader</em></p> <p>\u2022 Along with many others who voted for Labour earlier this year, I&nbsp;hoped that the party\u2019s first budget statement would make amends for the faltering and error-strewn start it has made in its first few months in government. I hoped that this would be the defining moment when the country learned what this Labour government stands for, what it believes in, and whether it has the courage and ingenuity to generate the scale of economic and social change needed to reverse years of Conservative decline. On that count this budget has clearly failed.</p> <p>The Treasury impact statement that accompanied the budget, however, offers some mitigating reassurances. It demonstrates that the lowest-income households benefit the most from increased investment in health and education, and that the proposed changes in taxation mean the poorest households stand to gain the most and the wealthiest households will pay the most. </p> <p>Overall, the budget failed the postwar Clement Attlee government\u2019s seismic shift test, but if we imagine what would have been in a Tory budget, it does begin to feel just a tiny bit that the country finally has a Labour government in power.<br><strong>Peter Riddle</strong><br><em>Wirksworth, Derbyshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s first budget punishes the \u201cworking people\u201d they claim to support. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves promised to deliver real change to the electorate, after 14 years of Tory rule. This week, they have broken that promise. This budget is austerity by another name. While we welcome the government\u2019s decision to invest in school and hospital buildings, it is extremely disappointing that these investments have been undermined by a swathe of public sector cuts, cruel attacks on the worst off, and a dogmatic refusal to redistribute wealth and power. These are not \u201ctough choices\u201d for government ministers, but for ordinary people who are forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table. Labour is raising defence expenditure to 2.5% of GDP while telling us there is no money to lift 250,000 children out of poverty. This is a lie. There is plenty of money \u2013 it\u2019s just in the wrong hands. The richest 1% in the UK hold more wealth than 70% of Britons. By refusing to impose a wealth tax, this government has chosen to force vulnerable communities to pay the price for years of economic failure, instead of making the richest pay their fair share. Labour\u2019s first budget shows us whose side they\u2019re on. Years of austerity and privatisation have decimated our public services and pushed millions into poverty, disproportionately impacting women, people of colour and disabled people. Making millions of children, working, retired and disabled people poorer damages our entire economy and stretches our public services. An austerity economy is a false economy. We, along with nearly 100 progressive Independent and Green politicians across the country, are calling on the Labour government to: 1) introduce wealth taxes; 2) abolish the two-child benefit cap and stop attacking welfare recipients; 3) reverse cuts to winter fuel; 4) restore the \u00a32 bus cap; and 5) invest in a Green New Deal. We refuse to believe that child poverty, mass hunger and homelessness are inevitable in the sixth largest economy in the world. A progressive movement is growing up and down the country, demanding a real alternative to this race to the bottom between Labour and the Tories, which has seen the new government perpetuate decades of austerity and rampant corporate greed. The Tories\u2019 collapse allowed Labour to come to power with the lowest vote share ever won by any single-party majority government. Labour haemorrhaging votes to progressive independents and Greens in their heartlands should be a lesson to this government: you are wrong to believe that progressive voters have nowhere else to go. Our movement is growing every day \u2013 and you ignore the demand for a real alternative at your peril. Jeremy Corbyn MP Independent, Carla Denyer MP Green party co-leader, Adrian Ramsay MP Green party co-leader, Sian Berry MP Green party, Ben Lake MP Plaid Cymru, Ann Davies MP Plaid Cymru, Liz Saville Roberts MP Plaid Cymru, Llinos Medi MP Plaid Cymru, Zack Polanski Green party deputy leader and London assembly member , Leanne Mohamad Independent candidate for Ilford North, Jamie Driscoll Former North of Tyne mayor, Andrew Feinstein Former ANC MP and Independent candidate for Holborn and St Pancras, Leanne Wood Former leader, Plaid Cymru, Beth Winter Former Labour MP for Cynon Valley, Hilary Schan Chair, We Deserve Better and Independent councillor in Worthing, Anthony Slaughter Wales Green party leader \u2022 Along with many others who voted for Labour earlier this year, I hoped that the party\u2019s first budget statement would make amends for the faltering and error-strewn start it has made in its first few months in government. I hoped that this would be the defining moment when the country learned what this Labour government stands for, what it believes in, and whether it has the courage and ingenuity to generate the scale of economic and social change needed to reverse years of Conservative decline. On that count this budget has clearly failed. The Treasury impact statement that accompanied the budget, however, offers some mitigating reassurances. It demonstrates that the lowest-income households benefit the most from increased investment in health and education, and that the proposed changes in taxation mean the poorest households stand to gain the most and the wealthiest households will pay the most. Overall, the budget failed the postwar Clement Attlee government\u2019s seismic shift test, but if we imagine what would have been in a Tory budget, it does begin to feel just a tiny bit that the country finally has a Labour government in power.

He was also reprimanded by his state supreme court for criticizing a doctor who provided an abortion for 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio. The corporate donations, detailed in publicly available filings, were made to the Republican Attorneys General Association, or Raga, a \u201c527 committee\u201d \u2013 a tax-exempt political campaign group so-called in reference to the US tax code. It exists to funnel nationally donated funds into key state races. In 2024, Amazon, Doordash and CVS Health between them have donated $425,000 to Raga. And Raga has given $255,000 to Rokita, who has also participated in a suit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over accommodations for workers receiving abortions; signed amicus briefs in a US supreme court challenge to Food and Drug Administration approval of mifepristone, an abortion pill; and sought access to private health records, in order to prosecute women seeking abortions. Altria, AT&amp;T and Comcast are also among major public companies that publicly support reproductive rights while donating to Raga, which supports campaigns for attorney general across the US.

The finding reveals a critical period for healthy nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life as babies initially absorb nutrients from their mother and move on to formulas and infant foods. Scientists found that restricting sugar intake to levels in dietary guidelines in early life was linked to a 35% drop in rates of type 2 diabetes in middle age and a 20% fall in high blood pressure. A low-sugar diet also appeared to delay onset of the chronic diseases, with diabetes and high blood pressure arising four and two years later respectively in people who had little sugar at the start of life compared with those who consumed much more. Tadeja Gra\u010dner, at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, said: \u201cExposure to a relatively low-sugar environment in utero and early childhood significantly reduces the diabetes and hypertension risk decades later, as well as delays their onset.\u201d The researchers took advantage of a natural experiment in the UK when a decade of postwar sugar and sweets rationing ended in 1953.

The Arctic is home to diverse Alaska Native communities dependent on healthy lands and caribou herds, which oil development can harm. Yet industry and for-profit Alaska Native corporations also bring in oil-related jobs and revenue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/21/us-navy-to-apologize-for-razing-of-native-alaska-community-in-late-1800s\">US navy apologizes for razing of Native Alaska community in late 1800s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur research shows a taxpayer-funded effort to tip the scale of public opinion toward Arctic drilling,\u201d said Chris Marshall, spokesperson for <a href=\"http://accountable.us\">Accountable.US</a>, a non-partisan group that researched the VAI\u2019s funding using public records requests. Indigenous groups who oppose drilling criticized the funding.</p> <p>Next Tuesday\u2019s election is due to bring about one of two visions for Alaska\u2019s Arctic. One is Donald Trump\u2019s self-described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/donald-trump-climate-change-environment\">\u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d approach</a>, which late during his presidency opened the massive ConocoPhillips Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve and the first-ever oil leases in the Arctic national wildlife refuge, projects pushed by the VAI, Alaska\u2019s congressional delegation and others.</p> <p>In contrast, the Biden-Harris administration has pursued policies with more attempts to balance oil development, preservation and climate concerns. It added protections on millions of acres of National Petroleum Reserve lands, canceled Trump\u2019s Arctic refuge leases and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/14/biden-president-approved-alaska-willow-project\">approved a downsized but still sprawling</a> Willow project. It also invested historic funding in renewables in Alaska and nationally through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>    <p>The Biden moves, condemned by Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alaskan-native-americans-unleash-biden-admins-climate-agenda\">and the VAI</a>, more closely align with Alaska Native groups concerned about the climate crisis and Arctic environments. For his part, Dunleavy, an oil development supporter who heads a state where oil provides nearly 90% of state budgets, backs the Trump approach, <a href=\"https://gov.alaska.gov/governor-dunleavy-condemns-biden-bureau-of-land-managements-barrage-of-anti-alaska-actions-and-announcements/\">saying</a> Biden\u2019s moves deprive Alaskans of jobs.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor has an unusually close relationship with [the] Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat,\u201d said Marshall, adding that Dunleavy attended a VAI board meeting and in 2021 announced a <a href=\"https://gov.alaska.gov/governor-dunleavy-voice-to-advance-north-slope-region-issues/\">\u201cjoint effort\u201d</a> with the group, with purposes including ensuring development of North Slope natural resources. Dunleavy also co-wrote a Washington Examiner <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/2634269/congress-must-not-break-trust-with-alaska-and-its-native-people/\">opinion piece</a> with the VAI promoting Arctic drilling.</p> <p>Research from Accountable.US shows that in 2021 Dunleavy requested $1m in funding for the VAI. Alaska\u2019s legislature approved the request, which was later delivered as a five-year reimbursable state grant, also with purposes that include ensuring North Slope resource development.</p> <p>Emails obtained by record requests show communications between the VAI and the governor\u2019s office on ideas for statewide and national strategies to promote Arctic drilling. They include ideas about how to undermine arguments from other Indigenous groups, discrediting renewable energy and positioning VAI members to attend Biden administration meetings as it crafted its climate and Arctic policies.</p> <p>In one section of the communications in 2021 headlined \u201cIdeas for collaboration\u201d, a strategy of taking out a full-page advertisement and accusing Indigenous opponents of destroying the local economy is floated and described as how it would be \u201cone Indigenous group taking down another indigenous group\u201d.</p> <p>The VAI is a leading proponent of Arctic drilling <a href=\"https://voiceofthearcticinupiat.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Voice-Willow-Letter-FINAL.pdf\">and the Willow project</a>, generating op-eds, <a href=\"https://voiceofthearcticinupiat.org/news-events/\">press releases</a> and social media activity criticizing Biden conservation measures and countering other Indigenous groups opposed to new drilling. Major media sources regularly <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alaskan-native-americans-unleash-biden-admins-climate-agenda\">quote</a> the VAI president, Nagruk Harcharek, who claims to represent a<a href=\"https://ictnews.org/news/willow-has-alaska-natives-concerned-about-traditional-foods\"> \u201cmajority consensus\u201d</a> among I\u00f1upiaq organizations. The I\u00f1upiat are Alaska Native people whose homeland is in Arctic Alaska.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Harcharek, who was appointed as the VAI\u2019s president in late 2022, said the $1m funding \u201csolely supports\u201d its efforts to educate audiences about I\u00f1upiaq culture and the unique challenges faced by the region and the importance of a robust regional economy.</p> <p>He added: \u201c[The VAI\u2019s] \u2026 use of all \u2026 grant funds must be approved by the state of Alaska\u2019s department of commerce, community and economic development.\u201d</p> <p>In response to questions about disparaging the arguments of other Indigenous groups, Harcharek said the conversations took place under a previous organizational leadership and did not \u201cspeak for or reflect\u201d VAI\u2019s values. Given our organization\u2019s mission to convene regional stakeholders and build unity on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, it is not our place to speak or comment on other Indigenous groups.\u201d</p> <p>The governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>    <p>The VAI\u2019s <a href=\"https://voiceofthearcticinupiat.org/members/\">21 member</a> organizations include Alaska Native corporations, communities and tribal organizations. Aside from the state, its <a href=\"https://voiceofthearcticinupiat.org/about/\">main funders</a> are the North Slope Borough and the Alaska Native-owned Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Both entities depend on oil revenue \u2013 which the VAI told the Guardian financially supports the I\u00f1upiat to practise their subsistence traditions and steward subsistence resources \u2013 and aggressively push for more Arctic drilling.</p> <p>But others reject the idea of consensus. They include Nauri Simmonds, executive director of <a href=\"https://www.silainuat.org/#:~:text=happens%20to%20us.%20%E2%80%9D-,Our%20Mission,land%20and%20what%20it%20provides.\">Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic</a>. The group, which she calls a \u201c100% I\u00f1upiaq organization\u201d, opposes new drilling at Willow and the Arctic refuge. Instead, it seeks a \u201cjust transition\u201d from extraction to a more equitable economy that Simmonds said was healthier for people, the environment and the climate.</p> <p>As a youth, Simmonds lived in the Arctic communities of Utqiag\u0307vik and Nuiqsut, not far from Alaska oilfields. She recalls green smoke that resembled smog, word of <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02082018/alaska-north-slope-oil-drilling-health-fears-pollution-risk-native-village-nuiqsut/\">increased respiratory illnesses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/economy/article/repsol-suspends-drilling-operations/2012/02/26/\">leaks</a> containing chemicals, drilling mud and natural gas.</p> <p>In 2019, the Nuiqsut tribal government <a href=\"https://www.ktoo.org/2019/02/28/north-slope-village-tribal-government-sues-over-conocophillips-drilling-plans/\">unsuccessfully sued</a> to stop the Willow project, and the Nuiqsut-based Grandmothers Growing Goodness, a group dedicated to the preservation of I\u00f1upiat culture, remains critical of increased drilling.</p> <p>Simmonds also said drilling interfered with I\u00f1upiat subsistence needs. \u201cPeople have to work harder and go further to reach caribou,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Simmonds acknowledges there is support within Arctic communities for more oil development and the jobs and benefits it brings. But she said that oil giants like ConocoPhillips and its well-funded supporters drown out dissent. Simmonds said corporate interests deserved a say in the community but do not represent a consensus of \u201caverage people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Simmonds said of the state funding for the VAI. \u201cBut it is hurtful,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Voice discredits the opinions of other I\u00f1upiaq people.\u201d</p> <p>Enei Begaye, executive director of Native Movement, also opposes the new drilling projects. Native Movement is a statewide collective of more than 20 organizations working on social, environmental and climate issues through an Indigenous lens. It also seeks a transition away from extraction. Begaye points to Native communities investing in mariculture, sustainable tourism and other pursuits informed by Indigenous knowledge and science.</p> <p>\u201cWe can make a living without cannibalizing our lands,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Begaye also cites the arrival in Alaska of billions of dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. In the Arctic, <a href=\"https://alaskamagazine.com/authentic-alaska/alaska-2-0/\">the laws fund</a> broadband hookups, renewables, port and airport upgrades, and more that can build economic opportunity and resilience to the climate crisis. Governor Dunleavy and Alaska\u2019s bipartisan delegation also doggedly pursue funds from the two laws, while still arguing that new oil development is essential for providing funding for the same improvements.</p> <p>Peter Winsor, interim director of the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee, said that his group had specifically opposed Arctic refuge drilling since 1988. The committee represents Gwich\u2019in Nation villages in the US and Canada. \u201cThe Gwich\u2019in have never been reliant on any oil and gas development,\u201d said Winsor.</p> <p>Winsor said Arctic refuge oil development can compound climate crisis stressors already affecting polar bears, migratory waterfowl and the caribou central to Gwich\u2019in culture and nutrition. Stressors include increasing <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/our-research/featured-projects/arctic-rain-snow-study-project\">rain-on-snow events</a>, which form icy crust that prevent caribou from grazing.</p> <p>Winsor is also not surprised that state funding supports the VAI. But he added that oil companies, banks and insurance companies already shy away from Arctic refuge drilling due to economic trends, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/19/oil-alaska-arctic-global-heating-local-cooling\">thawing permafrost</a> and public pressure.</p>    <p>Winsor, who operates a small guiding company in the Arctic refuge, sees growing interest in an Arctic economy based on sustainable activities and non-extractive industries.</p> <p>Even as the VAI claims consensus, its emails to the governor\u2019s office show awareness of other views. In one email, the VAI describes spending $4.6m pushing for Arctic refuge drilling and countering arguments from Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic, Native Movement and the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee. The VAI reports doing \u201cextensive research\u201d on the groups and sending paid staff to their community meetings.</p> <p>As a 501(c)4 organization, the VAI can legally accept funding from the state and lobby on political issues.</p> <p>In an email, VAI president Harcharek said the group uses the state funding to \u201ceducate audiences in both Alaska and the Lower 48 about our unique I\u00f1upiaq culture and the many unique challenges faced by our region\u201d. Harcharek said the challenges include the right to \u201cself-determination\u201d. In public statements and <a href=\"https://voiceofthearcticinupiat.org/news-events/\">press releases</a>, Harcharek often <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/13/politics/willow-project-alaska-oil-biden-approval-climate/index.html\">cites</a> self-determination as central to the group\u2019s support for new Arctic oil development.</p> <p>He added that the VAI engages in education about I\u00f1upiat life and culture and hosts <a href=\"https://voiceofthearcticinupiat.org/resources/americas-northernmost-region/#:~:text=Life%20at%20the%20top%20of,over%2010%2C000%20North%20Slope%20residents.\">resources</a> on its website related to climate change adaptation, food security and other topics.</p> <p>When asked about VAI communication with Governor Dunleavy\u2019s office, Harcharek said that the group\u2019s \u201ccurrent leadership\u201d had had very little direct engagement with the governor. And regarding its claims of consensus, he said the VAI focuses on its 21 member organizations, who along with their communities and constituents \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d support the group\u2019s efforts to \u201cadvance I\u00f1upiaq self-determination,\u201d adding that its members include the city of Kaktovik, the only human settlement in the Arctic national wildlife refuge.</p> <p>Harcharek said that the VAI was active in discussions of other economic issues in the Arctic, including protecting subsistence activities. And while acknowledging that climate change poses \u201cvery real threats to the North Slope\u201d, he said it should not be an excuse to \u201cdeny our self-determination and right to shape our shared destiny in our ancestral homelands\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/\">Experts</a> say deep and rapid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/its-over-for-fossil-fuels-ipcc-spells-out-whats-needed-to-avert-climate-disaster\">cuts to fossil fuels </a>are needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not out to attack [the] Voice [of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat],\u201d said Simmonds. \u201cMy problem is that they project this consensus and act like it\u2019s objective. But they\u2019re corporation-funded and represent the members of the community who have gained the most from oil.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 November 2024 to include a response from Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat about past emails that discussed disparaging the arguments of other Indigenous groups. A line that said the VAI had not responded to questions about this has been removed. A comment from VAI on oil revenues supporting subsistence traditions and resource stewardship was added, along with a reference to the Kaktovik community being a member of the group.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The administration of Alaska\u2019s Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, awarded at least $1m in state funds to a group claiming to represent a consensus of Indigenous support for new Arctic oil drilling, new research shows. The group, called Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat (VAI), had just months earlier communicated with the governor\u2019s office on ways to counter other Alaska Native groups opposed to new drilling. In Alaska, Indigenous voices hold sway in the Arctic drilling debate, an issue the upcoming presidential election will help settle. The Arctic is home to diverse Alaska Native communities dependent on healthy lands and caribou herds, which oil development can harm. Yet industry and for-profit Alaska Native corporations also bring in oil-related jobs and revenue. \u201cOur research shows a taxpayer-funded effort to tip the scale of public opinion toward Arctic drilling,\u201d said Chris Marshall, spokesperson for Accountable.US, a non-partisan group that researched the VAI\u2019s funding using public records requests. Indigenous groups who oppose drilling criticized the funding. Next Tuesday\u2019s election is due to bring about one of two visions for Alaska\u2019s Arctic. One is Donald Trump\u2019s self-described \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d approach, which late during his presidency opened the massive ConocoPhillips Willow project in the National Petroleum Reserve and the first-ever oil leases in the Arctic national wildlife refuge, projects pushed by the VAI, Alaska\u2019s congressional delegation and others. In contrast, the Biden-Harris administration has pursued policies with more attempts to balance oil development, preservation and climate concerns. It added protections on millions of acres of National Petroleum Reserve lands, canceled Trump\u2019s Arctic refuge leases and approved a downsized but still sprawling Willow project. It also invested historic funding in renewables in Alaska and nationally through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. The Biden moves, condemned by Trump and the VAI, more closely align with Alaska Native groups concerned about the climate crisis and Arctic environments. For his part, Dunleavy, an oil development supporter who heads a state where oil provides nearly 90% of state budgets, backs the Trump approach, saying Biden\u2019s moves deprive Alaskans of jobs. \u201cThe governor has an unusually close relationship with [the] Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat,\u201d said Marshall, adding that Dunleavy attended a VAI board meeting and in 2021 announced a \u201cjoint effort\u201d with the group, with purposes including ensuring development of North Slope natural resources. Dunleavy also co-wrote a Washington Examiner opinion piece with the VAI promoting Arctic drilling. Research from Accountable.US shows that in 2021 Dunleavy requested $1m in funding for the VAI. Alaska\u2019s legislature approved the request, which was later delivered as a five-year reimbursable state grant, also with purposes that include ensuring North Slope resource development. Emails obtained by record requests show communications between the VAI and the governor\u2019s office on ideas for statewide and national strategies to promote Arctic drilling. They include ideas about how to undermine arguments from other Indigenous groups, discrediting renewable energy and positioning VAI members to attend Biden administration meetings as it crafted its climate and Arctic policies. In one section of the communications in 2021 headlined \u201cIdeas for collaboration\u201d, a strategy of taking out a full-page advertisement and accusing Indigenous opponents of destroying the local economy is floated and described as how it would be \u201cone Indigenous group taking down another indigenous group\u201d. The VAI is a leading proponent of Arctic drilling and the Willow project, generating op-eds, press releases and social media activity criticizing Biden conservation measures and countering other Indigenous groups opposed to new drilling. Major media sources regularly quote the VAI president, Nagruk Harcharek, who claims to represent a \u201cmajority consensus\u201d among I\u00f1upiaq organizations. The I\u00f1upiat are Alaska Native people whose homeland is in Arctic Alaska. In a statement to the Guardian, Harcharek, who was appointed as the VAI\u2019s president in late 2022, said the $1m funding \u201csolely supports\u201d its efforts to educate audiences about I\u00f1upiaq culture and the unique challenges faced by the region and the importance of a robust regional economy. He added: \u201c[The VAI\u2019s] \u2026 use of all \u2026 grant funds must be approved by the state of Alaska\u2019s department of commerce, community and economic development.\u201d In response to questions about disparaging the arguments of other Indigenous groups, Harcharek said the conversations took place under a previous organizational leadership and did not \u201cspeak for or reflect\u201d VAI\u2019s values. Given our organization\u2019s mission to convene regional stakeholders and build unity on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, it is not our place to speak or comment on other Indigenous groups.\u201d The governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment. The VAI\u2019s 21 member organizations include Alaska Native corporations, communities and tribal organizations. Aside from the state, its main funders are the North Slope Borough and the Alaska Native-owned Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Both entities depend on oil revenue \u2013 which the VAI told the Guardian financially supports the I\u00f1upiat to practise their subsistence traditions and steward subsistence resources \u2013 and aggressively push for more Arctic drilling. But others reject the idea of consensus. They include Nauri Simmonds, executive director of Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic. The group, which she calls a \u201c100% I\u00f1upiaq organization\u201d, opposes new drilling at Willow and the Arctic refuge. Instead, it seeks a \u201cjust transition\u201d from extraction to a more equitable economy that Simmonds said was healthier for people, the environment and the climate. As a youth, Simmonds lived in the Arctic communities of Utqiag\u0307vik and Nuiqsut, not far from Alaska oilfields. She recalls green smoke that resembled smog, word of increased respiratory illnesses and leaks containing chemicals, drilling mud and natural gas. In 2019, the Nuiqsut tribal government unsuccessfully sued to stop the Willow project, and the Nuiqsut-based Grandmothers Growing Goodness, a group dedicated to the preservation of I\u00f1upiat culture, remains critical of increased drilling. Simmonds also said drilling interfered with I\u00f1upiat subsistence needs. \u201cPeople have to work harder and go further to reach caribou,\u201d she said. Simmonds acknowledges there is support within Arctic communities for more oil development and the jobs and benefits it brings. But she said that oil giants like ConocoPhillips and its well-funded supporters drown out dissent. Simmonds said corporate interests deserved a say in the community but do not represent a consensus of \u201caverage people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Simmonds said of the state funding for the VAI. \u201cBut it is hurtful,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Voice discredits the opinions of other I\u00f1upiaq people.\u201d Enei Begaye, executive director of Native Movement, also opposes the new drilling projects. Native Movement is a statewide collective of more than 20 organizations working on social, environmental and climate issues through an Indigenous lens. It also seeks a transition away from extraction. Begaye points to Native communities investing in mariculture, sustainable tourism and other pursuits informed by Indigenous knowledge and science. \u201cWe can make a living without cannibalizing our lands,\u201d she said. Begaye also cites the arrival in Alaska of billions of dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. In the Arctic, the laws fund broadband hookups, renewables, port and airport upgrades, and more that can build economic opportunity and resilience to the climate crisis. Governor Dunleavy and Alaska\u2019s bipartisan delegation also doggedly pursue funds from the two laws, while still arguing that new oil development is essential for providing funding for the same improvements. Peter Winsor, interim director of the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee, said that his group had specifically opposed Arctic refuge drilling since 1988. The committee represents Gwich\u2019in Nation villages in the US and Canada. \u201cThe Gwich\u2019in have never been reliant on any oil and gas development,\u201d said Winsor. Winsor said Arctic refuge oil development can compound climate crisis stressors already affecting polar bears, migratory waterfowl and the caribou central to Gwich\u2019in culture and nutrition. Stressors include increasing rain-on-snow events, which form icy crust that prevent caribou from grazing. Winsor is also not surprised that state funding supports the VAI. But he added that oil companies, banks and insurance companies already shy away from Arctic refuge drilling due to economic trends, thawing permafrost and public pressure. Winsor, who operates a small guiding company in the Arctic refuge, sees growing interest in an Arctic economy based on sustainable activities and non-extractive industries. Even as the VAI claims consensus, its emails to the governor\u2019s office show awareness of other views. In one email, the VAI describes spending $4.6m pushing for Arctic refuge drilling and countering arguments from Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic, Native Movement and the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee. The VAI reports doing \u201cextensive research\u201d on the groups and sending paid staff to their community meetings. As a 501(c)4 organization, the VAI can legally accept funding from the state and lobby on political issues. In an email, VAI president Harcharek said the group uses the state funding to \u201ceducate audiences in both Alaska and the Lower 48 about our unique I\u00f1upiaq culture and the many unique challenges faced by our region\u201d. Harcharek said the challenges include the right to \u201cself-determination\u201d. In public statements and press releases, Harcharek often cites self-determination as central to the group\u2019s support for new Arctic oil development. He added that the VAI engages in education about I\u00f1upiat life and culture and hosts resources on its website related to climate change adaptation, food security and other topics. When asked about VAI communication with Governor Dunleavy\u2019s office, Harcharek said that the group\u2019s \u201ccurrent leadership\u201d had had very little direct engagement with the governor. And regarding its claims of consensus, he said the VAI focuses on its 21 member organizations, who along with their communities and constituents \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d support the group\u2019s efforts to \u201cadvance I\u00f1upiaq self-determination,\u201d adding that its members include the city of Kaktovik, the only human settlement in the Arctic national wildlife refuge. Harcharek said that the VAI was active in discussions of other economic issues in the Arctic, including protecting subsistence activities. And while acknowledging that climate change poses \u201cvery real threats to the North Slope\u201d, he said it should not be an excuse to \u201cdeny our self-determination and right to shape our shared destiny in our ancestral homelands\u201d. Experts say deep and rapid cuts to fossil fuels are needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cI\u2019m not out to attack [the] Voice [of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat],\u201d said Simmonds. \u201cMy problem is that they project this consensus and act like it\u2019s objective. But they\u2019re corporation-funded and represent the members of the community who have gained the most from oil.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 November 2024 to include a response from Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat about past emails that discussed disparaging the arguments of other Indigenous groups. A line that said the VAI had not responded to questions about this has been removed. A comment from VAI on oil revenues supporting subsistence traditions and resource stewardship was added, along with a reference to the Kaktovik community being a member of the group.",

      "bodyText": "Former Harrods staff who were sexually abused by Mohamed Al Fayed have called for a boycott of the luxury store as it was revealed that more than 400 victims of his predatory behaviour had come forward. Three victims of Fayed\u2019s abuse posed with tote bags with the Harrods logo crossed out during a press conference by the Justice for Harrods Survivors group. Lawyers for the group revealed they had been approached by 421 people, most of whom alleged they were sexually abused or harassed by Fayed when he was the owner of Harrods from 1985-2010. Bruce Drummond KC, at New Bailey Chambers, said: \u201cThat is industrial scale abuse \u2013 abuse that could have only been perpetrated with a system that enabled the abuse to happen. \u201cThe majority of those contacting us are from the UK but the claims against Harrods and Fayed are still coming in from all around the world: Canada, Asia, Australia, America and Europe.\u201d One of the victims, who wanted to be identified only as Lindsay, described Harrods as \u201ca store that enabled the rape and sexual abuse of so many young and innocent women \u2026 So we don\u2019t think that people should be shopping there. We think they should be going elsewhere.\u201d Jen, who was backing a boycott, said: \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying and it\u2019s incredibly sad \u2013 we thought there were only few of us that went through this, and we\u2019re realising it\u2019s hundreds and hundreds of women over a 25- to 30-year period.\u201d Lawyers for the survivors questioned the independence of Harrods\u2019 own investigation into Fayed\u2019s behaviour when he was the chair. The barrister Maria Mulla asked: \u201cWho from Harrods designed and is leading this ongoing internal review? Did anyone who was still within the business from the Al Fayed\u2019s time, recuse themselves from discussion over the design and execution of this review?\u201d She confirmed that four of Fayed\u2019s victims had withdrawn from a settlement scheme set up by Harrods, over concerns that it was being managed by a consultant who had been employed at the store when Fayed was chair. Asked how many \u201cenablers\u201d of Fayed\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct had been identified by the group, Mulla said: \u201cIt was a very large web. Some of them are still alive \u2013 it\u2019s not in our ability to name names or announce who those individuals are.\u201d The lawyers also confirmed the first letter of claim had been sent to the London department store. \u201cIt\u2019s the first of hundreds to come; it\u2019s going to snowball and snowball,\u201d Drummond said. Six of the accusers are Australian women. Drummond told Australian broadcaster ABC on Thursday that five were employed at Harrods and one worked for a supplier. All were in their 20s. \u201cIt was the most wonderful thing they had, quite understandably, working for this amazing store, working for this very powerful individual who was a billionaire \u2026 then a lot of them, after they had been subjected to this horrific ordeal, fled [back to Australia],\u201d he said. The Metropolitan police asked prosecutors to decide whether to charge the former Harrods and Fulham FC owner in relation to only two of 21 women who made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, between 2005 and 2023. Evidence was shown to the Crown Prosecution Service in 2009 and 2015 but it decided not to proceed with either because there was not \u201ca realistic prospect of conviction\u201d. Dean Armstrong KC said many of the victims were sceptical about the police investigations. He said: \u201cIn lots of cases there are trust issues, because a lot of our survivors in their hours of need went to the police and little or nothing was done.\u201d Jen said after helping Vanity Fair with an article about Fayed\u2019s abuse, she was contacted by John Mcnamara, a former Met detective. She said: \u201cI was contacted by John Mcnamara, who was then head of security from Mohamed, who asked me to think very carefully about my involvement in Vanity Fair and just to remind me that he knew where I lived and he knew where my parents lived, and wouldn\u2019t it be terrible if something would happen to either them or myself? It\u2019s that kind of terror that kept us all so quiet for so long.\u201d Fayed died in 2023 at the age of 94. Harrods referred to a previous statement by its managing director, Michael Ward, in which he acknowledged the store had failed its colleagues. He said if he had known about Fayed\u2019s criminality and abuse he would have acted immediately. He added: \u201cThis was a shameful period of the business\u2019s history, however the Harrods of today is unrecognisable to Harrods under his ownership.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The morning after the day and night before. Traditionally the time by which any budget that is going to unravel has started to do so. No wonder Rachel Reeves sounded relatively chipper on the morning media round. OK, her budget hadn\u2019t been declared the greatest ever by the Daily Telegraph, but then she was no Kwasi Kwarteng. And Keir Starmer was no Liz Truss.</p> <p>The haters were always going to hate; you could disagree with the politics but the numbers more or less appeared to add up. Well, as much as any chancellor\u2019s numbers ever do. Even the International Monetary Fund had given her the thumbs up. This for a chancellor was about as good as it gets. Everyone knows that all budgets are launched on a wing and a prayer. Graveyards of broken promises. Huge sums of money spent and raised on assumptions that would be laughed at by a bank manager if you tried them out on your own finances.</p> <p>Reeves\u2019s biggest hurdle of the morning was the obligatory 8.10am slot on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Nick Robinson began by observing that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/reeves-needs-faster-uk-growth-than-the-obr-predicts-for-her-budget-to-work\">Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting minimal growth</a>. Rachel had answered this one countless times before in previous interviews so she had her answer ready prepared.</p> <p>This was just her first budget and she wasn\u2019t responsible for the state of the public finances. Given time, she hoped she would outperform the forecasts. Robinson gave her the benefit of the doubt on this. Other listeners with longer memories who are used to being let down by politicians may have been wondering if things were not so bad now that 1.4% growth may even be wishful thinking.</p> <p>The tricky questions came thick and fast. Had she lied to the country when she had promised that spending would be paid for by growth rather than borrowing? When she had said that every policy would be fully funded and costed. That the only taxes to be going up were the ones in their manifesto.</p> <p>Here it might have been nice to have heard the truth. Politicians always talk about their desire to level with the country. To treat voters as grown ups. But then they always do the precise opposite. For the reality is that Reeves made those promises because she felt they were necessary to win the election. She didn\u2019t believe them at the time, neither did she expect voters to. They were all just part of the game.</p> <p>If Reeves had said that, it would have been the start of a proper conversation. But she is not that kind of person. Nor is any politician from any party. The charade of dishonesty must be sustained at all costs. As if no one in the country ever feels duped.</p> <p>So the fictions went on. She had had no idea just how bad the public finances were when she made those promises. Reader, she did. We all did. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) had been shouting about a \u00a320bn black hole for months.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t raised corporation tax. Yes, but she had raised national insurance. And no it wasn\u2019t a tax on working people even though she had said it was. The interview went on like this for about 15 minutes ending in a no-score draw. Robinson making no real headway and Reeves answering the questions she wished she had been asked. Rachel would have definitely settled for that at the start. She\u2019s getting a lot better at these gigs.</p> <p>Next it was the turn of Jeremy Hunt, making his swansong appearance as shadow chancellor. It was almost enough to make you feel sorry for him. He was never very good at being chancellor \u2013 he was only chosen because he looked vaguely plausible \u2013 and he\u2019s always exposed in interviews. His main aim was to absolve himself from claims be had misled the OBR. To be fair, he probably didn\u2019t mean to. He just didn\u2019t understand the numbers he was presented with. But mislead them he did.</p> <p>Jezza then tried to deliver his own version of the budget. The public finances were in a desperate state, he said \u2013 one day he will find out which chancellor had been in charge of them \u2013 but he had a brilliant solution. Rather than raising taxes like Labour he was going to just slash the welfare bill. There were too many people with disabilities claiming benefits. This was the non-austerity return to austerity plan. Disability and poverty were just a state of mind. I\u2019m going to miss him when he\u2019s gone. Though I doubt many others will. You don\u2019t often get to sketch that perfect storm of ineptitude.</p> <p>The last hurdle for Reeves was the IFS press conference. The near-enough definitive verdict from the only people who really understand the intricacies of a budget. And that includes the Treasury. The IFS has been doing its day-after-budget analyses for years now and they have become a must-watch for any politics and economics geek. They used to be live events but are now done online. Presumably to make it easier for chancellors to save their blushes and tune in anonymously. It\u2019s the only way Rachel Reeves ever gets to find out what she\u2019s actually done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-more-money-fix-public-services-ifs-autumn-budget\">Rachel Reeves may need extra \u00a39bn to avoid cuts to public services, says IFS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As ever it was the IFS\u2019s director, Paul Johnson, who introduced proceedings.

Giving evidence for the first time at an inquest into the deaths of 62 of his former patients, Paterson said he considered a cleavage-sparing mastectomy to be an \u201cadaptation of a standard operation\u201d that did not require separate consent. After previously refusing to give evidence in the hearings, Paterson spoke on Thursday at the inquest of Elaine Turbill, who died, aged 63, in 2017 when her cancer returned after undergoing a mastectomy carried out by Paterson in 2005. The inquest heard that at a recall clinic in 2010, it was recorded that 20% of her breast tissue had been left behind after the operation. Speaking via video link from prison, where he is serving a 20-year sentence for multiple counts of wounding linked to unnecessary operations he carried out on patients, Paterson said he did not explain the procedure in detail to his patients. \u201cMost ladies know what a mastectomy is. I never went into great detail, it scares them and I don\u2019t think they hear it, they just hear the word cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cThis lady [Turbill] would have been taken into a separate room with a breast care nurse and would have discussed things in more detail.\u201d He later said: \u201cIt was frightening and [patients] didn\u2019t need to or want to know.\u201d A cleavage-sparing mastectomy involved leaving tissue behind for cosmetic reasons. National guidelines state all tissue should be removed to reduce the risk of cancer returning. Paterson said he did not know how many patients he had performed this procedure on, adding that he did not think it was a \u201cnew or special operation\u201d and that he did not \u201ccoin the term\u201d used to describe it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a different operation, it was simply an adaptation. I never kept any figures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a safe oncology procedure and as soon as someone suggested it might not be, I stopped doing it.\u201d He insisted there was no further risk to patients than during a standard mastectomy, where there was always a risk of some tissue being left behind. Paterson said he did not tell his colleagues he was performing the cleavage-sparing procedure as he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was anything other than a better cosmetic result\u201d. Earlier in the week, Balapathiran Balasubramanian, a surgeon who carried out some of the recall checks on Paterson\u2019s patients, said Turbill decided against further surgery to remove the left-behind breast tissue and instead opted for regular checkups. He told the court she did not mind her follow-ups being carried out by Paterson but he was suspended before she could see him again, so she saw other surgeons instead. A CT scan in December 2013 found Turbill\u2019s cancer was metastatic and had spread to her bones, brain and liver. In a statement, Turbill\u2019s daughter Gemma said her mother was a \u201ckind, loving and friendly\u201d person whose smile \u201ccould light up the room\u201d. \u201cIt was very hard to see her deteriorate.

It\u2019s a tiny fraction of the changes to our borrowing forecasts over a five-year horizon.</p> <p>Small changes in interest rates, smaller than ones we even saw in terms of the changes in interest rates between the March budget and this budget, would be enough to eliminate that kind of headroom.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked again if that meant Reeves would have to come back for more tax revenue, Hughes replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are always risks to the outlook.

Unlike the coalition\u2019s corporate tax \u201croad map\u201d the one published yesterday is more of a parking space \u2013 an ambition not to take a big journey in any direction. That the chancellor decided to increase stamp duty, if only on second properties, is most disappointing of all. It again reduces transactions, increases again the bias in favour of owner occupation, and against renting, and at least part of the consequence will be to reduce the supply of rental housing and so increase rents \u2026</p> <p>If this government really wants to focus on growth, then part of the plan needs to be a much more coherent tax strategy than we saw yesterday. Let\u2019s hope for better next year.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said the Treasury should be more honest about what it was doing.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Also disappointing is some of the presentation \u2013 even after the \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d entered into during the election campaign. How the budget red book can include the sentence \u201cit [the government] is not increasing the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT\u201d is beyond me. The continued pretence that these changes will not affect working people risks further undermining trust.</p> </blockquote> <p>Johnson may have drafted this statement before Rachel Reeves\u2019s interview round this morning, where she did concede the national insurance rise would affect workers. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour-tax-rises-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-6723357f8f0821d89821d62e#block-6723357f8f0821d89821d62e\">8.02am</a>.)</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said the national insurance rise would raise much less than the \u00a325bn implied in the budget red book.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is also worth noting that, net, this increase will not actually get the Treasury anything like the \u00a325bn stated on the scorecard. As the OBR note, it will result in lower wages, reducing the amount raised from employer NI and reducing employee NI and income tax revenues. That takes the net revenue down to some \u00a316 billion. On top of that there will be an effective \u00a36bn of compensation for public sector employers.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said Reeves was right to prioritise investment.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Reeves] chose to increase borrowing in order to increase investment spending \u2013 or at least to stop it falling as a fraction of national income. Given that the growth benefits of this take some time to arrive, this is a courageous move and a welcome focus on the long term. This was the right thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said the the spending allocation for the NHS was not a lot higher than it was for other departments.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unusually the NHS is not scooping the pool. It is getting about the average spending increase. Equally unusually local government is doing rather well, as is the justice department, reflecting the severe pressures each is facing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said that Reeves was right to say the Tories left her with public spending plans that were not properly funded.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The increases in spending look big relative to the previous government\u2019s plans, but that is in large part because their plans were unrealistic. Despite the apparent scale of the increases, this is not going to feel like Christmas has come for the public realm. Ms Reeves may be overegging the \u00a322 billion black hole, but she is not wrong to stress that she got a hospital pass on the public finances.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said the Tory cuts to national insurance before the election were irresponsible.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rachel Reeves was faced with a genuinely difficult inheritance and the last government must take a lot of the responsibility.

It has been doing it again this morning. </p> <p>The IFS is not universally critical, it is more positive about some budgets than others, and overall it is more complimentary about what Rachel Reeves announced than it was about the efforts from some of her predecessors. But it is still finding fault, and in his opening presentation at the IFS press conference this morning <strong>Paul Johnson</strong>, the IFS director, said that Reeves\u2019s longterm spending plans were almost as unrealistically low as Jeremy Hunt\u2019s. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much the most striking aspect of the spending decisions is how incredibly front loaded the additional spending is. Day-to-day public service spending, after inflation and the additional cost to public sector employers of rising NI, is set to rise by 4.3% this year and 2.6% next year, but then by just 1.3% each year thereafter \u2026</p> <p>I am willing to bet a substantial sum that day-to-day public service spending will in fact increase more quickly than supposedly planned after next year. 1.3% a year overall would almost certainly mean real terms cuts for some departments. It would be odd to increase spending rapidly only to start cutting back again in subsequent years.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid this looks like the same silly games playing as we got used to with the last lot. Pencil in implausibly low spending increases for the future in order to make the fiscal arithmetic balance. It sounds like it was hard enough to get agreement from departmental ministers to relatively generous settlements in the short term. When it comes to settling with departments for the period after 2025-26 keeping within that 1.3% envelope will be extremely challenging. To put it mildly \u2026.</p> <p>[Reeves] is meeting her borrowing target only by repeating the same silly manoeuvres as her predecessors used to make it look as if the books will balance. Let\u2019s pretend we\u2019ll increase fuel duties next time, but not do it this year. Let\u2019s pretend that we\u2019ll really rein in spending in a couple of years after splurging this year. That\u2019s not going to happen. The spending plans will not survive contact with her cabinet colleagues.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the briefing soon.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T11:48:30.632Z\">at 11.48am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-672363e98f0821d89821d7c0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T11:05:33.716Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Firms with workers on low wages will face highest proportional rise in labour costs from national insurance hike, says IFS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019</strong> briefing on the budget is underway.</p> <p>One point it is making is that the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance will, proportionally, have the biggest impact on firms employing people on low wages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HelenMiller_IFS/status/1851940530340413746\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You can see that here - biggest increase in labour cost for low earners <a href=\"https://t.co/XawpiLLzFj\">pic.twitter.com/XawpiLLzFj</a></p>&mdash; Helen Miller (@HelenMiller_IFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenMiller_IFS/status/1851940530340413746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67235b318f086f851f56fd98\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T10:53:20.007Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reeves offers alternative explanation for how Tories left \u00a322bn black hole, after OBR does not endorse original calculation</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In July <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> published<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66ab7c420808eaf43b50dbc2/E03171937_-_Fixing_the_foundations_-_public_spending_audit_2024-24_-_Print_v2.pdf\"> a document</a> claiming there was a \u00a322bn black hole in the Tories\u2019 spending plans, which Labour inherited, for 2024-25. The figure was widely quoted, although when the Financial Times tried to use a freedom of information request to get details of how the Treasury arrived at the \u00a322bn figure, the Treasury <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f686444-7036-4efc-82c5-971b0f3929fa\">would not release the information.</a></p> <p>Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility published a report saying spending pressures were not fully disclosed by the last goverment. But it did not endorse the \u00a322bn figure, and it implied that, if there was a black hole, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-tax-rachel-reeves-labour?page=with:block-6722479e8f08bfbda34378a0#block-6722479e8f08bfbda34378a0\">it was more like \u00a39.5bn.</a></p> <p>This morning, in her interview on the Today programme, Reeves, rather ingeniously, suggested there was an alternative way of arguing that the Tories left a \u00a322bn black hole. She did not withdraw or disown the Treasury calculation released in July. But when the presenter, Nick Robinson, put it to her that she should have known during the election campaign that the Tory spending plans were unrealistic, because that is what all the experts were saying (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/31/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour-tax-rises-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-67233e538f0821f410faab24#block-67233e538f0821f410faab24\">8.27am</a>), she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think this is really important.

Times that by two to take us to the full year, that\u2019s \u00a322bn pounds more than the OBR forecast in March because the previous government withheld that information.</p> </blockquote> <p>Labour has got a history of redefining contested \u201cblack hole\u201d figures. In May Labour claimed that there was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3g51qlxezro\">a \u00a371bn annual black hole in Tory spending plans</a>. The figure was dismissed by most commentators as a wild exaggeration, not least because it assumed that the Tories would abolish national insurance in its entirety without replacing it with an alternative source of income (something that Jeremy Hunt had floated as a very long-term aspiration, but that was not widely seen as a realistic aim). Later, during the proper election campaign, Labour produced a more realistic assessment of the black hole in Tory plans, focusing on what the five-year figure would be, not the annual figure.

It explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Indeed, the outlook for living standards looks weaker than the OBR projected in March 2024, with real household disposable income (RHDI) per person set to increase slightly (up 1.5 per cent) between 2024 and 2025, compared to a projected increase of 1.7 per cent in the March 2024 forecast. Notably, the living standards outlook later in the forecast period has been revised down more significantly \u2026 In March, the OBR projected RHDI per person to grow by 1.3 per cent between 2027 and 2028 \u2013 but in its latest set of forecasts, the OBR projected RHDI per person to grow by just 0.4 per cent during this period (and then to grow by only 0.7 per cent between 2028 and 2029).</p> <p>Some might view any income growth as a cause for celebration, since the last parliament remains the worst since at least the 1950s for living standards improvements. As figure 30 [see below] shows, RHDI per person rose by an average of just 0.3 per cent a year during the 2019-2024 parliament. But the forecast for this parliament is not much better: RHDI is set to rise by 0.5 per cent a year across this parliament, equating to a total income gain of \u00a3700 per person between the 2024 and 2029 elections (in 2024-25 prices). This projected income growth is a far cry from the living standards increases that were experienced during the last Labour government, during which even the worst term for living standards (the 2005-2010 parliament) recorded 0.8 per cent annual growth. When we look across the entire period of the last Labour government (between 1997-2010), RHDI rose by a relatively strong 1.9 per cent on an annualised basis \u2013 equating to an overall income boost of \u00a35,400 per person \u2013 even though this period of government included the financial crisis.</p> <p>That said, this historically tepid projected real income growth over the course of the parliament needs to be seen in the broader context. Given its inheritance, the government presumably felt that increasing taxes to better fund day-to-day public services was the priority, even if that put downward pressure on incomes directly or, in the case of the employer NI rise, indirectly through the second-order earnings and employment effects. In this respect, the government has clearly gambled on the hope that the public will accept limited income growth over the parliament in exchange for improvements to public services.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the figure 30 chart.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T10:53:48.659Z\">at 10.53am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6723558c8f0821d89821d705\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T10:03:21.250Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In his interview on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> also confirmed that he will leave the shadow cabinet at the end of this week, when a new leader takes over.

Speaking on Sky News, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With an ageing population, with all the pressures of what [Russian president Vladimir] Putin is doing in Ukraine, how do you fund our public services without really damaging rises in taxation?</p> <p>We would have made difficult decisions on welfare reform, on the public sector, and productivity.</p> <p>If you cut the number of people claiming benefits to 2019 levels \u2013 in other words before the pandemic \u2013 that releases \u00a334bn a year.</p> <p>The government has chosen to do nothing on that and, as a result, the adult working-age benefit bill is going to be more than \u00a3100bn by this end of this period.</p> <p>We would have taken that harder path, because we know that the result of higher taxes is lower growth, and that is bad for ordinary families.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67234e548f0821f410faab7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T09:35:03.201Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the chancellor, insisted that the Scottish government was getting extra money to reimburse the public sector for the extra cost of the national insurance hike.</p> <p>She was asked about a comment from <strong>Shona Robison</strong>, the Scottish finance secretary, who said the employers\u2019 national insurance increase could cost the public sector an extra \u00a3500m in Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Reeves</strong> replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve given \u00a33.4bn in the settlement to Scotland, which takes into account all of those pressures and the challenge now for the SNP in Scotland is to use that money wisely to start reducing waiting times, because, you know, frankly, the performance of the NHS in Scotland under the SNP is worse than in any part of the United Kingdom, and that money now needs to be used to address the priorities of the Scottish people.</p> <p>Talking to Scottish MPs yesterday in parliament, this settlement was very welcome, the biggest settlement in the history of devolution.</p> <p>The Scottish government now need to deliver.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> An article by <strong>Full Fact</strong>, the factchecking organisation, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/nhs-performance-four-nations-comparison/\">published in July</a> points out that it is hard or even impossible to properly compare NHS performance in the four countries in the UK because \u201cthe four services have different targets and different ways of measuring performance\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T12:40:17.583Z\">at 12.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-672341a38f086f851f56fccd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T08:50:03.760Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reeves brushes aside IFS analysis saying this parliament set to be second worst for household incomes for 75 years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> is now being interview on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain.</p> <p>She is being interviewed by <strong>Ed Balls</strong>, the former Labour shadow chancellor who is now a TV presenter.

      "bodyText": "UK government borrowing costs have risen to their highest level this year as City investors bet Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget would lead the Bank of England to adopt a more cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Rachel Reeves could need \u00a39bn of further tax increases to avoid a fresh round of austerity for some struggling public services, despite her first budget setting out the largest rise in a generation, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. Keir Starmer has played down claims from the Office for Budget Responsibility that the budget will do little to boost growth, saying more pro-growth policies are coming. (See 2.19pm.) The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the measures announced by Rachel Reeves in her first budget, saying her \u00a340bn of tax rises would boost growth \u201csustainably\u201d. The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to exempt the social care sector from the increase in national insurance in Labour\u2019s budget. Ofcom has fined the rightwing broadcaster GB News \u00a3100,000 for \u201cbreaking due impartiality rules\u201d after an interview with the former prime minister Rishi Sunak earlier this year. Voting has closed in the Tory leadership contest, and on Saturday the winner \u2013 either Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick \u2013 will be announced. As PA Media reports, the two candidates have declared another \u00a3112,500 in campaign donations. Badenoch has now received a total of \u00a3422,500 in campaign donations, and Jenrick has received \u00a3480,000. For 14 years the Conservative party were in government. Now they\u2019re out of office, and a sign of how little power they have is the fact that they\u2019ve been reduced to organising petitions. Earlier this week they presented a petition to the Treasury calling for the winter fuel payment cut to be reversed, and now they are organising one saying farms should remain exempt from inheritance tax. Steve Barclay, the shadow environment secretary, said: Labours introduction of the family farm tax marks a shameful betrayal of British farmers everywhere. It will harm rural communities, risk our food security, and make it harder to pass farms to the next generation. Farmers toil, day and night, to put food on our tables, and foster our countryside - so I am proud to launch this petition, to fight for our farmers, and call on Labour to ditch this cruel tax. Perhaps Ed Balls will sign? (See 5.11pm.) Ed Balls, the former Labour shadow chancellor, has suggested Rachel Reeves will have to rethink the decision to impose inheritance tax on farms worth more than \u00a31m. Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, he said: This issue of inheritance tax on family farms, where the limit is \u00a31m before you pay inheritance tax, I think this is going to be one of those things which may become a growing issue in the coming weeks and months. It\u2019s one of those things where you just wonder, \u2018Has the Treasury really thought through all the hard cases\u2019. It\u2019s quite easy to have a low-income, hard-working farming family, which have had their farm for generations, where, if you actually add up the 100 acres of land and the house, is more than \u00a31m, and if the dad dies, have they got to sell the farm to pay the inheritance tax? To Rachel Reeves and her team that \u00a31m sounds like a big number. I wonder whether, actually, when you really dig into the cases, \u00a31m is a big number or small number for cash-poor, asset-rich farmers. Downing Street has refused to comment on the rise in gilt yields (government borrowing costs) this afternoon. At the afternoon lobby briefing, a spokesperson said it was \u201cgovernment policy not to comment on market fluctuations\u201d. The spokesperson also said the aim of the budget was to restore economic stability. Rupert Harrison, who was George Osborne\u2019s chief adviser when he was chancellor, claims the rise in UK borrowing costs this afternoon has already wiped out Rachel Reeves\u2019s budget headroom. (See 2.35pm and 3.48pm.) Market moves since the Budget will have already wiped out the headroom against the new fiscal rules. This is from Mohamed El-Erian, President of Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, and chief economic adviser at Allianz, on the rise in UK government borrowing costs. Another leg up in UK borrowing costs, with the yield on 10-year government bonds currently trading at 4.47% after peaking earlier above 4.50%. This move takes place in the context of an active debate, fueled in part by the OBR report, on whether yesterday\u2019s budget will result in higher growth. There is more comment on the significance of the increase on our business live blog. The Liberal Democrats could achieve more than the Conservatives in opposition by taking a less \u201ccombative\u201d approach and trying to be constructive where it is helpful, Ed Davey has argued. Speaking to journalists at a parliamentary press gallery lunch, Davey said the way his party chose to act might \u201csurprise people\u201d, contrasting this with the stances taken both by the Tories and the SNP, the latter of whom were supplanted as the third party by the Lib Dems in the general election. The SNP\u2019s use of \u201cpolitical game-playing\u201d often did not land well with voters, the Lib Dem MP argued, saying they often preferred a more mature and collegiate approach. For example Lib Dems are offering to work cross-party to reform the care system. This was also the case with the Conservatives, Davey said, contrasting Rishi Sunak\u2019s final performances in the Commons as opposition leader on Wednesday. He explained: Prime minister\u2019s questions was quite fun, but then we got to the budget response, and it was back to normal, and Rishi was really quite combative. I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t have had a go at the government, he had every right to do that. I just think the tone was the wrong tone to adopt, and I like to think that ours, being clear where we agree and disagree, is a better one. At the Downing Street lobby briefing earlier, the PM\u2019s spokesperson echoed what Keir Starmer said in his BBC interview in response to the OBR saying the budget won\u2019t do much for growth. (See 2.19pm.) The spokesperson said: This is not the limit of [the chancellor\u2019s] ambitions when it comes to growth. The OBR figures don\u2019t take into account a significant range of other reforms that the government\u2019s undertaking, whether it\u2019s planning reform, reforms of the skills system ... This is not the limit of our agenda on growth. Do we want to see higher growth figures to bring in the revenues to fund our public services? Yes, but yesterday was a start. And the value of sterling has been falling too, Ed Conway reports. Ed Conway, economics editor at Sky News, has posted a good thread on social media on the significance of the post-budget rise in government borrowing costs. (See 3.30pm.) How worried should we (and @RachelReevesMP) be about the slightly nervy reaction from financial markets towards her first Budget? Short answer: certainly a bit worried. But perhaps not for the reasons you might expect.. Worth saying at the outset: these markets are volatile. Trying to interpret movements in govt bonds is v tricky. They\u2019re moved by all sorts of factors - fiscal, monetary, economic and structural - from all over the world. So yesterday\u2019s Budget is only one of many factors here... Even so, there has been a marked rise in UK bond yields following the Budget which is greater than what we\u2019re seeing in other markets. This morning the UK 10 year bond yield hit the highest level in nearly a year. It\u2019s up 1.7% since yday - far more than US or German equivalents Now, perhaps the most important thing to say is: this is NOTHING like the reaction we saw following the Truss mini Budget. Gilts are NOT going up as quickly as they did around then. Even so, there has definitely been SOME reaction. The pound weakened a bit and gilt yields rose. This despite the fact that most of this Budget was pre-briefed long in advance. Investors are actively re-pricing UK debt. And that matters... The issue at present isn\u2019t the one @trussliz had to grapple with - a near financial crisis - but something else. The cost of debt servicing is going up. And if debt interest costs goes up it has a direct bearing on the govt\u2019s fiscal plans... Consider the following line from the OBR\u2019s report yday. If gilt yields go more than 1.3 percentage points above their projections then the govt will break its fiscal rules. Which implies having to change its plans. That would be... awkward Now consider this in chart form... \ud83d\udc40Right now gilt yields are pretty much halfway towards the danger zone\ud83d\udc47 Now... it\u2019s only day one after the Budget. Plenty could happen in the coming weeks and months. But upshot is @RachelReevesMP\u2018s room for manoeuvre is ALREADY diminishing because of market moves. Not good. The sell-off of UK government bonds has gathered pace, pushing up borrowing costs for the Treasury, Julia Kollewe reports. She says investors have become increasingly alarmed about the sharp rise in borrowing to fund investment. There are more details on the business live blog. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says social care companies should be exempt from the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance. Peter Walker has the story. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has suggested that social care companies will not be compensated for rise in employers\u2019 national insurance. In an interview on Radio 4\u2019s World at One, asked if the NHS would be compensated for having to pay national insurance, Streeting said the NHS was \u201cthe biggest employer in the land\u201d and that the chancellor had made allowance for this in the budget. Asked if that would also apply to GPs and to private firms providing NHS services, Streeting said: Of course there are a number of others involved in delivering health services that will be affected by employer national insurance contributions. I\u2019m working through that now, and I\u2019ll have more to say about that in the coming weeks in terms of what we can do more quickly to deliver the shift I\u2019ve wanted to see for some time, [getting] NHS investment spending out of hospitals into primary care. Asked again if private companies, and social care companies, which are also having to pay a higher minimum wage, would have to pay the extra national insurance, Streeting said: Bear in mind, as well, in terms of the increases in local government funding, the \u00a3600m allocated to social care in the budget, the chancellor has taken into account those pressures when making budget decisions. Sarah Montague, the presenter, said that, according to the care sector, the chancellor had definitely not taken those costs into account. She said Care England has claimed the care sector faces extra costs worth \u00a32.4bn as a result of the minimum wage and national insurance increases. She said \u00a3600m would not \u201ceven touch the sides\u201d. Streeting said there were various measures in the budget that would help this sector, like the boost to special educational needs funding. When it was put to him that he seemed to be saying that, while the NHS would be refunded for the national insurance increase, private healthcare companies would not get help, Streeting just repeated his point about wanting to shift more care into primary care. Montague said: \u201cWe\u2019ll take that as a no.\u201d In an interview with the Today programme this morning, Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggested that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, could end up having to raise more in tax in future budgets because she left herself so little headroom in her figures. Asked if there was a risk of the chancellor needing to \u201ccome back for more\u201d, he replied: The chancellor has changed the fiscal rules in this budget, but she\u2019s kept the practice of her predecessors in setting aside very little headroom, very little margin for manoeuvre against those rules. She\u2019s just got \u00a310bn pounds worth of headroom against her target to balance the current budget, \u00a316bn pounds against getting net financial liabilities falling. These are about a third of what her predecessors have set aside against their rules. It\u2019s a tiny fraction of the changes to our borrowing forecasts over a five-year horizon. Small changes in interest rates, smaller than ones we even saw in terms of the changes in interest rates between the March budget and this budget, would be enough to eliminate that kind of headroom. Asked again if that meant Reeves would have to come back for more tax revenue, Hughes replied: There are always risks to the outlook. Chancellors have to set their fiscal policy in light of those risks. This chancellor has set aside very little margin for manoeuvre against the target she has set for herself. Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility said that the measures in the budget would boost growth in the short term, but that after five years they would not be making any difference. Asked about this forecast, in an interview with the BBC Keir Starmer said that he wanted to do \u201cbetter than that\u201d and that the budget was just the \u201cfirst step\u201d. He said other policies, like planning reform and deregulation, would \u201chelp towards growth\u201d. More than 13,000 prisoners in England and Wales were released early under a scheme introduced by the previous Conservative government, PA Media reports. PA says: The move is likely to have contributed to a sharp rise this year in the number of offenders recalled to custody for breaching the conditions of their release. Some 13,325 prisoners were released early between October 17 2023 and September 9 2024, according to data published by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The scheme, known as End of Custody Supervised Licence (ECSL), continued for a few months after the Conservatives lost the general election in July this year, until it was superseded in September by a separate early-release programme introduced by the new Labour government. Just over a quarter (26%) of those released under the ECSL scheme had been found guilty of an offence classed as violence against the person, a similar proportion (26%) had been convicted of a theft offence, while nearly one in seven (15%) had been jailed for drug offences. No prisoners serving time for a sexual offence were released. The scheme initially allowed prisoners in certain jails to be released a maximum of 18 days early, but this was increased in March 2024 to a maximum of 35 days, then again in May to a maximum of 70 days. Separate figures published today show there were 9,782 recalls to custody in April to June 2024 of offenders who had breached the conditions of their release, up 44% from 6,814 in the equivalent period in 2023. John Swinney, the first minister, has urged the Treasury to fully compensate the Scottish government for the expected loss of \u00a3500m to its budget from the hike in national insurance (NI) payments by employers. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, appears to have been wrongfooted by the impact her decision to increase NI rates for employers will have on the already stretched finances of Scotland\u2019s public sector, which is larger than England\u2019s. The Scottish government estimates Scotland\u2019s health service, schools, police, courts and other public services will have to spend \u00a3500m extra \u2013 money which will now flow to the HM Revenue and Customs in London. Scotland\u2019s public sector employs around 600,000 people, 22% of the national workforce, compared to 17% across the UK as a whole. Swinney told Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, during first minister\u2019s questions he broadly welcomed Reeves\u2019 budget. It adds \u00a33.4bn to his spending next year, while the extra money this year will help the Scottish government meet the soaring costs of its public sector pay deals and inflation. But the NI anomaly needed to be addressed, he added, before the Scottish budget is published on 4 December. He said: There remains significant uncertainty about the impact of the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions on public spending in Scotland [and] whether our finances will be compensated in full for all that\u2019s involved. That of course is not an insignificant sum, it\u2019s \u00a3500m. Reeves was pressed about this on BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday morning, and appeared to suggest that no additional money would be provided. \u201cWe\u2019ve given \u00a33.4bn in the settlement to Scotland, which takes into account all of those pressures,\u201d she said. \u201cThe challenge now for the SNP in Scotland is to use that money wisely.\u201d (See 9.35am.) However, other UK government sources have said extra money would be given to Scotland to cover those costs, but were not clear how much. Scottish ministers fear the Treasury will give them a flat rate population-based share of those extra NI receipts, without recognising Scotland\u2019s larger public sector. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published on its website the slides shown at the presentation this morning where it explained its analysis of the budget. This one illustrates the point made by Paul Johnson, the IFS director, in his opening statement about how health was not the department that did best, in relative terms, from the spending allocations. (See 11.49am.) Voting in the Tory leadership contest closes at 5pm this afternoon, and the two candidates, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch, have both been attacking the budget in final media appearances. Jenrick, who is the underdog in the contest, claimed that Rachel Reeves was acting like \u201ca compulsive liar\u201d. He said: What we saw yesterday was a Halloween horror show. This was the biggest political heist in modern British history. \u00a340 billion of tax rises hurting people across this country and just three months ago the Labour party won an election on a pledge not to raise taxes. I am afraid Rachel Reeves is acting like a compulsive liar. She said during the general election she wasn\u2019t going to raise taxes. She just has. She said she wasn\u2019t going to increase debt. She just massively increased debt. And Badenoch said the budget would be \u201cterrible\u201d for small businesses. She told GB News: We are a party that believes not just in business, but in real business, in entrepreneurialism. Small business in particular, is full of entrepreneurs, and this Budget is terrible for them. What they have done on employers\u2019 NI is going to destroy jobs. It is going to lower wages. People will not see pay rises. Employment, disposable income, and salaries are all going to be lower than [they were] under the Conservatives. That is what the OBR, pretty much, has said. The OBR has basically said that Labour have chosen tax over growth. Keir Starmer ended his Q&amp;A with health workers at at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire by urging them to contribute to the public consultation on the future of the NHS. Being able to tell the government what they thought was a right, not a gift, he said. After the election I stood outside Downing Street and said we\u2019d be a government of service. And that means that we\u2019re a government which is in your service. So the opportunity to talk to us, that\u2019s not a great gift that we\u2019re giving you this morning. That\u2019s actually your right. You have every right to tell me and Rachel [Reeves] what you think. You\u2019ve every right to be heard on this. Starmer also said, if people had any points they wanted to raise that they had not done already, they should do so via the members of his team there organising the event. He went on: I\u2019m one of these people that, on the train on the way home, ruminate about what people have said to me and think about it. So it really is impactful if you do that. So you have the right to tell us what you think. You\u2019ve got the right to put your fingerprints on the future of your country. Please exercise that right. Back at the hospital event, Keir Starmer was asked about an NHS worker what Labour would do to promote more collaborative working in the health service. Starmer said it was important to create an environment where staff felt valued. He went on: But I also want to be honest with you; we are going to be asking more of you. There\u2019s no point me standing here and saying, your workload will go down. The whole point is, people are living longer. They\u2019ve got more conditions. What the NHS is facing now is different to what it was facing in the post war period. Your workload is likely to go up, not down. Now, in a way, that is a good thing, because we\u2019re living longer. We shouldn\u2019t see that as a bad thing, but it does make your life more complicated. So are we making a bigger ask of you? Yes. Are we going to help you? Therefore, yes. As examples of what government might do to help, Starmer said it would make sure they had the right number of trained staff, and that AI and technology was used properly. He said patients were fed up of the fact that it is not always easy for doctors to access their notes. There would also be more focus on preventative health, he said. He went on: So you\u2019re doing more, but actually the pressure will come off if we do it in the way that we need to do it. Ofcom said it has imposed a \u00a3100,000 fine on GB News for \u201cbreaking due impartiality rules\u201d following a question and answer-style debate with former prime minister Rishi Sunak earlier this year, PA Media reports. PA says: The media watchdog began an investigation into GB News three days after the airing of a programme on February 12 titled People\u2019s Forum: The prime minister, which saw Sunak answer questions from a studio audience and a presenter. GB News chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos said the channel is challenging the \u201cunnecessary, unfair and unlawful\u201d Ofcom ruling in the courts. In a statement, Ofcom said Sunak \u201chad a mostly uncontested platform to promote the policies and performance of his government in a period preceding a UK general election, in breach of Rules 5.11 and 5.12 of the Broadcasting Code\u201d. \u201cGiven the seriousness and repeated nature of this breach, Ofcom has imposed a financial penalty of \u00a3100,000 on GB News Limited,\u201d it added. \u201cWe have also directed GB News to broadcast a statement of our findings against it, on a date and in a form determined by us. \u201cGB News is challenging our original breach decision in this case by judicial review, which we are defending. Ofcom will not enforce this sanction decision until those proceedings are concluded.\u201d The rules state that \u201cdue impartiality must be preserved on matters of major political and industrial controversy\u201d and \u201can appropriately wide range of significant views\u201d should be included. Back to the hospital event, and a consultant has asked Keir Starmer how he can assure here that the extra money for the NHS will ensure there are extra staff to fill the rota gaps. Staff are suffering burnout because of the pressure, she says. Starmer says, in the first place, there will be a \u201cmindset change\u201d. He says this government will repect the NHS workforce in a way the last government didn\u2019t. There will have to be a workforce plan too. He says he cannot pretend things will change immediately, but he says the extra money for the NHS in the budget is a \u201cdownpayment\u2019 on a better future for the NHS. This is from Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, reporting what Paul Johnson, the IFS director, told him when Islam asked him if Rachel Reeves\u2019s future spending figures were more realistic than Jeremy Hunt\u2019s (which were described as fiction by the head of the OBR). See 11.49am. \u201cLight fiction rather than science fiction\u201d @PJTheEconomist @theIFS response to my q of whether the Budget ended what was called the \u201cfiscal fiction\u201d of previous spending plans\u2026 Budget assumes two years of spending growth (4.3%, 2.6%) then tight at 1.3% in following 3 years Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer are talking about the budget at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire. Their opening comments have been routine, but they are due to take questions shortly. And here are some more lines from Paul Johnson\u2019s opening briefing at the IFS press conference this morning. Johnson, director of the IFS, said the government needed a \u201cmore coherent tax strategy\u201d to promote growth. He explained: As for the rest of the tax changes [after the national insurance rise], I will only say that the lack of any apparent strategy or appetite for reform is deeply disappointing. Unlike the coalition\u2019s corporate tax \u201croad map\u201d the one published yesterday is more of a parking space \u2013 an ambition not to take a big journey in any direction. That the chancellor decided to increase stamp duty, if only on second properties, is most disappointing of all. It again reduces transactions, increases again the bias in favour of owner occupation, and against renting, and at least part of the consequence will be to reduce the supply of rental housing and so increase rents \u2026 If this government really wants to focus on growth, then part of the plan needs to be a much more coherent tax strategy than we saw yesterday. Let\u2019s hope for better next year. He said the Treasury should be more honest about what it was doing. Also disappointing is some of the presentation \u2013 even after the \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d entered into during the election campaign. How the budget red book can include the sentence \u201cit [the government] is not increasing the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT\u201d is beyond me. The continued pretence that these changes will not affect working people risks further undermining trust. Johnson may have drafted this statement before Rachel Reeves\u2019s interview round this morning, where she did concede the national insurance rise would affect workers. (See 8.02am.) He said the national insurance rise would raise much less than the \u00a325bn implied in the budget red book. It is also worth noting that, net, this increase will not actually get the Treasury anything like the \u00a325bn stated on the scorecard. As the OBR note, it will result in lower wages, reducing the amount raised from employer NI and reducing employee NI and income tax revenues. That takes the net revenue down to some \u00a316 billion. On top of that there will be an effective \u00a36bn of compensation for public sector employers. He said Reeves was right to prioritise investment. [Reeves] chose to increase borrowing in order to increase investment spending \u2013 or at least to stop it falling as a fraction of national income. Given that the growth benefits of this take some time to arrive, this is a courageous move and a welcome focus on the long term. This was the right thing to do. He said the the spending allocation for the NHS was not a lot higher than it was for other departments. Unusually the NHS is not scooping the pool. It is getting about the average spending increase. Equally unusually local government is doing rather well, as is the justice department, reflecting the severe pressures each is facing. He said that Reeves was right to say the Tories left her with public spending plans that were not properly funded. The increases in spending look big relative to the previous government\u2019s plans, but that is in large part because their plans were unrealistic. Despite the apparent scale of the increases, this is not going to feel like Christmas has come for the public realm. Ms Reeves may be overegging the \u00a322 billion black hole, but she is not wrong to stress that she got a hospital pass on the public finances. He said the Tory cuts to national insurance before the election were irresponsible. Rachel Reeves was faced with a genuinely difficult inheritance and the last government must take a lot of the responsibility. Its spending plans for this year and for the future lacked credibility. To cut \u00a320 billion from employee national insurance last year in the face of known fiscal pressures was not responsible. One of the great traditions of a British budget is that, whichever party is in power, and whoever is chancellor, the Institute for Fiscal Studies always comes out the next day and picks holes in it. It has been doing it again this morning. The IFS is not universally critical, it is more positive about some budgets than others, and overall it is more complimentary about what Rachel Reeves announced than it was about the efforts from some of her predecessors. But it is still finding fault, and in his opening presentation at the IFS press conference this morning Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said that Reeves\u2019s longterm spending plans were almost as unrealistically low as Jeremy Hunt\u2019s. He explained: Much the most striking aspect of the spending decisions is how incredibly front loaded the additional spending is. Day-to-day public service spending, after inflation and the additional cost to public sector employers of rising NI, is set to rise by 4.3% this year and 2.6% next year, but then by just 1.3% each year thereafter \u2026 I am willing to bet a substantial sum that day-to-day public service spending will in fact increase more quickly than supposedly planned after next year. 1.3% a year overall would almost certainly mean real terms cuts for some departments. It would be odd to increase spending rapidly only to start cutting back again in subsequent years. I\u2019m afraid this looks like the same silly games playing as we got used to with the last lot. Pencil in implausibly low spending increases for the future in order to make the fiscal arithmetic balance. It sounds like it was hard enough to get agreement from departmental ministers to relatively generous settlements in the short term. When it comes to settling with departments for the period after 2025-26 keeping within that 1.3% envelope will be extremely challenging. To put it mildly \u2026. [Reeves] is meeting her borrowing target only by repeating the same silly manoeuvres as her predecessors used to make it look as if the books will balance. Let\u2019s pretend we\u2019ll increase fuel duties next time, but not do it this year. Let\u2019s pretend that we\u2019ll really rein in spending in a couple of years after splurging this year. That\u2019s not going to happen. The spending plans will not survive contact with her cabinet colleagues. I will post more from the briefing soon. The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 briefing on the budget is underway. One point it is making is that the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance will, proportionally, have the biggest impact on firms employing people on low wages. In July Rachel Reeves published a document claiming there was a \u00a322bn black hole in the Tories\u2019 spending plans, which Labour inherited, for 2024-25. The figure was widely quoted, although when the Financial Times tried to use a freedom of information request to get details of how the Treasury arrived at the \u00a322bn figure, the Treasury would not release the information. Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility published a report saying spending pressures were not fully disclosed by the last goverment. But it did not endorse the \u00a322bn figure, and it implied that, if there was a black hole, it was more like \u00a39.5bn. This morning, in her interview on the Today programme, Reeves, rather ingeniously, suggested there was an alternative way of arguing that the Tories left a \u00a322bn black hole. She did not withdraw or disown the Treasury calculation released in July. But when the presenter, Nick Robinson, put it to her that she should have known during the election campaign that the Tory spending plans were unrealistic, because that is what all the experts were saying (see 8.27am), she replied: I think this is really important. Nobody knew about this in-year overspend. It\u2019s why, when we get the monthly borrowing numbers, in the six months of this year, they are already running \u00a311bn pounds higher. Times that by two to take us to the full year, that\u2019s \u00a322bn pounds more than the OBR forecast in March because the previous government withheld that information. Labour has got a history of redefining contested \u201cblack hole\u201d figures. In May Labour claimed that there was a \u00a371bn annual black hole in Tory spending plans. The figure was dismissed by most commentators as a wild exaggeration, not least because it assumed that the Tories would abolish national insurance in its entirety without replacing it with an alternative source of income (something that Jeremy Hunt had floated as a very long-term aspiration, but that was not widely seen as a realistic aim). Later, during the proper election campaign, Labour produced a more realistic assessment of the black hole in Tory plans, focusing on what the five-year figure would be, not the annual figure. Conveniently, this also came to \u00a371bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is about to hold a press conference to present its own, detailed budget analysis. You can watch it here. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has this morning published a 61-page analysis of the budget. Like the IFS (see 8.50am), the Resolution Foundation says this parliament is set to be the second worst since the war for rising living standards. It explains: Indeed, the outlook for living standards looks weaker than the OBR projected in March 2024, with real household disposable income (RHDI) per person set to increase slightly (up 1.5 per cent) between 2024 and 2025, compared to a projected increase of 1.7 per cent in the March 2024 forecast. Notably, the living standards outlook later in the forecast period has been revised down more significantly \u2026 In March, the OBR projected RHDI per person to grow by 1.3 per cent between 2027 and 2028 \u2013 but in its latest set of forecasts, the OBR projected RHDI per person to grow by just 0.4 per cent during this period (and then to grow by only 0.7 per cent between 2028 and 2029). Some might view any income growth as a cause for celebration, since the last parliament remains the worst since at least the 1950s for living standards improvements. As figure 30 [see below] shows, RHDI per person rose by an average of just 0.3 per cent a year during the 2019-2024 parliament. But the forecast for this parliament is not much better: RHDI is set to rise by 0.5 per cent a year across this parliament, equating to a total income gain of \u00a3700 per person between the 2024 and 2029 elections (in 2024-25 prices). This projected income growth is a far cry from the living standards increases that were experienced during the last Labour government, during which even the worst term for living standards (the 2005-2010 parliament) recorded 0.8 per cent annual growth. When we look across the entire period of the last Labour government (between 1997-2010), RHDI rose by a relatively strong 1.9 per cent on an annualised basis \u2013 equating to an overall income boost of \u00a35,400 per person \u2013 even though this period of government included the financial crisis. That said, this historically tepid projected real income growth over the course of the parliament needs to be seen in the broader context. Given its inheritance, the government presumably felt that increasing taxes to better fund day-to-day public services was the priority, even if that put downward pressure on incomes directly or, in the case of the employer NI rise, indirectly through the second-order earnings and employment effects. In this respect, the government has clearly gambled on the hope that the public will accept limited income growth over the parliament in exchange for improvements to public services. And here is the figure 30 chart. In his interview on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Jeremy Hunt also confirmed that he will leave the shadow cabinet at the end of this week, when a new leader takes over. He said: I have told [Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, the two leadership candidates left in the contest] that I will step back. I think it is the right thing to do when a party suffers a loss of the scale that we have, so I will step back from the shadow chancellor role for a few years whilst the party recovers \u2013 but I will be very active on the back benches. Earlier this week Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, suggested that the Office for Budget Responsibility was about to publish a report biased in favour of Labour. Referring to the news that the OBR was going to release the outcome of its review into Rachel Reeves\u2019s claim that the last government had an undisclosed \u00a322bn black hole in its spending plans, Hunt said: Straying into political territory and failing to follow due process like this demeans it and also is deeply problematic for perceptions of the impartiality of the civil service. But when the report came out yesterday, although it said that the Treasury withheld information from the OBR about spending pressures in the accounts at the time of the spring budget, it did not endorse the Labour claim about Hunt leaving his successor a \u00a322bn black hole. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain today, Hunt said he was wrong to imply the OBR was going to be party political. He said: I was worried about the process through which they compile their report, but I am happy to say that I was wrong. I was worried if they would criticise the previous government, but there were no criticism of the previous government in their report. The Conservatives claim the budget includes a series of broken promises by Labour \u2013 about not planning to raise taxes, about ruling out a national insurance increase, about the pre-election fiscal rules being non-negotiable \u2013 and in interviews this morning Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, restated these claims. The budget was \u201ca bad day for trust in British politics\u201d, he claimed. Labour say they haven\u2019t broken promises, and that during the election the Tories were criticising them for things like not ruling out a rise in employers\u2019 national insurance. But Hunt also accused Rachel Reeves this morning of \u201ctaking the easy route\u201d in her budget, instead of finding an alternative to higher taxes that could also lead to better public services. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, he said: I would always welcome more money for the NHS and we all want it to get back on its feet. But there are choices in how you decide to do that and [Reeves] took the easy route \u2013 which is to pick the pockets of businesses. He said the Conservatives would have adopted a different approach. Speaking on Sky News, he said: With an ageing population, with all the pressures of what [Russian president Vladimir] Putin is doing in Ukraine, how do you fund our public services without really damaging rises in taxation? We would have made difficult decisions on welfare reform, on the public sector, and productivity. If you cut the number of people claiming benefits to 2019 levels \u2013 in other words before the pandemic \u2013 that releases \u00a334bn a year. The government has chosen to do nothing on that and, as a result, the adult working-age benefit bill is going to be more than \u00a3100bn by this end of this period. We would have taken that harder path, because we know that the result of higher taxes is lower growth, and that is bad for ordinary families. In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, insisted that the Scottish government was getting extra money to reimburse the public sector for the extra cost of the national insurance hike. She was asked about a comment from Shona Robison, the Scottish finance secretary, who said the employers\u2019 national insurance increase could cost the public sector an extra \u00a3500m in Scotland. Reeves replied: We\u2019ve given \u00a33.4bn in the settlement to Scotland, which takes into account all of those pressures and the challenge now for the SNP in Scotland is to use that money wisely to start reducing waiting times, because, you know, frankly, the performance of the NHS in Scotland under the SNP is worse than in any part of the United Kingdom, and that money now needs to be used to address the priorities of the Scottish people. Talking to Scottish MPs yesterday in parliament, this settlement was very welcome, the biggest settlement in the history of devolution. The Scottish government now need to deliver. UPDATE: An article by Full Fact, the factchecking organisation, published in July points out that it is hard or even impossible to properly compare NHS performance in the four countries in the UK because \u201cthe four services have different targets and different ways of measuring performance\u201d. Rachel Reeves is now being interview on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. She is being interviewed by Ed Balls, the former Labour shadow chancellor who is now a TV presenter. He asks her to confirm that workers will end up losing out because of the employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) increase. Reeves says the NICs increase will have an impact. But she says living standards are expected to rise during this parliament. Balls pays a clip from the budget speech, where Reeves explained why she was freezing fuel duty. Q: If raising fuel duty was the wrong choice for working people during a cost of living crisis, why was cutting the winter fuel allowance the right choice? Reeves says, if she had not frozen fuel duty, petrol costs would have gone up sharply. On pensioners, she says the state pension is going up by \u00a3470. And she says the investment in the NHS will help everyone who uses the NHS. Kate Garraway, Balls\u2019 co-presenter, asks why the elderly should take a hit. Reeves says the government is trying to get more people to claim pension credit, which will mean they can continue to get the winter fuel payment, as well as potentially thousands of pounds in pension credit. She says applications for pension credit are up 151%. Q: You are gambling on growth. But some forecasts say it won\u2019t do very well. Will people feel better off at the end of this parliament. Reeves says the OBR says people will be better off at the end of this parliament. Balls chips in again. He says the Institute for Fiscal Studies is predicting the second worst rise in living standards for any parliament since the war. That feels like a miserable rise in living standards. Reeves says the government is just getting started. There is more to do, she says. But the OBR says real disposable income will increase, she says. And that\u2019s the end of the ITV interview, and all the early morning broadcast interviews Reeves is doing. Rachel Reeves is now being interviewed on Radio 5 Live. Asked about a business leader saying he now has to raise an extra \u00a3500,000 to pay the national insurance increase, Reeves says she recognises the challenges businesses face. But she had to stabilise the national finances, she says. She is also asked to respond to complaints from a farmer about the budget, and farms worth more than \u00a31m losing their exemption from inheritance tax. Reeves says 73% of farms will not be affected at all. Some landowners will have to pay more inheritance tax. But they will still pay less inheritance tax (20%) than many families pay. Q: Are you embarrassed when I remind you you said at the election that every Labour policy was fully costed? Reeves says: When I became chancellor on 5 July, I had no idea about all the unfunded commitments that the previous government had made. Robinson says, if she had listened to the Today programme, she would have heard them repeatedly heard reports about claims that the Tories\u2019 spending plans did not add up. [The IFS was issuing press releases about this almost daily during the election campaign.] Reeves says government borrowing is running much higher than forecast. And that\u2019s the end of that interview. Q: Wes Streeting said recently it was a mistake to keep pouring money into the NHS without reform. But isn\u2019t that what you are doing? Reeves says the NHS needed immediate help. But she says it has also been set a 2% efficiency target. Q: The OBR says interest rates will be higher as a result of the decisions you took? Reeves says that is not exactly right. She says the OBR is forecasting higher interest rates than it forecast in March. But it has also said that in March it was not given full details of the government\u2019s spending commitments. Overall, the OBR is forecasting interest rates to come down, she says. Reeves says people paying four people on the national minimum wage won\u2019t pay any more in national insurance. And she says 1 million firms will pay the same or less national insurance than they do now. Q: Why are you putting what you have called a \u201cjobs tax\u201d on business, worth \u00a325bn? Reeves says the government recently held an investors summit that showed there was a vote of confidence in the UK. And stability is important, she says. If the budget has involved half measures, with the chance of taxes going up again in the future, that would not provide stability, she says. Q: A business leader told us that a firm making profits of \u00a38m would have higher costs of \u00a31.5m. Do you accept the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance will take money out of people\u2019s pockets. Reeves says she does accept that this will have \u201can impact on wage growth\u201d. Rachel Reeves is being interviewed on the Today programme by Nick Robinson. Q: How disappointed were you by the OBR saying the budget would not boost growth? Reeves says she has to set a budget in circumstances at the time. She says she wanted to be \u201copen and transparent\u201d about the problems she faced. She says the OBR has, for the first time, looked at the growth impact of the budget beyond the next five years. It says the plans, especially on infrastructure, will boost growth by 1.5% over the longer term. As Julia Kollewe reports on the business live blog, the IMF has praised the budget. An IMF spokesperson said: We support the envisaged reduction in the deficit over the medium term, including by sustainably raising revenue. Good morning. The day after budget day is normally when the most thorough and considered budget analysis starts to emerge, and rarely has there been more to chew over than there was in Rachel Reeves\u2019s first budget as chancellor \u2013 a mammoth, \u00a340bn-tax-raising fiscal reset with huge consequences for Britain for the rest of the decade. Reeves and her Tory shadow, Jeremy Hunt, are doing full media rounds this morning, and the leading budget thinktanks are publishing full studies of what was announced yesterday. In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Reeves accepted that people would get lower pay rises as a result of her decision to increase employers\u2019 national insurance. She said: I said that [the national insurance increase] will have consequences. It will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been. But, overall, the Office of Budget Responsibility forecast that household incomes will increase during this parliament. That is a world away from the last parliament, which was the worst Parliament ever for living standards. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Resolution Foundation publishes its full budget analysis. 10.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies holds a press conference to present its budget analysis. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 11.30am: MPs resume their budget debate, with Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, opening for the government. 5pm: Voting closes in the Conservative leadership contest. The results will be announced on Saturday morning. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

      "bodyText": "Choosing to hold a bumper tax-raising budget the day before Halloween was always going to create presentational problems for Rachel Reeves. If you announce plans to borrow more and increase the size of the state you can expect the headline writers to have fun at your expense. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201cNightmare on Downing Street\u201d summed up the mood. Reeves is not naive and knew what was coming. But while the chancellor would have preferred more positive headlines, a budget is judged not on its day one reception but over months and years. Here there was better news for Reeves. She received some heavyweight support for her decision to increase public investment from the International Monetary Fund and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Both said higher spending on infrastructure was the right thing to do, even if it would take time for the benefits to feed through into stronger growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility says that by the end of the decade, higher capital spending will increase the supply potential of the economy by just 0.14%, rising to 0.43% in a decade\u2019s time. But this is just one estimate, and assumes higher public investment will lead to higher interest rates, which in turn will dampen private investment. But, as the IPPR thinktank has noted, the recent experience of the US suggests a more positive outcome. There, the expansionary fiscal policy and the activist industrial strategy has had the knock-on effect of stimulating private investment. The IPPR thinks the boost to the supply capacity of Reeves\u2019s capital spending increases could be three times as great as the OBR is forecasting. It was not all good post-budget news for the chancellor.

Even the biggest Shostakovich fan would not claim that all of those first five scores are among the finest in the series, though two of them, the Third and the Fifth, composed in 1946 and 1952 respectively, are substantial works in which Shostakovich began to explore the limits of what the medium could offer him.</p> <p>In its way, 1938\u2019s First Quartet is as much a \u201creply to just criticism\u201d as the much better known Fifth Symphony, completed the previous year; its four movements stick closely to the classical model, in a language that is almost blandly diatonic. Though conceived on a more expansive scale, the Second, composed towards the end of the second world war, is similarly unadventurous. But the Third is a different matter altogether, a five-movement work of far greater emotional depth and scope, which inescapably reflects Shostakovich\u2019s experience of the war just ended.</p> <p>All of the Cuarteto Casals\u2019 performances are wonderfully refined, but it\u2019s clear that they respond more vividly to the greater expressive demands of the Third and Fifth, where their playing has much more bite and intensity than it does in the other works.

      "bodyText": "The first volume in the Cuarteto Casals\u2019 survey of Shostakovich\u2019s 15 numbered string quartets takes in the works composed between 1938 and 1952. Even the biggest Shostakovich fan would not claim that all of those first five scores are among the finest in the series, though two of them, the Third and the Fifth, composed in 1946 and 1952 respectively, are substantial works in which Shostakovich began to explore the limits of what the medium could offer him. In its way, 1938\u2019s First Quartet is as much a \u201creply to just criticism\u201d as the much better known Fifth Symphony, completed the previous year; its four movements stick closely to the classical model, in a language that is almost blandly diatonic. Though conceived on a more expansive scale, the Second, composed towards the end of the second world war, is similarly unadventurous. But the Third is a different matter altogether, a five-movement work of far greater emotional depth and scope, which inescapably reflects Shostakovich\u2019s experience of the war just ended. All of the Cuarteto Casals\u2019 performances are wonderfully refined, but it\u2019s clear that they respond more vividly to the greater expressive demands of the Third and Fifth, where their playing has much more bite and intensity than it does in the other works. Though bigger challenges will come later in the cycle, this opening instalment is a very promising one. Listen on Apple Music (above) or Spotify",

The task involved walking a tightrope between frightening them into capital flight and democratising an economy whose ownership was concentrated into a handful of conglomerates, dominated by the gold and diamond miners, almost all of whom were white. It went to Tito Mboweni, who has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgwq9kkzwro\">died aged 65</a> following a short illness, and he came to have a key influence on the country\u2019s development. </p> <p>In the transition period to 1994, when the African National Congress came to power in the first multiracial general election, the party was divided between the centre and the left, with the latter calling for the nationalisation of mines and banks. Mandela had to intervene, urging pragmatism, and Mboweni used the threat of nationalisation as leverage over both the apartheid-era National party, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/11/fw-de-klerk-obituary\">FW de Klerk</a> as president, and the heads of big business.</p> <p>In 1992, Mandela was invited to address global corporate leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Late in the day, it was discovered that his speech, written by a supporter of the left, had committed South Africa to nationalisation. Mboweni hastily rewrote the offending paragraphs, fudging the nationalisation question. Newspapers in South Africa, having been provided with the earlier version, splashed with the nationalisation pledge, but Mandela could \u2013 fortunately for the tortuous negotiations then being conducted between the outgoing regime and incoming one \u2013 plausibly deny it.</p> <p>When the ANC formed a government in 1994, Mandela appointed Mboweni, still only 35, as his minister of labour. Mboweni went on to transform labour relations from the master-servant model under apartheid with a new framework that included the right to strike and belong to a union of choice, as well as collective bargaining and a dispute resolution mechanism. Working closely with the International Labour Organization, he regulated conditions of employment in the workplace.</p> <p>In 1999, Mboweni was appointed the first black governor of the Reserve Bank. He negotiated the country through a difficult period, which included rampant inflation and a sudden dramatic devaluation of the currency. Instituting an inflation-targeting regime, he successfully aimed for a range of 3-6%, and restored the credibility of the rand. In 2008, he had to deal with the fallout of the global economic downturn, which hit emerging countries such as South Africa particularly hard.</p>    <p>After 10 years, he left for the private sector, notably as an adviser to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and on his farm in Magoebaskloof, Limpopo, he cultivated avocados. But it was not to last. In 2018, when Cyril Ramaphosa became president, he asked Mboweni to join his cabinet as minister of finance to repair the damage wrought by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/09/jacob-zumas-arrest-south-africas-post-apartheid-constitution\">Jacob Zuma\u2019s kleptocratic rule</a>.

Respectfully.\u201d It was a bit like listening to the white tigers\u2019 team talk about how they were going to deal with Siegfried &amp; Roy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/30/joe-marler-calls-on-haka-to-be-binned-england-new-zealand-clash-rugby-union\">Marler left England camp for personal reasons before post criticising haka</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI think Joe Marler knew exactly what he was doing by throwing that out there,\u201d said Sam Cane, who managed to say all the right, and polite things, but in a tone that made it very clear indeed just how unamused he was. \u201cIn New Zealand when we perform the haka to someone it\u2019s a sign of respect. It\u2019s performed at 21sts, and at weddings. Yes, it\u2019s about laying down a challenge, and it\u2019s up to the opposition how they would like to perceive that challenge, but to us it\u2019s a sign of respect.\u201d The unspoken implication was that by talking about it the way he did, Marler had, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/31/england-jamie-george-joe-marler-haka-new-zealand-rugby-union\">prior to his apology</a> on Thursday night, disrespected the team, and their&nbsp;traditions.</p> \n<p>And the English wonder why the&nbsp;rest of the world seems to take&nbsp;so much pleasure in beating them. Imagine how it would go down in certain quarters of the Twickenham crowd if the Kiwis had rocked up this week and started mocking the English for singing Swing Low. At least the haka is an authentic expression of Kiwi culture. And besides, as Cane pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s a great spectacle, and the crowd love it\u201d.</p> \n<p>Robertson said he didn\u2019t have a problem with the other team responding to the haka on the field. He says he thought it was \u201cawesome\u201d when England lined up into an arrow formation to face it before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\">the World Cup semi-final</a> in 2019. \u201cThat had a clear meaning behind it, and it was respectfully done, so it was great, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Cane agreed. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re laying down a challenge. If they want to do something else that signifies they\u2019re accepting the challenge, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Although he did say that he thought it was a good thing there is a rule that keeps the opposition 10m away, because \u201cit keeps it clean\u201d.</p> \n<p>New Zealand have won only four out of their last seven Tests, but Robertson\u2019s lineup looks formidable. He\u2019s made four changes to the XV that beat Australia 33-13 in the final match of the Rugby Championship at the end of September. Mark Tele\u2019a is in on the wing ahead of Sevu Reece, Jordie Barrett has recovered from a knee injury and is back at inside centre, and Cortez Ratima, who has been in red-hot form all year, starts at scrum half. The only area where they\u2019re under-strength is at loosehead, where Ethan de Groot has been dropped, and Tamaiti Williams starts instead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"61149539-6669-40ad-be09-b9c5e87cd34f\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England</b> G Furbank; I Feyi-Waboso, H Slade, O Lawrence, T Freeman; M Smith, B Spencer; E Genge, J George (capt), W Stuart, M Itoje, G Martin, C Cunningham-South, T Curry, B Earl</p>\n    <p>Replacements: T Dan, F Baxter, D Cole, N Isiekwe, B Curry, A Dombrandt, H Randall, G Ford</p>\n    <p><b>New Zealand</b> W Jordan; M Tele'a, R Ioane, J Barrett, C Clarke; B Barrett, C Ratima; T Williams, C Taylor, T Lomax, S Barrett (capt), T Vaa'i, W Sititi, S Cane, A Savea</p>\n    <p>Replacements: A Aumua, O Tu\u2019ungafasi, P Tosi, P Tuipulotu, S Finau, C Roigard, A Lienert-Brown, D McKenzie</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>Allianz Stadium, Sat 3.10pm GMT</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Robertson would only say that De Groot \u201cdidn\u2019t meet internal standards\u201d, which is quite a euphemism. All this talk about the haka may actually have spared him from a stiff interrogation about exactly what his team have been up to after hours this week.</p> \n<p>The most telling selection is at fly-half, where Beauden Barrett starts ahead of Damian McKenzie. Barrett played there often enough in the early years of his career but this is the first time he has started a Test there inside his younger brother Jordie. Robertson said Barrett\u2019s game-management skills had given him the edge. \u201cBeauden\u2019s experience means he understands what\u2019s needed on a northern tour,\u201d he said. \u201cOut of his hand or off his foot he\u2019s very instinctive, but he also knows how to get around the field. So we believe he\u2019s the best one for this week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Robertson was clear that they don\u2019t need any extra incentive to get up for a Test against England at Twickenham. \u201cThere have been some epic battles and a lot of our All&nbsp;Black heroes have left their mark on it,\u201d he said. But thanks to Marler, they have one anyway.</p>",

At least the haka is an authentic expression of Kiwi culture. And besides, as Cane pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s a great spectacle, and the crowd love it\u201d. Robertson said he didn\u2019t have a problem with the other team responding to the haka on the field. He says he thought it was \u201cawesome\u201d when England lined up into an arrow formation to face it before the World Cup semi-final in 2019. \u201cThat had a clear meaning behind it, and it was respectfully done, so it was great, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Cane agreed. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019re laying down a challenge. If they want to do something else that signifies they\u2019re accepting the challenge, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Although he did say that he thought it was a good thing there is a rule that keeps the opposition 10m away, because \u201cit keeps it clean\u201d. New Zealand have won only four out of their last seven Tests, but Robertson\u2019s lineup looks formidable. He\u2019s made four changes to the XV that beat Australia 33-13 in the final match of the Rugby Championship at the end of September. Mark Tele\u2019a is in on the wing ahead of Sevu Reece, Jordie Barrett has recovered from a knee injury and is back at inside centre, and Cortez Ratima, who has been in red-hot form all year, starts at scrum half. The only area where they\u2019re under-strength is at loosehead, where Ethan de Groot has been dropped, and Tamaiti Williams starts instead. Robertson would only say that De Groot \u201cdidn\u2019t meet internal standards\u201d, which is quite a euphemism. All this talk about the haka may actually have spared him from a stiff interrogation about exactly what his team have been up to after hours this week. The most telling selection is at fly-half, where Beauden Barrett starts ahead of Damian McKenzie. Barrett played there often enough in the early years of his career but this is the first time he has started a Test there inside his younger brother Jordie. Robertson said Barrett\u2019s game-management skills had given him the edge. \u201cBeauden\u2019s experience means he understands what\u2019s needed on a northern tour,\u201d he said. \u201cOut of his hand or off his foot he\u2019s very instinctive, but he also knows how to get around the field. So we believe he\u2019s the best one for this week.\u201d Robertson was clear that they don\u2019t need any extra incentive to get up for a Test against England at Twickenham. \u201cThere have been some epic battles and a lot of our All Black heroes have left their mark on it,\u201d he said. But thanks to Marler, they have one anyway.",

      "body": "<p>Advent calendars filled with everything from beauty products to chocolate, Lego to tea, are as much a staple in the run-up to Christmas as drinking too much and listening to Last Christmas for the 1,237th time.</p> <p>So, we\u2019ve sniffed, tasted and drunk our way through 12 of them, rating them by their contents, value for money, sustainability and festive factor. And for those who want to swerve products altogether, we\u2019ve rounded up the most beautiful, feelgood paper Advent calendars we could find.</p> <h2><strong>Product Advent calendars 2024: the verdict</strong></h2> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Lebkuchen</h2>    <p><strong>Lebkuchen-Schmidt Advent calendar, \u00a355<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/lebkuchen-and-biscuit-advent-calendar\"><sub>souschef.co.uk</sub></a><sub> </sub></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>A cheerful cardboard calendar that folds open like a book and measures a sizeable 58 x 40cm. The brightly coloured, graphic cartoons of a snowy Christmas market scene and, inside, a Christmas tree are cute, but suggest this is aimed at under-fives.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>Inside are 24 individually wrapped Lebkuchen of different varieties and sizes \u2013 from cinnamon stars (tasty and moist) to classic gingerbread to, err, more cinnamon stars \u2013 with plain cardboard behind each door.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products?<br></strong>Not at all, but they\u2019re absolutely delicious, made in \u2013 where else? \u2013 N\u00fcrnberg in Germany, home of the Lebkuchen. It gave me a Christmassy hit every morning: like mince pies, Lebkuchen are almost entirely associated with Christmas for me. <strong>5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>You can buy two packs of six large Lebkuchen for \u00a36.99 on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lambertz-Chocolate-Lebkuchen-Rounds-Cookies/dp/B08MT8CYG7/\">Amazon</a>, so that suggests not (my favourite Lebkuchen are from Aldi, though). So, even with the extra thrills of the Advent calendar itself, it feels a little overpriced. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The cardboard box is entirely recyclable, but each biscuit is wrapped in a small, plastic, albeit recyclable at a supermarket, sleeve.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>Extremely \u2013 if you\u2019re at primary school. Yet, my 10-year-old turned up her nose at the Lebkuchen, finding them a bit too rich and spiced, so the contents are at odds with the design. Perhaps German children just love Lebkuchen more. <strong>9/10</strong> <br><strong>Hannah Booth</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Tools</h2>    <p><strong>Halfords Advent calendar, \u00a329.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/tools/hand-tools/socket-sets/halfords-advent-calendar-2024-267683.html\"><sub>halfords.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>It\u2019s a box \u2013 like a chocolate box, but deeper \u2013 featuring an illustration of Santa handling some spare parts.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>The box says \u201cincludes 40-piece socket set\u201d. In fact, that\u2019s all it includes \u2013 one 40-piece 1/4in metric socket wrench set. On 1 December you open an enormous door to find a blow-moulded plastic case in which to keep your new socket set. Day 2 brings a rather smart socket ratchet handle. Thereafter, it\u2019s mostly wrench sockets of varying sizes \u2013 9mm, 4mm, 13mm, 5.5mm. By mid-month the sense of anticipation will have pretty much worn off.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>There is nothing in this world more useful than a 40-piece socket wrench set, excepting perhaps a 50-piece socket wrench set. I have often wondered if a decent socket collection would change my life immeasurably for the better. It looks as if this is the year I find out. <strong>10/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>It\u2019s a pretty solid piece of kit \u2013 heavy duty, with a lifetime guarantee \u2013 and nothing like the cheap tools you tend to get in Christmas crackers. I\u2019m hoping this socket set will last me the rest of my days. <strong>10/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>At \u00a329.99, it\u2019s \u00a35 cheaper than Halfords\u2019 regular, non-festive 40-piece 1/4in socket set, so it would appear to be a bit of a bargain.</p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The box has a plastic inside and a cardboard outside, and is \u201cfrom responsible sources\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>It looks like someone typed \u201cSanta tinkering at his workbench\u201d into ChatGPT. The spare parts on the table are unidentifiable. It\u2019s not terribly festive, but if you had a DIY emergency on Christmas Day, you would certainly find its presence reassuring, not to say provident. <strong>7/10<br>Tim Dowling</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Coffee</h2>    <p><strong>Pact coffee Advent calendar, \u00a334.95<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.pactcoffee.com/christmas/single-ground-advent-calendar\"><sub>pactcoffee.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>A smart, neat box with a bauble print and nicely packaged sachets of coffee stacked inside. No glitter, sparkles or sign of Santa, so this is more suitable for grownups who like the idea of a caffeinated take on Advent but don\u2019t need it to feel overtly Christmassy.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>The box contains 25 single-serving sachets of \u201cbetter than Fair Trade\u201d speciality ground coffee from Pact\u2019s network of small-scale, independent farmers. Each bag is tucked inside a numbered and nicely written information card that tells you about that particular coffee, from the country of origin to the roast, acidity, mouthfeel and tasting notes. Each card also features five blank stars for you to fill in to rate each days brew, which is a nice touch.<br><br><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>The coffees are delicious, interesting and varied. The 18g portions make sense for an Advent calendar, but it does mean you need the ability to brew a single portion. I used my <a href=\"https://www.pactcoffee.com/brewing-equipment/aeropress-coffee-maker\">Aeropress</a>, which worked well; single portions don\u2019t suit a large French press or a filter machine. And if you usually make coffee for two or more people in the morning, you can\u2019t share this Advent calendar. But really, who doesn\u2019t want a high-quality coffee every winter morning?<strong> 8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>The coffees are excellent, though best drunk black \u2013 once you add milk, you tend to lose the subtleties in flavour and aroma and they start to taste the same. Some of the brews are award-winning, and others are made in such small batches, or exclusively for Pact, that this is the only way you\u2019ll get to try this coffee. <strong>10/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>Very \u2013 \u00a330 for 25 different, speciality brews? That would be impossible to replicate elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The packaging (cardboard with paper tape), the box and the tasting notes are all recyclable paper or cardboard. But the sachets of coffee themselves are made from a soft plastic that you need to take to a supermarket for recycling (code 5). That\u2019s a bit of a pain.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>More functional than fabulous \u2013 the bold red and green design is grownup, with a nod to the season. It looks smart enough on the kitchen counter, but it won\u2019t scratch the Christmassy itch if you\u2019re after twinkly lights, Santa or snowy scenes. <strong>4/10<br>Ruth Lewy</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Fragrances and candles</h2>    <p><strong>Sentier fragrance Advent calendar, \u00a399<br></strong><a href=\"https://sentierfragrance.com/product/sentiers-2024-advent-calendar-12-days-x-12-stories/\"><sub>sentierfragrance.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>I love the crisp snow-white cardboard packaging and the beautifully embossed sleeve. It doesn\u2019t feel particularly Christmassy, though, more of a luxe-lifestyle product \u2013 but I\u2019m not mad about that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>The box opens like a book to reveal 12 numbered drawers, each containing either a 60mg scented candle or a 10ml alcohol-free fragrance. I think 12 items is fair because it would be an enormous box if it were to contain 24 gifts. My favourite fragrance was M\u00e9ribel because I love patchouli and sandalwood \u2013 I was even asked what perfume I was wearing by friends. The Golden River candle had a lovely musk scent.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products?<br></strong>My teenage daughter and I almost always have a candle lit in the house, and we wear perfume daily, so we\u2019ve got a lot of use out of the products. We also found the compact fragrance bottles perfect for stashing in our bags. <strong>10/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>There wasn\u2019t a scent I didn\u2019t like. The candles fill a room with a pleasant smell while burning, and the fragrances lasted well throughout the day. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>Sentier says the calendar is worth \u00a3516: it\u2019s difficult to work out if this is accurate because the brand sells its <a href=\"https://sentierfragrance.com/product/alpine-chalet/\">candles only in 150mg for \u00a359</a> and not the 60mg that comes in the calendar. But I did calculate that six of its <a href=\"https://sentierfragrance.com/product/chronicles-of-self/\">10ml fragrances</a> would cost \u00a3192, so you\u2019re already getting more than your money\u2019s worth. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The box, sleeve and numbered boxes are all cardboard, so easily recycled or, better yet, reused. Each box is filled with a product and shredded paper, which can also be recycled. The candles are in glass jars with plastic lids, so they can be recycled or reused. And the fragrance bottles are glass with plastic and metal lids and a plastic atomiser spray, which may be harder to recycle with doorstep collection services but can be easily refilled and reused.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>The minimalist packaging is aesthetically pleasing but, save for the snow-white colour and a snow-capped mountain range, it\u2019s not especially festive. That said, it would make an excellent gift for someone whose birthday falls in November. <strong>7/10 </strong><strong><br>Emily Goddard</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Wine</h2>    <p><strong>Virgin Wines </strong><strong>Advent calendar, \u00a389.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.virginwines.co.uk/gifts/advent/Y63375VIRGIN/Mixed-Wine-Advent-Calendar-2024\"><sub>virginwines.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>Wow, this is <em>heavy</em>! And too big to carry long distances without the use of a sleigh. But it covers all the basics of what an Advent calendar should be: a reindeer drawing provides festive cheer, and there\u2019s 25 windows, including a bonus big one for Christmas Day. Does anyone feel more festive seeing a Virgin Wines logo slapped in the middle of it? I\u2019m guessing not.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>Behind each window is a 187ml bottle of wine. We\u2019re not talking Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild here, but neither has Santa stuffed it with undrinkable plonk. Beginner wine drinkers should enjoy trying a different style each day. A QR code on the back of the box directs you to more information on each wine.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products?</strong><strong><br></strong>The Advent calendar covers red, white, ros\u00e9 and one mini fizz. Beyond a surprise (and slightly tart) Italian famoso, it\u2019s not very adventurous, sticking to mainstream grapes such as merlot, sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio. It does the job, if wine can ever be deemed \u201cuseful\u201d? <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>\u00a389.99 is a fair whack to spend on an Advent calendar, but it\u2019s not a bad price to sample a range of wines. The wines are all drinkable enough without setting the world alight \u2013 a Macon-like Aussie chardonnay and French cabernet sauvignon stood out for me in a rather so-so crowd. But the big bottle of Black Pig reserve Australian shiraz on Christmas Day is a stunner, combining fruity accessibility with a backbone of smoke, tobacco and eucalyptus. It\u2019s a great alternative to Chateauneuf-du-Pape. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The box is made of cardboard, so recyclable. 25 (mainly glass) bottles may seem wasteful but I reuse them to store leftover wine in the freezer for stews and risottos.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>Providing a big bottle for the Christmas dinner table is a neat idea, but this is essentially a glorified box of miniature wines. <strong>6/10<br>Tim Jonze</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Seeds</h2>    <p><strong>She Grows Veg heirloom seed calendar, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://shegrowsveg.com/product/heirloom-seed-advent-calendar/?srsltid=AfmBOoqhxUrinV8UPAVSXITSSkrMBFlcdkVhjdLKfEW7NemKtGvlT-L_\"><sub>shegrowsveg.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>The seeds come in a small, beige sack with a green Santa boot printed on the side. It\u2019s not a calendar by any traditional use of the word, and it doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of festive decoration. It could nestle nicely underneath a Christmas tree, though, or hang from a mantelpiece.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>Open the sack, and you\u2019ll find 25 individually wrapped packages, in different kinds of tissue paper. Each contains vegetable seeds, across wild and wonderful varieties, from Himalayan pink bananas to Indian purple daikon, plus some good-quality staples, such as oxheart carrots and Rudolph purple sprouting broccoli.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products?<br></strong>Every seed in the calendar can be planted, and most of the plants eaten, so they are, by their very nature, useful. Each seed packet has a QR code that takes you to a YouTube playlist of tips curated for the specific plant, and I found that genuinely helpful. You\u2019d need a large garden or allotment to plant them all, though, and most of the seed packets will feel a little redundant until their planting season arrives later in 2025. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>At \u00a365, it\u2019s an awful lot of money, although looking at the price of each seed packet individually, it seems a good deal. The variety appears nicely curated rather than thrown together from the cheapest seeds on the shelf. One advantage of the sowing seasons coming later in the year is that this does seem like a present that will last throughout the seasons. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The fabric sack could, in theory, be reused, and most of the packaging is recyclable, aside from a few ribbons.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>The Advent calendar has a lovely handmade feel to it, almost as though someone has taken the time to wrap 25 presents for you, and the quality of the wrapping is excellent. But is it festive? That depends on how you\u2019d feel to open a Christmas present of seeds. If the idea excites you, this is the calendar for you. <strong>7/10</strong><br><strong>Monica Horridge</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Tea</h2>    <p><strong>Whittard</strong><strong> tea calendar, \u00a325<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.whittard.co.uk/christmas/tea-advent-calendar-358432.html\"><sub>whittard.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>It\u2019s reminiscent of a classic chocolate Advent calendar, except three times as thick to account for the teabags behind each door. The design is tasteful and fairly festive \u2013 not tacky, but not particularly exciting either.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>The front of the calendar opens to uncover 24 doors, behind each are two individually wrapped teabags of the same flavour: good for couples.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>I have a cup of tea every day and enjoy discovering new flavours, so I definitely got a lot out of it. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>They\u2019re pretty much all black teas in various flavours. Some were weaker than others \u2013 for instance, the vanilla chai wasn\u2019t strong enough for me. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>The calendar\u2019s RRP is \u00a325, which is fairly affordable for a product Advent calendar. It\u2019s a good way to try new flavours, without splashing out on a packet of teabags that you may not like and ultimately shove to the back of the cupboard. That said, many product calendars boast that their contents are worth more than the RRP, but in this case the cost per teabag (52p) is more than if you just bought a pack of them. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The calendar is made of recyclable cardboard, the teabags are wrapped in a paper envelope (also recyclable), and the bags themselves are compostable.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>The packaging is Christmassy in a grownup way, which some may see as tasteful and others might find slightly boring. <strong>5/10<br>Lily Smith</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Beer</h2>    <p><strong>Woodforde\u2019s beer calendar, \u00a365<br></strong><a href=\"https://woodfordes.com/products/woodfordes-advent-calendar\"><sub>woodfordes.com</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>It\u2019s chunky, as you\u2019d expect, given the contents. But it\u2019s not the most enticing object and aesthetics seem a low priority here: it\u2019s a box of beers after all.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>A selection of ales, lagers, ciders and stouts from Norfolk\u2019s Woodforde\u2019s brewery. Each day offers up a 500ml bottle or 440ml can, accessed from above via circular flaps. Accessing them is a challenge: the holes are barely bigger than the cans and bottles inside, and they are quite sharp!</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>It depends on how happy you are to drink a beer every day for 24 consecutive days: mine started piling up after a while. Still, it may be a useful calendar for anyone looking to stockpile for Christmas or New Year parties. Woodforde\u2019s is a respected Camra-friendly brewery, with an emphasis on hoppy old-school IPAs and bitters, and it\u2019s clearly very good at what it does. There\u2019s only occasional repetition \u2013 and the presence of ciders alongside the beers certainly adds to the sense of variety, as do the limited-edition seasonal beers like the Tinsel Toes Christmas ale. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>At \u00a32.70 a can/bottle, it seems reasonable, if not spectacular, value. Pleasingly, you get a decent amount of liquid for your buck: there are none of the stubby cans favoured by many craft breweries.</p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>Very: the calendar itself is cardboard, with no extra packaging beyond the outer shell, and the products are either cans or glass bottles. No plastic in sight.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor</strong><strong><br></strong>A half-hearted attempt, with illustrations of fairy lights, candy canes and the like \u2013 but not the sort of thing you\u2019d want to show off to the neighbours. I found the beers a little too on the hoppy side for my tastes, but I\u2019d happily buy the calendarfor a real ale-enjoying family member. <strong>7/10<br>Gwilym Mumford</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Cat treats</h2>    <p><strong>Lily\u2019s Kitchen cat treat calendar, \u00a39.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.lilyskitchen.co.uk/for-cats/christmas-cat-food/advent-calendar-for-cats-CTADV24.html\"><sub>lilyskitchen.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>It\u2019s a fairly standard Advent calendar, but with cartoon pictures of cats bedecked in tinsel where a baby Jesus or Rudolph might usually be. Deep, but disappointingly light; cat treats don\u2019t have the heft of Lindor.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>Behind the cardboard windows is a layer of what appears to be plastic that\u2019s scored to make it easier to retrieve the treats behind. Once inside, you scoop a finger, somewhat awkwardly, into a cavernous hole containing a few \u2013 five-ish \u2013 cat treats rattling around inside.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>If you\u2019re a cat, very. But as much as this is my cat\u2019s type on paper, I think these treats have been deployed as bribery to bundle him into carriers to take him to the vets on too many occasions, meaning he is deeply suspicious every time I go to open the day\u2019s window. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>There\u2019s no doubt that these treats are of a superior quality to most cat treats. The ingredients are tempting, <em>almost</em>: salmon, chicken and turkey with sweet potato and cranberries (that is until you dig deeper into their composition and read phrases like \u201chydrolysed chicken protein\u201d). But there\u2019s no getting away from that pong or the dusty texture that seems to be a feature of all cat treats. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>A 60g packet of Lily\u2019s Kitchen treats is \u00a32.50 and this 42g of treat is nearly a tenner. Call me Scrooge, but that feels like quite a high mark-up for some festive messaging that is lost on my cat, if not all cats. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The outer layer is cardboard, the film layer strikes me as a thin kind of plastic, and the inside structure holding the treats in their slots is certainly plastic. I\u2019d struggle to know whether that can go in the recycling along with the cardboard, but I\u2019ll probably err on the side of caution and put that in my regular rubbish bin for fear of voiding a whole bag of recycling. Sadly, none of it has a use I can think of beyond 25 December, although crafty types may beg to differ.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>There are baubles, a robin, holly, a drum, a tree, a crown, a cracker and something of an in-joke for felines: a fish wrapped up as a gift. Plus, lots of red, green and gold \u2013 it looks festive enough to me. My cat, however, seems unmoved. I feel pretty confident he\u2019d be just as happy with the treats without the countdown. <strong>5/10<br>Ellie Bramley</strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Spicy snacks</h2>    <p><strong>Chili Klaus Spicy </strong><strong>Xmas</strong><strong> Advent calendar</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>\u00a360<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/chili-klaus-chili-advent-calendar?srsltid=AfmBOor5lQZI4cQkigjkUHJFQGG6q65kfrUqqYVlYPvDmnD21JD6sBlp\"><sub>souschef.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>The calendar is adorned with the face of its eponymous Chili Klaus, AKA Claus Pilgaard, a Danish musician turned chilli influencer with a long-running and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1lgD9Xs3HBN-KxRnuZ4YQ\">popular YouTube channel in which Danish celebrities eat chillies</a>. </p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>I assumed there\u2019d be at least a couple of mini hot sauce bottles contained herein \u2013 but it\u2019s actually variations of a few sweet snacks: spicy chocolate, spicy liquorice, spicy sweets and even more spicy liquorice. Most windows have a little \u201cwind force\u201d heat rating, so you can share them with those with a low tolerance \u2013 but there are a few, well-labelled, heat surprises to wake you up on a cold December morning. There\u2019s also the \u201cburning Santa\u201d liquorice ball, which \u2013 and I\u2019m really not a spico-masochist \u2013 was still on the pleasant side of heat. Proper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/17/scoville-scale-chilli-peppers-heat-notes-queries\">Scoville</a>-busters may be disappointed.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>I\u2019d assumed this would \u2013 for \u00a360! \u2013 at least give me a few fun new spicy condiments to keep in the cupboard for the next few months, but instead it was all eat-on-the-day sweets treats. Which is fine, but \u00a360! <strong>2/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>All the sweets are excellent \u2013 especially the liquorice balls, a beautifully Scandi mix of sweet chocolate and salty liquorice, with differing degrees of chilli tang on the back of your tongue. However, half the fun of eating pricey Scandi sweet treats is the fancy glass jars they come in \u2013 it\u2019s not quite the same with one or two in little individual plastic bags. <strong>9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>No. Give me a <a href=\"https://en.chiliklaus.dk/collections/hot-sauces\">couple of hot sauces</a> and maybe a little <a href=\"https://en.chiliklaus.dk/collections/gourmet-spreads-ketchup-bbq-mayo-aioli-sennep/products/ketchup-chipotle-morita\">chipotle ketchup or two</a>, and then we\u2019ll talk. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The box is all cardboard, but each day\u2019s treat is individually wrapped in soft plastic which is, in theory, recyclable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/01/soft-plastic-collected-for-recycling-burned-tesco-sainsburys-campaigners#:~:text=Most%20soft%20plastic%20collected%20for%20recycling%20is%20burned%2C%20campaigners%20say,-Everyday%20Plastic%20calls&amp;text=Seventy%20per%20cent%20of%20soft,investigation%20by%20campaigners%20has%20found.\">but often burned in the UK</a>.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>It looks <em>slightly </em>more upmarket than a standard supermarket chocolate calendar and features a picture of a nice man in a Santa hat.

The first friend to catch sight of it immediately asked if she could have it when we were finished \u2013 although my daughter complained the packaging wasn\u2019t Christmassy enough for her taste. It\u2019s also pretty big (about 35 x 35cm) and, like a Lush shop, gives off quite a strong sweet smell, but if you\u2019re into Lush, you\u2019ll be into it.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>A total of 24 Lush goodies, festively themed: Father Christmas bath bombs, candy cane bubble bars, \u201cYog Nog\u201d body lotion, Merry Kissmas lip scrub, a Christmas lights soap, shower gels, a perfume. You get the idea \u2026</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>You can have a festive wash every day in the run-up to Christmas, and the contents will probably keep you going into January. <strong>9/10.</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>There\u2019s lots of fizzy fun inside with berry, spicy, cinnamon smells. And, of course, Lush opts for sustainable ingredients and has an <a href=\"https://www.lush.com/uk/en/a/our-environmental-policy\">environmental policy</a>, which is reassuring. <strong>8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>Let\u2019s face it, this is not cheap. I tried to work out whether the individual cost of the contents added up to the hefty price tag, but some of the items seem exclusive to the Advent calendar, so it\u2019s not easy to do like for like. My back-of-the-envelope sums suggest the whole package is slightly more than you\u2019d pay for the contents individually \u2013 but then again, you get the lovely reusable box. Lush is also trialling an Advent calendar refill this year, so those who bought last year\u2019s calendar can refill the box with this year\u2019s products. Presuming they\u2019ll offer the same next year, this may help justify the cost.</p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>It\u2019s all cardboard and reusable.</p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>It\u2019s very pretty even though it doesn\u2019t feel Christmassy on the outside (and the contents make up for that). <strong>5/10 </strong></p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2>Spices</h2>    <p><strong>Terre Exotique spice discovery calendar, \u00a334.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.souschef.co.uk/products/the-spice-discovery-advent-calendar\"><sub>souschef.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p><strong>First impression<br></strong>Tasteful. Grownup. Niche. French.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s in it?<br></strong>It\u2019s essentially a sampler of the global flavourings sourced by spice merchant Terre Exotique over 25 years, filled with tiny plastic sachets of salts and spices. If you\u2019re wondering what timur berry from Nepal, Breton curry or white Penja pepper from Cameroon are like, this is your fantasy tasting tray. There are QR codes for recipes behind each flap. And no chocolate.</p> <p><strong>How useful are the products</strong><strong>?<br></strong>The packets contain, at most, a scant teaspoon, so they\u2019re not keepers, but they allow adventurous cooks to test two dozen flavours. I wanted to perk up some chicken breasts and liked the Viking salt (onion, \u201csmoke flavour\u201d and turmeric) and sea salt with grilled spice. The speculoos spice blend warmed up my cherry compote, but I had no use for the foie gras mix. Incredibly \u2013 by which I mean mercifully \u2013 only one sample featured the overhyped luxury seasonal treat of truffle (21 December, the shortest, darkest day of the northern year, so it was probably meant well). Christmas Eve was a chai blend, which you may consider charmingly calming or a total buzzkill. Enjoy deciding how to store 24 miniature bags of spices with a hangover on Boxing Day. <strong>6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the quality like?<br></strong>Impossible to judge but full marks for exoticism and inspiration. It\u2019s like a pro-level version of those quick and easy midweek meal kits. <strong>7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Good value for money?<br></strong>It gives you 24 samples for the cost of buying about four whole products. </p> <p><strong>How sustainable is the packaging?<br></strong>The cardboard box and plastic tray can be recycled, but it feels like a lot of packaging. </p> <p><strong>Festive factor<br></strong>Not festive at all. The folding, ribbon-tied box is illustrated with a red-and-white design like toile de Jouy, but the image is of a woman picking leaves rather than bucolic flirting. There is no spicy Santa. <em>Quelle tentation!

So, we\u2019ve sniffed, tasted and drunk our way through 12 of them, rating them by their contents, value for money, sustainability and festive factor. And for those who want to swerve products altogether, we\u2019ve rounded up the most beautiful, feelgood paper Advent calendars we could find. Product Advent calendars 2024: the verdict *** Lebkuchen Lebkuchen-Schmidt Advent calendar, \u00a355 souschef.co.uk First impression A cheerful cardboard calendar that folds open like a book and measures a sizeable 58 x 40cm. The brightly coloured, graphic cartoons of a snowy Christmas market scene and, inside, a Christmas tree are cute, but suggest this is aimed at under-fives. What\u2019s in it? Inside are 24 individually wrapped Lebkuchen of different varieties and sizes \u2013 from cinnamon stars (tasty and moist) to classic gingerbread to, err, more cinnamon stars \u2013 with plain cardboard behind each door. How useful are the products? Not at all, but they\u2019re absolutely delicious, made in \u2013 where else? \u2013 N\u00fcrnberg in Germany, home of the Lebkuchen. It gave me a Christmassy hit every morning: like mince pies, Lebkuchen are almost entirely associated with Christmas for me. 5/10 Good value for money? You can buy two packs of six large Lebkuchen for \u00a36.99 on Amazon, so that suggests not (my favourite Lebkuchen are from Aldi, though). So, even with the extra thrills of the Advent calendar itself, it feels a little overpriced. How sustainable is the packaging? The cardboard box is entirely recyclable, but each biscuit is wrapped in a small, plastic, albeit recyclable at a supermarket, sleeve. Festive factor Extremely \u2013 if you\u2019re at primary school. Yet, my 10-year-old turned up her nose at the Lebkuchen, finding them a bit too rich and spiced, so the contents are at odds with the design. Perhaps German children just love Lebkuchen more. 9/10 Hannah Booth *** Tools Halfords Advent calendar, \u00a329.99 halfords.com First impression It\u2019s a box \u2013 like a chocolate box, but deeper \u2013 featuring an illustration of Santa handling some spare parts. What\u2019s in it? The box says \u201cincludes 40-piece socket set\u201d. In fact, that\u2019s all it includes \u2013 one 40-piece 1/4in metric socket wrench set. On 1 December you open an enormous door to find a blow-moulded plastic case in which to keep your new socket set. Day 2 brings a rather smart socket ratchet handle. Thereafter, it\u2019s mostly wrench sockets of varying sizes \u2013 9mm, 4mm, 13mm, 5.5mm. By mid-month the sense of anticipation will have pretty much worn off. How useful are the products? There is nothing in this world more useful than a 40-piece socket wrench set, excepting perhaps a 50-piece socket wrench set. I have often wondered if a decent socket collection would change my life immeasurably for the better. It looks as if this is the year I find out. 10/10 What\u2019s the quality like? It\u2019s a pretty solid piece of kit \u2013 heavy duty, with a lifetime guarantee \u2013 and nothing like the cheap tools you tend to get in Christmas crackers. I\u2019m hoping this socket set will last me the rest of my days. 10/10 Good value for money? At \u00a329.99, it\u2019s \u00a35 cheaper than Halfords\u2019 regular, non-festive 40-piece 1/4in socket set, so it would appear to be a bit of a bargain. How sustainable is the packaging? The box has a plastic inside and a cardboard outside, and is \u201cfrom responsible sources\u201d. Festive factor It looks like someone typed \u201cSanta tinkering at his workbench\u201d into ChatGPT. The spare parts on the table are unidentifiable. It\u2019s not terribly festive, but if you had a DIY emergency on Christmas Day, you would certainly find its presence reassuring, not to say provident. 7/10 Tim Dowling *** Coffee Pact coffee Advent calendar, \u00a334.95 pactcoffee.com First impression A smart, neat box with a bauble print and nicely packaged sachets of coffee stacked inside. No glitter, sparkles or sign of Santa, so this is more suitable for grownups who like the idea of a caffeinated take on Advent but don\u2019t need it to feel overtly Christmassy. What\u2019s in it? The box contains 25 single-serving sachets of \u201cbetter than Fair Trade\u201d speciality ground coffee from Pact\u2019s network of small-scale, independent farmers. Each bag is tucked inside a numbered and nicely written information card that tells you about that particular coffee, from the country of origin to the roast, acidity, mouthfeel and tasting notes. Each card also features five blank stars for you to fill in to rate each days brew, which is a nice touch. How useful are the products? The coffees are delicious, interesting and varied. The 18g portions make sense for an Advent calendar, but it does mean you need the ability to brew a single portion. I used my Aeropress, which worked well; single portions don\u2019t suit a large French press or a filter machine. And if you usually make coffee for two or more people in the morning, you can\u2019t share this Advent calendar. But really, who doesn\u2019t want a high-quality coffee every winter morning? 8/10 What\u2019s the quality like? The coffees are excellent, though best drunk black \u2013 once you add milk, you tend to lose the subtleties in flavour and aroma and they start to taste the same. Some of the brews are award-winning, and others are made in such small batches, or exclusively for Pact, that this is the only way you\u2019ll get to try this coffee. 10/10 Good value for money? Very \u2013 \u00a330 for 25 different, speciality brews? That would be impossible to replicate elsewhere. How sustainable is the packaging? The packaging (cardboard with paper tape), the box and the tasting notes are all recyclable paper or cardboard. But the sachets of coffee themselves are made from a soft plastic that you need to take to a supermarket for recycling (code 5). That\u2019s a bit of a pain. Festive factor More functional than fabulous \u2013 the bold red and green design is grownup, with a nod to the season. It looks smart enough on the kitchen counter, but it won\u2019t scratch the Christmassy itch if you\u2019re after twinkly lights, Santa or snowy scenes. 4/10 Ruth Lewy *** Fragrances and candles Sentier fragrance Advent calendar, \u00a399 sentierfragrance.com First impression I love the crisp snow-white cardboard packaging and the beautifully embossed sleeve. It doesn\u2019t feel particularly Christmassy, though, more of a luxe-lifestyle product \u2013 but I\u2019m not mad about that. What\u2019s in it? The box opens like a book to reveal 12 numbered drawers, each containing either a 60mg scented candle or a 10ml alcohol-free fragrance. I think 12 items is fair because it would be an enormous box if it were to contain 24 gifts. My favourite fragrance was M\u00e9ribel because I love patchouli and sandalwood \u2013 I was even asked what perfume I was wearing by friends. The Golden River candle had a lovely musk scent. How useful are the products? My teenage daughter and I almost always have a candle lit in the house, and we wear perfume daily, so we\u2019ve got a lot of use out of the products. We also found the compact fragrance bottles perfect for stashing in our bags. 10/10 What\u2019s the quality like? There wasn\u2019t a scent I didn\u2019t like. The candles fill a room with a pleasant smell while burning, and the fragrances lasted well throughout the day. 9/10 Good value for money? Sentier says the calendar is worth \u00a3516: it\u2019s difficult to work out if this is accurate because the brand sells its candles only in 150mg for \u00a359 and not the 60mg that comes in the calendar. But I did calculate that six of its 10ml fragrances would cost \u00a3192, so you\u2019re already getting more than your money\u2019s worth. How sustainable is the packaging? The box, sleeve and numbered boxes are all cardboard, so easily recycled or, better yet, reused. Each box is filled with a product and shredded paper, which can also be recycled. The candles are in glass jars with plastic lids, so they can be recycled or reused. And the fragrance bottles are glass with plastic and metal lids and a plastic atomiser spray, which may be harder to recycle with doorstep collection services but can be easily refilled and reused. Festive factor The minimalist packaging is aesthetically pleasing but, save for the snow-white colour and a snow-capped mountain range, it\u2019s not especially festive. That said, it would make an excellent gift for someone whose birthday falls in November. 7/10 Emily Goddard *** Wine Virgin Wines Advent calendar, \u00a389.99 virginwines.co.uk First impression Wow, this is heavy! And too big to carry long distances without the use of a sleigh. But it covers all the basics of what an Advent calendar should be: a reindeer drawing provides festive cheer, and there\u2019s 25 windows, including a bonus big one for Christmas Day. Does anyone feel more festive seeing a Virgin Wines logo slapped in the middle of it? I\u2019m guessing not. What\u2019s in it? Behind each window is a 187ml bottle of wine. We\u2019re not talking Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild here, but neither has Santa stuffed it with undrinkable plonk. Beginner wine drinkers should enjoy trying a different style each day. A QR code on the back of the box directs you to more information on each wine. How useful are the products? The Advent calendar covers red, white, ros\u00e9 and one mini fizz. Beyond a surprise (and slightly tart) Italian famoso, it\u2019s not very adventurous, sticking to mainstream grapes such as merlot, sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio. It does the job, if wine can ever be deemed \u201cuseful\u201d? 6/10 Good value for money? \u00a389.99 is a fair whack to spend on an Advent calendar, but it\u2019s not a bad price to sample a range of wines. The wines are all drinkable enough without setting the world alight \u2013 a Macon-like Aussie chardonnay and French cabernet sauvignon stood out for me in a rather so-so crowd. But the big bottle of Black Pig reserve Australian shiraz on Christmas Day is a stunner, combining fruity accessibility with a backbone of smoke, tobacco and eucalyptus. It\u2019s a great alternative to Chateauneuf-du-Pape. How sustainable is the packaging? The box is made of cardboard, so recyclable. 25 (mainly glass) bottles may seem wasteful but I reuse them to store leftover wine in the freezer for stews and risottos. Festive factor Providing a big bottle for the Christmas dinner table is a neat idea, but this is essentially a glorified box of miniature wines. 6/10 Tim Jonze *** Seeds She Grows Veg heirloom seed calendar, \u00a365 shegrowsveg.com First impression The seeds come in a small, beige sack with a green Santa boot printed on the side. It\u2019s not a calendar by any traditional use of the word, and it doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of festive decoration. It could nestle nicely underneath a Christmas tree, though, or hang from a mantelpiece. What\u2019s in it? Open the sack, and you\u2019ll find 25 individually wrapped packages, in different kinds of tissue paper. Each contains vegetable seeds, across wild and wonderful varieties, from Himalayan pink bananas to Indian purple daikon, plus some good-quality staples, such as oxheart carrots and Rudolph purple sprouting broccoli. How useful are the products? Every seed in the calendar can be planted, and most of the plants eaten, so they are, by their very nature, useful. Each seed packet has a QR code that takes you to a YouTube playlist of tips curated for the specific plant, and I found that genuinely helpful. You\u2019d need a large garden or allotment to plant them all, though, and most of the seed packets will feel a little redundant until their planting season arrives later in 2025. 9/10 Good value for money? At \u00a365, it\u2019s an awful lot of money, although looking at the price of each seed packet individually, it seems a good deal. The variety appears nicely curated rather than thrown together from the cheapest seeds on the shelf. One advantage of the sowing seasons coming later in the year is that this does seem like a present that will last throughout the seasons. How sustainable is the packaging? The fabric sack could, in theory, be reused, and most of the packaging is recyclable, aside from a few ribbons. Festive factor The Advent calendar has a lovely handmade feel to it, almost as though someone has taken the time to wrap 25 presents for you, and the quality of the wrapping is excellent. But is it festive? That depends on how you\u2019d feel to open a Christmas present of seeds. If the idea excites you, this is the calendar for you. 7/10 Monica Horridge *** Tea Whittard tea calendar, \u00a325 whittard.co.uk First impression It\u2019s reminiscent of a classic chocolate Advent calendar, except three times as thick to account for the teabags behind each door. The design is tasteful and fairly festive \u2013 not tacky, but not particularly exciting either. What\u2019s in it? The front of the calendar opens to uncover 24 doors, behind each are two individually wrapped teabags of the same flavour: good for couples. How useful are the products? I have a cup of tea every day and enjoy discovering new flavours, so I definitely got a lot out of it. 9/10 What\u2019s the quality like? They\u2019re pretty much all black teas in various flavours. Some were weaker than others \u2013 for instance, the vanilla chai wasn\u2019t strong enough for me. 7/10 Good value for money? The calendar\u2019s RRP is \u00a325, which is fairly affordable for a product Advent calendar. It\u2019s a good way to try new flavours, without splashing out on a packet of teabags that you may not like and ultimately shove to the back of the cupboard. That said, many product calendars boast that their contents are worth more than the RRP, but in this case the cost per teabag (52p) is more than if you just bought a pack of them. How sustainable is the packaging? The calendar is made of recyclable cardboard, the teabags are wrapped in a paper envelope (also recyclable), and the bags themselves are compostable. Festive factor The packaging is Christmassy in a grownup way, which some may see as tasteful and others might find slightly boring. 5/10 Lily Smith *** Beer Woodforde\u2019s beer calendar, \u00a365 woodfordes.com First impression It\u2019s chunky, as you\u2019d expect, given the contents. But it\u2019s not the most enticing object and aesthetics seem a low priority here: it\u2019s a box of beers after all. What\u2019s in it? A selection of ales, lagers, ciders and stouts from Norfolk\u2019s Woodforde\u2019s brewery. Each day offers up a 500ml bottle or 440ml can, accessed from above via circular flaps. Accessing them is a challenge: the holes are barely bigger than the cans and bottles inside, and they are quite sharp! How useful are the products? It depends on how happy you are to drink a beer every day for 24 consecutive days: mine started piling up after a while. Still, it may be a useful calendar for anyone looking to stockpile for Christmas or New Year parties. Woodforde\u2019s is a respected Camra-friendly brewery, with an emphasis on hoppy old-school IPAs and bitters, and it\u2019s clearly very good at what it does. There\u2019s only occasional repetition \u2013 and the presence of ciders alongside the beers certainly adds to the sense of variety, as do the limited-edition seasonal beers like the Tinsel Toes Christmas ale. 6/10 Good value for money? At \u00a32.70 a can/bottle, it seems reasonable, if not spectacular, value. Pleasingly, you get a decent amount of liquid for your buck: there are none of the stubby cans favoured by many craft breweries. How sustainable is the packaging? Very: the calendar itself is cardboard, with no extra packaging beyond the outer shell, and the products are either cans or glass bottles. No plastic in sight. Festive factor A half-hearted attempt, with illustrations of fairy lights, candy canes and the like \u2013 but not the sort of thing you\u2019d want to show off to the neighbours. I found the beers a little too on the hoppy side for my tastes, but I\u2019d happily buy the calendarfor a real ale-enjoying family member. 7/10 Gwilym Mumford *** Cat treats Lily\u2019s Kitchen cat treat calendar, \u00a39.99 lilyskitchen.co.uk First impression It\u2019s a fairly standard Advent calendar, but with cartoon pictures of cats bedecked in tinsel where a baby Jesus or Rudolph might usually be. Deep, but disappointingly light; cat treats don\u2019t have the heft of Lindor. What\u2019s in it? Behind the cardboard windows is a layer of what appears to be plastic that\u2019s scored to make it easier to retrieve the treats behind. Once inside, you scoop a finger, somewhat awkwardly, into a cavernous hole containing a few \u2013 five-ish \u2013 cat treats rattling around inside. How useful are the products? If you\u2019re a cat, very. But as much as this is my cat\u2019s type on paper, I think these treats have been deployed as bribery to bundle him into carriers to take him to the vets on too many occasions, meaning he is deeply suspicious every time I go to open the day\u2019s window. 6/10 What\u2019s the quality like? There\u2019s no doubt that these treats are of a superior quality to most cat treats. The ingredients are tempting, almost: salmon, chicken and turkey with sweet potato and cranberries (that is until you dig deeper into their composition and read phrases like \u201chydrolysed chicken protein\u201d). But there\u2019s no getting away from that pong or the dusty texture that seems to be a feature of all cat treats. 8/10 Good value for money? A 60g packet of Lily\u2019s Kitchen treats is \u00a32.50 and this 42g of treat is nearly a tenner. Call me Scrooge, but that feels like quite a high mark-up for some festive messaging that is lost on my cat, if not all cats. How sustainable is the packaging? The outer layer is cardboard, the film layer strikes me as a thin kind of plastic, and the inside structure holding the treats in their slots is certainly plastic. I\u2019d struggle to know whether that can go in the recycling along with the cardboard, but I\u2019ll probably err on the side of caution and put that in my regular rubbish bin for fear of voiding a whole bag of recycling. Sadly, none of it has a use I can think of beyond 25 December, although crafty types may beg to differ. Festive factor There are baubles, a robin, holly, a drum, a tree, a crown, a cracker and something of an in-joke for felines: a fish wrapped up as a gift. Plus, lots of red, green and gold \u2013 it looks festive enough to me. My cat, however, seems unmoved. I feel pretty confident he\u2019d be just as happy with the treats without the countdown. 5/10 Ellie Bramley *** Spicy snacks Chili Klaus Spicy Xmas Advent calendar, \u00a360 souschef.co.uk First impression The calendar is adorned with the face of its eponymous Chili Klaus, AKA Claus Pilgaard, a Danish musician turned chilli influencer with a long-running and popular YouTube channel in which Danish celebrities eat chillies. What\u2019s in it? I assumed there\u2019d be at least a couple of mini hot sauce bottles contained herein \u2013 but it\u2019s actually variations of a few sweet snacks: spicy chocolate, spicy liquorice, spicy sweets and even more spicy liquorice. Most windows have a little \u201cwind force\u201d heat rating, so you can share them with those with a low tolerance \u2013 but there are a few, well-labelled, heat surprises to wake you up on a cold December morning. There\u2019s also the \u201cburning Santa\u201d liquorice ball, which \u2013 and I\u2019m really not a spico-masochist \u2013 was still on the pleasant side of heat. Proper Scoville-busters may be disappointed. How useful are the products? I\u2019d assumed this would \u2013 for \u00a360! \u2013 at least give me a few fun new spicy condiments to keep in the cupboard for the next few months, but instead it was all eat-on-the-day sweets treats. Which is fine, but \u00a360! 2/10 What\u2019s the quality like? All the sweets are excellent \u2013 especially the liquorice balls, a beautifully Scandi mix of sweet chocolate and salty liquorice, with differing degrees of chilli tang on the back of your tongue. However, half the fun of eating pricey Scandi sweet treats is the fancy glass jars they come in \u2013 it\u2019s not quite the same with one or two in little individual plastic bags. 9/10 Good value for money? No. Give me a couple of hot sauces and maybe a little chipotle ketchup or two, and then we\u2019ll talk. How sustainable is the packaging? The box is all cardboard, but each day\u2019s treat is individually wrapped in soft plastic which is, in theory, recyclable but often burned in the UK. Festive factor It looks slightly more upmarket than a standard supermarket chocolate calendar and features a picture of a nice man in a Santa hat. It\u2019s festive enough, but it\u2019s not exactly Bjarke Ingels in terms of Danish design cool. Sorry, Klaus! 3/10 Will Dean *** Smellies Lush Advent calendar, \u00a3190 lush.com First impression This is a big beautiful box, designed to be repurposed when the festive season is behind you. The first friend to catch sight of it immediately asked if she could have it when we were finished \u2013 although my daughter complained the packaging wasn\u2019t Christmassy enough for her taste. It\u2019s also pretty big (about 35 x 35cm) and, like a Lush shop, gives off quite a strong sweet smell, but if you\u2019re into Lush, you\u2019ll be into it. What\u2019s in it? A total of 24 Lush goodies, festively themed: Father Christmas bath bombs, candy cane bubble bars, \u201cYog Nog\u201d body lotion, Merry Kissmas lip scrub, a Christmas lights soap, shower gels, a perfume. You get the idea \u2026 How useful are the products? You can have a festive wash every day in the run-up to Christmas, and the contents will probably keep you going into January. 9/10. What\u2019s the quality like? There\u2019s lots of fizzy fun inside with berry, spicy, cinnamon smells. And, of course, Lush opts for sustainable ingredients and has an environmental policy, which is reassuring. 8/10 Good value for money? Let\u2019s face it, this is not cheap. I tried to work out whether the individual cost of the contents added up to the hefty price tag, but some of the items seem exclusive to the Advent calendar, so it\u2019s not easy to do like for like. My back-of-the-envelope sums suggest the whole package is slightly more than you\u2019d pay for the contents individually \u2013 but then again, you get the lovely reusable box. Lush is also trialling an Advent calendar refill this year, so those who bought last year\u2019s calendar can refill the box with this year\u2019s products. Presuming they\u2019ll offer the same next year, this may help justify the cost. How sustainable is the packaging? It\u2019s all cardboard and reusable. Festive factor It\u2019s very pretty even though it doesn\u2019t feel Christmassy on the outside (and the contents make up for that). 5/10 *** Spices Terre Exotique spice discovery calendar, \u00a334.99 souschef.co.uk First impression Tasteful. Grownup. Niche. French. What\u2019s in it? It\u2019s essentially a sampler of the global flavourings sourced by spice merchant Terre Exotique over 25 years, filled with tiny plastic sachets of salts and spices. If you\u2019re wondering what timur berry from Nepal, Breton curry or white Penja pepper from Cameroon are like, this is your fantasy tasting tray. There are QR codes for recipes behind each flap. And no chocolate. How useful are the products? The packets contain, at most, a scant teaspoon, so they\u2019re not keepers, but they allow adventurous cooks to test two dozen flavours. I wanted to perk up some chicken breasts and liked the Viking salt (onion, \u201csmoke flavour\u201d and turmeric) and sea salt with grilled spice. The speculoos spice blend warmed up my cherry compote, but I had no use for the foie gras mix. Incredibly \u2013 by which I mean mercifully \u2013 only one sample featured the overhyped luxury seasonal treat of truffle (21 December, the shortest, darkest day of the northern year, so it was probably meant well). Christmas Eve was a chai blend, which you may consider charmingly calming or a total buzzkill. Enjoy deciding how to store 24 miniature bags of spices with a hangover on Boxing Day. 6/10 What\u2019s the quality like? Impossible to judge but full marks for exoticism and inspiration. It\u2019s like a pro-level version of those quick and easy midweek meal kits. 7/10 Good value for money? It gives you 24 samples for the cost of buying about four whole products. How sustainable is the packaging? The cardboard box and plastic tray can be recycled, but it feels like a lot of packaging. Festive factor Not festive at all. The folding, ribbon-tied box is illustrated with a red-and-white design like toile de Jouy, but the image is of a woman picking leaves rather than bucolic flirting. There is no spicy Santa. Quelle tentation! Quelle d\u00e9ception! 0/10 Tim Lusher *** The best picture Advent calendars in 2024 *** Best for book lovers Oxfam bookshelf Advent calendar, \u00a33.99 onlineshop.oxfam.org.uk This adorable picture calendar has a brain teaser behind each door, and all profits go to Oxfam. *** Best for gardeners Kew Gardens Advent calendar, \u00a34 shop.kew.org Kew\u2019s offering features a festive image of the gardens with a traditional Christmas image behind each door.

The pro-western opposition on Thursday repeated its earlier assertions that the parliamentary vote had been \u201cstolen\u201d by the ruling Georgian Dream party and it refused to recognise the results, plunging the Caucasus country into uncertainty. The pro-European president, Salome Zourabichvili, who is at loggerheads with the governing party, has declared the election results \u201cillegitimate\u201d, alleging there was a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d to undermine the vote, which the Kremlin has denied. The opposition has called for further protests next week. On Monday tens of thousands of people thronged the streets in Tbilisi to protest against the alleged fraud. The central election commission told Agence France-Presse on Thursday that a recount at about 12% of polling stations, involving 14% of the vote, \u201cdidn\u2019t lead to a significant change to previously announced official results\u201d. \u201cFinal tallies only slightly changed at some 9% of recounted polling stations,\u201d a spokesperson said.

A group of Georgia\u2019s leading election monitors said earlier that they had uncovered evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud that had swayed results in favour of the ruling party. Before the elections, Brussels cautioned that they would be a crucial test for Tbilisi\u2019s fledgling democracy and would determine its chances of joining the bloc. The European Commission said in a report published on Wednesday it could not recommend opening membership talks \u201cunless Georgia reverts the current course of action which jeopardises its EU path\u201d. Critics of the increasingly conservative Georgian Dream party accuse it of derailing efforts to join the EU and of bringing the former Soviet country back into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit.

Even the trees can die because they have been under water for 36 hours ... With the heat, the humidity, the fungus will attack them too,\u201d he told the Reuters news agency by phone from his farm in the Alzira area.</p> \n  <p>Valencia as a whole accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus fruit production in Spain - the world\u2019s top exporter of oranges. Persimmon, a soft, orange-coloured fruit is another major regional crop, along with avocados, almonds and grapes for wine-making.</p> \n  <p>The floods, which have killed at least 155 people and caused massive damage to infrastructure, have affected thousands of hectares of farmland, agricultural groups and farmers said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are facing a catastrophe ... the losses will be in the millions of euros,\u201d said Ricardo Bayo, secretary of the Union of Small Producers (UPA) in Valencia.</p> \n  <p>Another farming group, the Valencia Farmers\u2019 Association, said orange, persimmon and mandarin crops were among those that would be lost.</p> \n  <p>In the rice-growing area of Albufera, fields were totally sumerged, with only a few farm buildings and trees visible above the water, Reuters pictures showed.</p> \n  <p>Ferrer said he was relieved he had insurance to cover his losses.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe insurance (payout) usually arrives quite quickly but with this scale we\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>But while citrus crops are generally insured in the region, the proportion of vineyards and nut crops with insurance is low, Bayo said.</p> \n  <p>The floods also washed away machinery, irrigation systems and roads, said Manuel Alcaide, spokesman for farmers\u2019 association COAG, who said it was too early to calculate losses.</p> \n  <p>Livestock was also killed as the floodwaters swept in.

The video below shows the moment a woman and a dog were rescued from a property in Valencia If you\u2019re just joining our coverage this afternoon, here\u2019s a brief look at developments in Spain today. Tap the link in each bullet point to take a look back at previous posts The number of people killed by yesterday\u2019s flash floods in eastern Spain now stands at 155, with the toll expected to rise as the search continues. One minister said bodies were likely to have been trapped in cars Rescue workers, residents and the military have been working at pace in a bid to find survivors and to clean-up after yesterday\u2019s floods. There are no confirmed numbers of those missing Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez urged people to stay at home during a visit to flood-hit Valencia and has said they will search for as long as it takes to find any survivors More rain is forecast, with parts of Valencia notably subject to an AEMET yellow weather warning for more rain on Thursday As well as the damage caused to roads, businesses and neighbourhoods, farms in Valencia have also borne the brunt of the flash floods. Fruit farmer Bernardo Ferrer says everything has been lost - his trees caked in thick silt that will make harvesting impossible. \u201cNow the fruit is going to rot. Even the trees can die because they have been under water for 36 hours ... With the heat, the humidity, the fungus will attack them too,\u201d he told the Reuters news agency by phone from his farm in the Alzira area. Valencia as a whole accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus fruit production in Spain - the world\u2019s top exporter of oranges. Persimmon, a soft, orange-coloured fruit is another major regional crop, along with avocados, almonds and grapes for wine-making. The floods, which have killed at least 155 people and caused massive damage to infrastructure, have affected thousands of hectares of farmland, agricultural groups and farmers said. \u201cWe are facing a catastrophe ... the losses will be in the millions of euros,\u201d said Ricardo Bayo, secretary of the Union of Small Producers (UPA) in Valencia. Another farming group, the Valencia Farmers\u2019 Association, said orange, persimmon and mandarin crops were among those that would be lost. In the rice-growing area of Albufera, fields were totally sumerged, with only a few farm buildings and trees visible above the water, Reuters pictures showed. Ferrer said he was relieved he had insurance to cover his losses. \u201cThe insurance (payout) usually arrives quite quickly but with this scale we\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said. But while citrus crops are generally insured in the region, the proportion of vineyards and nut crops with insurance is low, Bayo said. The floods also washed away machinery, irrigation systems and roads, said Manuel Alcaide, spokesman for farmers\u2019 association COAG, who said it was too early to calculate losses. Livestock was also killed as the floodwaters swept in. In Utiel, one of the worst-affected towns in Valencia, Javier Iranzo and Ana Carmen Fernandez said the flooding had completely wrecked their pig farm, with 50 of their animals having drowned Global heating made the heavy rainfall that lashed Spain this week about 12% heavier and twice as likely, an initial estimate from climate scientists has found. The early-stage analysis, carried out by scientists from the World Weather Attribution, said climate change was \u201cthe most likely explanation\u201d for the unusual strength of the downpour. The group pointed to historical weather observations that showed one-day bursts of rain in the region have increased as fossil fuel pollution has heated the planet. They also highlighted a physical relationship that shows hotter air can hold more moisture - about 7% for every 1C that temperatures rise. \u201cWe are loading the dice of extreme weather in the worst way possible,\u201d said Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London. To properly quantify the influence of global heating, the group would have to use models to project the probability of such heavy rainfall hitting in a hypothetical climate without human activity. Their estimate comes as a separate analysis from Climate Central finds climate change made the hot sea surface temperatures that fuelled the downpour at least 50 to 300 times more likely. These new images in from Valencia this afternoon are just a snapshot of the impact on homes and streets caused by the flash flooding \u2013 with more rain forecast on Thursday. The pictures show scenes of ruin and destruction, with homes damaged and cars piled up and strewn across roads in the area The number now killed in yesterday\u2019s flash floods in Valencia stands at 155, according to regional authorities. This is an increase on the 140 confirmed earlier today and a jump on the 95 confirmed just yesterday. As we reported earlier, the Spanish government has pledged to continue the search for survivors \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d. The Spanish top flight football game between Valencia and Real Madrid scheduled for this weekend has been called off in light of these week\u2019s multiple tragedies. The match was due to take place at Valencia\u2019s Mestalla stadium on Saturday evening. In a statement released by Real Madrid this afternoon, it said: \u201cDue to the natural catastrophe that has occurred in the Comunidad Valenciana as a result of a hurricane, having decreed three days of official mourning with the suspension of sporting competitions in the cited autonomous region, a request for a postponement has been received from the LIGA F, after speaking with all the clubs involved. \u201cIn the light of the circumstances of force majeure arising from the events referred to above, it is necessary to postpone the matches scheduled to take place.\u201d Other La Liga and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n matches due to be played this weekend in the Valencia region have also been postponed - Villarreal-Rayo Vallecano, Castell\u00f3n-Racing de Ferrol, Eldense-Huesca and Levante-M\u00e1laga. Sam Jones Madrid correspondent In the small Valencian town of Utiel, where six people died in the floods, residents were trying to come to terms with what had happened as they carted bucketloads of sodden possessions from their homes and tried to sweep out the mud. Around them, personnel from the army\u2019s military emergencies unit supervised the clean-up and the pumps, aided by Guardia Civil officers, firefighters and civil protection units. In the worst affected part of the town, where the river Magro had burst its banks and sent floodwaters surging into people\u2019s houses, the mud was still calf-deep in places and the streets littered with wrecked cars and other detritus. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you want happened here,\u201d said one local resident, Carmen Aleixandre. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the words to describe it.\u201d Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, said the town was at the end of its tether and desperately needed help from the regional and national governments. \u201cSix people died and we\u2019re mourning them, but hundred of people could have died here,\u201d he said. In some parts of the town, the floodwaters reached a height of three metres, trapping some people in their homes and leading to the deaths of the victims, who were older people or those with mobility issues. The mayor said water and shelter were still major problems for many in the town, adding that some people were now homeless. \u201cThere\u2019s no power in some places and we\u2019re having to restrict water,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hundreds of people who\u2019ve lost everything - their houses and their businesses.\u201d The death toll as a result of the flash floods in eastern Spain has risen from 95 to 140, according to state-run news agency EFE. Images from the US Landsat-8 satellite from 8 and 30 October vividly illustrate the scale of the disaster, showing the dramatic transformation of the landscape: We would like to hear from people in Spain about the impact of the flooding.

The top picture \u2013 captured by the NASA/USGS Landsat 8 Earth observation satellite \u2013 above the white line shows Valencia on October 13. The lower image, below the white line, is the same city on October 30 after the rain caused flash floods. Our video team have produced this, showing shocking footage of a bridge being washed away in Valencia. Agence France-Presse have a dispatch from Paiporta, a suburb of Valencia city at the epicentre of the damage, where 27-year-old musician David Romero lamented a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. \u201cNeighbourhood after neighbourhood, street after street, there is not a business standing,\u201d he told AFP. Romero said the warnings in Paiporta only arrived when the local river was already overflowing and catching people off guard in the streets, a complaint echoed by 21-year-old Joaquin Rigon. \u201cNobody warned of anything... they took out the owner of the bar here dead, drowned, chaos,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re just joining our coverage today here\u2019s a brief round-up of the situation in Spain. Stay with us while we keep you updated The number of people killed by yesterday\u2019s flash floods in eastern Spain stands at 95, with the toll expected to rise as the search continues Rescue workers, residents and the military have been working at pace in a bid to find survivors and to clean-up after yesterday\u2019s floods. There are no confirmed numbers of those missing Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez has urged people to stay at home and has said they will search for as long as it takes to find any survivors More rain is forecast, with parts of Valencia notably, subject to an AEMET yellow weather warning for more rain on Thursday These pictures \u2013 just coming into us now \u2013 show the extent of the clean-up operation taking place in Valencia and north and eastern parts of Spain hit by yesterday\u2019s deadly floods. Streets are caked in mud, cars are stranded and homes have been severely damaged by yesterday\u2019s torrential rainfall. The flags at the European Commission have been flown at half mast today. EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen has offered Spain support in the wake of yesterday\u2019s flooding As we reported earlier, Pedro S\u00e1nchez has arrived in Valencia and has been speaking to the media. \u201cThe priority right now is to find those who are missing in order to alleviate the anguish that families are suffering,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe will support the search by land, sea and air for as long as it takes to find all of the missing people.\u201d \u201cPlease, the storm continues, please stay at home. Please heed all calls from the emergency services, their needs, their recommendations. \u201cThe most important thing is to save as many lives as possible. The AEMET is issuing alerts, I ask that these recommendations be heeded.\u201d More now on the impact of the floods on communities in regions in and around Valencia. \u201cUnfortunately, there are dead people inside some vehicles,\u201d said Spain\u2019s transport minister \u00d3scar Puente in reference to hundreds of cars and trucks stranded on roads stained brown with mud. The aftermath of the floods looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Cars piled on one another like broken toys, uprooted trees, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Barrio de la Torre, just one of dozens of damaged localities in the hard-hit region, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. It knocked down bridges and made roads unrecognisable. \u201cThe neighbourhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it\u2019s literally smashed up,\u201d said Christian Viena, a bar owner in Barrio de la Torre. Ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Why were yesterday\u2019s floods in Spain so bad? Ninety-five people are dead, an unknown number of people remain missing, while thousands of others are without electricity or phone service. The intense rain was attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fr\u00eda, or \u201ccold drop\u201d, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This creates atmospheric instability as the warm, moist air rising rapidly to form towering, dense clouds capable of dumping heavy rain. See below for a visual guide to yesterday\u2019s devastating events Let\u2019s return now to the rescue efforts currently ongoing in north and eastern Spain. More than one thousand soldiers from Spain\u2019s emergency rescue units joined regional and local emergency workers in the search for survivors. Spain\u2019s defence minister said that soldiers alone had recovered 22 bodies and rescued 110 people by Wednesday night. \u201cWe are searching house by house,\u201d \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez, official of a military emergency unit, told Spain\u2019s national radio broadcaster RNE on Thursday from the town of Utiel, where at least six people died. As we reported earlier, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction first-hand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. In the rural town of Utiel, some 85 km from the city of Valencia, the Magro river burst its banks, sending up to three metres of water into homes, reports the Reuters news agency. Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabaldon said at least six people had died in the town of about 12,000, most of them elderly or disabled people who were unable to clamber to safety. Early on Thursday, residents used water pumps carried on tractors as they started the clean-up, with children helping to sweep the sidewalks. \u201cThe sorrow is for the people who have died,\u201d said Encarna, a 60-year-old teacher in the town, wiping away tears as she spoke in a flood-ravaged street near her damaged home. \u201cThese are my savings, my effort, my life. But we are alive.\u201d The floods have also wrecked crops and killed livestock. Utiel residents Javier Iranzo, 47, and Ana Carmen Fernandez, 48, told Reuters the flooding had completely wrecked their pig farm, with 50 of their animals having drowned. They estimated hundreds of thousands of euros worth of damages and, despite government pledges of help, said they worried about whether they would receive state aid to help rebuild. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez is due to make a visit to Valencia later today \u2013 we\u2019ll keep you updated when that happens. He has thanked EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen and UN general secretary Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for their support. Here\u2019s a reminder of what he had to say after the floods hit: Rescuers today face the painstaking process of searching stranded cars for any survivors of yesterday\u2019s flash floods, with these pictures of a motorway in Valencia showing the aftermath of the torrential rain. Spain\u2019s transport minister has said bodies of dead are still likely to be trapped in vehicles. Pictures coming in from Valencia show relatively calm conditions as the clean-up and search for survivors continues. But as we touched on in our post at 9.17GMT, a weather warning has been issued for part of the region already devastated by yesterday\u2019s tragedy. The AEMET state weather agency issued its highest level of alert for the province of Castellon. Further north in the Catalonia region, an amber alert was issued for the city of Tarragona. Meteorologists said a year\u2019s worth of rain had fallen in eight hours in parts of Valencia on Tuesday. The storm that caused the torrential downpours has since moved in a northeasterly direction. \u201cThere are already very strong storms in the area, especially in the north of Castellon,\u201d AEMET posted on its X account. \u201cThe adverse weather continues! Beware!\u201d it added, saying people should not travel to the area. Local authorities have not disclosed how many people are still unaccounted for after Europe\u2019s deadliest floods in years, but Defence Minister Margarita Robles said late on Wednesday the death toll was likely to rise. How have you been affected? If you have been impacted by the flooding The Guardian\u2019s community team would like to hear from you. We\u2019re also interested in hearing from those helping with rescue efforts. Get in touch below More heavy rain is predicted for the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region and other areas on the north-east coast today. National weather agency AEMET launched a red alert for Valencia region on Tuesday morning and conditions deteriorated throughout the day. But it was only in the early evening that the regional body in charge of coordinating the emergency services was set up. And an alert sent by the civil protection service urging residents in the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia not to leave home was issued after 8pm. For many, it was already too late. Motorists began journeys only to find themselves trapped on roads and left at the mercy of raging torrents of water. \u201cThey raised the alarm when the water was already here, there\u2019s no need to tell me the flood is coming,\u201d fumed Julian Ormeno, a 66-year-old pensioner in the Valencia city suburb of Sedavi. \u201cNobody came to take responsibility,\u201d he told AFP. With weather forecasters issuing warnings beforehand, such tragedies are \u201centirely avoidable\u201d if people can be kept away from surging flood water, said Hannah Cloke, hydrology professor at the University of Reading. The devastating outcome suggests Valencia\u2019s warning system failed, she said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to do when faced with a flood, or when they hear warnings.\u201d \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be dying from these kinds of forecasted weather events in countries where they have the resources to do better,\u201d added Liz Stephens, a professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading. \u201cWe have a long way to go to prepare for this kind of event, and worse, in future.\u201d You can read the full story below Experts have been giving their reaction to yesterday\u2019s disaster - sounding a warning about our preparedness and ability to cope. Extreme weather events are becoming more intense, are lasting longer and are occurring more frequently as a result of human-induced climate change, scientists say. \u201cOur infrastructure is not designed to deal with these levels of flooding,\u201d Hayley Fowler, professor of climate change impacts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University. She added \u201crecord-shatteringly hot\u201d warmer sea temperatures fuel storms that dump extreme levels of rain in one place. Such extreme weather \u201ccan overwhelm the ability of existing defences and contingency plans to cope, even in a relatively wealthy country like Spain\u201d, said Leslie Mabon, senior lecturer in environmental systems at Britain\u2019s Open University. \u201cThe floods in Spain are a timely reminder that no country is exempt from the risks of climate change.\u201d For Linda Speight, a lecturer at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford, warnings for intense thunderstorms are \u201cincredibly hard to issue\u201d as the exact location of the heaviest rainfall is usually unknown in advance. \u201cWe urgently need to adapt our cities to be more resilient to floods,\u201d she added, suggesting making space for water to flow through urban environments without causing damage. \u201cWe take preparation for other hazards such as earthquakes and tsunami very seriously,\u201d added Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology, at the University of Reading. \u201cIt is time we afforded the same to flood risk preparedness.\u201d As we\u2019ve been reporting this morning, there are ongoing efforts to find survivors. However, Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page, the president of the Castilla La-Mancha communitieas, has said part of the hard-hit village of Letur remains inaccessible to crews. The region said yesterday two people had died. Five residents of Letur remained missing. \u201cIn Letur, specifically, it still hasn\u2019t been possible to access part of the village,\u201d Garc\u00eda-Page told reporters. \u201cThe prognosis is pessimistic, but until we find people and confirm things, we will cling to hope.\u201d Residents of Chiva, a small town on the outskirts of Valencia, can expect a grim future of worsening drought as the planet heats up and the country dries out. But on Tuesday, they also witnessed a year\u2019s worth of rainfall in a matter of hours. The torrential rains that flooded southern and eastern Spain on Tuesday night, ripping away bridges and tearing through towns, have killed scores of people. Fossil fuel pollution plays a role in warping both extremes of the water cycle: heat evaporates water, leaving people and plants parched, but hot air can hold more moisture, increasing the potential for catastrophic downpours. \u201cDroughts and floods are the two sides of the same climate change coin,\u201d said Stefano Materia, an Italian climate scientist at Barcelona Supercomputing Centre. He said studies had linked droughts in the Mediterranean with the climate emergency through changes in atmospheric circulation at the same time that global temperature rise had severely heated the region. Read on here: Authorities have confirmed a mother and baby were among the victims swept away in yesterday\u2019s floods in the Valencia suburbs. Around 40 people were confirmed to have died in Paiporta alone. Tens of thousands of homes across the area are still without electricity and drinking water and many roads were blocked by hundreds of cars and trucks swept away in sudden torrents. Emergency services carried out 200 rescues on the ground and 70 aerial evacuations on Wednesday, said Valencia regional government chief Carlos Mazon. This week\u2019s floods were Spain\u2019s worst since 1996, when 87 people died after torrential rain hit a campsite in the Pyrenees mountains. Europe\u2019s most recent deadly floods came in July 2021, killing 243 people in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Italy and Austria. The intense rain has been attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fr\u00eda, or \u201ccold drop\u201d, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean. This creates atmospheric instability, causing warm, saturated air to rise rapidly, leading to heavy rain and thunderstorms. Experts say the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. Here are some of the latest images from affected areas in Spain: The gratitude that greeted Tuesday\u2019s dawn downpours was short-lived in Utiel. When the longed-for rains finally reached the town in the drought-stricken eastern Spanish region of Valencia, they were merciless in their abundance. \u201cPeople were very happy at first because they\u2019d been praying for rain as their lands needed water,\u201d said Remedios, who owns a bar in Utiel. \u201cBut by 12 o\u2019clock, this storm had really hit and we were all pretty terrified.\u201d Trapped in the bar, she and a handful of her customers could only sit and watch as Spain\u2019s worst flooding in almost 30 years caused the Magro River to overflow its banks, trapping some residents in their homes and sending cars and rubbish bins surging through the streets on muddy flood waters. \u201cThe rising waters brought mud and stones with them and they were so strong that they broke the surface of the road,\u201d said Remedios, who gave only her first name. \u201cThe tunnel that leads into the town was half-full of mud, trees were down and there were cars and rubbish containers rolling down the streets. My outside terrace has been destroyed \u2013 the chairs and shades were all swept away. It\u2019s just a disaster.\u201d By Wednesday afternoon, the death toll in Valencia and the neighbouring regions of Castilla-La Mancha and Andaluc\u00eda stood at 95 . Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, told Las Provincias newspaper that some of the town\u2019s residents had not survived the floods, but was unable to provide an exact number. Hours earlier, Gabald\u00f3n had told Spain\u2019s national broadcaster, RTVE, that Tuesday had been the worst day of his life. \u201cWe were trapped like rats,\u201d he said. \u201cCars and rubbish containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to 3 metres.\u201d Rescue personnel and more than 1,100 soldiers from Spain\u2019s emergency response units have been deployed to affected areas. Spain\u2019s central government has also set up a crisis committee to coordinate rescue efforts. As the search for missing people continues, motorists are urged to stay off the roads and away from swollen rivers amid warnings that the severe weather was not over and that the number of deaths could still rise. Rescue workers in Spain continued to search for more victims after deadly floods, as questions were raised about how one of the world\u2019s most developed nations failed to respond adequately to an extreme storm. Torrential rains that began at the start of the week sparked flooding that has left at least 95 people dead, the deadliest such disaster in the western European country since 1973. Defence minister Margarita Robles told Cadena Ser radio station that a military unit specialised in rescue operations would on Thursday start combing through the mud and debris with sniffer dogs in the worst-hit areas. Asked if the number of victims was likely to increase, she said: \u201cUnfortunately we are not optimistic\u201d. The teams have brought with them 50 mobile morgues. More heavy rain was predicted for the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region and other areas on the north-east coast on today.",

      "body": "<p>Have you ever felt more stylish than when popping out for a pint of semi-skimmed milk? No? Well, that is surprising \u2013 because supermarkets and their produce are one of fashion\u2019s greatest muses. This week, Moschino launched its Sedano bag \u2013 a celery-shaped clutch that first appeared on catwalks earlier in the year. In response, the UK supermarket, Aldi touted its 75p celery sticks as a cheaper alternative to the $4,470 (\u00a33,730) leather purse, posting a photo on Facebook with the caption: \u201cYour move Moschino, but we do have a whole veg aisle.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, artist and designer <a href=\"https://nikbentel.com/projects/kdx71030\">Nikolas Bentel\u2019s \u00a350 croissant bag</a>, inspired by Lidl\u2019s all-butter pastry, sold out. Leather, with a coin purse (and a Lidl-branded trolley coin in the zipper), the paper-bag-style handbag featured a roll-top \u2013 as if freshly scrunched en route to the checkout. Last year, JW Anderson, whose designs are a favourite on red carpets, sent a model down the catwalk in a dress seemingly made of Tesco carrier bags. In fact, T-shirts riffing on the Tesco logo, on which the supermarket\u2019s name is replaced with the word \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bigdogtees.co.uk/product/disco-tesco-t-shirts/\">Disco</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://nomadwindsor.co.uk/product/tesco-techno-t-shirt/\">Techno</a>\u201d, seem to hold timeless appeal.</p> <p>Supermarket staples and fast-moving consumer goods are also often used as inspiration. Bentel previously <a href=\"https://www.nikolasbentelstudio.com/projects/the-pasta-bag-2\">designed a penne pasta bag</a> seemingly inspired by Italian brand De Cecco\u2019s yellow and blue packaging, which is usually found on grocery store shelves between the own-brand macaroni and the Napolina fusilli. Anya Hindmarch has tapped the cereal aisle with an <a href=\"https://www.anyahindmarch.com/products/anya-brands-mini-tote-frosties-in-sequins-blueberry?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsoe5BhDiARIsAOXVoUvd5H4RlqIrpq7UHbZgUmNvQQB1ASLHghpiILYOVuniU6qPpUIqdDEaAv7rEALw_wcB\">embellished Frosties bag</a>, as well as the biscuit section via <a href=\"https://www.anyahindmarch.com/products/anya-brands-tassel-clutch-milk-chocolate-digestives-in-hazelnut-embellished-recycled-satin?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjNS3BhChARIsAOxBM6rabyNFj7oIh9O2wowNGL-Kr6CseHINHn27hyoWRhwQKrjGpC7AO1UaAhUQEALw_wcB\">McVitie\u2019s Digestives</a> and Rich Tea clutches, all on sale for roughly \u00a31,300 more than the food that inspired them. At its most recent show, Moschino, a brand that often toys with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/13/moschino-glorifying-mcdonalds-logo-fashion\">iconography of pop culture food brands</a> \u2013 perhaps most notably the golden arches of McDonald\u2019s \u2013 sent a model down the catwalk clutching a bag resembling a bottle of laundry detergent. Paper grocery bags have been appropriated by everyone <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-paper-bag-that-jil-sander-is-selling-for-290-2012-8\">from Jil Sander</a> to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C0cGVdgOhgj/?hl=en&amp;img_index=5\">Bottega Veneta</a>.</p>    <p>So what is behind fashion\u2019s obsession with Tesco et al? Are these seemingly incongruous designs made to go viral? Or do they seek to poke fun at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2017/nov/01/ten-items-or-fewer-why-no-longer-doing-big-shop-supermarket\">mundanity of the \u201cbig shop\u201d</a>? \u201cSupermarkets are visually appealing with stocked shelves, colourful packaging and endless offerings to satisfy our tastes,\u201d says Melissa Marra-Alvarez, curator of education and research at the Museum at FIT in New York City, and co-editor of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/food-and-fashion-9781350164345/\">Food and Fashion</a>. \u201cThere is a lot of material here \u2013 literal, figural, psychological \u2013 for designers to have some fun and get creative with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSupermarket fashion allows for a very literal presentation of our \u2018tastes\u2019 \u2026 Food and fashion are both very connected to our personal identity,\u201d she adds. Much like our wardrobes, our shopping lists can be seen to convey who we are, what we stand for and how we want others to view us. Wearing these kind of designs could be seen as an attempt to signal a sort of salt of the earth mentality, despite being able to afford to spend a grand on a bag with Tony the Tiger on it.<strong> </strong>Dr Gaby Harris, lecturer in fashion cultures at Manchester Metropolitan University, says: \u201cWe can see this as a playful relationship between ideas of excess and everydayness.\u201d</p>    <p>There is a more serious side to it all, however. \u201cI think we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the real consequences of this consumer culture,\u201d Harris says, \u201cwhich privileges wealthy and elite groups to perform an ordinariness, all the while benefiting from a system that sees those from lower income backgrounds unable to afford basic necessities.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sabrinafaramarzi.net/\">Trends analyst Sabrina Faramarzi</a> agrees that luxury fashion has \u201calways been fascinated with fetishising the value of the mundane\u201d. She cites Chanel\u2019s 2014 show, held in a fake supermarket, complete with Chanel-themed flour, oil and eggs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/16/why-fashion-loves-a-supermarket-shopping-bag\">As the Guardian pointed out</a>: \u201cNot everyone is a fan of high fashion parodying the low, deeming the idea that a customer at Chanel is more likely to carry a Chanel basket than an Asda one a bit off-key, a little Marie Antoinette.\u201d</p> <p>Faramarzi says: \u201cIn my opinion, what was once seen as novel and playful irony now leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially against the backdrop of an increasingly turbulent economic and social landscape.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, Marra-Alvarez points out that food motifs have <a href=\"https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/1937-schiaparelli-lobster/\">appeared on clothing for centuries</a>. While the depictions themselves may have evolved along with consumer culture, they have long signalled an aspirational lifestyle \u2013 and perhaps a carton of detergent is more relatable for most than, say, a <a href=\"https://www.tattydevine.com/collections/lobster-necklaces?srsltid=AfmBOoqH0J_5STmCE8WdqZNSKo52MPWavMPVFxGpMVjvE0AW3zb5ITho\">lobster-charm pendant</a>. \u201cThe appeal of food, both aesthetic and symbolic, to highlight harvest, bounty, abundance or luxury is not a new concept \u2013 these associations have always been there.\u201d Her personal favourite? \u201cRachel Antonoff\u2019s coffee cup sweater\u201d \u2013 described on the Antonoff website as \u201c<a href=\"https://rachelantonoff.com/products/coffee-cup-sweater?srsltid=AfmBOooF3sDx-EWobFdVXXZD2hf9xAXQqvn2MyMHxWYEyqv1JqjOX-YT\">everyone\u2019s favorite bodega beverage</a>\u201d.</p> <p><em>To read the complete version of this newsletter \u2013 complete with this week\u2019s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-fashion-statement-newsletter-our-free-fashion-email\">subscribe to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox</a> every Thursday.</em></p>",

Bentel previously designed a penne pasta bag seemingly inspired by Italian brand De Cecco\u2019s yellow and blue packaging, which is usually found on grocery store shelves between the own-brand macaroni and the Napolina fusilli. Anya Hindmarch has tapped the cereal aisle with an embellished Frosties bag, as well as the biscuit section via McVitie\u2019s Digestives and Rich Tea clutches, all on sale for roughly \u00a31,300 more than the food that inspired them. At its most recent show, Moschino, a brand that often toys with the iconography of pop culture food brands \u2013 perhaps most notably the golden arches of McDonald\u2019s \u2013 sent a model down the catwalk clutching a bag resembling a bottle of laundry detergent. Paper grocery bags have been appropriated by everyone from Jil Sander to Bottega Veneta. So what is behind fashion\u2019s obsession with Tesco et al? Are these seemingly incongruous designs made to go viral? Or do they seek to poke fun at the mundanity of the \u201cbig shop\u201d? \u201cSupermarkets are visually appealing with stocked shelves, colourful packaging and endless offerings to satisfy our tastes,\u201d says Melissa Marra-Alvarez, curator of education and research at the Museum at FIT in New York City, and co-editor of Food and Fashion. \u201cThere is a lot of material here \u2013 literal, figural, psychological \u2013 for designers to have some fun and get creative with.\u201d \u201cSupermarket fashion allows for a very literal presentation of our \u2018tastes\u2019 \u2026 Food and fashion are both very connected to our personal identity,\u201d she adds. Much like our wardrobes, our shopping lists can be seen to convey who we are, what we stand for and how we want others to view us. Wearing these kind of designs could be seen as an attempt to signal a sort of salt of the earth mentality, despite being able to afford to spend a grand on a bag with Tony the Tiger on it. Dr Gaby Harris, lecturer in fashion cultures at Manchester Metropolitan University, says: \u201cWe can see this as a playful relationship between ideas of excess and everydayness.\u201d There is a more serious side to it all, however. \u201cI think we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the real consequences of this consumer culture,\u201d Harris says, \u201cwhich privileges wealthy and elite groups to perform an ordinariness, all the while benefiting from a system that sees those from lower income backgrounds unable to afford basic necessities.\u201d Trends analyst Sabrina Faramarzi agrees that luxury fashion has \u201calways been fascinated with fetishising the value of the mundane\u201d. She cites Chanel\u2019s 2014 show, held in a fake supermarket, complete with Chanel-themed flour, oil and eggs. As the Guardian pointed out: \u201cNot everyone is a fan of high fashion parodying the low, deeming the idea that a customer at Chanel is more likely to carry a Chanel basket than an Asda one a bit off-key, a little Marie Antoinette.\u201d Faramarzi says: \u201cIn my opinion, what was once seen as novel and playful irony now leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially against the backdrop of an increasingly turbulent economic and social landscape.\u201d Even so, Marra-Alvarez points out that food motifs have appeared on clothing for centuries. While the depictions themselves may have evolved along with consumer culture, they have long signalled an aspirational lifestyle \u2013 and perhaps a carton of detergent is more relatable for most than, say, a lobster-charm pendant. \u201cThe appeal of food, both aesthetic and symbolic, to highlight harvest, bounty, abundance or luxury is not a new concept \u2013 these associations have always been there.\u201d Her personal favourite? \u201cRachel Antonoff\u2019s coffee cup sweater\u201d \u2013 described on the Antonoff website as \u201ceveryone\u2019s favorite bodega beverage\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The death toll from devastating floods in eastern Spain has risen to 158, regional authorities and emergency services have said, as the country began three days of mourning and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, urged people to stay at home. With forecasts of more bad weather prompting storm alerts farther north, S\u00e1nchez urged residents on Thursday to \u201cplease, follow the calls of the emergency services \u2026 Right now the most important thing is to save as many lives as possible.\u201d Officials in the stricken eastern region of Valencia said 155 bodies had been recovered there, with three deaths also reported from the Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia regions. The toll makes the disaster the deadliest episode of flooding in Spain\u2019s modern history. Authorities have not disclosed how many people are still unaccounted for but the defence minister, Margarita Robles, earlier said the death toll was expected to rise further given some areas remain inaccessible to rescuers. Flags flew at half-mast on government buildings and a minute of silence was observed nationwide after the flash floods battered Valencia\u2019s infrastructure, sweeping away bridges, roads and railway tracks and submerging farmland. Survivors told of walls of rushing water that turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned torrents that poured into the ground floors and garages of houses and apartment blocks. Angry people in several towns said mobile phone alerts had not been sent out until 8pm on Tuesday, when serious flooding had already started in some areas \u2013 and several hours after the national weather service, Aemet, had issued a red alert for exceptionally heavy rains. Laura Villaescusa, who lives in the Valencia suburb of La Torre, told Reuters: \u201cThose people wouldn\u2019t have died if they had been warned in time.\u201d One man told Eldiario.es that the alert came as he was already trapped in his car with flood waters up to his chest. \u201cJust after 8pm, after an hour with water up to my neck and swallowing mud, the alert went off,\u201d he said. Conservative opposition politicians have accused the socialist-led federal government of acting too slowly to warn people to get to safety, but the interior ministry said responsibility for civil protection measures lay with regional authorities. Valencia\u2019s conservative regional president, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, defended his administration\u2019s management of the crisis, saying the region\u2019s officials had \u201cfollowed the standard protocol\u201d. Spain\u2019s national weather agency had alerted officials and the public via its website and social media on Sunday, two days before the tragedy struck, that there was a 70% chance of torrential rain ahead. The agency then issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, early on Tuesday. Emergency service workers and more than 1,200 troops combed through thick silt in mud-caked towns and villages on Thursday to find survivors and clear roads, while rescuers used helicopters to winch survivors to safety in areas that were still flooded. \u201cOur priority is to find the victims and the missing so we can help end the suffering of their families,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said after visiting a rescue coordination centre and meeting with regional officials and emergency services in Valencia. \u201cThis storm front is still with us,\u201d S\u00e1nchez added. \u201cStay home and heed the official recommendation and you will help save lives.\u201d Meteorologists said a year\u2019s worth of rain had fallen in eight hours in parts of Valencia on Tuesday.

In the small Valencian town of Utiel, where six people died in the floods, people were trying to come to terms on Thursday with what had happened as they carted bucket-loads of sodden possessions from their homes and tried to sweep out the mud. Around them, personnel from the army\u2019s military emergencies unit supervised the cleanup and the pumps, aided by Guardia Civil officers, firefighters and civil protection units. In the worst affected part of the town, where the Magro River had burst its banks and sent flood waters surging into people\u2019s houses, the mud was still calf-deep in places and the streets littered with wrecked cars and other detritus. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what happened here,\u201d one local resident, Carmen Aleixandre, told the Guardian. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the words to describe it.\u201d Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, said the town was at the end of its tether and desperately needed help from the regional and national governments. \u201cSix people died and we\u2019re mourning them, but hundreds could have died here,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Seeing a room full of teenagers, some as young as 14, screaming their lungs out to a version of Aqua\u2019s 1997 track Barbie Girl in 2024 is a surreal experience no one could have predicted a few years ago. But not many artists embody the unpredictable world of contemporary music more than Ice Spice. After appearing from seemingly nowhere and going viral with her track Munch (Feelin\u2019 U) in 2022, the Bronx rapper went stratospheric and was quickly being declared \u201crap\u2019s new princess\u201d before collaborating with Nicki Minaj on the Barbie soundtrack.</p> <p>Merging drill, hip-hop, and Jersey club music with a pop sheen \u2013 a \u201crap bitch on a pop chart\u201d in her own words \u2013 Spice\u2019s tracks never break the three-minute mark and so within 10 minutes she\u2019s rattled through a bunch: from the bass heavy gurgles of Princess Diana to the melodic synth loops of Phatt Butt, the rapper letting rip some of her most animated and tight flows on the latter.</p> <p>Spice\u2019s near-constant twerking gets audience squeals, as a cohort of dancers move gracefully and powerfully around her, while the DJ fires off air horn and broken glass sound effects with almost comical regularity. The venue isn\u2019t full at all but it pops off regardless, with giddily high octane pace and energy from artist and audience.</p> <p>In the end she performs 21 tracks in just 45 minutes.

But not many artists embody the unpredictable world of contemporary music more than Ice Spice. After appearing from seemingly nowhere and going viral with her track Munch (Feelin\u2019 U) in 2022, the Bronx rapper went stratospheric and was quickly being declared \u201crap\u2019s new princess\u201d before collaborating with Nicki Minaj on the Barbie soundtrack. Merging drill, hip-hop, and Jersey club music with a pop sheen \u2013 a \u201crap bitch on a pop chart\u201d in her own words \u2013 Spice\u2019s tracks never break the three-minute mark and so within 10 minutes she\u2019s rattled through a bunch: from the bass heavy gurgles of Princess Diana to the melodic synth loops of Phatt Butt, the rapper letting rip some of her most animated and tight flows on the latter. Spice\u2019s near-constant twerking gets audience squeals, as a cohort of dancers move gracefully and powerfully around her, while the DJ fires off air horn and broken glass sound effects with almost comical regularity. The venue isn\u2019t full at all but it pops off regardless, with giddily high octane pace and energy from artist and audience. In the end she performs 21 tracks in just 45 minutes. This rapid-fire approach is impressively succinct, allowing pop hooks and booming beats to fizz and bubble before quickly settling down and disappearing \u2013 but it can also feel slightly bitty and restless. However, the final run offers up some pleasing variety and range: there\u2019s a thunderous Did It First, the slowed down yet slick Fisherrr, and the squelchy bounce of closer Think U the Shit (Fart).

While the US economy broadly bounced back from the pandemic, Nevada has lagged behind. Nearly a quarter of jobs here are in leisure or hospitality, and although the Las Vegas Strip, where Gonzalez works, is back to booming with tourists, unemployment in Nevada remains the highest of any US state.</p> <p>And working-class voters are wrestling with a big question: which candidate will help dig them out of a profound economic rut?</p> <p>Their decision will help decide the election. Nevada is one of seven US swing states that help determine the outcome of the presidential race. With its six electoral votes, Nevada has leaned Democratic in every presidential vote since 2008 \u2013 but winning candidates have scraped by with slim margins. This year, the outcome could come down to working-class voters who have been worn down by low wages and ever-higher costs.</p> <p>\u201cNevada is a blue state, but it\u2019s a very, very, very light blue state,\u201d said David Byler, chief of research at the polling firm Noble Predictive Insights. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take a lot of swing to turn any of those into a functional tie or a Republican win.\u201d</p> <p>Both presidential campaigns are pitching solutions that \u2013 at least at first glance \u2013 look nearly identical.</p> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZddZeznA4E&amp;t=1875s\">raised the idea</a> of ending taxes on tips at a June campaign rally. Harris came out with a plan to do so in August, and combined it with a promise to end the federal sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, which is $2.13 an hour.</p> <p>JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, floated the idea of expanding the child tax credit to $5,000. Harris and Walz have made their plan to expand the child tax credit and cap childcare costs one of their top campaign priorities.</p> <p>Gonzalez doesn\u2019t believe Trump will do anything to help workers \u2013 after all, the glittering hotel and casino that bears the former president\u2019s name on the strip fought fiercely to block workers from unionising ahead of the 2016 elections. \u201cAll Trump wants to do is cut taxes for his buddies, for his rich friends, not for us,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has shown us that.\u201d</p>    <p>In past years, the state\u2019s powerful, politically engaged unions have helped buoy Democratic candidates to victory \u2013 and this year, the Culinary Union alone aims to knock on at least 900,000 doors. The AFL-CIO has also been canvassing for Harris, and the Nevada Teamsters have made a point to endorse Harris, even as the national organization declined to make an endorsement.</p> <p>\u201cThe people I talk to, they hear talking points from the Trump campaign, they hear a plan from the Harris campaign,\u201d said Max Carter, a state assemblyman and former union electrician who has been canvassing on behalf of the Harris campaign.</p> <p>But Republicans have also positioned themselves as the champions of workers. \u201cTrump\u2019s big innovation was really going after these working-class voters,\u201d Byler said. The former president has messaged populism and managed to distinguish himself from a past era of Republicans focused on fiscal and social conservatism, and hawkish foreign policy.</p> <p>Increasingly, voters say they trust Trump over Harris to improve economic conditions and follow through on policy promises. A September poll from Noble Predictive Insights, for example, found that 47% of voters trusted Trump to ban taxes on tips, compared to 40% who trusted Harris more on the matter.</p> <p>Many voters remember the days early in the Trump administration when costs were just lower. \u201cI think the economy was just better when Trump was president,\u201d said Magaly Rodas, a 32-year-old mother of two who was deciding on the cost of groceries at her local Latin market.</p> <p>Her husband, an electrician, has struggled to find work since the pandemic, she said \u2013 even as rent and other expenses have continued to climb. He\u2019s also an immigrant, who has struggled to attain legal status in the US for more than a decade. Biden, Rodas said, keeps letting immigrants into the US, without any plan to help those who are already in the country. \u201cWhat have the Democrats done for us in four years?\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>That\u2019s a common complaint that canvassers for Make the Road Action in Nevada, a progressive group focused on turning out Latino and other minority voters. \u201cA lot of people think \u2013 \u2018Oh, the economy was better under Trump,\u2019\u201d said Josie Rivera, an organiser for the group.\u201d And it\u2019s been really disappointing to hear that a lot of Black and Latino men especially are turning more conservative or just sitting out the election and staying home.\u201d</p> <p>A Reuters/Ipsos <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-gains-with-hispanic-men-harris-up-with-white-women-reutersipsos-polls-show-2024-10-25/\">poll</a> conducted in the weeks leading up to election day found that Trump trailed Harris by just two percentage points among Hispanic men.</p> <p>Canvassers for Make the Road have been working to fact-check Trump\u2019s rhetoric that the economy was at its \u201cbest\u201d under his presidency. They have also been talking to voters about Project 2025 \u2013 the ultra-conservative roadmap that details how the former president and his allies would restructure the US government \u2013 launching mass deportations, or dismantling education and climate programs, with disastrous consequences for immigrant and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/project-2025-black-americans\">Black communities</a>.</p>    <p>\u201cStill, we\u2019re facing a lot of misinformation,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cWe try to combat that, when we go door to door, with one-on-one conversations and personal testimonials. But it can still be hard to get to voters.\u201d</p> <p>Many voters of color are turned off by the president\u2019s racist rhetoric about immigrants, but don\u2019t necessarily take him seriously, or believe he will actually enact the extreme policies he says he will, Rivera noted. Many voters do, however, seem to trust the former president\u2019s business acumen.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him as a person, but I like his economic standpoint,\u201d said Maile McDaniel, a 22-year-old resident of Reno. \u201cBecause he\u2019s shown that he can do it before. He\u2019s shown he can keep inflation down, he\u2019s shown he can make things affordable.\u201d</p> <p>As an expecting mother, McDaniel said, she\u2019s especially concerned about childcare costs and inflated prices at the grocery store.</p> <p>Childcare in Nevada is also more <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/news/data/2023/06/14/nevada-couples-have-highest-child-care-cost-burden-in-u-s-new-report-says/70319080007/\">expensive than elsewhere</a> in the country, and other basic expenses in the state remain, for some, unattainably high. The median home price in the Las Vegas area, for example, has far outpaced national averages, and the average rent increased by nearly a third between 2020 and 2022.</p> <p>Democrats argue that Joe Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://nevadacurrent.com/2023/05/25/the-republican-base-is-driving-lombardo-but-arpa-built-the-session/\">American Rescue Plan</a> brought in billions to fund everything from education to housing programs. And the president\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act has also brought in unprecedented funding for new construction. But many of these projects are in the early stages, and it may take a while before Nevadans see the benefit.</p> <p>The potential benefits of the rival proposals not to tax tips are also unclear. An analysis from the <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240624/no-tax-tips-act-background-tipped-workers\">Yale Budget Lab</a> estimated that more than a third of tipped American workers already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s version of the plan would also aim to end the practice of paying tipped workers less than minimum wage, though in Nevada, all workers already are entitled to a minimum of $12 an hour, regardless of whether they earn tips. And a tax exemption for tips could also leave some workers worse off \u2013 disqualifying them from other tax credits.</p> <p>Voters leaning toward either candidate also wondered why either Trump or Harris hadn\u2019t tried to pass any of these reforms already.</p> <p>\u201cTrump was president for four years,\u201d said Kenneth Logan, a retired bartender who lives in Las Vegas. \u201cHe says a lot of things, but he normally doesn\u2019t follow through on them. I say if somebody tells you who they are, believe what they tell you.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>For decades, Nevada has been an election bellwether, voting for the winner of every presidential contest since 1912 with two exceptions \u2013 the state broke for Gerald Ford in 1976, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Still, this year, even seasoned strategists and pollsters have struggled to predict which way the Silver state will swing.</p> <p>Indeed, reaching voters has long been a struggle in Nevada. Its largest cities \u2013 Reno and Las Vegas \u2013 are home to a transient population, many of whom work unpredictable shifts in the state\u2019s 24/7 entertainment and hospitality industries. The state is also incredibly diverse, and home to several immigrant communities who primarily speak Spanish or a language other than English.</p> <p>Residents\u2019 political affiliations can also be difficult to parse. Many Nevada voters have been fiercely independent for decades \u2013 voting for Democratic and Republican candidates. But new changes to the voter registration system \u2013 which automatically registers eligible voters at the DMV, and lists them as \u201cnon-partisan\u201d by default \u2013 has increased the ranks of voters who are unaffiliated with any political party, even as voters beliefs have grown increasingly entrenched and polarised. Campaign operatives have been struggling to find these independents and figure out if they can be swayed.</p> <p>Another uncertainty is how the state\u2019s mostly Mexican American Latinos, who make up nearly 20% of Nevada\u2019s electorate, will sway. Latino voters here have traditionally backed Democrats, though the party\u2019s popularity is slipping. And both parties have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/05/las-vegas-nevada-latino-voters-democratic-primary\">struggled</a> to strategically and thoughtfully message to Latinos, even as they seek desperately to win their votes.</p> <p>Asian-American voters \u2013 who make up 12% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 are another increasingly important voting bloc, and the Harris campaign especially has worked to court a growing constituency of Filipino-American voters in the state.</p> <p>In addition, there are indications that Nevada\u2019s Latter-day Saints, who make up 6% of the state\u2019s population and have historically been reliable Republican voters, have been <a href=\"https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/10/25/for-many-latter-day-saints-christian-nationalism-is-a-step-too-far/\">turned off</a> by Trump\u2019s Christian nationalism.</p> <p>More than any other group, however, the campaigns in Nevada have remained focused on winning the state\u2019s workers.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for all the people like us who work in those hard jobs in this country to have someone working hard for us,\u201d said Claudio Lara, 49, who works as a housecleaner in Vegas.</p> <p>He is voting for Harris, he said, because she is a child of immigrants, and a woman. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a woman, and it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a strong change, a sharp change in this country.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2024 to clarify that the temperatures in Nevada were for the final few weeks of the campaign, not \u201cdays\u201d as an earlier version said. </p>",

I say if somebody tells you who they are, believe what they tell you.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 For decades, Nevada has been an election bellwether, voting for the winner of every presidential contest since 1912 with two exceptions \u2013 the state broke for Gerald Ford in 1976, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Still, this year, even seasoned strategists and pollsters have struggled to predict which way the Silver state will swing. Indeed, reaching voters has long been a struggle in Nevada. Its largest cities \u2013 Reno and Las Vegas \u2013 are home to a transient population, many of whom work unpredictable shifts in the state\u2019s 24/7 entertainment and hospitality industries. The state is also incredibly diverse, and home to several immigrant communities who primarily speak Spanish or a language other than English. Residents\u2019 political affiliations can also be difficult to parse. Many Nevada voters have been fiercely independent for decades \u2013 voting for Democratic and Republican candidates. But new changes to the voter registration system \u2013 which automatically registers eligible voters at the DMV, and lists them as \u201cnon-partisan\u201d by default \u2013 has increased the ranks of voters who are unaffiliated with any political party, even as voters beliefs have grown increasingly entrenched and polarised. Campaign operatives have been struggling to find these independents and figure out if they can be swayed. Another uncertainty is how the state\u2019s mostly Mexican American Latinos, who make up nearly 20% of Nevada\u2019s electorate, will sway. Latino voters here have traditionally backed Democrats, though the party\u2019s popularity is slipping. And both parties have struggled to strategically and thoughtfully message to Latinos, even as they seek desperately to win their votes. Asian-American voters \u2013 who make up 12% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 are another increasingly important voting bloc, and the Harris campaign especially has worked to court a growing constituency of Filipino-American voters in the state. In addition, there are indications that Nevada\u2019s Latter-day Saints, who make up 6% of the state\u2019s population and have historically been reliable Republican voters, have been turned off by Trump\u2019s Christian nationalism. More than any other group, however, the campaigns in Nevada have remained focused on winning the state\u2019s workers. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for all the people like us who work in those hard jobs in this country to have someone working hard for us,\u201d said Claudio Lara, 49, who works as a housecleaner in Vegas. He is voting for Harris, he said, because she is a child of immigrants, and a woman. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a woman, and it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a strong change, a sharp change in this country.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2024 to clarify that the temperatures in Nevada were for the final few weeks of the campaign, not \u201cdays\u201d as an earlier version said.",

Initial financial market reaction was sanguine, but investors appear to have taken flight after picking over the bones of the huge tax and spending plans\u2026</p> <p>The quiet optimism that appeared to be spreading during Rachel Reeves\u2019 speech has evaporated and a higher risk premium has returned for UK debt. Bond yields are set to stay volatile, as institutions financing government borrowing keep a more suspicious eye trained on what the swollen investment budget will be spent on.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6723a6b18f086f851f570251\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T15:50:52.275Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Laith Khalaf</strong>, head of investment analysis at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sizeable fiscal loosening announced by the chancellor has prompted markets to pretty much rule out two interest rate cuts this year. Previously market expectations were for the base rate to fall to 4.5% by the end of this year, and then to under 4% by the middle of 2025.</p> <p>But the inflationary nature of the measures announced in the Budget are forecast by the OBR to add 0.4% to CPI inflation in the next tax year, thereby putting pressure on the Bank of England to keep rates at higher levels for longer. Indeed, the OBR has added 0.25% to its forecasts for interest rates over the next five years to accommodate the effects of the Budget, which suggests the impact is not simply going to be a short-term blip.</p> <p><strong>Markets are still pricing in a rate cut from the Bank of England in November, but think that will be the lot for this year.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>With the ten-year gilt yield now climbing to levels seen in the wake of mini-budget two years ago, it\u2019s fair to ask whether Rachel Reeves\u2019 maiden budget could cause similar problems. Khalaf said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The answer is probably, and hopefully, not. <strong>The scale and speed of rises in gilt yields has not been the same as it was in September 2022, giving markets time to adjust to lower prices.</strong> We don\u2019t know precisely how inflationary the mini-budget was, because Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng chose not to ask the OBR to publish their accompanying analysis. But markets panicked, probably a result of the divergence from due process alongside an inflationary Budget at a time when inflation was much more malign than it is now. The OBR reckons CPI will average 2.6% in 2025. That\u2019s above target, but not by a terrifying amount.</p> <p>Nonetheless we can expect some impact from higher rate expectations in the mortgage and savings market. Based on what\u2019s happened to the two-year gilt, we might start to see mortgages creeping up again, just when borrowers thought we were on a firmly downward path. However, rates are still more affordable than they were, with some fixed rates coming in under 4%. That at least gives borrowers a better base if rates do tick up a bit. On the other side of the ledger, savings rates can be expected to get a boost from the Budget and the adjustment to interest rate expectations. Higher cash rates aren\u2019t exactly going to fund an early retirement, but savers can probably sit on their coffers a bit more comfortably, for a while at least.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T16:12:45.668Z\">at 4.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-672393298f086f851f5700f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T14:36:36.514Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK gilt sell-off intensifies, pound drops; Wall Street falls amid Meta, Microsoft warnings</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/oct/31/imf-reeves-sustainable-tax-rises-budget-shift-cuts-resolution-foundation-shell-boj-ifs-business-live?page=with:block-6723755e8f0821d89821d8f6#block-6723755e8f0821d89821d8f6\">The sell-off of UK government bonds</a> has gathered pace, pushing yields sharply higher following the budget.

The slow decline in core inflation gives us the feeling that there is still some truth to that. The labour market remains tight at the moment, which still adds to wage pressures. We expect wage growth to come down over the course of 2025 as labour market tightness continues to ease, but we aren\u2019t seeing this effect just yet.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the drop in unemployment to a historic low indicates that inflationary pressures from the job market are not yet a thing of the past.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Including yesterday\u2019s accelerating GDP growth figures, this week\u2019s data has provided some counterweight to the ECB\u2019s dovish view presented on inflation at the October press conference. ECB President <strong>Christine Lagarde</strong> referred to all data pointing in the same direction: downward.</p> <p>Two weeks later, all data points in a different direction: upward. Lagarde has often warned against data point dependency, but may have fallen into the trap of the plural of that \u2013 data points dependency. </p> </blockquote> <p>Summing up, Colijn said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Taking a step back from the short-term confusing signals, we see a eurozone economy that continues to struggle to rebound, with third-quarter GDP data overstating momentum due to one-offs.</strong> </p> <p>The job market remains strong, but with profit growth down, we expect this to affect the labour market negatively over the course of next year. This keeps demand driven inflation down, which should help to bring inflation \u2013 including core \u2013 down to target in 2025. Still, upside risks to the outlook remain as labour market pressures have yet to fade and wage growth remains elevated for now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67235e4b8f0821f410faac29\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T10:40:46.715Z\">10.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IFS verdict on budget</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> could be forced to find more money to fix public services after her budget made a start at reversing the \u201cunrealistic\u201d and irresponsible spending plans of the Conservatives, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s leading experts on the government finances said the chancellor\u2019s tax measures on Wednesday had allowed for a substantial short-term increase in public servicing spending this year and next, but not thereafter.</p> <p><strong>Paul Johnson</strong>, the director of the IFS, said there would need to be \u201cmore to come\u201d after Labour\u2019s first budget in 15 years outlined \u00a340bn of tax increases needed for the emergency cash injection.</p> <p>Saying the spending plans amounted to \u201cpretending\u201d that Labour would splurge in the early years before reining in spending in future, he said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That\u2019s not going to happen.

Given the scale of the tax rise required it was inevitable that one of income tax, VAT or NICs would have to increase in order to pay for higher spending, and so it has transpired. </p> <p>Choosing employer NICs has some downsides. They are of course largely incident on wages. Increasing them increases the wedge between employment and self-employment, and between employment income and other income. <strong>But this is a better choice than trying to get big increases from a range of smaller taxes.</strong></p> <p><strong>It is also worth noting that, net, this increase will not actually get the Treasury anything like the \u00a325bn stated on the scorecard.</strong> As the Office for Budget Responsibility note, it will result in lower wages, reducing the amount raised from employer NI and reducing employee NI and income tax revenues. That takes the net revenue down to some \u00a316bn. On top of that there will be an effective \u00a36bn of compensation for public sector employers.</p> <p>As for the rest of the tax changes, I will only say that the lack of any apparent strategy or appetite for reform is deeply disappointing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-672356898f086f851f56fd60\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T10:30:01.696Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Reeves may have to find more money in future to avoid cuts \u2013 IFS</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, <strong>Paul Johnson</strong>, said Rachel Reeves could be forced to increase spending in future to avoid cuts. He also said increasing borrowing to ramp up investment spending was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson said much the most striking aspect of the spending decisions is how incredibly front loaded the additional spending is. Day-to-day spending on public services, after inflation and the additional cost to public sector employers of rising national insurance contributions, is set to rise by 4.3% this year and 2.6% next year, but then by just 1.3% each year thereafter.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unusually the NHS is not scooping the pool. It is getting about the average spending increase. Equally unusually local government is doing rather well, as is the justice department, reflecting the severe pressures each is facing.</p> <p>I am willing to bet a substantial sum that day-to-day public service spending will in fact increase more quickly than supposedly planned after next year. 1.3% a year overall would almost certainly mean real terms cuts for some departments. <strong>It would be odd to increase spending rapidly only to start cutting back again in subsequent years.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>He said the chancellor made a number of big choices in her first budget, the first Labour budget in almost 15 years.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She chose to increase borrowing in order to increase investment spending \u2013 or at least to stop it falling as a fraction of national income. Given that the growth benefits of this take some time to arrive, this is a courageous move and a welcome focus on the long term. This was the right thing to do.</p> <p>She chose a sensible new primary fiscal rule \u2013 that the current budget should be in balance in five years\u2019 time, with that shortening to a three year rolling target after 2026-27. She chose to keep the rather less sensible rule that debt should be falling in the same year of the forecast, but redefined debt to a measure which will treat the National Wealth Fund more favourably, and more generally gives her a bit more headroom to borrow for additional investment.</p> <p>She chose to increase taxes (on the scorecard at least) by an historically big \u00a340bn or so, with most of that coming from employer NI. That \u2013 and an increase in borrowing \u2013 allowed her to choose to increase day to day public service spending substantially this year and next, though not thereafter.</p> <p>The increases in spending look big relative to the previous government\u2019s plans, but that is in large part because their plans were unrealistic. <strong>Despite the apparent scale of the increases, this is not going to feel like Christmas has come for the public realm.</strong> Ms Reeves may be overegging the \u00a322bn black hole, but she is not wrong to stress that she got a hospital pass on the public finances.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T11:00:12.551Z\">at 11.00am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-672351128f0821f410faaba7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T09:49:23.180Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pan-European share index poised for worst month in a year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has been dragged down by poor results from companies, falling to its lowest level in nearly two months.</p> <p>It lost 0.75%, and is on track for its worst month in a year.</p> <p>Uncertainty around the outcome of the US presidential election next Tuesday is another factor.

The poorest half of households face a 0.8% reduction in their annual income on average, while the richest half face a 0.6% decrease. However, increases to capital gains and inheritance taxes (not included in this modelling) are more progressive, so wealthy households will face the largest cash impact overall.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A prolonged pay downturn. </strong>The combination of higher inflation and weaker growth stemming from increased taxes on employment, coming on top of an already challenging outlook, mean that real pay is set to stagnate again in the middle of this parliament. As a result, by 2028 real wages are expected to have grown by just \u00a313 a week over the past two decades.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A (public) investment nation\u2026</strong>The welcome boost to public investment, preventing the planned cuts set out by the previous government, means that Public Sector Net Investment is set to average 2.6% of GDP over the forecast period. This would be the highest five-year average in the UK since 1980-81, and bring the country close to the OECD average.</p></li> <li><p><strong>\u2026or a stagnation nation?</strong> Real household disposable income per person is projected to grow by 0.5% a year on average across the parliament. While stronger than growth during the last parliament (0.3%), it would still be the worst term for living standards under a Labour government, lower even than the 0.8% annual growth recorded in the 2005-2010 Parliament.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-672338238f0821d89821d63c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T07:58:07.445Z\">7.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Resolution Foundation\u2019s main findings:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Britain\u2019s National Health State</strong>. Health alone accounts for 40% of the overall \u00a335bn real increase to day-to-day public service spending between 2023-24 and 2025-26. As a result, the 2025-26 health budget will account for 42% of all departmental spending, up from 31% in 2007-08.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A tight Spending Review.</strong> The decision to frontload public service spending increases into this year and next have created a tough climate for the spending review next spring. Setting a spending envelope that increases by just 1.3% a year in day-to-day spending on public services between 2025-26 and 2029-30 implies \u00a310.8bn of real per person cuts to unprotected departments, sending their funding back to 2015-16 levels.</p></li> <li><p><strong>No margin for error.</strong> Having chosen a new debt rule that gives her more headroom, the chancellor has already used it up, with just \u00a39.9bn to spare against the current balance rule, and \u00a316bn against the public sector net financial liabilities rule. Even a modest economic downturn could force the chancellor to come back for more tax rises at a future fiscal event.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67232d1d8f0821f410faaad9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-31T07:53:31.137Z\">7.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Introduction: IMF hails Reeves\u2019 \u2018sustainable\u2019 tax rises; Resolution Foundation says budget marks \u2018decisive shift from planned cuts\u2019</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

      "bodyText": "UK government bonds have sold off, pushing yields (or interest rates) up. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt (as government bonds are known) jumped by 15 basis points to a one-year high of over 4.5% at one stage, as traders grew alarmed about Rachel Reeves\u2019 big rise in borrowing to fund investment spending in yesterday\u2019s budget. This means that the government is likely to issue more bonds. The 10-year yield is now trading 10bps higher at 4.43%. Interest rate expectations have also been scaled back, as the Office for Budget Responsibility judged that the budget was likely to raise inflation slightly. Before the budget, markets were expecting the Bank of England to cut rates from 5% to about 3.75% by the end of next year, with a first quarter-point move next Thursday. Now, they are forecasting fewer reductions, to around 4% by end of 2025. However, analysts said today\u2019s market moves could not be compared to the disastrous mini-budget delivered by Kwasi Kwarteng under Liz Truss in September 2022, when gilt yields jumped by 33 basis points in one day. Thank you for reading. Take care \u2013 JK Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Fresh nervousness has crept into markets about the prospects for the UK economy, just a day after Rachel Reeves delivered Labour\u2019s first Budget for 14 years. Initial financial market reaction was sanguine, but investors appear to have taken flight after picking over the bones of the huge tax and spending plans\u2026 The quiet optimism that appeared to be spreading during Rachel Reeves\u2019 speech has evaporated and a higher risk premium has returned for UK debt. Bond yields are set to stay volatile, as institutions financing government borrowing keep a more suspicious eye trained on what the swollen investment budget will be spent on. Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: The sizeable fiscal loosening announced by the chancellor has prompted markets to pretty much rule out two interest rate cuts this year. Previously market expectations were for the base rate to fall to 4.5% by the end of this year, and then to under 4% by the middle of 2025. But the inflationary nature of the measures announced in the Budget are forecast by the OBR to add 0.4% to CPI inflation in the next tax year, thereby putting pressure on the Bank of England to keep rates at higher levels for longer. Indeed, the OBR has added 0.25% to its forecasts for interest rates over the next five years to accommodate the effects of the Budget, which suggests the impact is not simply going to be a short-term blip. Markets are still pricing in a rate cut from the Bank of England in November, but think that will be the lot for this year. With the ten-year gilt yield now climbing to levels seen in the wake of mini-budget two years ago, it\u2019s fair to ask whether Rachel Reeves\u2019 maiden budget could cause similar problems. Khalaf said: The answer is probably, and hopefully, not. The scale and speed of rises in gilt yields has not been the same as it was in September 2022, giving markets time to adjust to lower prices. We don\u2019t know precisely how inflationary the mini-budget was, because Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng chose not to ask the OBR to publish their accompanying analysis. But markets panicked, probably a result of the divergence from due process alongside an inflationary Budget at a time when inflation was much more malign than it is now. The OBR reckons CPI will average 2.6% in 2025. That\u2019s above target, but not by a terrifying amount. Nonetheless we can expect some impact from higher rate expectations in the mortgage and savings market. Based on what\u2019s happened to the two-year gilt, we might start to see mortgages creeping up again, just when borrowers thought we were on a firmly downward path. However, rates are still more affordable than they were, with some fixed rates coming in under 4%. That at least gives borrowers a better base if rates do tick up a bit. On the other side of the ledger, savings rates can be expected to get a boost from the Budget and the adjustment to interest rate expectations. Higher cash rates aren\u2019t exactly going to fund an early retirement, but savers can probably sit on their coffers a bit more comfortably, for a while at least. The sell-off of UK government bonds has gathered pace, pushing yields sharply higher following the budget. Investors have become increasingly alarmed about the sharp rise in borrowing to fund investment. This means that the government is likely to issue more bonds. The pound rose in early trading but has now lost nearly 0.8% against the dollar and the euro in response to the bond sell-off. The yield, or interest rate, on the benchmark 10-year gilt jumped as much as 15 basis points and is now 14bps higher at 4.481%, the highest level in a year. The two-year gilt yield, which is more sensitive to interest rates, jumped by 20bps to a five-month high of 4.5% while the 20-year yield rose by 11bps to 4.89%. 10-year yields jumped more after Liz Truss\u2019 mini-budget of unfunded tax cuts two years ago, but were at similar levels then (in the aftermath of the mini-budget, yields surged to 4.558% on 28 September 2022, the highest since the financial crisis of 2008, prompting the Bank of England to intervene). Yields were even higher in the summer of 2023, when markets feared that interest rates could stay high for a prolonged period of time. Analyst Kyle Chapman, at Ballinger Group, said the rise in yields is due to what the market now appears to have concluded are overextended borrowing and spending plans in the budget. The OBR reckons that the net effect is an average of over \u00a330bn a year in increased gilt issuance over the next five years, and a total supply of nearly \u00a3300bn in this fiscal year. Yields have risen over the past couple of days in response to the increased bond supply, but the move has intensified over the course of this afternoon. The volatility in the gilt market has been extraordinary, with the 10-year yield up 30bps in the past 24 hours alone. Interest rate expectations have also been scaled back, as the Office for Budget Responsibility judged that the budget was likely to raise inflation slightly. Before the budget, markets were expecting the Bank of England to cut rates from 5% to about 3.75% by the end of next year, with a first quarter-point move next Thursday. Now, they are forecasting fewer reductions, to around 4% by end of 2025. Eurozone and US bond yields have also risen as investors have scaled back expectations of interest rate cuts, after stronger-than-expected inflation and growth data for the eurozone. The 10-year German Bund yield rose by 5bps to 2.42%, the highest since late July. The gap between British and German two-year yields reached 210bps, the widest level since September last year. The 10-year US Treasury yield also rose by 5bps to 4.31%, despite a drop in the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation to 2.1%. However, the core measure held at 2.7%, slightly higher than expected, while consumer spending also increased a little more than forecast. On Wall Street, stocks fell after warnings from Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft about soaring artificial intelligence costs led to a tech sell-off. Thank you for reading. Happy Halloween! Back tomorrow. \u2013 JK The European Union has fined pharmaceutical giant Teva \u20ac462.6m for \u201cabusing its dominant position to delay competition to its blockbuster medicine\u201d for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, Copaxone. It said Teva had implemented \u201ca systemic disparagement campaign\u201d to stop cheaper rivals come to market. After an anti-trust investigation, the European Commission found that Teva did this by artificially extending the patent for the drug. In a damning indictment of the company, it said Teva had also \u201csystematically spread misleading information about a competing product to hinder its market entry and uptake\u201d of cheaper glatiramer acetate medicines. It found that when its own patent for glatiramer acetate was running out it misused the procedures by filing multiple sub or divisional patents in a staggered way, \u201ccreating a web of secondary patents\u201d around its own drug. When rivals challenged it, Teva started enforcing these patents against competitors, the European Commission said in a statement issued on Thursday. Teva said: The company is deeply disappointed by this decision and has been cooperating extensively with the EC since 2019. Teva disagrees with the Commission\u2019s legal theories which are legally untested and, Teva believes, not supported by the facts. The company will vigorously defend its position on appeal and is well prepared financially to mount a defense. Teva conducts its business lawfully and ethically and has been a strong partner to Europe, its patients, economy and healthcare systems. This misguided decision will not distract Teva from its unwavering support for patients living with MS and their families. Inflation in the US on the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure has fallen to its lowest level since early 2021. The closely watched measure of US inflation slipped to within striking distance of policymakers\u2019 target after the Fed scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation. Inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, declined to an annual rate of 2.1% in September from 2.3% in August, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Core PCE inflation, excluding volatile food and energy, remained at 2.7%, though, against hopes that it would slip too. There is a sight of relief across the City as the budget could have been worse \u2013 says Vivek Rajak, financial sector analyst at Shore Capital. The budget ushered something of a relief sigh across the general financials sector as speculation, which exacerbated share price movements in the preceding days, came to an end. It was less bad than feared in terms of inheritance tax, pensions taxes, betting duty and AIM\u2019s future. Negatives for the sector are higher capital gains tax and employers\u2019 NIC, which will raise costs. This was a Budget aimed at income rather than savings and with pensions taxes set to rise, the medium-term outlook for assets under management formation has marginally reduced. UK government bonds are extending their post-budget sell-off, pushing yields higher. This is response to the planned higher borrowing in coming years, and as investors scaled back bets on interest rate cuts, with yesterday\u2019s budget measures expected to push inflation higher. The Office for Budget Responsibility has warned that the budget would lead to slightly higher inflation, which could lead the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer. The 10-year gilt yield has climbed by 7.5bps to 4.42%, the highest in a year. But eurozone bond yields are also up and on track for the biggest monthly rise since April \u2013 as investors expect a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank. The yield, or interest rate on Germany\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bond rose as much as 5 basis points to 2.425%, its highest since late July and is now at 2.41%. The eurozone benchmark yield has increased by 27bps in October, which looks to be the biggest monthly gain since April. Investors are digesting the latest data and what it means for interest rates. Eurozone inflation was higher than expected at 2% in October, according to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate today. The eurozone economy grew by 0.4% in the third quarter, faster than expected albeit still fragile, data showed yesterday. US Treasury yields have also risen sharply \u2013 by 47bps this month, which if sustained will be the biggest increase in six months. The government has further sold down its shareholding in NatWest Group, reducing its stake to 14.81% \u2013 halving it since March. A spokesperson for NatWest Group said: In March, the government\u2019s shareholding moved below the 30% milestone. We are pleased that the continued momentum of the government\u2019s trading plan and other activity has now halved that position to below 15%. Returning NatWest Group to full privatisation is a shared ambition and one that is in the interest of all our stakeholders. The government stake in NatWest is what remains from the 84% holding taken by the taxpayer at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, the UK government bailed out the bank, then called Royal Bank of Scotland, to the tune of \u00a345.5bn to help save the UK\u2019s financial system from collapse. The government says it intends to exit its stake in the bank by 2025-26, but a retail offer \u2013 selling shares to the public \u2013 has been ruled out. The Bank of England has launched a search for a new group of artificial intelligence (AI) experts, as it raises concerns over the risks that the technology might pose to financial stability. Sarah Breeden, the central bank\u2019s deputy governor with responsibility for financial stability, flagged the risks in a speech entitled \u2018Engaging with the machine: AI and financial stability\u2019. AI is expected to bring considerable potential benefits for productivity and growth in the financial sector and the rest of the economy. But for the financial sector to harness those benefits we, as financial regulators, must have policy frameworks that are designed to manage any risks to financial stability that come with them. Economic stability underpins growth and prosperity. It would be self-defeating to allow AI to undermine it... We should be alive to the possible need for macroprudential interventions to support the stability of the financial system as a whole. We should keep our regulatory perimeters under review, should the financial system become more dependent on shared AI technology and infrastructure systems. She said the Bank was launching an AI consortium of the private sector and AI experts \u201cto help us understand more deeply not only AI\u2019s potential benefits but also the different approaches firms are taking to managing those risks which could amount to financial stability risks\u201d. We will consider what we can do to spread best practices widely in the industry and whether further regulatory guidelines and guardrails are needed. The central bank\u2019s financial policy committee will publish its assessment of AI\u2019s impact on financial stability and set out how it will monitor those risks going forward. The Bank already warned last December that rapid developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning could pose risks to the UK\u2019s financial stability. The number of UK home sales in September rose by 9% year-on-year, according to figures from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). Across the UK, an estimated 91,820 properties were sold in September, which was a tad higher than in August. This was the first time sales increased month on month \u2013albeit by less than 1% \u2013 since May, HMRC said. In the financial year so far, between April and September, an estimated 547,350 home sales have taken place. Hope has started to return to the housing market but sales growth has stagnated in recent months, property experts said. Nick Leeming, chairman of estate agency group Jackson-Stops, said home buyers have been \u201cpressing on with their searches amid falling interest rates and positive wage growth\u201d. Here is our full story on the IFS verdict on the budget: The budget is likely to mean smaller pay rises for workers because of the impact on businesses, Rachel Reeves has conceded. The chancellor said she recognised \u201cthere will be consequences\u201d to her first budget, which includes \u00a340bn in tax rises, more than half of which come from increasing tax on businesses. The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the measures announced by Rachel Reeves in her first budget, saying her \u00a340bn of tax rises would boost growth \u201csustainably\u201d. In a rare intervention, the Washington-based IMF backed her increase in investment and extra spending to ease the financial pressure on public services and boost growth. A spokesperson for the fund said new budget rules showed the government was committed to bringing down the UK\u2019s debts over the longer term. \u201cWe support the envisaged reduction in the deficit over the medium term, including by sustainably raising revenue,\u201d they said, adding that the IMF approved of the government\u2019s \u201cfocus on boosting growth through a needed increase in public investment while addressing urgent pressures on public services\u201d. Inflation in the eurozone picked up more than expected, rising to 2% in October, mainly driven by energy and food prices. The annual inflation rate was up from 1.7% in September, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Core inflation, which strips out energy and food costs which tend to be volatile, stayed at 2.7%, also slightly higher than expected. Separate figures from Eurostat showed unemployment came in at 6.3% in September \u2013stable compared with August, and at a historic low since the eurozone was established in 1999. Services inflation is estimated to have the highest annual rate in October (3.9%, stable compared with September), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (2.9% versus 2.4% in September), non-energy industrial goods (0.5% vs 0.4% in September) and energy (-4.6% vs -6.1% in September). In the biggest European countries, inflation is estimated to have risen to 2.4% in Germany from 1.8% in September, while France had 1.5% inflation versus 1.4% and price increases picked up to 1% in Italy, from 0.7% in September. You can see the full country by country breakdown here. \u201cThe direction of incoming data in the region is not quite clear, which provides the European Central Bank with confusing signals for the path of rate cuts,\u201d said ING economist Bert Colijn. After the rapid decline in September, this provides a reality check about the eurozone\u2019s disinflationary process. The ECB frequently used the motto that \u2018the last mile is the hardest\u2019 when it comes to inflation fighting before summer, but hasn\u2019t done so recently. The slow decline in core inflation gives us the feeling that there is still some truth to that. The labour market remains tight at the moment, which still adds to wage pressures. We expect wage growth to come down over the course of 2025 as labour market tightness continues to ease, but we aren\u2019t seeing this effect just yet. He said the drop in unemployment to a historic low indicates that inflationary pressures from the job market are not yet a thing of the past. Including yesterday\u2019s accelerating GDP growth figures, this week\u2019s data has provided some counterweight to the ECB\u2019s dovish view presented on inflation at the October press conference. ECB President Christine Lagarde referred to all data pointing in the same direction: downward. Two weeks later, all data points in a different direction: upward. Lagarde has often warned against data point dependency, but may have fallen into the trap of the plural of that \u2013 data points dependency. Summing up, Colijn said: Taking a step back from the short-term confusing signals, we see a eurozone economy that continues to struggle to rebound, with third-quarter GDP data overstating momentum due to one-offs. The job market remains strong, but with profit growth down, we expect this to affect the labour market negatively over the course of next year. This keeps demand driven inflation down, which should help to bring inflation \u2013 including core \u2013 down to target in 2025. Still, upside risks to the outlook remain as labour market pressures have yet to fade and wage growth remains elevated for now. Rachel Reeves could be forced to find more money to fix public services after her budget made a start at reversing the \u201cunrealistic\u201d and irresponsible spending plans of the Conservatives, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. Britain\u2019s leading experts on the government finances said the chancellor\u2019s tax measures on Wednesday had allowed for a substantial short-term increase in public servicing spending this year and next, but not thereafter. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, said there would need to be \u201cmore to come\u201d after Labour\u2019s first budget in 15 years outlined \u00a340bn of tax increases needed for the emergency cash injection. Saying the spending plans amounted to \u201cpretending\u201d that Labour would splurge in the early years before reining in spending in future, he said: That\u2019s not going to happen. The spending plans will not survive contact with her cabinet colleagues.\u201d I am willing to bet a substantial sum that day-to-day public service spending will in fact increase more quickly than supposedly planned after next year. The IFS said that while the spending increases announced by Reeves appeared big relative to the previous government\u2019s plans, this was in large part because \u201ctheir plans were unrealistic\u201d. \u201cDespite the apparent scale of the increases, this is not going to feel like Christmas has come for the public realm,\u201d Johnson said. On taxes, Johnson said: We are all by now aware that employers National Insurance contributions (NICs) are set to rise, and to rise a lot. Given the scale of the tax rise required it was inevitable that one of income tax, VAT or NICs would have to increase in order to pay for higher spending, and so it has transpired. Choosing employer NICs has some downsides. They are of course largely incident on wages. Increasing them increases the wedge between employment and self-employment, and between employment income and other income. But this is a better choice than trying to get big increases from a range of smaller taxes. It is also worth noting that, net, this increase will not actually get the Treasury anything like the \u00a325bn stated on the scorecard. As the Office for Budget Responsibility note, it will result in lower wages, reducing the amount raised from employer NI and reducing employee NI and income tax revenues. That takes the net revenue down to some \u00a316bn. On top of that there will be an effective \u00a36bn of compensation for public sector employers. As for the rest of the tax changes, I will only say that the lack of any apparent strategy or appetite for reform is deeply disappointing. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, said Rachel Reeves could be forced to increase spending in future to avoid cuts. He also said increasing borrowing to ramp up investment spending was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d. Johnson said much the most striking aspect of the spending decisions is how incredibly front loaded the additional spending is. Day-to-day spending on public services, after inflation and the additional cost to public sector employers of rising national insurance contributions, is set to rise by 4.3% this year and 2.6% next year, but then by just 1.3% each year thereafter. Unusually the NHS is not scooping the pool. It is getting about the average spending increase. Equally unusually local government is doing rather well, as is the justice department, reflecting the severe pressures each is facing. I am willing to bet a substantial sum that day-to-day public service spending will in fact increase more quickly than supposedly planned after next year. 1.3% a year overall would almost certainly mean real terms cuts for some departments. It would be odd to increase spending rapidly only to start cutting back again in subsequent years. He said the chancellor made a number of big choices in her first budget, the first Labour budget in almost 15 years. She chose to increase borrowing in order to increase investment spending \u2013 or at least to stop it falling as a fraction of national income. Given that the growth benefits of this take some time to arrive, this is a courageous move and a welcome focus on the long term. This was the right thing to do. She chose a sensible new primary fiscal rule \u2013 that the current budget should be in balance in five years\u2019 time, with that shortening to a three year rolling target after 2026-27. She chose to keep the rather less sensible rule that debt should be falling in the same year of the forecast, but redefined debt to a measure which will treat the National Wealth Fund more favourably, and more generally gives her a bit more headroom to borrow for additional investment. She chose to increase taxes (on the scorecard at least) by an historically big \u00a340bn or so, with most of that coming from employer NI. That \u2013 and an increase in borrowing \u2013 allowed her to choose to increase day to day public service spending substantially this year and next, though not thereafter. The increases in spending look big relative to the previous government\u2019s plans, but that is in large part because their plans were unrealistic. Despite the apparent scale of the increases, this is not going to feel like Christmas has come for the public realm. Ms Reeves may be overegging the \u00a322bn black hole, but she is not wrong to stress that she got a hospital pass on the public finances. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has been dragged down by poor results from companies, falling to its lowest level in nearly two months. It lost 0.75%, and is on track for its worst month in a year. Uncertainty around the outcome of the US presidential election next Tuesday is another factor. It has prompted investors to seek out assets regarded as safer bets, such as gold and the dollar. Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, told Reuters: Trump threatening so many tariffs \u2013 that concerns what is this giong to mean for international trade. We\u2019re likely to see a decrease in productivity in a lot of companies that deal with the US, so investors are concerned. We\u2019ve spoken to a few businesses about how the budget is affecting them, such as the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, and changes to business rates for the high street. Rachel Reeves didn\u2019t scare the markets. But nor did she impress with a growth plan, says our financial editor Nils Pratley. Businesses adopt a wait-and-see response as it becomes clear the autumn budget is part of a long-term mission. People in Reeves\u2019 constituency of Leeds West and Pudsey were more positive. Steve Cook, who is retired but works part time driving the \u201cHappy Cab\u201d for the charity Bramley Elderly Action, ferrying older people around for days out and shopping trips, said the chancellor had \u201credeemed herself\u201d with the budget. I can see what they\u2019re doing now. Yeah, they\u2019ve won me over. They\u2019ve saved themselves by the skin of their teeth. On the stock markets across Europe, shares have fallen. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is trading 48 points, or 0.6%, lower at 8,110, while the German, French and Italian markets have all lost about 0.5%. Uncertainty around the tight US presidential election race is weighing on markets. Shell is among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index, up 0.9%, while the artificial hips and knees maker Smith &amp; Nephew is the biggest faller. Its shares plunged more than 13% to a one-year low. The company, the UK\u2019s largest medical products maker, cut its annual underlying revenue growth forecast because of weaker-than-expected demand in China that is likely to continue into next year. The pound has firmed slightly, trading nearly 0.2% higher against the dollar and the euro at $1.2981 and \u20ac1.1960. UK government bonds have extended their sell-off following the budget, with 20-year borrowing costs touching their highest level in almost a year. Investors are digesting the sharp increase in government borrowing forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog. They also scaled back their expectations of Bank of England interest rate cuts. While US Treasuries and German Bund prices also slipped, there was a bigger decline in UK government bonds, known as gilts. This pushed up yields, or interest rates. The yield on the 20-year gilt rose to its highest level since early November last year, at 4.855%, up 5 basis points. The yield on the 10-year gilt benchmark rose by nearly 4 basis points. Yields also rose on short-dated bonds, which are more sensitive to the outlook for interest rates. The two-year gilt yield rose as much as 7 basis points. Investors are now pricing in fewer than four interest rate cuts over the next year, compared with nearly five before yesterday\u2019s budget, which included major increases in public spending and investment, which are expected to push inflation higher. Rachel Reeves has just said that she \u201cchose to be a responsible chancellor,\u201d speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. You can read more on our politics live blog with Andrew Sparrow. And a few more \u2013 Resolution Foundation analysis: Tax and benefit changes fall on everyone\u2019s shoulders. The combined impact of benefit cuts, employer national insurance rises and consumption tax changes are felt evenly across the income distribution. The poorest half of households face a 0.8% reduction in their annual income on average, while the richest half face a 0.6% decrease. However, increases to capital gains and inheritance taxes (not included in this modelling) are more progressive, so wealthy households will face the largest cash impact overall. A prolonged pay downturn. The combination of higher inflation and weaker growth stemming from increased taxes on employment, coming on top of an already challenging outlook, mean that real pay is set to stagnate again in the middle of this parliament. As a result, by 2028 real wages are expected to have grown by just \u00a313 a week over the past two decades. A (public) investment nation\u2026The welcome boost to public investment, preventing the planned cuts set out by the previous government, means that Public Sector Net Investment is set to average 2.6% of GDP over the forecast period. This would be the highest five-year average in the UK since 1980-81, and bring the country close to the OECD average. \u2026or a stagnation nation? Real household disposable income per person is projected to grow by 0.5% a year on average across the parliament. While stronger than growth during the last parliament (0.3%), it would still be the worst term for living standards under a Labour government, lower even than the 0.8% annual growth recorded in the 2005-2010 Parliament. Here are the Resolution Foundation\u2019s main findings: Britain\u2019s National Health State. Health alone accounts for 40% of the overall \u00a335bn real increase to day-to-day public service spending between 2023-24 and 2025-26. As a result, the 2025-26 health budget will account for 42% of all departmental spending, up from 31% in 2007-08. A tight Spending Review. The decision to frontload public service spending increases into this year and next have created a tough climate for the spending review next spring. Setting a spending envelope that increases by just 1.3% a year in day-to-day spending on public services between 2025-26 and 2029-30 implies \u00a310.8bn of real per person cuts to unprotected departments, sending their funding back to 2015-16 levels. No margin for error. Having chosen a new debt rule that gives her more headroom, the chancellor has already used it up, with just \u00a39.9bn to spare against the current balance rule, and \u00a316bn against the public sector net financial liabilities rule. Even a modest economic downturn could force the chancellor to come back for more tax rises at a future fiscal event. Good morning. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has welcomed the measures announced by Rachel Reeves in her budget yesterday. In an unusual move, the influential Washington-based financial watchdog backed the increases in investment and spending on public services as well as \u201csustainable\u201d tax rises. A spokesperson said: We support the envisaged reduction in the deficit over the medium term, including by sustainably raising revenue. Last night, a spokesperson said the fund welcomed the government\u2019s \u201cfocus on boosting growth through a needed increase in public investment while addressing urgent pressures on public services. The Resolution Foundation, a UK thinktank, has published its analysis of the budget and given it a guarded welcome. It said the UK budget has delivered \u201cshort-term living standards pain in the hope of long-term growth-based gains\u201d. The London-based foundation said the first Labour budget in nearly 15 years marked a \u201cdecisive shift\u201d from the planned cuts set out by the last government, with better-funded public services and greater public investment coming from higher taxes and more borrowing. But the budget has not yet delivered a decisive shift away from Britain\u2019s record as a \u2018stagnation nation\u2019, with the outlook for growth and living standards remaining weak in this Parliament. By prioritising extra spending on public services and investment, the chancellor is borrowing an extra \u00a332bn a year by the end of the parliament, with another \u00a341bn coming from tax rises. Mike Brewer, interim chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: Rachel Reeves\u2019s first ever Budget was never going to be a crowd-pleaser, given the profound and often conflicting challenges she faced, from failing public services to perilous public finances, weak growth and stagnating living standards. The short-term effect of these changes will be better funded public services \u2013 not just across schools and the NHS \u2013 but, critically, also in our justice system. But families are also set for a further squeeze on living standards as the rise in employer National Insurance dampens wage growth. With Britain finally turning the page on its longstanding failure to invest thanks to a \u00a3100bn boost to public capital spending, the hope is that this short-term pain will eventually turn into a long-term living standards gain. But if it doesn\u2019t, future budgets won\u2019t be any easier to deliver, especially if further tax rises are needed. Shell has beaten forecasts with a profit of $6bn for the third quarter, as weaker refining and oil trading revenues were offset by higher gas sales. This was down slightly from $6.2bn in the previous quarter, and ahead of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.36bn. The company said it will buy back a further $3.5bn of shares over the next three months. The Bank of Japan has left interest rates unchanged at ultra-low levels, as expected, and said it was monitoring global economic developments and any risks to fragile domestic recovery. The yen gained after the central bank\u2019s decision, trading close to 153 per dollar. BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda said: As for the timing of the next rate hike, we have no preset idea. We will scrutinise data available at the time of each policy meeting, and update our view on the economy and outlook, in deciding policy. We have seen some positive US data recently. But there is still uncertainty on how past rate hikes by the Fed affect the economy and prices. We need to monitor developments carefully. Looking at domestic data, wages and prices are moving in line with our forecast. As for downside risks to the US and overseas economies, we\u2019re seeing clouds clear a bit.

Miller continued: \u201cThink about how corrupt and hateful and evil a system is that allows gangs to come into this country and rape and murder little girls,\u201d repeating false claims about the US immigration system. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stand up for our daughters? Who\u2019s going to stand up for the girls of America, the women of America, the families of America? Who\u2019s going to stand up and say, the cartels are gone, the criminal migrants are gone, the gangs are gone.\u201d Research has shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.",

It can disturb a driver\u2019s visual function and result in temporary \u201cblindness\u201d, she says, and also affect the visibility of other objects due to intraocular light scatter, or the scattering of light within our eyes, which reduces the contrast of objects close to the light source.</p> <p>\u201cSome objects that are visible when no glare is present become difficult to see when there is [glare],\u201d Wood explains.</p> <h2>Why modern headlights seem so much brighter</h2> <p>Although headlights feel significantly brighter than they used to, Brannon notes that the maximum <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-571/subpart-B/section-571.108\">standards for light output</a> set by the US transportation department\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) haven\u2019t changed in decades. Not only that, the US maximum light output for a vehicle is <a href=\"https://www.aaa.com/AAA/common/AAR/files/ResearchReportEuroSpecvsUSHeadlamps.pdf\">significantly lower</a> than in other countries: 150,000 candela (a measure of luminous intensity) compared to 430,000 candela in Europe.</p> <p>While the candela measure hasn\u2019t changed, there are other relevant factors. \u201cBrightness is measured in a variety of different ways,\u201d Brannon says.</p> <p>Part of the issue, he says, is that the temperature of the light in headlight bulbs has changed. Brannon drives a 1957 Volkswagen built with incandescent bulbs. These were the norm until halogen headlights took over in the 1980s, then <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/automobiles/27LIGHT.html\">LEDs</a> in the 2010s.</p> <p>Incandescent and halogen bulbs typically emit a light that has a light orange or red hue, which is gentler on the eye. LEDs tend to emit a harsh white light. Brannon says the headlights of his Volkswagen create a \u201cnice amber glow about 5ft in front of the car\u201d \u2013 warm and welcoming, but not great for fully illuminating the road ahead.</p> <p>Experts point out that more drivers are buying bigger cars. Because these cars are taller, their headlights are more likely to shine in the eyes of drivers of smaller cars. One 2021 <a href=\"https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2021/01/06/ihs-markit-suvs-crossovers-likely-reached-50-market-share-in-2020-trucks-hit-20/\">report</a> found that in the US, SUVs and crossover vehicles made up roughly 50% of vehicle purchases, and sales of pickup trucks roughly 20%.</p> <p>Additionally, many vehicles on the road have misaligned headlights. Over time, the regular wear and tear of driving can jostle headlights out of alignment, meaning the brightest part of the light ends up illuminating areas it\u2019s not supposed to \u2013 say, right into an oncoming driver\u2019s eyes. One <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/blinded-light-american-headlight-safety-lags-years-countries-rcna82666\">NBC News report</a> found that \u201conly 15 states require annual or biennial passenger vehicle inspections\u201d, and only 10 of those check headlight alignment.</p> <p>The glare from LED headlights has a particularly strong effect on drivers with conditions that lead to light sensitivity. Mark Baker is president of the Soft Lights Foundation, a non-profit aimed at \u201cprotecting people and the environment from the harms\u201d of LED headlights.</p> <p>Baker, who was diagnosed with mild autism, says the advent of LED headlights has been \u201cdevastating\u201d to him. \u201cThey were overwhelming my nervous system,\u201d he says. He founded Soft Lights in 2016, and since then, the group has petitioned the FDA, the Department of Energy, the Federal Highway Administration and other government agencies to regulate LED light sources.</p> <h2>Adaptive headlights are promising \u2013 but not popular in the US</h2> <p>In 2022, NHTSA announced it would allow US car manufacturers to install adaptive driving beam headlights, a technology already widely used across Europe.</p> <p>Many headlights in the US are equipped to automatically switch from high to low beams when another car is ahead of them. But adaptive headlights are equipped with a complex array of sensors and LED lights, explains David Aylor, vice-president for active safety testing at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. When the system\u2019s camera senses a vehicle or pedestrian approaching the front of the car, only the potentially disruptive sections of light switch off or dim.</p> <p>This means a driver with adaptive headlights can use high beams all the time. The system just \u201cshutters light for anybody or anything that shouldn\u2019t be illuminated\u201d, Brannon says. According to a <a href=\"https://www.aaa.com/AAA/common/AAR/files/ResearchReportEuroSpecvsUSHeadlamps.pdf\">2019 AAA report</a>, headlights increased roadway lighting by as much as 86% compared to US headlights without the adaptive beam technology.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/29/ask-ugly-acne-scars-medicine\">Ask Ugly: I was prescribed medicine for a zit. Should I take it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, no adaptive high beams have been installed in the US since the NHTSA approved the technology. The US and Europe have different lighting and testing standards, and Aylor says it\u2019s a struggle for manufacturers to meet US standards as well as afford the more complex lighting systems.</p> <p>Some are skeptical that adaptive headlights are really a panacea. Baker calls the technology a \u201cscam\u201d and says research has shown the lights aren\u2019t yet effective at sensing other cars on hills or during turns. If the sensors toggle from high beam to low beam, that\u2019s still too bright for most people\u2019s eyes, he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s too intense, and it\u2019s too blue,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But Brannon says adaptive headlights are promising and that AAA has lobbied extensively for them. The group is also researching other ways to make headlights less harsh.</p> <p>\u201cIs it possible that we could provide the same level of illumination with a color that is more human friendly?\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.\u201d</p> <p>I tell him about my recent scare on the road, and ask him what drivers should do when bright headlights are coming at them.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at the light source,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2024 to correct the spelling of Greg Brannon\u2019s surname.</p>",

Not only that, the US maximum light output for a vehicle is significantly lower than in other countries: 150,000 candela (a measure of luminous intensity) compared to 430,000 candela in Europe. While the candela measure hasn\u2019t changed, there are other relevant factors. \u201cBrightness is measured in a variety of different ways,\u201d Brannon says. Part of the issue, he says, is that the temperature of the light in headlight bulbs has changed. Brannon drives a 1957 Volkswagen built with incandescent bulbs. These were the norm until halogen headlights took over in the 1980s, then LEDs in the 2010s. Incandescent and halogen bulbs typically emit a light that has a light orange or red hue, which is gentler on the eye. LEDs tend to emit a harsh white light. Brannon says the headlights of his Volkswagen create a \u201cnice amber glow about 5ft in front of the car\u201d \u2013 warm and welcoming, but not great for fully illuminating the road ahead. Experts point out that more drivers are buying bigger cars. Because these cars are taller, their headlights are more likely to shine in the eyes of drivers of smaller cars. One 2021 report found that in the US, SUVs and crossover vehicles made up roughly 50% of vehicle purchases, and sales of pickup trucks roughly 20%. Additionally, many vehicles on the road have misaligned headlights. Over time, the regular wear and tear of driving can jostle headlights out of alignment, meaning the brightest part of the light ends up illuminating areas it\u2019s not supposed to \u2013 say, right into an oncoming driver\u2019s eyes. One NBC News report found that \u201conly 15 states require annual or biennial passenger vehicle inspections\u201d, and only 10 of those check headlight alignment. The glare from LED headlights has a particularly strong effect on drivers with conditions that lead to light sensitivity. Mark Baker is president of the Soft Lights Foundation, a non-profit aimed at \u201cprotecting people and the environment from the harms\u201d of LED headlights. Baker, who was diagnosed with mild autism, says the advent of LED headlights has been \u201cdevastating\u201d to him. \u201cThey were overwhelming my nervous system,\u201d he says. He founded Soft Lights in 2016, and since then, the group has petitioned the FDA, the Department of Energy, the Federal Highway Administration and other government agencies to regulate LED light sources. Adaptive headlights are promising \u2013 but not popular in the US In 2022, NHTSA announced it would allow US car manufacturers to install adaptive driving beam headlights, a technology already widely used across Europe. Many headlights in the US are equipped to automatically switch from high to low beams when another car is ahead of them. But adaptive headlights are equipped with a complex array of sensors and LED lights, explains David Aylor, vice-president for active safety testing at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. When the system\u2019s camera senses a vehicle or pedestrian approaching the front of the car, only the potentially disruptive sections of light switch off or dim. This means a driver with adaptive headlights can use high beams all the time. The system just \u201cshutters light for anybody or anything that shouldn\u2019t be illuminated\u201d, Brannon says. According to a 2019 AAA report, headlights increased roadway lighting by as much as 86% compared to US headlights without the adaptive beam technology. And yet, no adaptive high beams have been installed in the US since the NHTSA approved the technology. The US and Europe have different lighting and testing standards, and Aylor says it\u2019s a struggle for manufacturers to meet US standards as well as afford the more complex lighting systems. Some are skeptical that adaptive headlights are really a panacea. Baker calls the technology a \u201cscam\u201d and says research has shown the lights aren\u2019t yet effective at sensing other cars on hills or during turns. If the sensors toggle from high beam to low beam, that\u2019s still too bright for most people\u2019s eyes, he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s too intense, and it\u2019s too blue,\u201d he says. But Brannon says adaptive headlights are promising and that AAA has lobbied extensively for them. The group is also researching other ways to make headlights less harsh. \u201cIs it possible that we could provide the same level of illumination with a color that is more human friendly?\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.\u201d I tell him about my recent scare on the road, and ask him what drivers should do when bright headlights are coming at them. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the light source,\u201d he says. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2024 to correct the spelling of Greg Brannon\u2019s surname.",

      "bodyText": "The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court in The Hague is facing calls from his own staff for an independent external investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him. Karim Khan is the subject of allegations, details of which have emerged in recent weeks, about his conduct towards a woman who previously reported directly to him. On Monday, Khan announced in a social media post he had asked the court\u2019s internal watchdog to open an \u201cimmediate investigation\u201d and said he would \u201ccooperate fully with that inquiry\u201d. However, senior ICC officials have told the Guardian there are concerns among court staff about the independence of the inquiry, with some fearing it could be used to retaliate against those who raised the alarm. Four sources from the prosecutor\u2019s office also expressed concerns about a potential appearance of a conflict of interest as the incoming head of the court\u2019s internal watchdog, known as the independent oversight mechanism (IOM), currently works for Khan. The allegations against Khan, which are understood to span a 12-month period to April of this year, have emerged at an acutely sensitive moment for the ICC and prompted an unprecedented crisis at the judicial body, a court of last resort that prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities. In recent days, opponents of the ICC have sought to exploit the claims as a panel of its judges continue to consider requests by the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. Khan, a British barrister whose nine-year term as ICC prosecutor began in 2021, had convened a small group of close advisers to help deal with the crisis, sources said. The prosecutor\u2019s request for a new investigation came as the court\u2019s governing body, which is made up of member states, is understood to be considering how the allegations should be investigated and what form an inquiry should take. The presidency of the governing body, the assembly of state parties (ASP), did not respond to questions about the inquiry ordered by Khan. He announced the inquiry on Monday in a statement posted on X shortly after the Guardian reported allegations that Khan had tried to persuade his former colleague to deny the claims against him and that he took steps to deter her from formally pursuing the matter. His statement said he had notified the presidency of the ASP that he had requested the head of the independent oversight mechanism \u201cto open an immediate investigation under the umbrella of the IOM into misconduct allegations and surrounding circumstances relating to the official processes of the court and what appears to be disinformation\u201d.

In an email to staff, the union said: \u201cWe call for a prompt, independent and thorough investigation led by an external panel free from any potential conflict of interest.

The club said most of the bans and suspensions related to \u201cunauthorised selling of season tickets, memberships or hospitality tickets\u201d. In a warning to fans to buy tickets only through official channels, they said there had been an increase in the number of supporters being defrauded, particularly online. \u201cThe number of accounts deactivated includes those cancelled following investigations and others blocked from sales or ballots due to suspicious online activity, or identified as bots,\u201d Liverpool said. \u201cA further 5,670 accounts are currently under review by the club for suspicious activity, including supplying persons who have recently been charged by Merseyside police for fraud related to ticket touting. A total of 1,500 tickets were cancelled across the 23-24 season, either part of mass cancellations or from account holders who had already received sanctions, and the tickets were made available for resale.\u201d Liverpool said they were continuing to invest in anti-touting measures, including through online protection and \u201cmore boots-on-the-ground operations\u201d.",

To succeed, he will have to unseat Michelle Steel, a powerful, well-funded Republican incumbent with deep roots in county politics and who, as a Korean American, has her own Asian bona fides.</p> <p>To the south of both districts, the incumbent Democrat, Mike Levin, is facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from Matt Gunderson, a wealthy car dealer who previously ran for office in Wisconsin.</p> <p>Opinion polls in all three districts have been volatile. Levin\u2019s campaign manager, Adam Berkowitz, described his race as a \u201cpollercoaster\u201d \u2013 recent surveys have put Levin anywhere from 12 points to just a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000192-8672-d5a2-ad93-877bfa890000\">single percentage point</a> ahead \u2013 and he said he expected the determining factor not to be overall voting preferences so much as the ability of each party to turn out its supporters.</p>    <p>For the Democrats to succeed, they will need to depend on three key, overlapping groups: Asian Americans, who see an opportunity to flex their political muscles in two of the three districts; female voters alarmed at the prospect of a national abortion ban if Republicans take both chambers of Congress and the White House; and moderate Republicans (many of them now former Republicans) appalled by the fealty of all three GOP congressional candidates to Donald Trump and everything he stands for.</p> <p>The Republicans, meanwhile, have done their best to talk about anything but abortion \u2013 their candidates have twisted themselves into pretzels claiming to be <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/10/04/gunderson-tries-to-take-abortion-off-the-table-in-congress-race/\">more moderate</a> on the issue than their <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/community-action-fund-planned-parenthood-orange-and-san-bernardi/michelle-steel-exposed\">past stances</a> would suggest \u2013 and are betting that well-to-do Orange county residents will see more opportunities to increase their wealth if Republicans take charge in Washington.</p> <p>That bet is causing particular heartburn for politically engaged women who have abandoned the GOP and wish they could convince more of their wealthy suburban friends to do likewise. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what Republican voters think he [Trump] will bring to the table so they can save a buck or two on their taxes,\u201d former Republican turned Democratic party fundraiser Katherine Amoukhteh said. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided that leaving millions to their kids is more important than climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone, though, thinks the choice is quite so transactional, or so cut and dried. Liz Dorn Parker, another former Republican who supervises endorsements for Women for American Values and Ethics (Wave), a non-partisan Orange county political action committee, believes the threat to reproductive rights is a powerful motivator for female voters \u2013 whether or not they admit it publicly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/orange-county-turn-blue-republicans-democrats\">or tell their husbands</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to imagine some of these older Republican women, many of them divorced or widowed,\u201d Parker said, painting with a deliberately broad brush. \u201cAll their money is tied to housing, and, yes, they\u2019re worried about the Democrats being communists. But they\u2019re also looking at their granddaughters and asking, what if they get raped? The issue is freaking people out in ways that the men just don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <h2>An immigrant community eyes alternatives</h2> <p>As the races come into the home stretch, the Democrats are cautiously confident that Tran can unseat Steel, following a bruising campaign in which Steel\u2019s team has tried to make political hay out of everything from the clients Tran took on as a consumer rights lawyer to his investments in cryptocurrencies which, they say, link him to Chinese Communist party, a reliable bogeyman in Orange county, especially among Vietnamese American voters.</p> <p>A Steel spokesperson described Tran as \u201ca sleazy trial lawyer\u201d and offered a statement to the Guardian, reflecting the overall tone, accusing him of making a fortune \u201cworking for sexual predators, filing frivolous lawsuits, discrediting the victims and blaming the women\u201d.</p> <p>Tran has not shied away from calling Steel a \u201cTrump lackey\u201d and a \u201ccomplete fraud\u201d for withdrawing her support for the strict anti-abortion Life at Conception Act, a bill she previously co-sponsored.</p>    <p>Still, Tran\u2019s campaign says the relentless, often baseless attacks against him are a sign of Steel\u2019s nervousness, in a district where Democrats hold a<a href=\"https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/154day-presprim-2024/congressional.pdf\"> five-point registration edge</a> and the most recent<a href=\"https://dccc.org/new-dccc-poll-shows-derek-tran-leading-michelle-steel/\"> internal polling</a> put him a few points ahead. Tran\u2019s candidacy has generated genuine excitement in Little Saigon, a staunchly conservative area in northern Orange county at the centre of Steel\u2019s C-shaped district, where Tran campaign signs are now prominent even among the names of other much more conservative candidates for local office.</p> <p>That alone is striking, since most Vietnamese immigrants to the United States fled during the fall of Saigon in 1975 and have translated their native anticommunism into staunchly Republican politics that they have passed down to their children and grandchildren.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287?mt=8\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThis all boils down to the fact that this community has never had representation from one of its own in the 49-plus years they\u2019ve been in this country,\u201d Tran said in an interview. \u201cFor many seniors, I\u2019m the first Democrat they\u2019ve ever voted for.

One of her congressional allies is Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose support for Steel\u2019s re-election proved so awkward that Steel opted <a href=\"https://dccc.org/new-michelle-steel-plays-dog-ate-my-homework-routine-claims-she-lost-check-from-marjorie-taylor-greene/\">not to cash</a> a check the showboating congresswoman wrote. They also say Steel has a reputation for spending little time in her district and offering little in the way of constituent services. Her campaign did not respond to several invitations to comment.</p> <p>Some of Steel\u2019s attacks on Tran have arguably pushed the bounds of believability, including one<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1063420699070276&amp;ref=sharing&amp;_rdr\"> recent television appearance</a> in which she said: \u201cI think I am more Vietnamese than my opponent.\u201d</p> <h2>A bruising contest for a vacated seat</h2> <p>Min almost certainly faces a tougher challenge than Tran, even though his Republican opponent, Scott Baugh, has run for Congress twice before and was embroiled in an election fraud scheme 28 years ago that resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jul-28-me-60372-story.html\">large civil fine</a>.</p> <p>Several activists who might otherwise have offered full-throated support to Min were dismayed when Porter walked away from the seat, seeing the decision as close to a betrayal, and were dismayed all over again when Min ran a negative and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/02/min-weiss-ad-porter-seat-00139366\">highly personal primary campaign</a> to defeat his leading challenger. That, local political operatives say, has significantly eaten into Min\u2019s ability to mount an effective grassroots campaign.</p>    <p>In addition, Min was arrested for driving under the influence last year, prompting calls across the political spectrum for him to drop out of the race.

      "bodyText": "In an industrial business park in Orange county \u2013 the affluent, largely suburban slice of southern California wedged between Los Angeles and San Diego \u2013 Dave Min was feeling the weight of the world last weekend. \u201cIf we sit on our asses for the next 10 days, we lose,\u201d the Democratic candidate for California\u2019s 47th congressional district told a roomful of Asian American supporters at his campaign headquarters. \u201cWe need to get out that vote.\u201d Earlier in the day, with former president Bill Clinton standing next to him, Min spelled out the stakes to a noisy crowd of about 200 volunteers about to spread out and canvass for him. \u201cAmerica is under greater threat to our most cherished values than at any time in our lifetimes,\u201d he told them gravely. \u201cAnd control of Congress could depend on who wins this particular district.\u201d That claim was no exaggeration. As Democrats vie to overturn the Republicans\u2019 four-seat majority in the House of Representatives \u2013 a vital backstop, as they see it, if they should lose the White House to Donald Trump \u2013 their chances hinge on a number of highly competitive California districts, three of them in Orange county. Once a bastion of Reagan Republicanism, the county has edged towards the centre-left as its population has grown more ethnically diverse and a crucial percentage of Republican voters \u2013 college-educated women, in particular \u2013 have grown disgusted with Trump and his Maga movement. Just how far, and how reliably, the county has moved will be put to the test on 5 November, following a campaign in which both parties have sunk tens of millions of dollars and bombarded the airwaves and people\u2019s mailboxes with a toxic brew of attack ads invoking everything from the Chinese Communist party to pedophilia. Min, a Korean American law professor who has a solid legislative record in California\u2019s state senate, is fighting to fill a seat being vacated by Katie Porter, the outspoken Democratic party populist and prolific fundraiser who ran for the US Senate but fell short in the March primary against her House colleague Adam Schiff. Inland from Porter\u2019s coastal district, Derek Tran is hoping to represent an area with the largest ethnic Vietnamese population outside Vietnam. To succeed, he will have to unseat Michelle Steel, a powerful, well-funded Republican incumbent with deep roots in county politics and who, as a Korean American, has her own Asian bona fides. To the south of both districts, the incumbent Democrat, Mike Levin, is facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from Matt Gunderson, a wealthy car dealer who previously ran for office in Wisconsin. Opinion polls in all three districts have been volatile. Levin\u2019s campaign manager, Adam Berkowitz, described his race as a \u201cpollercoaster\u201d \u2013 recent surveys have put Levin anywhere from 12 points to just a single percentage point ahead \u2013 and he said he expected the determining factor not to be overall voting preferences so much as the ability of each party to turn out its supporters. For the Democrats to succeed, they will need to depend on three key, overlapping groups: Asian Americans, who see an opportunity to flex their political muscles in two of the three districts; female voters alarmed at the prospect of a national abortion ban if Republicans take both chambers of Congress and the White House; and moderate Republicans (many of them now former Republicans) appalled by the fealty of all three GOP congressional candidates to Donald Trump and everything he stands for. The Republicans, meanwhile, have done their best to talk about anything but abortion \u2013 their candidates have twisted themselves into pretzels claiming to be more moderate on the issue than their past stances would suggest \u2013 and are betting that well-to-do Orange county residents will see more opportunities to increase their wealth if Republicans take charge in Washington. That bet is causing particular heartburn for politically engaged women who have abandoned the GOP and wish they could convince more of their wealthy suburban friends to do likewise. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what Republican voters think he [Trump] will bring to the table so they can save a buck or two on their taxes,\u201d former Republican turned Democratic party fundraiser Katherine Amoukhteh said. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided that leaving millions to their kids is more important than climate change.\u201d Not everyone, though, thinks the choice is quite so transactional, or so cut and dried. Liz Dorn Parker, another former Republican who supervises endorsements for Women for American Values and Ethics (Wave), a non-partisan Orange county political action committee, believes the threat to reproductive rights is a powerful motivator for female voters \u2013 whether or not they admit it publicly, or tell their husbands. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to imagine some of these older Republican women, many of them divorced or widowed,\u201d Parker said, painting with a deliberately broad brush. \u201cAll their money is tied to housing, and, yes, they\u2019re worried about the Democrats being communists. But they\u2019re also looking at their granddaughters and asking, what if they get raped? The issue is freaking people out in ways that the men just don\u2019t understand.\u201d An immigrant community eyes alternatives As the races come into the home stretch, the Democrats are cautiously confident that Tran can unseat Steel, following a bruising campaign in which Steel\u2019s team has tried to make political hay out of everything from the clients Tran took on as a consumer rights lawyer to his investments in cryptocurrencies which, they say, link him to Chinese Communist party, a reliable bogeyman in Orange county, especially among Vietnamese American voters.

      "body": "<h2><strong>THE WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART</strong></h2> <p>What a difference a day makes. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/ruben-amorim-sporting-manchester-united-one-snag-job-football-daily\">yesterday\u2019s Football Daily</a> teased the tantalising possibility that R\u00faben Amorim might reject the coquettish advances of Big Sir Jim, Call Me Dave and assorted other members of the Ineos Brains Trust, this morning it was revealed that the Sporting manager will indeed succeed Erik ten Hag as Manchester United, albeit at a time of his current club\u2019s choosing. Amorim is set to parachute into Old Trafford during the next interlull, which begins on 11 November and it is to be hoped some club liaison officer is on hand to greet him at the airport and pin a poppy to his lapel for fear he causes immediate offence and has to face accusations of forgetting to remember.</p> <p>Having agreed to pay the \u00a38.3m release fee for the 39-year-old, United are also ponying up the thick end of another \u00a31m and will presumably have to shell out even more to enlist the assorted assistants he hopes to have seated alongside him in the dugout conducting the important business of organising pre-match shuttle-runs, chewing gum intently, badgering the fourth official and showing substitutes stuff on iPads. In the meantime, Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue in his role as caretaker manager for United\u2019s next three games \u2013 against Chelsea on Sunday, Paok on Thursday and Leicester on 10 November \u2013 before handing over the reins ahead of their trip to Ipswich on 24 November.</p> <p>In charge of Sporting for another three matches, one of which is against Estrela da Amadora on Friday night, Amorim was asked about his new gig by reporters in Lisbon. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it until the end of the game,\u201d he said, remaining commendably coy. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about all these issues. Everything will be clearer. Talking now is just another destabilisation for the squad.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of squad destabilisation, a different manager of a big football club in Manchester could be heard bemoaning the knack crisis that has befallen his squad ahead of a run of games that includes, as luck would have it, next week\u2019s Bigger Cup clash with Sporting in Portugal.</p> <p>While Pep Guardiola did not seem particularly fussed by his Manchester City side\u2019s white-knuckle exit from Fizzy Cup at the hands of Tottenham last night, he was noticeably concerned by the knack incurred by Manuel Akanji, R\u00faben Dias and Savinho, three members of his already depleted squad. \u201cWe have 13 players, we are in real difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys that play, they finish most of them with problems and we\u2019ll see how they recover.

      "bodyText": "THE WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART What a difference a day makes. While yesterday\u2019s Football Daily teased the tantalising possibility that R\u00faben Amorim might reject the coquettish advances of Big Sir Jim, Call Me Dave and assorted other members of the Ineos Brains Trust, this morning it was revealed that the Sporting manager will indeed succeed Erik ten Hag as Manchester United, albeit at a time of his current club\u2019s choosing. Amorim is set to parachute into Old Trafford during the next interlull, which begins on 11 November and it is to be hoped some club liaison officer is on hand to greet him at the airport and pin a poppy to his lapel for fear he causes immediate offence and has to face accusations of forgetting to remember. Having agreed to pay the \u00a38.3m release fee for the 39-year-old, United are also ponying up the thick end of another \u00a31m and will presumably have to shell out even more to enlist the assorted assistants he hopes to have seated alongside him in the dugout conducting the important business of organising pre-match shuttle-runs, chewing gum intently, badgering the fourth official and showing substitutes stuff on iPads. In the meantime, Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue in his role as caretaker manager for United\u2019s next three games \u2013 against Chelsea on Sunday, Paok on Thursday and Leicester on 10 November \u2013 before handing over the reins ahead of their trip to Ipswich on 24 November. In charge of Sporting for another three matches, one of which is against Estrela da Amadora on Friday night, Amorim was asked about his new gig by reporters in Lisbon. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it until the end of the game,\u201d he said, remaining commendably coy. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about all these issues. Everything will be clearer. Talking now is just another destabilisation for the squad.\u201d Speaking of squad destabilisation, a different manager of a big football club in Manchester could be heard bemoaning the knack crisis that has befallen his squad ahead of a run of games that includes, as luck would have it, next week\u2019s Bigger Cup clash with Sporting in Portugal. While Pep Guardiola did not seem particularly fussed by his Manchester City side\u2019s white-knuckle exit from Fizzy Cup at the hands of Tottenham last night, he was noticeably concerned by the knack incurred by Manuel Akanji, R\u00faben Dias and Savinho, three members of his already depleted squad. \u201cWe have 13 players, we are in real difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys that play, they finish most of them with problems and we\u2019ll see how they recover. I think we are in trouble, because in nine years we\u2019ve never been in the situation with so many injuries. The players make a step forward, more together than ever, and we will try to do this week in this short time of recovery.\u201d That screeching sound you can hear is an orchestra of teeny-weeny violins. QUOTE OF THE DAY 24 May 2024: \u201cThere is a beginning and an end to everything. It is only fair: to close the circle in this way, where I had started, is something I dreamed of and the dream was wonderful\u201d \u2013 Claudio Ranieri retires after seeing his career out with Cagliari. 31 Oct 2024: \u201cI confess that I want to put myself back on the line even though I have already said \u2018no\u2019 to more than one offer. Let\u2019s see if a call comes from a national team\u201d \u2013 Ranieri does a Warnock.

      "bodyText": "The Scottish government has scrapped a pilot of juryless trials for rape cases, which aimed to tackle endemic low conviction rates for sexual assault prosecution, after a backlash from the highest levels of the legal profession. Campaigners against sexual violence expressed disappointment that the proposal, which would have made Scotland the first part of the UK to use specialist courts and judge-only trials for serious sexual assaults, had been dropped. The pilot had been recommended by Scotland\u2019s second most senior judge, Lady Dorrian, but attracted widespread condemnation, with lawyers\u2019 associations throughout Scotland balloting to join a near unanimous boycott of the scheme. It formed part of a suite of radical measures set out by the former first minister Humza Yousaf and the justice minister, Angela Constance, last year in the victims, witnesses, and justice reform bill, including the abolition of the controversial Scottish verdict of \u201cnot proven\u201d, which were hailed at the time as \u201ctransformative\u201d by campaigners and survivors of sexual assault. Updating the Holyrood parliament on Thursday, Constance said there was \u201cclearly not enough parliamentary support\u201d for the pilot, adding she remained concerned about \u201csubstantial evidence that juries may be influenced by rape myths\u201d. Rape myths are stereotyped or prejudiced assumptions about the way sexual assault survivors behave, for example the idea that if a woman did not scream for help or fight back then the assault did not constitute rape. Constance went on to announce amendments to the bill to allow for more detailed research into jury deliberations, as well as further work to challenge rape myths, for example, \u201cinterventions or educational resources for jurors and the wider public\u201d. Responding to the announcement, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, said: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that a pilot of judge-led trials, a significant part of the bill, has been dropped.

The announcement comes after a landmark decision by Scottish judges that the distress displayed by a complainer to a witness can be used to corroborate whether a rape took place, which is expected to result in more cases going to court. Corroboration requires prosecutors to provide another independent source of evidence to prove a crime took place, which can come in the form of forensic or witness evidence.

The injunction, granted to the woman\u2019s common law partner, blocks the Vancouver physician Ellen Wiebe, or any other medical professional, from \u201ccausing the death\u201d of an Alberta woman within the next 30 days. The court order comes as the country remains in a fractious debate over the expansion of medical assistance in dying, or Maid.

      "body": "<p>As they lock in to Yatton\u2019s remorseless groove, you get the sense that the audience could leave and Beak&gt; wouldn\u2019t break stride. Night one of the experimental rock band\u2019s final tour with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/geoff-barrow\">Geoff Barrow</a> \u2013 their drummer and, thanks to the lingering power of his work with Portishead, their foot in the door when they began in 2007 \u2013 is a celebration of noise, focus and, most importantly, the things that can be achieved when musicians really get each other.</p> <p>With Barrow stage left, bassist-vocalist Billy Fuller seated in the middle and multi-instrumentalist Will Young standing off to one side before a table of gadgets that look like they might once have sent a cosmonaut into orbit, the trio play spiky, difficult songs with the low-stakes freedom of three mates with a block booking at a rehearsal space.</p> <p>The set is split in two, with almost all of Beak&gt;\u2019s recently released fourth album &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; played front to back before a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d segment devoid of any actual hits. \u201cAll you have to do is be polite for the first bit,\u201d Barrow says, but the decision is a have-your-cake-and-eat-it success, allowing new songs such as the nuanced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADTrY_7IrY&amp;ab_channel=BEAK%3E-Topic\">Hungry Are We</a> to seep in without anything too cacophonous either side of them.</p> <p>Backed by flashing neon strip lights, which hang from wire trellises in mid-80s Top of the Pops fashion, Secrets is a weightless synth-pop song, its hook all the more effective for its half-mumbled delivery. \u201cThat was the ghost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/13/the-human-league-how-we-made-dont-you-want-me\">Phil Oakey</a>,\u201d Fuller quips, and he\u2019s not wide of the mark.</p> <p>The latter stages are a thunderous charge for the finish. All\u00e9 Sauvage is dialled up into a rumbling kosmische jam, while Wulfstan II is all fuzz and low-level threat, like the Stooges if they were into craft beer instead of heroin. Once the final note lands, the band get up and wander off. There isn\u2019t anything like sentiment, certainly not a sweat-soaked bow, to send Barrow on his way. That would be a bit much given this was just some friends mucking about.</p> <p>\u2022 Beak&gt; play <a href=\"https://www.academymusicgroup.com/o2forumkentishtown/events/1489612/beak-tickets\">Kentish Town Forum, London</a>, 1 Nov. <a href=\"https://www.songkick.com/artists/747717-beak\">Then touring</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As they lock in to Yatton\u2019s remorseless groove, you get the sense that the audience could leave and Beak&gt; wouldn\u2019t break stride. Night one of the experimental rock band\u2019s final tour with Geoff Barrow \u2013 their drummer and, thanks to the lingering power of his work with Portishead, their foot in the door when they began in 2007 \u2013 is a celebration of noise, focus and, most importantly, the things that can be achieved when musicians really get each other. With Barrow stage left, bassist-vocalist Billy Fuller seated in the middle and multi-instrumentalist Will Young standing off to one side before a table of gadgets that look like they might once have sent a cosmonaut into orbit, the trio play spiky, difficult songs with the low-stakes freedom of three mates with a block booking at a rehearsal space. The set is split in two, with almost all of Beak&gt;\u2019s recently released fourth album &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; played front to back before a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d segment devoid of any actual hits. \u201cAll you have to do is be polite for the first bit,\u201d Barrow says, but the decision is a have-your-cake-and-eat-it success, allowing new songs such as the nuanced Hungry Are We to seep in without anything too cacophonous either side of them. Backed by flashing neon strip lights, which hang from wire trellises in mid-80s Top of the Pops fashion, Secrets is a weightless synth-pop song, its hook all the more effective for its half-mumbled delivery. \u201cThat was the ghost of Phil Oakey,\u201d Fuller quips, and he\u2019s not wide of the mark. The latter stages are a thunderous charge for the finish. All\u00e9 Sauvage is dialled up into a rumbling kosmische jam, while Wulfstan II is all fuzz and low-level threat, like the Stooges if they were into craft beer instead of heroin. Once the final note lands, the band get up and wander off. There isn\u2019t anything like sentiment, certainly not a sweat-soaked bow, to send Barrow on his way. That would be a bit much given this was just some friends mucking about. \u2022 Beak&gt; play Kentish Town Forum, London, 1 Nov. Then touring.",

      "bodyText": "The biggest typhoon to hit Taiwan in decades has crossed over the island, leaving behind a path of destruction but minimal reported deaths or injuries. Typhoon Kong-rey was the largest in size to make landfall in Taiwan since 1996, and also struck later in the typhoon season, which typically stretches from May to October, than any other typhoon since record-keeping began in the 1950s. Kong-rey had been declared a \u201cstrong typhoon\u201d by Taiwan\u2019s Central Weather Administration (CWA) before it made landfall near the city of Taitung on Taiwan\u2019s south-eastern coast, at about 1.40pm on Thursday. Although it weakened slightly, the storm maintained typhoon strength as it crossed Taiwan\u2019s central mountain range and entered the Taiwan strait to the island\u2019s west. Its outer bands covered the length of Taiwan\u2019s main island and were still bringing destructive rain and winds well into the evening. Trees, power lines, and buildings were damaged or brought down, including in the capital, Taipei, hundreds of kilometres to the north of the storm\u2019s eye. Severe landslides and flooding were reported, mainly in regions closer to Kong-rey\u2019s centre. \u201cIt didn\u2019t rain too heavily at first, but suddenly I heard the sound of flooding, which sounded like thunder or a train passing by,\u201d said one resident outside a building that had been reduced to rubble. Workplaces, schools and some transport services were shut across Taiwan on Thursday in preparation for Kong-rey\u2019s arrival, and authorities had advised people to stay inside because of the high risk of landslides, storm surges, destructive winds and flooding, with more than 1.2 metres of rainfall expected. More than 200 injuries had been recorded as a result of the typhoon by the time it made landfall, and one person died after the vehicle they were in hit a fallen tree. Almost half a million homes were without power on Thursday afternoon. Storm trackers measured Kong-rey as the equivalent of a category 3 to 4 hurricane. As it approached the coast, reports measured gusts of more than 225kph (140mph) and sustained winds of 183kph near its centre. The large typhoon \u2013 with a radius of more than 320km and an eye of about 64km \u2013 prompted a warning for all of Taiwan\u2019s main and outer islands. Lanyu Island, which sits off Taitung and was in the direct path of Kong-rey, reported record high sustained winds of more than 213kph, as well as gusts above 260kph before wind speed indicators went offline. \u201cThe size of the storm is very large and the winds are high,\u201d said a CWA forecaster, Gene Huang. More than 9,000 people were evacuated. Scheduled military exercises were cancelled owing to the typhoon \u2013 for the second time this year \u2013 and more than 30,000 troops were diverted to stand by for disaster response. By Thursday morning, authorities had already issued 63 landslide warnings, and recorded four landslips. Two Czech nationals who could not be reached after they went hiking inside Taroko national park, near Hualien, were later found unharmed. Hundreds of domestic and international flights were cancelled or rescheduled, and fishing boats and ferries recalled to harbours on Wednesday. Ship traffic trackers showed the usually busy waters around Taiwan were almost entirely empty on the island\u2019s east side. The last typhoon to hit Taiwan directly was Krathon, earlier this month, which killed four people and injured more than 700. Additional reporting by Chi-hui Lin and Reuters",

The disclosure comes after the Guardian revealed serious question marks about Musk\u2019s voter turnout effort in Nevada and Arizona amid reports that up to 25% of reported door knocks in the state could be fraudulent. The Michigan canvassers were hired by Blitz Canvassing, a subcontractor that has so far been paid about $9m by Musk\u2019s Pac to oversee his ground operation aimed at generating turnout in the state. Recruits reported being told to knock on 1,000 doors a week and to achieve a 17-22% engagement rate \u2013 considered a high benchmark for householders opening the door to strangers \u2013 to avoid having to pay for their own accommodation and flights home. \u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen is, they\u2019re gonna stop paying for these [motel] rooms, and then you\u2019re gonna end up having to pay for it yourself,\u201d a manager is heard saying in a recording obtained by Wired. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that with no money.\u201d The canvassers also reported being driven to neighbourhoods to carry out door-knocking expeditions in the back of a U-Haul van without seat beats, rather than in rental cars, as had been promised.

      "bodyText": "A commuter car park in Essex is to be one of the first test cases of whether the government will enforce new legislation aimed at protecting national parks and landscapes in England. Dedham Vale is a designated \u201cnational landscape\u201d on the border of Essex and Suffolk, home to increasingly rare species including hazel dormice and hedgehogs. Within it is Manningtree station, where the train operator Greater Anglia built an extension to the car park to cope with increased traffic. Campaigners say the 200-metre long wall and a bike shed built as part of the extension inhibits public access to St Edmund Way, an ancient pilgrimage path, generates light pollution and threatens habitats. They are now locked in dispute with the planning inspectorate over whether the development should be allowed to stay and have applied for a judicial review, which is likely to be heard early next year. The seemingly localised case has much wider implications because it will be a test for new legislation that requires local authorities and all other public bodies in England to \u201cseek to further\u201d the aims of protecting landscapes in every decision taken that could have an impact on those landscapes. Campaigners want to use this duty, contained in section 245 of the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, to force public bodies to take much greater action to improve national parks and protected landscapes, formerly known as areas of outstanding national beauty. In the case of Dedham Vale, the local preservation society said the legislation, which came into force late last year, should mean the end of the 200-metre wall, arguing that the government\u2019s planning inspectorate did not take into account the new duties when deciding the extension to the car park could stay. Charles Clover, the chair of the Dedham Vale Society, and a longstanding environmental campaigner and writer, said: \u201cThere are shades of Mr Bates and the Post Office about this.

That is why we will protect our most beautiful landscapes, create more nature-rich habitats and help our national parks become wilder, greener and more accessible to all as we deliver our commitment to protect 30% of land for nature by 2030.\u201d",

As part of its strategic review, Northvolt has decided to prioritise funding of its wholly owned cell operations in Skellefte\u00e5 (Northvolt Ett), V\u00e4ster\u00e5s (Northvolt Labs), Heide (Northvolt Drei) and Montreal (Northvolt Six). \u201cThe past year has brought notable change, with challenges to the overall EV market as well as our strategic review process. We remain in active and constructive dialogue with Volvo Cars on the way forward for Novo Energy, while construction is progressing on the site in Gothenburg, under the excellent leadership of the Novo team.\u201d.\u201d",

Everybody around us lived the same way, but you don\u2019t think about that until you\u2019re away. We had good parents, but we didn\u2019t have all the big luxuries that I\u2019m able to afford now.

I think the one that\u2019s most personal to me is the lil\u2019 Coat of Many Colors, because it talks about my mom, my parents, and kind of gives you an insight. It also covers bullying, acceptance and all that. Of course, the one that\u2019s most recorded is Jolene. That seems to be the favourite \u2013 do you know that song has been recorded, somebody told me, 450 times in the last 52 years? I\u2019m so proud of it. And I Will Always Love You is one is the great love songs, so I\u2019m very proud of that too.</p>    <p><strong>I\u2019ve heard it said many times that you wrote Jolene and I Will Always Love You on the same day. Is this true?</strong> <em>garythenotrashcougar<br></em>I don\u2019t know if I wrote them on the same day \u2013 but they were found on the same cassette, and so I wrote them during that period of time.</p> <p><strong>What did you think about the revelation that playing Jolene at 33rpm turns it into a haunting masterpiece? </strong><em>Edspin<br></em>Years ago, they started playing my songs at 33rpm.

Buddy, he really paid attention.\u201d My voice is so high-pitched and I have all those little trills \u2013 it sounds better as a man\u2019s voice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/07/dolly-parton-wines-uk-prosecco-rose-kylie\">Drinking wine to 5: Dolly Parton launches prosecco and ros\u00e9 range in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>If you were a wine, what would you taste of?</strong> <em>MrSOBaldrick<br></em>I\u2019d be bubbly and sparkly, don\u2019t you think? I have written many songs that have a line about wine \u2013 in fact, me and my little niece wrote one not long ago, about drinking homemade wine. And I\u2019ve certainly <em>had</em> a little wine while I was writing songs.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it\u2019s true that British food is terrible? </strong><em>jwillchad<br></em>I\u2019ve had some great British food. We love it when we go over there. It\u2019s like anywhere, you have to know what to get. The best recipes we have here in Nashville are things like meatloaf with mashed potatoes and coleslaw, or chicken and dumplings. People always say: \u201cWhat\u2019s your husband buying you for Christmas?\u201d They think it\u2019s diamonds or whatever. Well, actually I like simple things \u2013 he just buys me things for the kitchen, like some oven mitts. I\u2019m easy to buy for: I like baskets, lil\u2019 tote bags, cheap costume jewellery and things for the kitchen, \u2019cause I love to cook.</p> <p><strong>How did you react to the news that Dolly the sheep was named after you? </strong><em>asparagusnextleft<br></em>I was flattered. You know, when the scientists cloned Dolly the sheep, they used the mammary glands. That\u2019s what they call them \u2026 glands \u2026 the boobs. They said: \u201cOh, we have this sheep, Dolly \u2026\u201d Everybody always played up to these [points to her chest], so that\u2019s why we had Dolly the sheep. I was sorry when she died, though I don\u2019t want be cloned myself. I want to get on out of here when I can. We already get a lot of Dolly lookalikes, a lot of Dolly drag queens. I can just send them down to the store instead of me.</p>    <p><strong>I\u2019ve always wondered: recording Jolene, did you dance your ass off with the almighty swing and sass of those guitar parts? The rhythm track is amazing. It utterly makes the song and is the vital part that everybody who covers it doesn\u2019t quite get. </strong><em>sfedroid<br></em>The thing I remember most was all the musicians when I came up with the little guitar lick, the Jolene lick, saying: \u201cDamn, that\u2019s so good. That\u2019s the coolest little lick.\u201d I was playing guitar pretty serious back then, before I had all the long nails. I remember all the guys learning to play it and everybody thinking how cool a rhythm it was. It was a little out of the norm for the things we\u2019d been doing up to that time. I remember everybody in the studio just loving that song.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019d love to know if you have a bucket list and if so, will you share something on it? </strong><em>LemonCactus<br></em>I guess if there was anything I wanted to do, I would. I think I just need a new bucket! I have a few little tattoos already \u2013 a few little flowers and butterflies and things. I only do it to cover little scars and little things I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t have total tattoos all under my clothes.

Your new album, Dolly Parton and Family: Smoky Mountain DNA \u2013 Family, Faith and Fables, not only highlights the family musical roots in the Great Smoky Mountains, but is a showcase for other talented family members. I am beginning to worry that these two albums are a wrapping-up exercise and that you\u2019re planning to retire. Please tell me I\u2019m wrong. </strong><em>SpottedRichard<br></em>Oh, my Lord, I can\u2019t retire. I always say I\u2019ve dreamed myself into a corner. I\u2019ve got to keep all those dreams alive. Every dream spins off into some something else. It\u2019s misinformation when I said I was not touring any more. I still do shows \u2013 I just don\u2019t go on the full-blown tours where I go overseas for weeks. I\u2019m older, my husband\u2019s older, and I want to be with him more. So, no. I couldn\u2019t retire if I wanted to. And I don\u2019t want to.</p> <p>\u2022 Dolly Wines are available at Asda.

MrSOBaldrick I\u2019d be bubbly and sparkly, don\u2019t you think? I have written many songs that have a line about wine \u2013 in fact, me and my little niece wrote one not long ago, about drinking homemade wine. And I\u2019ve certainly had a little wine while I was writing songs. Do you think it\u2019s true that British food is terrible? jwillchad I\u2019ve had some great British food. We love it when we go over there. It\u2019s like anywhere, you have to know what to get. The best recipes we have here in Nashville are things like meatloaf with mashed potatoes and coleslaw, or chicken and dumplings. People always say: \u201cWhat\u2019s your husband buying you for Christmas?\u201d They think it\u2019s diamonds or whatever. Well, actually I like simple things \u2013 he just buys me things for the kitchen, like some oven mitts. I\u2019m easy to buy for: I like baskets, lil\u2019 tote bags, cheap costume jewellery and things for the kitchen, \u2019cause I love to cook. How did you react to the news that Dolly the sheep was named after you? asparagusnextleft I was flattered. You know, when the scientists cloned Dolly the sheep, they used the mammary glands. That\u2019s what they call them \u2026 glands \u2026 the boobs. They said: \u201cOh, we have this sheep, Dolly \u2026\u201d Everybody always played up to these [points to her chest], so that\u2019s why we had Dolly the sheep. I was sorry when she died, though I don\u2019t want be cloned myself. I want to get on out of here when I can. We already get a lot of Dolly lookalikes, a lot of Dolly drag queens. I can just send them down to the store instead of me. I\u2019ve always wondered: recording Jolene, did you dance your ass off with the almighty swing and sass of those guitar parts? The rhythm track is amazing. It utterly makes the song and is the vital part that everybody who covers it doesn\u2019t quite get. sfedroid The thing I remember most was all the musicians when I came up with the little guitar lick, the Jolene lick, saying: \u201cDamn, that\u2019s so good. That\u2019s the coolest little lick.\u201d I was playing guitar pretty serious back then, before I had all the long nails. I remember all the guys learning to play it and everybody thinking how cool a rhythm it was. It was a little out of the norm for the things we\u2019d been doing up to that time. I remember everybody in the studio just loving that song. I\u2019d love to know if you have a bucket list and if so, will you share something on it? LemonCactus I guess if there was anything I wanted to do, I would. I think I just need a new bucket! I have a few little tattoos already \u2013 a few little flowers and butterflies and things. I only do it to cover little scars and little things I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t have total tattoos all under my clothes. I\u2019m not a biker chick! Your previous album, Rockstar, was in many ways a homage to other artists you admire. Your new album, Dolly Parton and Family: Smoky Mountain DNA \u2013 Family, Faith and Fables, not only highlights the family musical roots in the Great Smoky Mountains, but is a showcase for other talented family members. I am beginning to worry that these two albums are a wrapping-up exercise and that you\u2019re planning to retire. Please tell me I\u2019m wrong. SpottedRichard Oh, my Lord, I can\u2019t retire. I always say I\u2019ve dreamed myself into a corner. I\u2019ve got to keep all those dreams alive. Every dream spins off into some something else. It\u2019s misinformation when I said I was not touring any more. I still do shows \u2013 I just don\u2019t go on the full-blown tours where I go overseas for weeks. I\u2019m older, my husband\u2019s older, and I want to be with him more. So, no. I couldn\u2019t retire if I wanted to. And I don\u2019t want to. \u2022 Dolly Wines are available at Asda. The album Dolly Parton and Family: Smoky Mountain DNA \u2013 Family, Faith and Fables is released 15 November",

Last year Stokes rejected a three-year deal when the England and Wales Cricket Board offered multi-year contracts for the first time, instead opting to sign for 12 months. It was believed he kept his options open ahead of a new memorandum of understanding being agreed. On Thursday it was confirmed Stokes had signed a new two-year deal that takes him through to 2026 and includes the away Ashes in Australia next winter. Central contracts allow the ECB to control which franchise leagues their players compete in, meaning they can manage their workloads across the year. Buttler has renewed the two-year contract he signed last year, in a show of fresh commitment to the white-ball team with Brendon McCullum joining as head coach in January. Announcing the contracts, Rob Key, managing director of England men\u2019s cricket, said: \u201cBoth our captains have signed two-year central contracts that showcase the commitment of all the players to prioritise playing for their country. \u201cI want to congratulate all the players who have signed new central contracts ahead of what is set to be an exciting period for England Men\u2019s cricket.\u201d Five players \u2013 Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Shoaib Bashir, Phil Salt and Olly Stone \u2013 have been given central contracts for the first time.

Chris McGreal is on the ground in Saginaw in the run up to November's election examining the issues that voters of all political backgrounds care about.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/saginaw-michigan-voters-presidential-election-trump-harris-share\"><b>Saginaw voters: tell us which issues will decide the US election</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Voters in Saginaw \u2013 and Michigan as a whole \u2013 have endured months of relentless election ads attempting to land a punch in a matter of seconds with simplistic, and often distorted or outright false, claims. But none is a knockout blow and so the ads punch time and again \u2013 Kamala Harris is selling out American workers to China, Trump will stop workers being paid overtime \u2013 in an attempt to send voters reeling from one candidate to the other. Or at least get them out to vote.</p> \n<p>Most of the year, television news bulletins are bookended by ads for prescription drugs aimed at the older demographic that still sits down to watch the nightly news. But with the election only days away, the promotion of medicines and cheap mattresses has been pushed aside by the torrent of political advertising. They\u2019re everywhere. In the middle of movies, during reruns of Family Ties, even on the weather channels.</p> \n<p>Occasionally, the ads illuminate. Some of the Harris spots focus on how she intends to help people buy their first homes or get a small business off the ground. But mostly, they stoke fears and prejudices.</p> \n<p>Trump-supporting ads repeatedly attempt to pin responsibility for the \u201cimmigration crisis\u201d on Harris as the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cborder tsar\u201d, even though administration of the frontier was not her job and there are few immigrants in places like Saginaw.</p> \n<p>The screen fills with crime victims and a caption denouncing \u201cKamala\u2019s open border agenda\u201d as a voice intones that \u201cthey were bludgeoned, raped, strangled, stabbed, shot, murdered\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore American lives will be lost if she isn\u2019t stopped. Kamala Harris created the border crisis. She won\u2019t fix it now,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Much of this is not paid for by the campaigns themselves but political action committees (Pacs) permitted to raise and spend millions in support of a candidate provided they do not directly coordinate with the campaigns. But the source of the money is often shadowy.</p> \n<p>Neither are some ads what they seem. One focused on the Detroit area proclaimed: \u201cKamala Harris stands with Israel.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the ad, funded by a Trump-supporting Pac, was intended to undercut support for Harris within Michigan\u2019s sizeable Arab American community over Israel <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/at-least-43000-palestinians-killed-more-than-half-women-and-children-in-war-in-gaza-palestinian-health-ministry-says\">killing more than 43,000 Palestinians</a> in Gaza, the majority of them women and children.</p> \n<p>The same group, FC Pac, was also behind a message emphasising that the vice-president\u2019s husband in Jewish, and another featuring Harris and Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic member of Congress who is running for a Michigan seat in the US Senate.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen protesters went after Israel, Harris and Slotkin didn\u2019t back down. Harris and Slotkin are the pro-Israel team we can trust!\u201d one message said.</p> \n<p>In response, Harris has been running spots in Arabic denouncing Trump over the supreme court striking down the constitutional right to an abortion and his plans to cut social security.</p> \n<p>There is occasional relief with an attempt to raise a smile.</p> \n<p>Kristen McDonald Rivet, the Democratic candidate for Congress for the seat that includes Saginaw county, recorded an ad in a bar affirming broader Michigander loyalties.</p> \n<p>\u201cI root for the Lions. I hate Ohio. And I think most politicians are full of shit,\u201d she said, with the \u201cshit\u201d half bleeped out, before grabbing a pint of beer sliding down the bar.</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDZjzyfnhuU\">earlier ad</a>, McDonald Rivet\u2019s husband dived out of a moving car to escape her endless talk about cutting taxes.</p> \n<p>In an altogether more sinister vein, Duty to America, which has spent $23m on ads attacking Harris, is broadcasting one that shows a series of photographs of white people who are said to have been \u201cleft behind\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if we do everything right, Harris and the Democrats find new ways to make us pay. For what? No matter what we do, Democrats are against us. So this November, we\u2019re against them,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Even when viewers get a break from the onslaught, there are still echoes. One pro-Trump ad gave way to a local college promoting its training course in medical billing, a reminder of the US\u2019s politically contentious private healthcare system.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not clear how many minds the ads are changing, if any. But the election in bellwether Saginaw, and swing state Michigan, is highly likely to be decided by turnout. Trump won both in 2016 when Democratic voters stayed away but lost four years later, even though he increased his vote tally, because Democrats turned out in much larger numbers to remove him from power.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, a liberal group, Future Forward USA Action, which has spent more than $370m in support of Democrats during this election cycle, has taken a different tack.</p> \n<p>The screen fills with black letters on a grey screen telling those who do not vote that they will have helped put Trump back in the White House if he wins, and their families will blame them.</p> \n<p>\u201cWho you vote for is private, but if you vote is public information. After this election, your voting record will be updated. And your friends and family will be able to look up how often you vote. So vote,\u201d it said.</p>",

In response, Harris has been running spots in Arabic denouncing Trump over the supreme court striking down the constitutional right to an abortion and his plans to cut social security. There is occasional relief with an attempt to raise a smile. Kristen McDonald Rivet, the Democratic candidate for Congress for the seat that includes Saginaw county, recorded an ad in a bar affirming broader Michigander loyalties. \u201cI root for the Lions. I hate Ohio. And I think most politicians are full of shit,\u201d she said, with the \u201cshit\u201d half bleeped out, before grabbing a pint of beer sliding down the bar. In an earlier ad, McDonald Rivet\u2019s husband dived out of a moving car to escape her endless talk about cutting taxes. In an altogether more sinister vein, Duty to America, which has spent $23m on ads attacking Harris, is broadcasting one that shows a series of photographs of white people who are said to have been \u201cleft behind\u201d. \u201cEven if we do everything right, Harris and the Democrats find new ways to make us pay. For what? No matter what we do, Democrats are against us. So this November, we\u2019re against them,\u201d it said. Even when viewers get a break from the onslaught, there are still echoes. One pro-Trump ad gave way to a local college promoting its training course in medical billing, a reminder of the US\u2019s politically contentious private healthcare system. It\u2019s not clear how many minds the ads are changing, if any. But the election in bellwether Saginaw, and swing state Michigan, is highly likely to be decided by turnout. Trump won both in 2016 when Democratic voters stayed away but lost four years later, even though he increased his vote tally, because Democrats turned out in much larger numbers to remove him from power. With that in mind, a liberal group, Future Forward USA Action, which has spent more than $370m in support of Democrats during this election cycle, has taken a different tack. The screen fills with black letters on a grey screen telling those who do not vote that they will have helped put Trump back in the White House if he wins, and their families will blame them. \u201cWho you vote for is private, but if you vote is public information. After this election, your voting record will be updated. And your friends and family will be able to look up how often you vote. So vote,\u201d it said.",

The latest edition of the twice-yearly Hunger Hotspots report, published on Thursday, provides early warnings on food crises and situations around the world where food insecurity is likely to worsen, with a focus on the most severe and deteriorating situations of acute hunger. An 18-month conflict has driven hunger in Sudan by disrupting food systems, causing displacement, and blocking access for humanitarian support. Weather extremes, such as floods, have also played a role in worsening food insecurity. To identify hunger hotspots around the world, food security experts and analysts from the FAO and WFP conducted risk analysis of conflict, political violence, economic shocks and natural hazards, and assessed the current or probable disruptions to agricultural activities caused by those risks. They found 22 hunger hotspots where acute food insecurity is projected to worsen between November 2024 and May 2025. Sudan, South Sudan, Mali, Palestine and Haiti were rated at the level of highest concern, meaning they face famine or the risk of famine, or have populations in catastrophe. \u201cPeople are experiencing an extreme lack of food and face unprecedented enduring starvation,\u201d said Qu Dongyu, the director general of the FAO. Sudan is in the midst of a deadly war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that has lasted 18 months and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. In one town, children are reported to have been dying of hunger every day. The challenges have intensified in recent months: famine was declared at one displacement camp and heavy rains caused floods that led to deaths and displacement. The report says intensification of the war would cause further mass displacement and worsen the regional humanitarian crisis, leading to increased cross-border movements to Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia and Central African Republic. \u201cWithout immediate humanitarian efforts and concerted international action to address severe access constraints and advocate for the de-escalation of conflict and insecurity, further starvation and loss of life are likely in Palestine, the Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali,\u201d said Aur\u00e9lien Mellin, emergency and rehabilitation officer at the FAO. The analysis classified Chad, Nigeria, Mozambique, Lebanon, Myanmar, Syria and Yemen as hotspots of very high concern, meaning large populations there are facing or are forecast to face critical levels of acute food insecurity. Two countries \u2013 Namibia and Lesotho \u2013 appear in the hunger hotspots list for the first time due to the negative impact of weather events and a significant decrease in agricultural production this year. The other countries in the third highest category of concern are Kenya, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The report says that a La Ni\u00f1a event \u2013 the naturally occurring climate phenomenon that affects rainfall patterns and temperatures \u2013 is expected from November 2024 to March 2025.

The absence of authority as City got themselves back into the game was stark and alarming. Now it truly was a difficult moment.</p> <p>Spurs had won seven of their previous nine matches in all competitions and yet the two that got away seemed to have had the greater impact on the climate around the club. There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/crystal-palace-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">the 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace</a> on Sunday, the worst performance of the season. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/06/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">the 3-2 defeat at Brighton</a> at the start of October, when a 2-0 half-time lead was extravagantly frittered away. As Spurs headed for the dressing room, the prospect of a repeat was real.</p> <p>\u201cI am very angry that we conceded the goal in the last second \u2013 we can\u2019t do that,\u201d the midfielder Dejan Kulusevksi said. \u201cIt changes everything when you\u2019re going to go in at half-time at 2-0 and then it\u2019s 2-1.\u201d</p> <p>Postecoglou knows his team will mature and develop leadership skills only by confronting adversity. The alternative of the club signing experienced players with such qualities (probably for big fees) is not a part of the project. And so it was no exaggeration to describe half-time against City as a pivotal juncture.</p>    <p>\u201cWe were, of course, angry,\u201d Kulusevski said. \u201cBut people said: \u2018Listen, we are winning 2-1, keep going.\u2019 The manager said we had to keep playing our way \u2013 don\u2019t defend too deep, keep pressing.\u201d</p> <p>Spurs found new energy. They rediscovered their thrust, creating a fistful of chances before the hour. Now came a different problem to stress their fans, Postecoglou, too \u2013 profligacy. Timo Werner had scored the opener but he was the biggest culprit. Even Kulusevski, outstanding in the No 10 role, could not finish when one-on-one with Stefan Ortega.</p> <p>It felt as if the whole game was an internal struggle for Spurs, a battle to break down barriers. Again, the nerves jangled as the end approached. Again, it felt inevitable that City would at least have the chance to equalise. They did when Guglielmo Vicario flapped at an 88th-minute corner and the ball broke for Nico O\u2019Reilly, whose shot was goalbound only for the substitute Yves Bissouma to clear off the line.</p> <p>Had O\u2019Reilly scored and City won on penalties, Spurs would still be kicking themselves because they were the better team; there was plenty for Postecoglou to like. We all know how the story would have been told if they had been unhinged. But they got it over the line to set up a home quarter-final against Manchester United and it was surely a result to bolster the belief, to bring stability in the face of the edginess.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but it should not be like that \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be up and down,\u201d Kulusevski said. \u201cIf you want to be a champion you have to be there every game. That\u2019s the main part that everyone has to understand.\u201d</p> <p>Kulusevski was certainly up for it against City. He always is. The 24-year-old, for example, has scored in all three of his away games against them. \u201cI take it personally to play against City,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to play against the best \u2026 it\u2019s just extra motivating.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a personal thing. Everybody that\u2019s close to me knows it. I had prepared for this game for a long time. I had it in my head for a long time. There\u2019s no fear; it\u2019s the complete opposite of fear. I knew I had to perform and I did.\u201d</p> <p>Where Spurs have struggled, Kulusevski says, is away from home against the deeper-sitting, more physical teams. Such as Palace, perhaps. There is a related question mark against how Postecoglou sets up his midfield.</p> <p>Kulusevski has embraced his central attacking role to such an extent this season that he has to play there. But Postecoglou must also accommodate James Maddison. When he started both at Palace, with Bissouma as the holding player, it did not go well. There is an argument that Spurs could be better calibrated in a 4-2-3-1 with two from Bissouma, Pape Sarr and Rodrigo Bentancur in front of the defence.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to improve away from home against teams that play very physical and don\u2019t play the football that was played in the City game,\u201d Kulusevski said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of these games [against City] but I know we have to improve a lot in these away games.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to speak a lot about that in the team. We have to change some things when we play against the teams that play more difficult football. Did we discuss this after the Palace game? No, as we had to focus on City. But I would like to speak about it in the future.\u201d</p>",

They did when Guglielmo Vicario flapped at an 88th-minute corner and the ball broke for Nico O\u2019Reilly, whose shot was goalbound only for the substitute Yves Bissouma to clear off the line. Had O\u2019Reilly scored and City won on penalties, Spurs would still be kicking themselves because they were the better team; there was plenty for Postecoglou to like. We all know how the story would have been told if they had been unhinged. But they got it over the line to set up a home quarter-final against Manchester United and it was surely a result to bolster the belief, to bring stability in the face of the edginess. \u201cYeah, but it should not be like that \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be up and down,\u201d Kulusevski said. \u201cIf you want to be a champion you have to be there every game. That\u2019s the main part that everyone has to understand.\u201d Kulusevski was certainly up for it against City. He always is. The 24-year-old, for example, has scored in all three of his away games against them. \u201cI take it personally to play against City,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to play against the best \u2026 it\u2019s just extra motivating. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal thing. Everybody that\u2019s close to me knows it. I had prepared for this game for a long time. I had it in my head for a long time. There\u2019s no fear; it\u2019s the complete opposite of fear. I knew I had to perform and I did.\u201d Where Spurs have struggled, Kulusevski says, is away from home against the deeper-sitting, more physical teams. Such as Palace, perhaps. There is a related question mark against how Postecoglou sets up his midfield. Kulusevski has embraced his central attacking role to such an extent this season that he has to play there. But Postecoglou must also accommodate James Maddison. When he started both at Palace, with Bissouma as the holding player, it did not go well. There is an argument that Spurs could be better calibrated in a 4-2-3-1 with two from Bissouma, Pape Sarr and Rodrigo Bentancur in front of the defence. \u201cWe have to improve away from home against teams that play very physical and don\u2019t play the football that was played in the City game,\u201d Kulusevski said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of these games [against City] but I know we have to improve a lot in these away games. \u201cWe have to speak a lot about that in the team. We have to change some things when we play against the teams that play more difficult football. Did we discuss this after the Palace game? No, as we had to focus on City. But I would like to speak about it in the future.\u201d",

Guardian Australia reported three weeks ago Jo Tarnawsky\u2019s concerns she had not heard from her boss, Richard Marles, since May and had been barred from her office without 24 hours\u2019 notice, after she made a complaint about behaviour by some staff that she felt was bullying and was moved out of her job. She remains technically employed but is unable to perform her role and has been forced to take blocks of miscellaneous leave since the short-term contract for a specially created position ended last month.

If China\u2019s economy, already weak, is damaged further by a trade war with the US, Australia will be exposed.</p> \n<p><strong>Harris has criticised Trump\u2019s tariff policies, arguing they would act as a \u201csales tax on Americans\u201d and lead to higher prices and inflation.</strong> But the Biden administration has extended Trump-era tariffs and used tariffs to influence trade on industries it sees as strategic \u2013 particularly in relation to China. The administration extended tariffs on solar panels in 2022 and, in May this year, increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100%.</p> \n<p>As a senator, Harris opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement (involving Australia) negotiated by Barack Obama and from which Trump withdrew.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>Defence and Aukus</h2> \n<p><strong>While Trump has been critical of Nato, he has not criticised Australia as a military ally</strong> or the Aukus deal, a tripartite agreement (between the US, UK, and Australia) for Australia to acquire up to eight nuclear-powered submarines between now and the mid-2050s, the first in the 2030s.</p> \n<p>Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said his government believed Trump would honour the agreement: \u201cEvery engagement we\u2019ve had with the Trump camp in the normal process of speaking with people on both sides of politics in America, there is support for \u2026 Aukus,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/senate-races-elections-to-watch\">The key US Senate races that could determine who controls the chamber</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser \u2013 now a fierce critic of the former president \u2013 said of Aukus: \u201cI think it could be in jeopardy.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LowyInstitute/status/1813089377498898794\">Fullilove asked Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate JD Vance</a> this year for his position on the agreement.

More than 42,000 people have died in Gaza since, including more than 16,000 children.</p> \n<p><strong>Trump has expressed his support for Israel\u2019s invasion and bombardment of Gaza.</strong> He has also urged Israel to \u201cfinish up\u201d the war because it is losing support.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have to finish up your war \u2026 you\u2019ve got to get it done,\u201d he told the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to peace. You can\u2019t have this going on, and I will say Israel has to be very careful because you are losing a lot of the world. You are losing a lot of support.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump said of Harris: \u201cShe hates Israel. If she\u2019s president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his first term, Trump released a peace proposal he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/middleeast/peace-plan.html\">called a blueprint</a> for a two-state solution: it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/world/middleeast/trump-peace-plan-explained.html\">would not have created</a> an independent Palestinian state and was seen as strongly favouring Israel.</p> \n<p><strong>\u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself,\u201d Harris said in September\u2019s presidential debate.</strong></p> \n<p>She continued: \u201cHow it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children. Mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris has consistently reiterated support for a two-state solution.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<h2>The war in Ukraine</h2> \n<p>Nearly three years on since Russia invaded Ukraine \u2013 and a decade since its initial assault on Crimea \u2013 the US remains the largest backer of Ukraine\u2019s war effort. It is by far the single biggest contributor of money and materiel, outspending the next largest contributor, Germany, by five to one.</p> \n<p><strong>Trump has made it abundantly clear he wants the war over \u2013 or, more precisely, he wants to stop paying for it.</strong></p> \n<p>He told a rally: \u201cI think [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskyy is maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that\u2019s ever lived.

It is presumed a deal to stop the conflict would involve the ceding of Ukrainian territory to Russia.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s disposition towards Ukraine has broader implications for the collective security principle underpinning Nato.

Both see China as a competitor or even an adversary,\u201d Prof Zhao Minghao, from the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, told the Financial Times.</p> \n<p><strong>Trump was hawkish towards China in his first term</strong>, confronting Beijing over what he argued were a suite of unfair practices and abuses such as intellectual property theft, currency manipulation and economic espionage. He pledged to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-president-trumps-new-trade-plan-to-protect-american-workers\">completely eliminate dependence on China</a> in all critical areas\u201d including electronics, steel, pharmaceuticals and rare earths.

Billions have cast votes across scores of countries, including some of the largest, most powerful democracies on Earth. But America\u2019s remains the world\u2019s global election, the most forensically examined, the most consequential all over the world. America matters. \u201cThe US is still the most powerful actor in the international system,\u201d Dr Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, told the Guardian this week. \u201cIt is the richest company, with the biggest military, the biggest economy. \u201cIt is the only country that runs a truly global foreign policy, the only country that can project power anywhere on Earth. \u201cIt is the democratic, meritocratic superpower \u2026 it still attracts so many people around the world \u2026 the whole world is remarkably well-informed about the US election.\u201d And Australia\u2019s future is bound up in America\u2019s electoral decision. As one of America\u2019s closest allies \u2013 supporters might argue for \u201cstaunchest\u201d, opponents might claim \u201cuncritical\u201d \u2013 Australia\u2019s economic, security and multilateral landscape is tied to that of the US and the occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. How could the election of a second Donald Trump presidency impact Australia? Or how might the quasi-continuity of Vice-President Kamala Harris ascending to the White House? Trump, necessarily, is the object of much of Australia\u2019s focus. Harris, as Joe Biden\u2019s vice-president, is the continuity candidate \u2013 promoting policy positions in line with the current administration \u2013 meaning a Trump victory would raise many more questions. The election too, will be keenly fought over a host of domestic issues which have no direct \u2013 though some peripheral \u2013 impact on Australia. This includes issues such as reproductive rights (the overturning of Roe v Wade by the supreme court and a mooted national abortion ban), migration (particularly on the country\u2019s southern border), gun control and law and order \u2013 issues excluded in this piece. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Watching the crescendo of an increasingly vituperative election campaign, Fullilove said that politically \u201cAmerica is running a high temperature at the moment\u201d. \u201cMy real hope for the election is that there is a clear result, that the loser accepts defeat, that the transfer of power is peaceful \u2013 that might sound like a low bar \u2013 but it is critical, for America and for the world.\u201d *** Values and democracy Responding to the unpredictability of Trump\u2019s first presidency, Australian politicians repeated the refrain that the Australian-US alliance runs deeper than a president or prime minister and that it is one founded on shared values and democratic principles. Trump has said he would not be a dictator, \u201cexcept on day one\u201d. He said he would seek retribution on his political opponents: \u201croot out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections\u201d. As commander-in-chief, he said he would consider using the military to attack domestic enemies: \u201cIt should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military\u201d. Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, Gen John Kelly, said this week Trump was a \u201cfascist\u201d who \u201ccertainly prefers the dictator approach to government\u201d. Trump has repeatedly lied that he won the 2020 election and mused on \u201cterminating\u201d the constitution. He told a rally in July that if he was elected president again, \u201cyou won\u2019t have to vote any more\u201d. \u201cIn four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again. We\u2019ll have it fixed so good, you\u2019re not going have to vote.\u201d Harris has denounced Trump as a \u201cfascist\u201d who wants \u201cunchecked power\u201d and a military personally loyal to him. In her speech to the Democratic national convention, she cited the supreme court\u2019s split decision in July stating Trump enjoyed broad immunity for official acts taken while in office. \u201cConsider the power he [Trump] will have, especially after the United States supreme court ruled he will be immune from prosecution,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.\u201d *** Climate Climate change is \u201cone of the greatest scams of all time\u201d, Trump said last month. \u201cWe will drill, baby, drill,\u201d he told the Republican national convention when accepting the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cWe will do it at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d He has said he would prohibit, by executive order, all offshore wind projects on the first day of his presidency, saying they kill whales. In his first term, Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement (the US rejoined under Biden). But his campaign has indicated a second Trump presidency might re-abandon the Paris agreement, as well as the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) which underpins it \u2013 198 countries have committed to the UNFCCC: none has left it. The withdrawal of the US \u2013 the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the country that has contributed the largest share of historical emissions \u2013 would increase political uncertainty around the transition to net zero and deter investment. It would weaken the influence of the so-called umbrella group \u2013 of which Australia is a member \u2013 and give succour to climate laggards, such as the petrostates, to further slow global reduction efforts. Some have argued that much of the impetus and funding for global emissions reductions is locked in and emissions reductions efforts are working on timescales far longer than a four-year presidential cycle. But Michael Mann, distinguished professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University, has argued \u201ca second Trump term is game over for the climate\u201d. Harris has called climate change an \u201cexistential threat\u201d. As attorney general in California, she prosecuted oil companies for breaches of environmental laws. As vice-president, she was the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided about US$370bn to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. But during Harris\u2019s vice-presidency, the US produced and exported the most crude oil of any country at any time in history, according to the US Energy Information Administration\u2019s figures. Crude oil production averaged 12.9m barrels a day in 2023, breaking the previous global record of 12.3m, set in 2019. *** Trade and the economy Trump is a fierce economic nationalist, hostile to free trade and intensely focused on America\u2019s trade deficit, which he regards as a sign of weakness. He has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports to the US, with a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports and a 100% tariff on Chinese cars. Economists argue the policy will lead to higher prices and lower growth. The nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of an average US household by US$1,700 a year: poor Americans would be more affected than the rich. In September Trump said: \u201cTogether, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a car and a home.\u201d He has promised to reduce regulation and cut taxes but some economists argue that his tax cuts would benefit America\u2019s wealthiest while hurting the poorest. Australia is not dependent on direct trade with the US but the majority of Australia\u2019s trade is with China. If China\u2019s economy, already weak, is damaged further by a trade war with the US, Australia will be exposed. Harris has criticised Trump\u2019s tariff policies, arguing they would act as a \u201csales tax on Americans\u201d and lead to higher prices and inflation. But the Biden administration has extended Trump-era tariffs and used tariffs to influence trade on industries it sees as strategic \u2013 particularly in relation to China. The administration extended tariffs on solar panels in 2022 and, in May this year, increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100%. As a senator, Harris opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement (involving Australia) negotiated by Barack Obama and from which Trump withdrew. *** Defence and Aukus While Trump has been critical of Nato, he has not criticised Australia as a military ally or the Aukus deal, a tripartite agreement (between the US, UK, and Australia) for Australia to acquire up to eight nuclear-powered submarines between now and the mid-2050s, the first in the 2030s. Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said his government believed Trump would honour the agreement: \u201cEvery engagement we\u2019ve had with the Trump camp in the normal process of speaking with people on both sides of politics in America, there is support for \u2026 Aukus,\u201d he said. But John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser \u2013 now a fierce critic of the former president \u2013 said of Aukus: \u201cI think it could be in jeopardy.\u201d Fullilove asked Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate JD Vance this year for his position on the agreement. Vance replied he was \u201ca fan of Aukus\u201d. \u201cI suspect that Aukus would be safe under Trump too,\u201d Fullilove told the Guardian. \u201cAustralia is an example of an ally that is contributing to deterrence and contributing to the US industrial base. You could imagine Trump threatening to unpick it, but my conclusion is it is safe.\u201d Aukus was signed by the Biden-Harris administration. The administration\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy commits to the deal but does not give a timeline: \u201cThrough the Aukus partnership, we will identify the optimal pathway to deliver nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy at the earliest achievable date.\u201d Airbases in Australia were used for US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen this month. The defence department confirmed Australia provided support for the US strikes \u201cthrough access and overflight for US aircraft in northern Australia\u201d. *** Israel-Gaza Trump and Harris have declared their support for Israel and reiterated support for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. The US continues to supply Israel with billions of dollars of weapons and munitions as Israel carries out its bombardment of Gaza, Lebanon and, this week, strikes on Iran. The US is, by far, the largest supplier of arms to Israel: 69% of Israel\u2019s imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023 came from America, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The US has signed an agreement to provide Israel with $3.8bn in annual military aid under a 10-year-agreement. More than 1,200 Israelis died in the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas. More than 42,000 people have died in Gaza since, including more than 16,000 children. Trump has expressed his support for Israel\u2019s invasion and bombardment of Gaza. He has also urged Israel to \u201cfinish up\u201d the war because it is losing support. \u201cYou have to finish up your war \u2026 you\u2019ve got to get it done,\u201d he told the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to peace. You can\u2019t have this going on, and I will say Israel has to be very careful because you are losing a lot of the world. You are losing a lot of support.\u201d Trump said of Harris: \u201cShe hates Israel. If she\u2019s president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now.\u201d In his first term, Trump released a peace proposal he called a blueprint for a two-state solution: it would not have created an independent Palestinian state and was seen as strongly favouring Israel. \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself,\u201d Harris said in September\u2019s presidential debate. She continued: \u201cHow it does so matters. Because it is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. Children. Mothers. What we know is that this war must end. It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal and we need the hostages out.\u201d Harris has consistently reiterated support for a two-state solution. *** The war in Ukraine Nearly three years on since Russia invaded Ukraine \u2013 and a decade since its initial assault on Crimea \u2013 the US remains the largest backer of Ukraine\u2019s war effort. It is by far the single biggest contributor of money and materiel, outspending the next largest contributor, Germany, by five to one. Trump has made it abundantly clear he wants the war over \u2013 or, more precisely, he wants to stop paying for it. He told a rally: \u201cI think [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskyy is maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that\u2019s ever lived. Every time he comes to our country he walks away with $US60bn.\u201d Influencing Republican allies in Congress, Trump stalled the last funding package from passing for months while Ukrainian forces \u2013 critically short of ammunition and artillery \u2013 struggled to hold back Russian advances. Trump\u2019s manoeuvring was criticised as essentially backing Vladimir Putin\u2019s irredentism. Trump has also repeatedly claimed if re-elected he would end the war in a day \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll have that done in 24 hours\u201d \u2013 without detailing how. It is presumed a deal to stop the conflict would involve the ceding of Ukrainian territory to Russia. Trump\u2019s disposition towards Ukraine has broader implications for the collective security principle underpinning Nato. Trump has compared Nato to a protection racket and said he would not protect \u201cdelinquent\u201d allies. \u201cIn fact, I would encourage them [the Russians] to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay! You gotta pay your bills.\u201d Trump has repeatedly upbraided European countries for failing to live up to their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. Harris has pledged to continue Biden\u2019s support for Ukraine and for the Nato alliance. She said as vice-president \u201cI helped mobilise a global response \u2013 more than 50 countries \u2013 to defend against Putin\u2019s aggression. \u201cAnd as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies.\u201d Harris, however, has wavered on Ukraine being admitted as a member to Nato, saying the question was among the \u201cissues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point\u201d. *** China \u201cTrump and Kamala Harris are two bowls of poison for Beijing. Both see China as a competitor or even an adversary,\u201d Prof Zhao Minghao, from the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, told the Financial Times. Trump was hawkish towards China in his first term, confronting Beijing over what he argued were a suite of unfair practices and abuses such as intellectual property theft, currency manipulation and economic espionage. He pledged to \u201ccompletely eliminate dependence on China in all critical areas\u201d including electronics, steel, pharmaceuticals and rare earths. And he has flagged new laws to stop US companies from investing in China and a ban on federal contracts for any company that outsources to China. His first administration rejected Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea, condemning Beijing\u2019s \u201ccampaign of bullying\u201d of other countries. Harris spoke on China in September, saying her government would work to ensure the US \u201cis leading the world in the industries of the future and making sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century\u201d. \u201cChina is not moving slowly \u2026 if we are to compete, we can\u2019t afford to, either.\u201d She condemned Trump as having \u201cconstantly got played by China\u201d and said his administration had shipped advanced semiconductors to China, allowing them to upgrade their military. \u201cI will never hesitate to take swift and strong measures when China undermines the rules of the road at the expense of our workers, our communities, and our companies.\u201d *** The Pacific Climate change is an urgent existential threat for the islands of the Pacific. Trump does not mention the climate crisis in his platform, nor is it mentioned in Agenda47. The Heritage Foundation \u2013 the conservative thinktank behind the Trump-linked Project 2025 \u2013 has urged for partnership with the Pacific islands, but on American terms and in US interests. \u201cThe US must adopt a clear-eyed approach about putting American interests and objectives in the Pacific islands first,\u201d it said. The Biden-Harris administration have held two Pacific islands-US summits which have been big on ambition \u2013 with commitments of more than $1bn to resilience regionalism and sustainable development \u2013 but seen as lacking, so far, in application and results. The 2022 US-Pacific partnership declared a shared vision for \u201ca resilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity\u201d. Fullilove said while Harris sat within the mainstream traditions of US foreign policy, \u201cit\u2019s hard to get a really accurate fix on what she thinks about the world\u201d. \u201cAt a broad level, she believes in American leadership, she believes in alliances, she prefers democracy to dictators, she more pro-trade than Trump. But beyond that, it\u2019s very hard to know how she will approach Asia, the part of the world Australia is in, because she hasn\u2019t been a prominent foreign policy voice in the Biden administration.\u201d Read more of the Guardian\u2019s 2024 US election coverage: US election 2024 live updates: latest polls, results and news When do polls close?

      "body": "<p>In a quiet moment at the end of the first act of Australian Gospel, Lech Blaine\u2019s mother, Lenore, a \u201csaviour of the small details\u201d, sits at her desk and types up that day\u2019s diary entry about life with her husband, Tom, and their three foster kids, Steve, John and Trent. Hannah, the biological sister of Steve and John, hasn\u2019t yet arrived on the scene, nor has another foster daughter, Rebecca. Lech, Lenore and Tom\u2019s only biological offspring, hasn\u2019t been conceived. The household hasn\u2019t yet been upended by the violent harassment of Michael and Mary Shelley, the biological parents of Steve, John and Hannah.</p> <p>Australian Gospel tracks the relationship between the Shelleys and the Blaines over several tumultuous decades. Lenore told her family that one day she\u2019d be the one to write the story of the \u201cShelley Gang\u201d. She didn\u2019t live to do so, and Australian Gospel is dedicated to her. Fair enough, as Lenore\u2019s records of family life provide Blaine (the author of 2021\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/09/car-crash-by-lech-blaine-review-a-bruisingly-insightful-memoir-of-two-wreckages\">Car Crash: A Memoir</a>) with a rich fund of small details to draw on. As well as working through his mother\u2019s files, Blaine interviewed hundreds of people whose paths crossed the Shelleys\u2019, including his siblings and parents. He sifted through court records, foster care reports and newspaper archives to understand the events and relationships that form the narrative arc of Australian Gospel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/29/highways-and-byways-by-jimmy-barnes-review\">Highways and Byways by Jimmy Barnes review \u2013 compassionate collection from a master yarnsmith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What a sensational story it is, and hard to summarise without making the book sound like a crass potboiler overstuffed with colourful characters and melodrama. The bare bones go something like this: the Shelleys are itinerant missionaries who renounce their posh upbringings to crusade against contemporary decadence, losing custody of their children along the way. Their various court appearances \u2013 to answer charges of vagrancy, harassment, stalking and trespass \u2013 were tabloid fodder during the 1980s and 90s.</p> <p>The Blaines are working-class publicans who move around regional Queensland with their growing family of foster kids and dalmatians, accompanied by a huge crowd of cousins, comrades and friends. In their atheist egalitarianism, joie de vivre and love of sport, they epitomise everything the Shelleys despise about Australian culture. When the Shelleys discover their kids are living with the Blaines, they terrorise the family in a campaign to regain custody of their children.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The Shelleys turn up to the house, threaten Tom and Lenore, frighten the kids; one afternoon, Hannah finds Mary lying in her bed. The family moves house and successfully seeks restraining orders against the Shelleys but the harassment doesn\u2019t stop. The Shelleys turn up uninvited at Tom\u2019s pub and in Steven\u2019s university lectures, and generate an unending torrent of abusive correspondence. They send letters to everyone in Queensland with the surname Blaine, telling them Tom is a paedophile, and orchestrate the kidnapping of another child fostered with a different family. They harass politicians, church leaders and doctors. There are celebrity cameos, marriages, unfair deaths, a few births and a ton of marvellous small details.</p> <p>It is to Blaine\u2019s enormous credit that he tells this sensational story with compassion, intelligence and great wit. Australian Gospel is a captivating work of narrative nonfiction, at once a tremendously moving story of family life, and a profound meditation on family-making and the legacies of love, grief and trauma that get passed from one generation to the next.</p> <p>The Gospels offer four competing accounts of the life of Jesus Christ. Early on, Blaine tells us that he worked on his book in an office with \u201cfour cork boards on the walls\u201d: \u201cThe Gospel of Michael. The Gospel of Mary. The Gospel of Tom. The Gospel of Lenore.\u201d Australian Gospel tells the story of these four parents and their kids in a way that seeks to accommodate their irreconcilable perspectives. And so there\u2019s room in the book not just for Mary and Michael\u2019s poisonous behaviour but for their devotion to their children, and their heartbreak at being separated from them.</p> <p>In a note at the end of the book, Blaine acknowledges that many of the accounts he relied upon contradict each other. Australian Gospel is, he insists, a work of creative nonfiction, not history or journalism. To some readers this might sound like a cop-out. To me, it reveals an honest reckoning with how a story like this, thick with love and conflict, can be told, especially by an author who is deeply attached to its protagonists.</p> <p>Many messiahs compete for the reader\u2019s attention in Australian Gospel \u2013 and yet the impulse of Blaine\u2019s book is assiduously anti-messianic. Here is an author who knows that moral clarity can be a fig leaf for hypocrisy, and worse. In Australia, Blaine writes, \u201cthere was a thin line between the winners and the losers; the good Samaritans and the criminals; the saints and the sinners\u201d.</p> <p>Even after witnessing years of their vile harassment of his parents and siblings, Blaine resists using his power as a narrator to pass vengeful judgment of the Shelleys. He doesn\u2019t crib expertise to explain or rationalise why the Shelleys acted as they did, or the Blaines, for that matter. The reader of Australian Gospel is not bludgeoned with potted digressions on attachment theory or the history of out-of-home care in Australia, for example.</p> <p>In keeping his attention on the small details, Blaine makes sure the story he is telling about his family isn\u2019t mistaken for a universal truth. His siblings \u201cwon the foster care lottery\u201d when they were placed with Tom and Lenore; many kids in care are not nearly so lucky. Blaine can observe that awareness of the dire impact of forced child removal on Aboriginal families has shifted public discourse on foster care, without latching his family\u2019s story on to the systemic injustice experienced by the stolen generations.</p> <p>When Australian Gospel closes, Tom and Lenore have both died, as have Michael and Mary. We are left with a series of vignettes of the adult lives Steven, John and Hannah have made for themselves with their partners and children. While working a student job as a cleaner, Hannah is congratulated by a condescending woman for being \u201cjust remarkable\u201d: \u201cThe drunken socialites of the eastern suburbs were gobsmacked that a foster girl from country Queensland wasn\u2019t a junkie or an alcoholic.\u201d Hannah and the Blaine siblings know that their thriving wasn\u2019t pre-ordained by the God of their biological parents, and wasn\u2019t a matter of good character or genetics either. Hannah tells the socialites: \u201cI had a great upbringing.\u201d</p> <p>In this, Australian Gospel is a welcome antidote to the Australian mythology of lucky strivers and exceptional individuals who achieve social mobility through force of will and a few good breaks. It\u2019s a book that affirms the importance of the social bonds that form through families and communities, in sports clubs, unions and pubs.</p> <p>We\u2019ve become perhaps too accustomed to hearing family values invoked by conservatives and reactionaries. The Michael Shelleys of this world are more than ready to summon the patriarchal imperatives of blood and destiny to rule over their families and judge others. Many families remain unsafe for women and children. And yet Blaine here proposes a progressive vision of family life that follows the model created by his brave, rambunctious, generous parents. It\u2019s an incredible yarn, mighty well told \u2013 and for all that, the standout accomplishment of Australian Gospel is its reparative insistence that loving, joyful families can be made in the most unlikely circumstances.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/australian-gospel\">Australian Gospel: A Family Saga</a> by Lech Blaine is out 5 November through Black Inc ($36.99)</em></p></li> </ul>",

Fair enough, as Lenore\u2019s records of family life provide Blaine (the author of 2021\u2019s Car Crash: A Memoir) with a rich fund of small details to draw on. As well as working through his mother\u2019s files, Blaine interviewed hundreds of people whose paths crossed the Shelleys\u2019, including his siblings and parents. He sifted through court records, foster care reports and newspaper archives to understand the events and relationships that form the narrative arc of Australian Gospel. What a sensational story it is, and hard to summarise without making the book sound like a crass potboiler overstuffed with colourful characters and melodrama. The bare bones go something like this: the Shelleys are itinerant missionaries who renounce their posh upbringings to crusade against contemporary decadence, losing custody of their children along the way. Their various court appearances \u2013 to answer charges of vagrancy, harassment, stalking and trespass \u2013 were tabloid fodder during the 1980s and 90s. The Blaines are working-class publicans who move around regional Queensland with their growing family of foster kids and dalmatians, accompanied by a huge crowd of cousins, comrades and friends. In their atheist egalitarianism, joie de vivre and love of sport, they epitomise everything the Shelleys despise about Australian culture. When the Shelleys discover their kids are living with the Blaines, they terrorise the family in a campaign to regain custody of their children. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Shelleys turn up to the house, threaten Tom and Lenore, frighten the kids; one afternoon, Hannah finds Mary lying in her bed. The family moves house and successfully seeks restraining orders against the Shelleys but the harassment doesn\u2019t stop. The Shelleys turn up uninvited at Tom\u2019s pub and in Steven\u2019s university lectures, and generate an unending torrent of abusive correspondence. They send letters to everyone in Queensland with the surname Blaine, telling them Tom is a paedophile, and orchestrate the kidnapping of another child fostered with a different family. They harass politicians, church leaders and doctors. There are celebrity cameos, marriages, unfair deaths, a few births and a ton of marvellous small details. It is to Blaine\u2019s enormous credit that he tells this sensational story with compassion, intelligence and great wit. Australian Gospel is a captivating work of narrative nonfiction, at once a tremendously moving story of family life, and a profound meditation on family-making and the legacies of love, grief and trauma that get passed from one generation to the next. The Gospels offer four competing accounts of the life of Jesus Christ. Early on, Blaine tells us that he worked on his book in an office with \u201cfour cork boards on the walls\u201d: \u201cThe Gospel of Michael. The Gospel of Mary. The Gospel of Tom. The Gospel of Lenore.\u201d Australian Gospel tells the story of these four parents and their kids in a way that seeks to accommodate their irreconcilable perspectives. And so there\u2019s room in the book not just for Mary and Michael\u2019s poisonous behaviour but for their devotion to their children, and their heartbreak at being separated from them. In a note at the end of the book, Blaine acknowledges that many of the accounts he relied upon contradict each other. Australian Gospel is, he insists, a work of creative nonfiction, not history or journalism. To some readers this might sound like a cop-out. To me, it reveals an honest reckoning with how a story like this, thick with love and conflict, can be told, especially by an author who is deeply attached to its protagonists. Many messiahs compete for the reader\u2019s attention in Australian Gospel \u2013 and yet the impulse of Blaine\u2019s book is assiduously anti-messianic. Here is an author who knows that moral clarity can be a fig leaf for hypocrisy, and worse. In Australia, Blaine writes, \u201cthere was a thin line between the winners and the losers; the good Samaritans and the criminals; the saints and the sinners\u201d. Even after witnessing years of their vile harassment of his parents and siblings, Blaine resists using his power as a narrator to pass vengeful judgment of the Shelleys. He doesn\u2019t crib expertise to explain or rationalise why the Shelleys acted as they did, or the Blaines, for that matter. The reader of Australian Gospel is not bludgeoned with potted digressions on attachment theory or the history of out-of-home care in Australia, for example. In keeping his attention on the small details, Blaine makes sure the story he is telling about his family isn\u2019t mistaken for a universal truth. His siblings \u201cwon the foster care lottery\u201d when they were placed with Tom and Lenore; many kids in care are not nearly so lucky. Blaine can observe that awareness of the dire impact of forced child removal on Aboriginal families has shifted public discourse on foster care, without latching his family\u2019s story on to the systemic injustice experienced by the stolen generations. When Australian Gospel closes, Tom and Lenore have both died, as have Michael and Mary. We are left with a series of vignettes of the adult lives Steven, John and Hannah have made for themselves with their partners and children. While working a student job as a cleaner, Hannah is congratulated by a condescending woman for being \u201cjust remarkable\u201d: \u201cThe drunken socialites of the eastern suburbs were gobsmacked that a foster girl from country Queensland wasn\u2019t a junkie or an alcoholic.\u201d Hannah and the Blaine siblings know that their thriving wasn\u2019t pre-ordained by the God of their biological parents, and wasn\u2019t a matter of good character or genetics either. Hannah tells the socialites: \u201cI had a great upbringing.\u201d In this, Australian Gospel is a welcome antidote to the Australian mythology of lucky strivers and exceptional individuals who achieve social mobility through force of will and a few good breaks. It\u2019s a book that affirms the importance of the social bonds that form through families and communities, in sports clubs, unions and pubs. We\u2019ve become perhaps too accustomed to hearing family values invoked by conservatives and reactionaries. The Michael Shelleys of this world are more than ready to summon the patriarchal imperatives of blood and destiny to rule over their families and judge others. Many families remain unsafe for women and children. And yet Blaine here proposes a progressive vision of family life that follows the model created by his brave, rambunctious, generous parents. It\u2019s an incredible yarn, mighty well told \u2013 and for all that, the standout accomplishment of Australian Gospel is its reparative insistence that loving, joyful families can be made in the most unlikely circumstances. Australian Gospel: A Family Saga by Lech Blaine is out 5 November through Black Inc ($36.99)",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves could need \u00a39bn of further tax increases to avoid a fresh round of austerity for some struggling public services, despite her first budget setting out the largest rise in a generation, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. After the chancellor delivered Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years on Wednesday, the leading experts in public finances said she could be forced to top up her tax plans to avoid real-terms cuts in some areas, including councils, the justice system and prisons. The IFS said that while Reeves had provided a substantial short-term funding boost to unpick \u201cunrealistic\u201d Conservative plans, she had pencilled in cuts to unprotected departments after the next financial year that were more than likely to need revisiting. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, warned that Reeves\u2019s \u00a340bn tax-raising budget would mainly go towards steadying the government finances rather than paving the way for big improvements in public services. He said the chancellor was gambling that either a short-term splurge in public spending could clear backlogs in the system, helping to bring down future costs, or could be hoping for stronger economic growth to bail the government out. \u201c[But] if nothing else changes in the forecasts, particularly if we continue not to increase petrol duties, I think other taxes will likely have to rise,\u201d he said. Saying the spending plans amounted to \u201cpretending\u201d that Labour would splurge in the early years before reining in spending in future, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. The spending plans will not survive contact with her cabinet colleagues.\u201d \u201cI am willing to bet a substantial sum that day-to-day public service spending will in fact increase more quickly than supposedly planned after next year,\u201d he added. The IFS said that while the spending increases announced by Reeves appeared big relative to the previous government\u2019s plans, this was in large part because \u201ctheir plans were unrealistic\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cDespite the apparent scale of the increases, this is not going to feel like Christmas has come for the public realm.\u201d In her budget on Wednesday, the chancellor set out a real-terms increase in day-to-day spending on public services of 4.3% this year and 2.6% next year, before pencilling in a rise of 1.3% each year. \u201cIt would be odd to increase spending rapidly only to start cutting back again in subsequent years,\u201d Johnson said. In the final two budgets set by the Conservatives, Jeremy Hunt, the then chancellor, announced sweeping tax cuts despite ballooning pressures on public services and soaring debt interest payments. Johnson said: \u201cTo cut \u00a320bn from employee national insurance last year in the face of known fiscal pressures was not responsible.\u201d",

A few years after these plays were written, John Osborne\u2019s ground-breaking Look Back in Anger (currently revived at the Almeida in London) was seen by many, including Rattigan, to banish the drawing-room drama from the stage, and replace it with a new brand of social realism. Going back to these plays now is a fascinating exercise, not only for their dramatic value but in presenting a piece of English social history. At Theatre Royal Bath until 2 November. Then touring until 15 February",

Obama himself has said he finds the focus on Black men and Trump support puzzling.</p> <p>\u201c[Harris\u2019s] message is directly focused on the challenges that we face as Black men, and that our communities face, and that America faces,\u201d he said on an organizing call Sunday hosted by Win With Black Men. \u201cDonald Trump has shown utter disrespect and disregard for our communities \u2013 and for Black men specifically \u2013 throughout his career.\u201d</p> <p>Media reports citing polling data have suggested that Trump is capturing more Black male voters than previous election cycles. Many of those reports have relied on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/08/polls-predictions-president\">statistical aberration</a> in polling data \u2013 smaller sample sizes of Black voters within larger polls. As the election evolves in earnest, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5169193/2024-election-kamala-harris-black-voters-donald-trump\">polls</a> suggest Harris is suddenly recovering to the traditional baseline of Democratic support from Black voters.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense that Black men are not supporting the vice-president. We are supporting the vice-president. We actually have the data to prove that,\u201d said Quentin James, CEO of the Collective Pac, a political fundraising organization supporting Black candidates. His organization has been tracking turnout and conducting polling throughout the campaign, he said.</p> <p>James noted that Black turnout was softer in Georgia and North Carolina than Democrats would like, particularly among younger voters. Though turnout overall is breaking records, Black voters compose only about 26% of the electorate so far in Georgia \u2013 about four points shy of what conventional wisdom in the state suggests is a Democratic win.</p> <p>\u201cSo as Black men, we need you all to be surrogate fathers for the next nine days,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see a Black young person, they are your child, a child of our community. We need you to encourage them to show up and vote for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\u201d</p> <p>Republican policy objectives stand in stark contrast to the stated social and economic interests widely expressed by Black voters, with a conservative assault on diversity initiatives central to the Trump campaign. The last time Democrats nominated a Black candidate for the presidency, turnout among Black voters increased \u2013 proportionately exceeding white turnout in 2012 for the first time in American history.

      "bodyText": "Travis Foreman, a Black attorney in metro Atlanta, says he\u2019s been everywhere on the political spectrum. \u201cI voted Democrat, I voted Republican, I voted independent, you know, I voted all over the map,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I personally believe that this country is headed into a very dark place. \u201cI know a lot of people believe that Donald Trump is the reason for that dark place,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I actually disagree.\u201d Foreman\u2019s politics are at the center of a broad conversation about Black men voting for Trump. The only people in America who are less likely to vote for Trump than Black men are Black women. That is the history of Black voters and Democratic presidential candidates over the last 10 election cycles, from Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term to today. And yet, talk of defection by an unexpected number of Black male voters to Trump remains persistent. Obama himself has said he finds the focus on Black men and Trump support puzzling. \u201c[Harris\u2019s] message is directly focused on the challenges that we face as Black men, and that our communities face, and that America faces,\u201d he said on an organizing call Sunday hosted by Win With Black Men. \u201cDonald Trump has shown utter disrespect and disregard for our communities \u2013 and for Black men specifically \u2013 throughout his career.\u201d Media reports citing polling data have suggested that Trump is capturing more Black male voters than previous election cycles. Many of those reports have relied on a statistical aberration in polling data \u2013 smaller sample sizes of Black voters within larger polls. As the election evolves in earnest, polls suggest Harris is suddenly recovering to the traditional baseline of Democratic support from Black voters. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense that Black men are not supporting the vice-president. We are supporting the vice-president. We actually have the data to prove that,\u201d said Quentin James, CEO of the Collective Pac, a political fundraising organization supporting Black candidates. His organization has been tracking turnout and conducting polling throughout the campaign, he said. James noted that Black turnout was softer in Georgia and North Carolina than Democrats would like, particularly among younger voters. Though turnout overall is breaking records, Black voters compose only about 26% of the electorate so far in Georgia \u2013 about four points shy of what conventional wisdom in the state suggests is a Democratic win. \u201cSo as Black men, we need you all to be surrogate fathers for the next nine days,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see a Black young person, they are your child, a child of our community. We need you to encourage them to show up and vote for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\u201d Republican policy objectives stand in stark contrast to the stated social and economic interests widely expressed by Black voters, with a conservative assault on diversity initiatives central to the Trump campaign. The last time Democrats nominated a Black candidate for the presidency, turnout among Black voters increased \u2013 proportionately exceeding white turnout in 2012 for the first time in American history. Barack Obama won about 93% of the Black vote. Obama refrained from lecturing Black men for political backsliding on the Sunday call, as well as at a Harris rally in the heart of Atlanta\u2019s Black suburbs in Clarkston, Georgia, last week. The former president drew some criticism from a previous appearance in Pittsburgh this month, when he told Black men to get over their reluctance to vote for a woman. Some Black men \u201cjust aren\u2019t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, as you\u2019re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that\u201d, Obama said. For Black men who are steadfast Democratic voters, though, the impulse to question the motivations of Black Trump voters looms large. \u201cBlack men need to grow up,\u201d said Darryl Manning, a business consultant in Atlanta who cast his vote for Harris on the first day of early voting. \u201cBlack men need to own their communities again. We don\u2019t have those leaders any more. We don\u2019t have the Malcolm X and the Martin Luther King and the Ralph David Abernathy and the John Lewises any more \u2026 Black women held up, Black women stepped in, and Black women have led our communities.\u201d Trump won 12% of the Black vote in 2020. That is close to the high-water mark since the political realignments of the 1960s. Reagan maxed out Republican support among Black voters at 14% in 1980. With the exception of the Obama years, Republicans win a tight band of 8-12% of the Black vote. That figure disguises a significant gender gap. Historically, about 15-20% of Black men vote for Republicans, compared with 5-9% of Black women. Trey Baker, a senior Harris adviser working on Black voter outreach, said it was on the campaign to bring in voters who may have sat out in recent years. \u201cWe have to take that next step,\u201d he said. \u201cGo out and make sure that the disaffected voters, the people who didn\u2019t vote last time, the people who don\u2019t see themselves in some of these policies and some of these things, show them where they fit in.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Women\u2019s Super League has secured a vital dose of off-pitch stability for the next five seasons, with the news that Sky Sports and the BBC have agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/wsl-agrees-record-65m-domestic-five-year-tv-deal-with-sky-sports-and-bbc\">a record \u00a365m domestic television rights deal</a>, and with it, the new company running England\u2019s top divisions has completed one of its first essential assignments. When it took over in August, there could be no ifs, no buts, no excuses \u2013 it had to get a new broadcast agreement over the line swiftly, and it has done so, with a record fee to boot.</p> <p>A word we have heard regularly from Women\u2019s Professional Leagues Limited [WPLL] is that it is a \u201cstartup\u201d. That is the embryonic stage it feels not only the WPLL, but the women\u2019s game more broadly, is still at financially, after decades of relative underinvestment compared with men\u2019s football. If that is the case, then like any other startup the WPLL will be delighted to have guaranteed such an income stream until 2030. It is a sizable uplift on the current deal, which is understood to be worth approximately \u00a37m-\u00a38m per year. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/wsl-agrees-record-65m-domestic-five-year-tv-deal-with-sky-sports-and-bbc\">WSL agrees record \u00a365m domestic five-year TV deal with Sky Sports and BBC</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may be peanuts compared with the \u00a36.7bn \u2013 yes billion \u2013 deal over four years that the men\u2019s top tier enjoys but it is still big money for a sport that was banned in this country until 1971. And given that WPLL\u2019s mission is to make the women\u2019s game financially sustainable and profitable, the numbers really matter. With this deal, it has ensured a minimum of \u00a313m of domestic broadcast revenue per season for the next five years, from summer 2025.</p> <p>The broadcasters are investing much further with extensive production costs, but in terms of hard cash arriving into the WPLL\u2019s bank account, that rights fee is hugely significant, and it comes in addition to Barclays\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/23/wsl-and-womens-championship-secure-record-30m-commercial-deal#:~:text=The%20exact%20figures%20have%20not,sponsorship%20fee%20alone%2C%20plus%20significant\">new three-year title sponsorship deal</a>, understood to be worth between \u00a39m and \u00a310m per season for the sponsorship fee alone, plus marketing commitments on top. Therefore, with between \u00a322m and \u00a323m of cash already coming in, per season, for the next three years, it is not a bad first few months for a startup, on top of a \u00a320m, interest-free loan from the Premier League. Most Dragon\u2019s Den hopefuls would be jumping for joy.</p> <p>More revenue will need to follow, of course, and it surely will, whether from further overseas broadcast deals and additional commercial agreements \u2013 curious speculation continues to mount among club officials as to who will be the league\u2019s official airline, official cheese-and-onion cob supplier or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/15/chelsea-sink-arsenal-to-make-major-move-in-wsl-title-race\">even the official provider of emergency sock supplies</a>.</p>    <p>However, joking aside, it also does not take the world\u2019s greatest mathematician to see that, if you divide that income by the 23 clubs currently participating in the top two tiers, \u00a323m a year is not necessarily a transformative amount per club, and indeed that is one of the key unanswered questions so far: how will such revenue be distributed between the clubs? And what will the ratio be between WSL and Championship?</p> <p>There will also be some observers wondering why the deal was agreed for five years rather than three or four years. With the rather optimistic hypothesis that, if England were to enjoy success at next summer\u2019s Euros or even the 2027 Women\u2019s World Cup \u2013 \u201cnot if they defend like they did over the last week\u201d, I hear you shouting \u2013 then perhaps the rights fee agreed on Wednesday might prove to be a bargain for the broadcasters.</p> <p>Could a much larger fee for the 2028-29 or 2029-30 seasons have been negotiated in such circumstances, if interest in the women\u2019s game soared? But the counter arguments are valid. Firstly, with a five-year deal the leagues have stability and security of income and can now make longer-term plans. Let us never forget how fragile sports leagues can be without broadcast revenue. After all, the collapse of the pay TV channel Setanta in 2009 delayed the initial launch of the WSL by a year, to its eventual start date in 2011.</p> <p>Sky Sports, which has secured the rights to 118 matches per season, is understood to be contributing the vast majority of this new deal. In simplistic terms, Sky is stumping up the cash, while the BBC\u2019s main offering is exposure and the huge viewerships on its free-to-air channels. But having obtained 75% of the \u201cfirst picks\u201d, Sky is not only the lead broadcast partner. It is clear it is also now the WPLL\u2019s single largest investor to date, and with that, a colossal contributor to the future of the women\u2019s leagues. </p> <p>But will fans be delighted? Now the deal is done, there are many questions to be answered. It remains to be seen what impact there will be on kick-off times for travelling fans. Are more Friday night and weekend lunchtime kick-offs inevitable, given the large proportion of matches per gameweek that will be televised? In return for its cash, Sky will expect to have more influence over a fixture list already complicated by factors such as stadium access and calendar congestion.</p> <p>It is understood most televised games will still be on a Sunday. Sky\u2019s main slot is expected to be on a Sunday at noon, with the BBC\u2019s most regular slot likely to be after that at 2.30pm. That should be a relief to many travelling fans but, generally, supporters will surely have more questions, as the sport prepares to enter a new era where virtually every match will be televised.</p> <p>Overall, though, this is a hugely positive step for the women\u2019s leagues and now the hard work must continue to ensure any deal agreed post 2030 can be even better. The WSL\u2019s chair, Dawn Airey, previously stated a league target of becoming the \u201cfirst billion pound women\u2019s league in the world\u201d in 10 years. For that, lots of work remains.</p>",

A word we have heard regularly from Women\u2019s Professional Leagues Limited [WPLL] is that it is a \u201cstartup\u201d. That is the embryonic stage it feels not only the WPLL, but the women\u2019s game more broadly, is still at financially, after decades of relative underinvestment compared with men\u2019s football. If that is the case, then like any other startup the WPLL will be delighted to have guaranteed such an income stream until 2030. It is a sizable uplift on the current deal, which is understood to be worth approximately \u00a37m-\u00a38m per year. It may be peanuts compared with the \u00a36.7bn \u2013 yes billion \u2013 deal over four years that the men\u2019s top tier enjoys but it is still big money for a sport that was banned in this country until 1971. And given that WPLL\u2019s mission is to make the women\u2019s game financially sustainable and profitable, the numbers really matter. With this deal, it has ensured a minimum of \u00a313m of domestic broadcast revenue per season for the next five years, from summer 2025. The broadcasters are investing much further with extensive production costs, but in terms of hard cash arriving into the WPLL\u2019s bank account, that rights fee is hugely significant, and it comes in addition to Barclays\u2019 new three-year title sponsorship deal, understood to be worth between \u00a39m and \u00a310m per season for the sponsorship fee alone, plus marketing commitments on top. Therefore, with between \u00a322m and \u00a323m of cash already coming in, per season, for the next three years, it is not a bad first few months for a startup, on top of a \u00a320m, interest-free loan from the Premier League. Most Dragon\u2019s Den hopefuls would be jumping for joy. More revenue will need to follow, of course, and it surely will, whether from further overseas broadcast deals and additional commercial agreements \u2013 curious speculation continues to mount among club officials as to who will be the league\u2019s official airline, official cheese-and-onion cob supplier or even the official provider of emergency sock supplies. However, joking aside, it also does not take the world\u2019s greatest mathematician to see that, if you divide that income by the 23 clubs currently participating in the top two tiers, \u00a323m a year is not necessarily a transformative amount per club, and indeed that is one of the key unanswered questions so far: how will such revenue be distributed between the clubs? And what will the ratio be between WSL and Championship? There will also be some observers wondering why the deal was agreed for five years rather than three or four years. With the rather optimistic hypothesis that, if England were to enjoy success at next summer\u2019s Euros or even the 2027 Women\u2019s World Cup \u2013 \u201cnot if they defend like they did over the last week\u201d, I hear you shouting \u2013 then perhaps the rights fee agreed on Wednesday might prove to be a bargain for the broadcasters. Could a much larger fee for the 2028-29 or 2029-30 seasons have been negotiated in such circumstances, if interest in the women\u2019s game soared? But the counter arguments are valid. Firstly, with a five-year deal the leagues have stability and security of income and can now make longer-term plans. Let us never forget how fragile sports leagues can be without broadcast revenue. After all, the collapse of the pay TV channel Setanta in 2009 delayed the initial launch of the WSL by a year, to its eventual start date in 2011. Sky Sports, which has secured the rights to 118 matches per season, is understood to be contributing the vast majority of this new deal. In simplistic terms, Sky is stumping up the cash, while the BBC\u2019s main offering is exposure and the huge viewerships on its free-to-air channels. But having obtained 75% of the \u201cfirst picks\u201d, Sky is not only the lead broadcast partner. It is clear it is also now the WPLL\u2019s single largest investor to date, and with that, a colossal contributor to the future of the women\u2019s leagues. But will fans be delighted? Now the deal is done, there are many questions to be answered. It remains to be seen what impact there will be on kick-off times for travelling fans. Are more Friday night and weekend lunchtime kick-offs inevitable, given the large proportion of matches per gameweek that will be televised? In return for its cash, Sky will expect to have more influence over a fixture list already complicated by factors such as stadium access and calendar congestion. It is understood most televised games will still be on a Sunday. Sky\u2019s main slot is expected to be on a Sunday at noon, with the BBC\u2019s most regular slot likely to be after that at 2.30pm. That should be a relief to many travelling fans but, generally, supporters will surely have more questions, as the sport prepares to enter a new era where virtually every match will be televised. Overall, though, this is a hugely positive step for the women\u2019s leagues and now the hard work must continue to ensure any deal agreed post 2030 can be even better. The WSL\u2019s chair, Dawn Airey, previously stated a league target of becoming the \u201cfirst billion pound women\u2019s league in the world\u201d in 10 years. For that, lots of work remains.",

      "body": "<p>Nearly 20 years ago, the British mathematician Clive Humby coined a snappy phrase that has turned into a platitude: \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d. He wasn\u2019t wrong. We have an insatiable appetite for data, we can\u2019t stop generating it, and, just like oil, it\u2019s turning out to be bad news for the environment.</p> <p>So the Guardian<em> </em>set me a challenge: to try to give a sense of how much data an average person uses in a day, and what the carbon footprint of normal online activity might be. To do that, I tried to tot up the sorts of things I and millions of others do every day, and how that tracks back through the melange of messaging services, social networks, applications and tools, to the datacentres that keep our digital lives going.</p> <p>My own carbon tally gets off to a bad start, and it is not even my fault. The email from my editor asking me to try to quantify quite how much data a single person uses in a day is itself contributing to my footprint. If the editor took 10 minutes to write the email \u2013 likely, given it was quite detailed \u2013 and it took me three minutes to read, and if it was sent from a laptop and received on one, then we have <a href=\"https://carbonliteracy.com/the-carbon-cost-of-an-email/\">generated 17g of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions already</a>, according to estimates by Mike Berners-Lee, a professor at Lancaster University\u2019s Environment Centre, and the author of How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything.</p> <p>My frantic emails to people asking to speak to them for this story pump out more carbon at a prodigious rate. And though 17g of CO<sub>2</sub> is insignificant compared with <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6604460f91a320001a82b0fd/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-provisional-figures-statistical-release-2023.pdf\">the 384.2m tonnes</a> of net emissions the UK as a whole is responsible for each year, it all adds up.</p> <p>All those emails and videos and games don\u2019t just appear on our screens by magic. Everything we do digitally involves the vast transfer of data through the internet from one place to another, brokered through datacentres. Datacentres are vast premises full of computer servers that store data. The idea behind them is to reduce what the data industry calls \u201clatency\u201d, the time between you typing in a web address or clicking on an app button, and the content you are requesting being delivered to you. Everything on the internet, every link you click, every video you watch, is physically stored in a datacentre somewhere.</p>    <p>Datacentres are big business, and vast numbers of them are being built around the world. In the UK, Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/news/job-creation-and-investment/aws-plans-to-invest-8-billion-in-the-uk\">just announced</a> plans to invest \u00a38bn over the next five years building new datacentres and maintaining those it already has, \u201csupporting 14,000 jobs annually\u201d. That comes on top of \u00a33bn already spent in the UK by Amazon\u2019s cloud computing arm since 2020. Google is <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/google-1-billion-investment-in-a-new-uk-data-centre/\">spending $1bn</a> on a new centre at a 133,500 sq metre (33-acre) site in Hertfordshire, and at the end of last year Microsoft committed to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/boost-for-uk-ai-as-microsoft-unveils-25-billion-investment\">\u00a32.5bn of investment</a> in the next three years, more than doubling its datacentre footprint in this country.</p> <p>The reason for this is simple: demand is increasing at alarming rates. Americans used <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/americans-used-record-100-trillion-141750734.html\">100tn megabytes of wireless data</a> in 2023, a record-breaking increase of 36% on the previous year \u2013 that\u2019s enough to download Candy Crush Saga <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/candy-crush-saga/id553834731\">265bn times</a>.</p> <p>It is a lot of data, and a lot of energy is required to serve that data to us, plus a lot of water to keep all those servers cool. In fact, Ireland, the Netherlands and Singapore are so worried about the energy impact of datacentres that they have <a href=\"https://datacentremagazine.com/critical-environments/power-hungry-data-centres-put-pressure-on-irelands-grid\">imposed moratoria on new developments</a>. When Google announced its environmental impact earlier this year, it revealed its own greenhouse gas emissions had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/google-ai-emissions\">risen 48% in the last five years</a>, and 13% in the last 12 months, largely driven by increased datacentre demand to service its AI needs. Now big tech companies have come up with another solution to try to solve the looming energy crisis: their own nuclear power plants. Microsoft has struck a deal to recommission<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/20/three-mile-island-nuclear-plant-reopen-microsoft\"> the Three Mile Island</a> site in Pennsylvania, Google recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power\">plans to build six or seven new small reactors</a> to meet its anticipated energy needs. There\u2019s no way round it: a steady stream of environmental harm is coming from our everyday actions \u2013 activities that we often don\u2019t think about in relation to the target of limiting global heating to below 1.5C. </p> <p>\u201cYou will run into this pretty much anywhere during the day,\u201d says Alex de Vries, who researches the carbon footprint of our day-to-day lives at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. \u201cDigital applications are so deeply embedded in our lives nowadays, it\u2019s really hard to avoid. The thing is, when you\u2019re using them, it\u2019s not like you have something popping up in the screen telling you, like: \u2018Hey, be aware, this activity has this carbon footprint.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>De Vries also runs the Digiconomist website, which tries to track \u2013 where possible \u2013 the environmental impact of these things. That \u201cwhere possible\u201d is an important caveat. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to figure out that information,\u201d says de Vries.</p> <p>In the absence of reliable figures from the companies themselves, educated guesses are often all we can rely on. Case in point: estimates of the proportion of world energy use that the internet makes up range from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think\">3.7%</a> to <a href=\"https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1177210/FULLTEXT01.pdf\">10%</a>, depending on who is counting. One estimate by Zero Waste Scotland suggests all our online activity generates an average of 8.62kg of CO<sub>2</sub> a week (about 448kg a year), or about <a href=\"https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?lang=en-GB&amp;tab=4\">30 miles</a> in an average-sized petrol car. But a German estimate (which also includes the emissions created by the production digital devices themselves) says we expend around twice that, <a href=\"https://www.oeko.de/en/blog/the-carbon-footprint-of-our-digital-lifestyles/#:~:text=If%20this%20energy%20consumption%20is,CO2%20emissions%20per%20year.\">roughly 850kg a year</a>.</p> <p>People struggle with two key problems when trying to wrap their heads around their data usage and resultant carbon impact, says De Vries. One: everything is digital, and therefore not tangible. \u201cIf you\u2019re holding a pen and a piece of paper, you can get some idea of what might be necessary to make this product,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re using a digital application, what\u2019s really going into that to make all of that happen? A lot of people simply will have no clue what that looks like.\u201d</p> <p>The other issue is that the tech companies are really good at making things work. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even know what is in [an application],\u201d says De Vries. You press the button, and the Netflix series starts.</p> <p>Companies such as Netflix are disarmingly honest about their data usage: if you keep your video quality on \u201clow\u201d, you use a paltry 300MB an hour of data on a streaming service such as Netflix. If you want to watch things in HD, though, you ramp up to 3GB an hour when looking at the most detailed scenes. If you are a movie connoisseur, your 4K streaming uses up to 7GB an hour.</p> <p>But while few would argue we should spend less time in front of streaming services, the environmental impact of all that binge-watching appears to be comparatively low. A <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines\">2020 analysis by the International Energy Agency</a> (IEA) found that watching an hour of Netflix was equivalent to boiling a kettle once: about 36g of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>There are other variables to take into account, though: the energy consumption of the device you are watching on, for example (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17094610/netflix-70-percent-tv-viewing-statistics\">Netflix says 70% of its viewers use televisions</a>, which are more energy-hungry than mobile phones); or how the electricity you are using is generated (nuclear or wind is less carbon-emitting than coal or gas).</p> <p>If you want to gossip about the latest episode with your friends, that also comes with an environmental toll. The average WhatsApp group chat uses 2.35kg of CO<sub>2</sub> a week, Zero Waste Scotland <a href=\"https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/resources/environmental-footprint-everything-we-do-online\">calculated</a>. (To blunt the impact slightly, rely more on emojis \u2013 which are stored locally on your device \u2013 than reaction gifs, which have to be downloaded afresh from datacentres.) Listening to music online also comes at an environmental cost, although it is estimated that you can stream music for <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2021/11/how-environmentally-damaging-is-music-streaming\">five hours</a> before you will emit more CO2 \u2013 288g \u2013 than is involved in making a CD in a case. Like many tech companies, Spotify has committed to reaching net zero emissions, in its case, <a href=\"https://www.lifeatspotify.com/diversity-equity-impact/climate-action\">by 2030</a>.</p>    <p>Big tech companies buy carbon credits and offsets to try to mitigate the impact of their activity, but it\u2019s often seen as a poor attempt at atonement for the environmental impact they cause. There are also questions about the extent to which firms\u2019 reported datacentre emissions are capturing the whole picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech\">A recent Guardian analysis</a><em> </em>found that real emissions between 2020 and 2022 from datacentres owned by the four big tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple, were likely to be 662% higher than officially reported.</p> <p>The tech industry\u2019s warm embrace of generative AI has complicated things even further. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. Type certain searches into Google and you will be given an \u201cAI overview\u201d, as Google calls them, which summarises key information from the results the search engine finds and presents it in a simple set of bullet points, alongside associated links. And you can\u2019t turn it off. \u201cAI Overviews are a core Google Search feature,\u201d the company says. </p> <p>\u201cGenerative AI hasn\u2019t necessarily added very many new use cases,\u201d says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at AI company Hugging Face. \u201cIt\u2019s adding more compute and more environmental impacts to existing use cases.\u201d The problem is that we don\u2019t fully know how much. \u201cNone of the corporates, and none of the proprietary models, have published any numbers,\u201d she says. De Vries\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351(23)00365-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435123003653%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">research</a> suggests that AI-powered search results use 10 times the power that non-AI searches do.</p> <p>All this is before you get into the conscious use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot \u2013 where you are going to their websites or opening their apps, and taking part. Here, we are also in the dark about how much data, and therefore how much energy and water, generative AI uses. The best information we have is from informed third-party estimates: training GPT-3, a precursor to the current model, used an estimated 5.4m litres of water, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271.pdf\">according to one academic study</a>, and produced as much CO<sub>2</sub> as would be generated by flying between New York and San Francisco <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2104/2104.10350.pdf\">550 times</a>.</p> <p>I recently published a book on AI and as part of that, I have been touring and giving talks about AI\u2019s impact on our world. In my favourite set of slides that I present there is a party trick. To highlight concerns around copyright in generative AI, I ask ChatGPT\u2019s image generator, Dall-E, to produce a depiction of whichever place I\u2019m in, in the style of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s The Starry Night.</p> <p>The gimmick always gets a laugh and serves its purpose: it shows how often the AI system has seen that painting by the ability to mimic its brushstrokes.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 20 years ago, the British mathematician Clive Humby coined a snappy phrase that has turned into a platitude: \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d. He wasn\u2019t wrong. We have an insatiable appetite for data, we can\u2019t stop generating it, and, just like oil, it\u2019s turning out to be bad news for the environment. So the Guardian set me a challenge: to try to give a sense of how much data an average person uses in a day, and what the carbon footprint of normal online activity might be. To do that, I tried to tot up the sorts of things I and millions of others do every day, and how that tracks back through the melange of messaging services, social networks, applications and tools, to the datacentres that keep our digital lives going. My own carbon tally gets off to a bad start, and it is not even my fault. The email from my editor asking me to try to quantify quite how much data a single person uses in a day is itself contributing to my footprint. If the editor took 10 minutes to write the email \u2013 likely, given it was quite detailed \u2013 and it took me three minutes to read, and if it was sent from a laptop and received on one, then we have generated 17g of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions already, according to estimates by Mike Berners-Lee, a professor at Lancaster University\u2019s Environment Centre, and the author of How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything. My frantic emails to people asking to speak to them for this story pump out more carbon at a prodigious rate. And though 17g of CO2 is insignificant compared with the 384.2m tonnes of net emissions the UK as a whole is responsible for each year, it all adds up. All those emails and videos and games don\u2019t just appear on our screens by magic. Everything we do digitally involves the vast transfer of data through the internet from one place to another, brokered through datacentres. Datacentres are vast premises full of computer servers that store data. The idea behind them is to reduce what the data industry calls \u201clatency\u201d, the time between you typing in a web address or clicking on an app button, and the content you are requesting being delivered to you. Everything on the internet, every link you click, every video you watch, is physically stored in a datacentre somewhere. Datacentres are big business, and vast numbers of them are being built around the world. In the UK, Amazon has just announced plans to invest \u00a38bn over the next five years building new datacentres and maintaining those it already has, \u201csupporting 14,000 jobs annually\u201d. That comes on top of \u00a33bn already spent in the UK by Amazon\u2019s cloud computing arm since 2020. Google is spending $1bn on a new centre at a 133,500 sq metre (33-acre) site in Hertfordshire, and at the end of last year Microsoft committed to \u00a32.5bn of investment in the next three years, more than doubling its datacentre footprint in this country. The reason for this is simple: demand is increasing at alarming rates. Americans used 100tn megabytes of wireless data in 2023, a record-breaking increase of 36% on the previous year \u2013 that\u2019s enough to download Candy Crush Saga 265bn times. It is a lot of data, and a lot of energy is required to serve that data to us, plus a lot of water to keep all those servers cool. In fact, Ireland, the Netherlands and Singapore are so worried about the energy impact of datacentres that they have imposed moratoria on new developments. When Google announced its environmental impact earlier this year, it revealed its own greenhouse gas emissions had risen 48% in the last five years, and 13% in the last 12 months, largely driven by increased datacentre demand to service its AI needs. Now big tech companies have come up with another solution to try to solve the looming energy crisis: their own nuclear power plants. Microsoft has struck a deal to recommission the Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvania, Google recently announced plans to build six or seven new small reactors to meet its anticipated energy needs. There\u2019s no way round it: a steady stream of environmental harm is coming from our everyday actions \u2013 activities that we often don\u2019t think about in relation to the target of limiting global heating to below 1.5C. \u201cYou will run into this pretty much anywhere during the day,\u201d says Alex de Vries, who researches the carbon footprint of our day-to-day lives at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. \u201cDigital applications are so deeply embedded in our lives nowadays, it\u2019s really hard to avoid. The thing is, when you\u2019re using them, it\u2019s not like you have something popping up in the screen telling you, like: \u2018Hey, be aware, this activity has this carbon footprint.\u2019\u201d De Vries also runs the Digiconomist website, which tries to track \u2013 where possible \u2013 the environmental impact of these things. That \u201cwhere possible\u201d is an important caveat. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to figure out that information,\u201d says de Vries. In the absence of reliable figures from the companies themselves, educated guesses are often all we can rely on. Case in point: estimates of the proportion of world energy use that the internet makes up range from 3.7% to 10%, depending on who is counting. One estimate by Zero Waste Scotland suggests all our online activity generates an average of 8.62kg of CO2 a week (about 448kg a year), or about 30 miles in an average-sized petrol car. But a German estimate (which also includes the emissions created by the production digital devices themselves) says we expend around twice that, roughly 850kg a year. People struggle with two key problems when trying to wrap their heads around their data usage and resultant carbon impact, says De Vries. One: everything is digital, and therefore not tangible. \u201cIf you\u2019re holding a pen and a piece of paper, you can get some idea of what might be necessary to make this product,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re using a digital application, what\u2019s really going into that to make all of that happen? A lot of people simply will have no clue what that looks like.\u201d The other issue is that the tech companies are really good at making things work. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t even know what is in [an application],\u201d says De Vries. You press the button, and the Netflix series starts. Companies such as Netflix are disarmingly honest about their data usage: if you keep your video quality on \u201clow\u201d, you use a paltry 300MB an hour of data on a streaming service such as Netflix.

The gimmick always gets a laugh and serves its purpose: it shows how often the AI system has seen that painting by the ability to mimic its brushstrokes. But I always feel guilty.

      "bodyText": "Ofcom has fined the rightwing broadcaster GB News \u00a3100,000 for \u201cbreaking due impartiality rules\u201d after an interview with the former prime minister Rishi Sunak earlier this year. The media regulator said it chose to impose a fine over the programme titled People\u2019s Forum: The Prime Minister because it considered the breach serious, and because of GB News\u2019s track record of breaking impartiality rules. \u201cWe concluded that the then prime minister Rishi Sunak had a mostly uncontested platform to promote the policies and performance of his government in a period preceding a UK general election, in breach of rules 5.11 and 5.12 of the broadcasting code,\u201d Ofcom said. \u201cGiven the seriousness and repeated nature of this breach, Ofcom has imposed a financial penalty of \u00a3100,000 on GB News Limited. We have also directed GB News to broadcast a statement of our findings against it, on a date and in a form determined by us. \u201cGB News is challenging our original breach decision in this case by judicial review, which we are defending. Ofcom will not enforce this sanction decision until those proceedings are concluded.\u201d The media watchdog began its investigation into GB News on 15 February, three days after the airing of the programme in which Sunak answered questions from a studio audience and a presenter. The regulator found that, while the viewer was able to see Sunak challenged to some extent by the questions from members of the audience, no follow-up was allowed if his answers proved unsatisfactory. And it found the presenter failed to challenge Sunak on the viewers\u2019 behalf to \u201cany meaningful extent\u201d. Sunak was also allowed to freely criticise his political opponents without the viewer being given the benefit of their positions or responses. GB News has already been found to have repeatedly breached impartiality rules by allowing sitting Conservative MPs to serve as news presenters. The broadcast regulator said these related to five occasions involving Jacob Rees-Mogg, Esther McVey and Philip Davies. All three were Tory MPs at the time, though only McVey remains in the Commons. The broadcaster was not fined but was put \u201con notice\u201d that more breaches \u201cmay result in the imposition of a statutory sanction\u201d. And Ofcom said GB News\u2019s actions risked undermining the high public trust in regulated broadcast media. The channel has been given permission to seek a judicial review of Ofcom\u2019s latest finding. But it failed to convince the high court to also temporarily stop the regulator publishing its sanction. GB News\u2019s lawyers had argued that to do so would cause irreparable damage to the channel\u2019s reputation. In October, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the likely impact on the broadcaster had been overstated. GB News\u2019s chief executive, Angelos Frangopoulos, characterised the fine as a \u201cdirect attack on free speech and journalism in the United Kingdom\u201d, adding that he believed it was \u201cunnecessary, unfair and unlawful\u201d. He said: \u201cThe plan to sanction GB News flies in the face of Ofcom\u2019s duty to act fairly, lawfully and proportionately to safeguard free speech, particularly political speech and on matters of public interest.\u201d Frangopoulos claimed GB News would \u201ccontinue to fearlessly champion freedom; for our viewers, for our listeners and for everyone in the United Kingdom.

But the levy has fallen victim to rightwing populism and culture wars, said Rolf Lindahl, a climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace Sweden. \u201cThe plastic ban tax has become a part of a very unfortunate populist narrative around climate policies from the rightwing parties and they have used it as an example of environmental overreach from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worry that dropping the tax will mean increased plastic use and a return to the norm of always buying new bags at the supermarket.\u201d Joakim Brodahl, from the non-profit organisation Keep Sweden Clean, said the removal of the tax would probably lead to plastic bags costing less to consumers and in turn increasing consumption. \u201cWe see that there is a risk that the behaviour can quickly turn back unless, for example, the trade is alert to changes in their sales of plastic bags,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "There could be a potential surge in political violence following the upcoming US election, and pro-Trump rightwing vigilante \u201cpoll watchers\u201d might surveil ballot drop boxes as Americans cast their votes, experts warned this week. A new report from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) highlighted alarming trends in online chatter, mirroring patterns observed in the lead-up to the 2020 election and the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Meanwhile, Princeton\u2019s Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI), issued a fact sheet with recommendations for dealing with conspiracy-minded monitoring groups like True the Vote, which spread false narratives in 2020 alleging that Democrats had sent paid \u201cmules\u201d to drop boxes with thousands of illegal votes in order to steal the election from Donald Trump. The twin reports highlighted risks to the elections and strategies for mitigating them, at a time when one man has been charged over armed attacks on a Democratic party office, and police in Oregon and Washington are investigating suspected arson attacks on ballot boxes in which some ballots were destroyed. The GPAHE report\u2019s warning is based on a rise in violent chatter on platforms known for hosting extremist content, including Telegram, Gab, Communities.win, and some communities across the decentralized social media network known as the Fediverse. The report shows that while the overall volume of messages on these platforms may be lower than in 2020, the sharp rise in violent rhetoric follows a pattern set ahead of the 2020 election. For example, in October, violent rhetoric related to election denialism increased by 317% on Telegram, 105% on Gab, 25% on communities.win, and 75% across a selection of Fediverse communities. The report says that across these platforms, users are indulging in violent rhetoric linked to election denialism. Some posts on Telegram this year have used election denialism to justify calls for violence, including calls for an \u201cinevitable civil war\u201d and urging users to \u201cshoot to kill any illegal voters\u201d.

Communities.win is a collection of forums that includes The_Donald, which was banned from Reddit for hate speech in 2020. According to the GPAHE report, users there have fantasized about a civil war in recent weeks, claiming that Democrats will not relinquish power and that a violent uprising is necessary for a \u201cGreat Awakening\u201d, a concept previously popularised by the QAnon conspiracy movement. In Fediverse communities, users have shared posts blaming the \u201cliberal media\u201d for inciting a \u201cwar\u201d and encouraging violence against perceived political opponents. GPAHE\u2019s report warns that \u201cignoring these worrying trends will only risk further acts of violence related to election denialism and anti-democratic sentiment\u201d. Heidi Beirich, GPAHE\u2019s co-founder, said: \u201cOur report shows that, when compared to violent election denial chatter in 2020, the numbers have been lower so far this year, but they are quickly rising as we approach election day.\u201d She added that \u201cunmoderated fringe sites\u201d were seeing \u201crising numbers of comments with violent political rhetoric \u201c and \u201cposts targeting election workers with violence, a sign that real world activity could escalate\u201d. BDI, meanwhile, warns against complacency after 2022, when vigilante poll watchers mostly stayed away from drop boxes, despite months of conspiracy-minded chatter about Democrats and the \u201cdeep state\u201d stealing mid-term elections from Republicans. According to the fact sheet, BDI data shows that in 2022, there were 44 incidents of physical monitoring at fewer than 20 drop box locations out of an estimated 13,000 active sites nationwide. That is, only 0.1% of drop boxes around the country were subject to monitoring activity. It warns, however, that threats of monitoring activity have resurfaced online during the 2024 campaign, and states including Arizona and Wisconsin have seen legal decisions that reduce restrictions on vigilante monitoring, opening the way for possible voter intimidation. The Guardian reported this week on an Arizona poll-watching group which has been casting doubt on the election result ahead of time, with members\u2019 paranoia being fueled by rightwing influencers and media outlets. The fact sheet makes a series of recommendations to poll workers ahead of the vote on ways to head off political violence, including de-escalation techniques; research to identify threats; communicating accurate information on elections; and community outreach and dialogue on election security. The BDI report says: \u201cThese steps can improve the US political violence early warning infrastructure and help prevent the amplification of rumors, false claims, and unfounded threat messaging aimed at suppressing voter turnout in targeted communities\u201d.",

Between two factories, under-construction houses pepper streets with names such as Frankfurt, Hamburg, Kiel, Hanover and Berlin.</p> <p>New Germany is part of a broader region, an industrial district covering about 4,000 square kilometres that has been a hub for Mexican and global multinationals \u2013 notably German conglomerates \u2013 since the 1960s. Spanning 47 municipalities in the state of Tlaxcala and 22 in the state of Puebla, it is home to 1.1 million people.</p> <p>Running through the area is the Atoyac River. But it is not a river that the community is proud of. \u201cPeople used to wash clothes as the water was crystal clear, and they even bathed in the river,\u201d remembers Mar\u00eda Ocotl\u00e1n, a Mexican snack shop owner on Munich Street. \u201cNow, you can\u2019t even wash your hands. The deterioration has been going on for 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>The Upper Atoyac basin is one of 30 regions identified as being in a state of socio-environmental and health emergency in Mexico, polluted by sewage and waste from homes, farmland, and, above all, factories.</p>    <p>Now, the <a href=\"https://www.elsoldepuebla.com.mx/local/claudia-sheinbaum-ve-urgente-sanear-el-atoyac-por-altos-niveles-de-contaminacion-12649086.html\">Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has promised to clean up the Atoyac</a> \u2013 as well as the Lerma, Santiago and Tula Rivers \u2013 as one of the 100 priorities of her <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-7d3599b39a7298df46e7eda34d80afee\">recently sworn-in government</a>.</p> <p>But to meet her commitment, Sheinbaum, a former climate scientist, will have to confront multinational companies accused by campaigners of harming the river.</p> <p>Since 2021, a coalition of Mexican and international NGOs and experts <a href=\"https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/informe_caravana_toxitourmexico_cast.pdf\">has been denouncing New Germany \u2013 and especially the German multinationals</a> \u2013 for the <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/es/m%C3%A9xico-r%C3%ADos-muertos-con-tal-de-atraer-inversi%C3%B3n/a-55649183\">environmental devastation</a> of the Atoyac, <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/10/31/Flyer_Caravana_ENG.pdf\">blaming</a> \u201cthe pollution left by transnational corporations such as Volkswagen, Bayer, BASF and Thyssenkrupp, among others\u201d for \u201cleaving its mark on the territory and people\u2019s bodies\u201d.</p> <p>In October 2023, the<a href=\"https://conahcyt.mx/\"> National Council of Science and Technology (Conahcyt</a>), a public body of the Mexican government, <a href=\"https://cdn.conahcyt.mx/enis/toxicologia/resa-atoyac/inicio/descargables/informe-caa.pdf\">acknowledged in a report</a> that the region\u2019s pollutants posed severe threats to public health.</p> <p>The report showed that the mortality rate from chronic kidney diseases among people aged 15 to 49 in Tlaxcala regions within the Upper Atoyac basin was almost five times higher than the national average. High mortality rates from acute leukaemias in individuals under 19 were also more common in the southern part of the basin, particularly in Puebla and Tlaxcala, where the levels of metals and arsenic in the river are significantly higher.</p>    <p>\u201cOver the last decades, the inhabitants of the Upper Atoyac basin have witnessed the constant increase of industrial settlements such as the arrival of Volkswagen in 1965, the creation of the Independencia Petrochemical Complex in 1969 or the installation of the Audi company in 2016, among others,\u201d says the document.</p> <p>\u201cThe region witnessed an economic development of apparent prosperity, but the organisation of global mercantile processes that privileged the profitability of transnational companies promoted health, social and environmental \u2018externalities\u2019 with serious effects for local communities.\u201d</p> <p>The report noted: \u201cThe scientific evidence presented in this first report demonstrates that these high [mortality] rates are caused by exposure to toxins and polluting processes from industries located in the region. The automotive, electrical, chemical and textile industries have the highest pollutant emissions.\u201d</p>    <p>Alejandra M\u00e9ndez, who directs the<a href=\"https://www.centrofrayjuliangarces.org.mx/\"> Fray Juli\u00e1n Garc\u00e9s Centre for Human Rights and Local Development</a>, has spent the last 20 years denouncing the pollution caused by Mexican and foreign multinationals settled in the industrial district. \u201cThe smell is terrible: toxic, sweet but spicy at night. It makes people dizzy or vomit,\u201d she says, referring to the region where VW and Pemex, the Mexican state-controlled oil company, have been since the 1960s.</p> <p>In 2011, local communities filed a complaint with the <a href=\"https://www.cndh.org.mx/\">Mexican National Human Rights Commission</a>. That led to <a href=\"https://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/doc/recomendaciones/2017/rec_2017_010.pdf\">a recommendation in 2017</a> urging the state governments of Puebla and Tlaxcala to implement measures to guarantee their right to a healthy environment.</p> <p>From 2015 to 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/profepa\">federal environmental prosecutor\u2019s office</a> (Profepa) conducted 945 inspection visits, leading to the closure of 27 industries for mishandling hazardous waste. It also initiated <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/profepa/prensa/juzgado-tercero-de-distrito-informo-negativa-de-suspension-definitiva-de-amparo-por-caso-rio-atoyac\">legal actions against 38 municipalities</a> over their responsibility for the pollution. From 2022 to mid-2023, the prosecutors enforced another 13 closures, mainly in San Mart\u00edn Texmelucan and Puebla.</p> <p>Last year, the Mexican secretariat of environment and natural resources, along with the <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/conagua/\">National Water Commission</a> (Conagua), <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/859856/1._Nota_Informativa_sobre_la_calidad_del_agua_Puebla-Tlaxcala.pdf\">released a report acknowledging</a> that out of 18 locations along the Atoyac River in Puebla and Tlaxcala, only one was found to be unpolluted.</p>    <p>***</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/859871/6_IPTARI_Cuenca_Alta_del_R_o_Atoyac_2022.pdf\">non-municipal wastewater treatment plants</a> inventory, 219 companies discharged wastewater into the Atoyac River basin every day in 2022. Although multinationals from several countries pour their waters into the Atoyac, many of the biggest are German.</p> <p>Last year, Puebla was the leading Mexican exporter to Germany, moving goods worth $3.66bn (\u00a32.82bn). A <a href=\"https://www.economia.gob.mx/datamexico/es/profile/country/alemania#fdi-by-states\">report from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Economy</a> on foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that from January to June, it received $942m worth of German investment, second only to Mexico City, with $1.45bn in investments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://cdn.conahcyt.mx/enis/toxicologia/resa-atoyac/inicio/descargables/informe-caa.pdf\">Conahcyt says that</a> the heavy metals, metalloids, organic-synthetic compounds, and pesticides dumped in the Atoyac by industry are the reason behind the high rates of diseases related to pollution among the local population \u2013 rates that surpass Mexico\u2019s national average.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to data from the pollutant release and transfer register , the area with the highest emissions is the Zahuapan area, a sub-basin of the Atoyac River located in Tlaxcala,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn this sub-region, there are important chemical and other industries of various kinds that are also highly polluting.\u201d</p>    <p>Another report, this time from the <a href=\"https://app.conagua.gob.mx/consultarepda.aspx\">Public Registry of Water Rights</a>, says in Puebla alone, BASF extracts approximately 1,750 cubic meters of water a day and discharges almost 194,000 cubic meters of wastewater annually directly into the Atoyac River.</p> <p>BASF says it operates its Puebla site \u201cin full compliance with local and federal laws and upholds a strong commitment to environmental stewardship across all its locations\u201d. The company highlights that since its establishment, the Puebla facility has operated a wastewater treatment plant 24 hours a day as part of its commitment to safe production for people and the environment, and has held the Clean Industry Certificate, issued by Profepa, since 2015.</p> <p>\u201cWe operate in alignment with local and federal laws that apply to us and with the Corporate Target Introduction of Sustainable Water Management,\u201d says BASF.</p> <p>Volkswagen\u2019s car assembly plants, also sitting next to the Atoyac, have extracted 1.5m cubic meters of water annually since May 1996, the exact volume of annual residual discharges the company reports to have made since 2004. In response to inquiries about the wastewater in the Atoyac, the company says it complies with \u201call the measurements required by applicable Mexican regulations\u201d.</p>    <p>Bayer says its production plant in Tlaxcala is dedicated to biofungicides, \u201cwith no chemical products produced on-site\u201d. The company says it has undergone inspections by the Mexican authorities, including Conagua and Profepa, and has not received any sanctions. The Tlaxcala\u2019s facility, says the organisation, does not discharge wastewater directly into the Atoyac River, but \u201cpre-treated wastewater\u201d in accordance with the state water and sanitation commission of Tlaxcala, which is responsible for its final discharge.</p> <p>\u201cBayer has maintained an open-door and transparency policy, informing the community, authorities, and all interested parties about its high standards of environmental protection, as well as its wastewater treatment process,\u201d the company says, adding: \u201cThe site complies with all applicable regulations and with the company\u2019s global international standards.\u201d</p> <p>Thyssenkrupp says it is \u201cnot aware of any complaints regarding the health of the local population, nor have any inspections been carried out by the Federal Environmental Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d. The company adds that wastewater \u201cis treated in water treatment plants and monitored by the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with officially established limits\u201d and reiterates that it follows \u201ccompany-wide standards\u201d, such as the <a href=\"https://lieferkettenmanagement.one/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Yy5BhD-ARIsAI0RbXbMoe9SJnCdShTHzt4VciVMOqFxfFqL9VzWe6w5nvE8uMHsxzDB_FMaAp9tEALw_wcB\">german supply chain due diligence act</a> and the principles of compliance with <a href=\"https://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/company/sustainability/social-responsibility/human-rights\">human rights and environmental due diligence</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Campaigners say that in the past 60 years, Mexico has made political decisions based on achieving economic growth, not environmental consequences. Rodolfo Omar Arellano-Aguilar, a researcher on ecology and natural resources at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, says that Mexican legislation allows high pollution levels and does not specify criteria to verify who is polluting.</p> <p>\u201cIndustries must keep their pollutants below certain levels, but those limits are absurdly high,\u201d he says. \u201cDespite that, discharges are carried out into common drains, making it impossible to know who is responsible.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to facing increasing pushback from federal authorities and affected communities in Mexico, the German and other European corporations blamed for damaging the Atoyac basin will soon be under greater scrutiny from the EU.</p>    <p>In April 2024, the European parliament approved the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/sustainability-due-diligence-responsible-business/corporate-sustainability-due-diligence_en\">corporate sustainability due diligence directive</a>, a new regulation strengthening European companies\u2019 responsibility for environmental practices beyond EU borders.</p> <p>The directive came despite two years of lobbying by industrial groups and efforts by German officials to water down the directive\u2019s scope, \u201cseeking to diminish the law\u2019s potential impact\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en\">Corporate Europe Observatory</a>. \u201cGerman business lobby groups have done their utmost to use the German law as a lever to keep European ambitions in check,\u201d <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/INSIDE-JOB_-How-business-lobbyists-used-the-Commissions-scrutiny-procedures.pdf\">says Friends of the Earth</a>.</p>    <p>At the final vote in Strasbourg\u2019s last plenary session before the EU election, MEPs approved a text that entered into force in July and will affect companies with more than 1,000 employees and an annual turnover of more than \u20ac450m (\u00a3376m).</p> <p>The German conglomerates in the Atoyac will fall within the scope of the EU regulation from 2027 onwards, when they will be obliged to integrate due diligence into their business policies to comply with the directive.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.basf.com/dam/jcr:38c2fd83-430e-3339-acf0-9784aa915111/BASF_Position_Mandatory-Due-Diligence.pdf\">BASF publicly welcomed the new regulations</a>, while Bayer joined a group of companies that <a href=\"https://media.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/240207_BusinessStatement_CSDDD_EN.pdf\">publicly condemned</a> German chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s manoeuvres to water down the directive.</p> <p>Finnish Green MEP Heidi Hautala, the directive\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d rapporteur, says these companies no longer opposed the new directive \u201cpartly because of the concessions agreed between member states\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn some ways,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are in the direction <em>they</em> wanted to go.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.journalismfund.eu/\">Journalismfund Europe</a> supported this story</em></p></li> </ul>",

Spanning 47 municipalities in the state of Tlaxcala and 22 in the state of Puebla, it is home to 1.1 million people. Running through the area is the Atoyac River. But it is not a river that the community is proud of. \u201cPeople used to wash clothes as the water was crystal clear, and they even bathed in the river,\u201d remembers Mar\u00eda Ocotl\u00e1n, a Mexican snack shop owner on Munich Street. \u201cNow, you can\u2019t even wash your hands. The deterioration has been going on for 20 years.\u201d The Upper Atoyac basin is one of 30 regions identified as being in a state of socio-environmental and health emergency in Mexico, polluted by sewage and waste from homes, farmland, and, above all, factories. Now, the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has promised to clean up the Atoyac \u2013 as well as the Lerma, Santiago and Tula Rivers \u2013 as one of the 100 priorities of her recently sworn-in government. But to meet her commitment, Sheinbaum, a former climate scientist, will have to confront multinational companies accused by campaigners of harming the river. Since 2021, a coalition of Mexican and international NGOs and experts has been denouncing New Germany \u2013 and especially the German multinationals \u2013 for the environmental devastation of the Atoyac, blaming \u201cthe pollution left by transnational corporations such as Volkswagen, Bayer, BASF and Thyssenkrupp, among others\u201d for \u201cleaving its mark on the territory and people\u2019s bodies\u201d. In October 2023, the National Council of Science and Technology (Conahcyt), a public body of the Mexican government, acknowledged in a report that the region\u2019s pollutants posed severe threats to public health. The report showed that the mortality rate from chronic kidney diseases among people aged 15 to 49 in Tlaxcala regions within the Upper Atoyac basin was almost five times higher than the national average. High mortality rates from acute leukaemias in individuals under 19 were also more common in the southern part of the basin, particularly in Puebla and Tlaxcala, where the levels of metals and arsenic in the river are significantly higher. \u201cOver the last decades, the inhabitants of the Upper Atoyac basin have witnessed the constant increase of industrial settlements such as the arrival of Volkswagen in 1965, the creation of the Independencia Petrochemical Complex in 1969 or the installation of the Audi company in 2016, among others,\u201d says the document. \u201cThe region witnessed an economic development of apparent prosperity, but the organisation of global mercantile processes that privileged the profitability of transnational companies promoted health, social and environmental \u2018externalities\u2019 with serious effects for local communities.\u201d The report noted: \u201cThe scientific evidence presented in this first report demonstrates that these high [mortality] rates are caused by exposure to toxins and polluting processes from industries located in the region. The automotive, electrical, chemical and textile industries have the highest pollutant emissions.\u201d Alejandra M\u00e9ndez, who directs the Fray Juli\u00e1n Garc\u00e9s Centre for Human Rights and Local Development, has spent the last 20 years denouncing the pollution caused by Mexican and foreign multinationals settled in the industrial district. \u201cThe smell is terrible: toxic, sweet but spicy at night. It makes people dizzy or vomit,\u201d she says, referring to the region where VW and Pemex, the Mexican state-controlled oil company, have been since the 1960s. In 2011, local communities filed a complaint with the Mexican National Human Rights Commission. That led to a recommendation in 2017 urging the state governments of Puebla and Tlaxcala to implement measures to guarantee their right to a healthy environment. From 2015 to 2017, the federal environmental prosecutor\u2019s office (Profepa) conducted 945 inspection visits, leading to the closure of 27 industries for mishandling hazardous waste. It also initiated legal actions against 38 municipalities over their responsibility for the pollution. From 2022 to mid-2023, the prosecutors enforced another 13 closures, mainly in San Mart\u00edn Texmelucan and Puebla. Last year, the Mexican secretariat of environment and natural resources, along with the National Water Commission (Conagua), released a report acknowledging that out of 18 locations along the Atoyac River in Puebla and Tlaxcala, only one was found to be unpolluted. *** According to the non-municipal wastewater treatment plants inventory, 219 companies discharged wastewater into the Atoyac River basin every day in 2022. Although multinationals from several countries pour their waters into the Atoyac, many of the biggest are German. Last year, Puebla was the leading Mexican exporter to Germany, moving goods worth $3.66bn (\u00a32.82bn). A report from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Economy on foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that from January to June, it received $942m worth of German investment, second only to Mexico City, with $1.45bn in investments. Conahcyt says that the heavy metals, metalloids, organic-synthetic compounds, and pesticides dumped in the Atoyac by industry are the reason behind the high rates of diseases related to pollution among the local population \u2013 rates that surpass Mexico\u2019s national average. \u201cAccording to data from the pollutant release and transfer register , the area with the highest emissions is the Zahuapan area, a sub-basin of the Atoyac River located in Tlaxcala,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn this sub-region, there are important chemical and other industries of various kinds that are also highly polluting.\u201d Another report, this time from the Public Registry of Water Rights, says in Puebla alone, BASF extracts approximately 1,750 cubic meters of water a day and discharges almost 194,000 cubic meters of wastewater annually directly into the Atoyac River. BASF says it operates its Puebla site \u201cin full compliance with local and federal laws and upholds a strong commitment to environmental stewardship across all its locations\u201d. The company highlights that since its establishment, the Puebla facility has operated a wastewater treatment plant 24 hours a day as part of its commitment to safe production for people and the environment, and has held the Clean Industry Certificate, issued by Profepa, since 2015. \u201cWe operate in alignment with local and federal laws that apply to us and with the Corporate Target Introduction of Sustainable Water Management,\u201d says BASF. Volkswagen\u2019s car assembly plants, also sitting next to the Atoyac, have extracted 1.5m cubic meters of water annually since May 1996, the exact volume of annual residual discharges the company reports to have made since 2004. In response to inquiries about the wastewater in the Atoyac, the company says it complies with \u201call the measurements required by applicable Mexican regulations\u201d. Bayer says its production plant in Tlaxcala is dedicated to biofungicides, \u201cwith no chemical products produced on-site\u201d. The company says it has undergone inspections by the Mexican authorities, including Conagua and Profepa, and has not received any sanctions. The Tlaxcala\u2019s facility, says the organisation, does not discharge wastewater directly into the Atoyac River, but \u201cpre-treated wastewater\u201d in accordance with the state water and sanitation commission of Tlaxcala, which is responsible for its final discharge. \u201cBayer has maintained an open-door and transparency policy, informing the community, authorities, and all interested parties about its high standards of environmental protection, as well as its wastewater treatment process,\u201d the company says, adding: \u201cThe site complies with all applicable regulations and with the company\u2019s global international standards.\u201d Thyssenkrupp says it is \u201cnot aware of any complaints regarding the health of the local population, nor have any inspections been carried out by the Federal Environmental Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d. The company adds that wastewater \u201cis treated in water treatment plants and monitored by the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with officially established limits\u201d and reiterates that it follows \u201ccompany-wide standards\u201d, such as the german supply chain due diligence act and the principles of compliance with human rights and environmental due diligence. *** Campaigners say that in the past 60 years, Mexico has made political decisions based on achieving economic growth, not environmental consequences. Rodolfo Omar Arellano-Aguilar, a researcher on ecology and natural resources at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, says that Mexican legislation allows high pollution levels and does not specify criteria to verify who is polluting. \u201cIndustries must keep their pollutants below certain levels, but those limits are absurdly high,\u201d he says. \u201cDespite that, discharges are carried out into common drains, making it impossible to know who is responsible.\u201d In addition to facing increasing pushback from federal authorities and affected communities in Mexico, the German and other European corporations blamed for damaging the Atoyac basin will soon be under greater scrutiny from the EU. In April 2024, the European parliament approved the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, a new regulation strengthening European companies\u2019 responsibility for environmental practices beyond EU borders. The directive came despite two years of lobbying by industrial groups and efforts by German officials to water down the directive\u2019s scope, \u201cseeking to diminish the law\u2019s potential impact\u201d, according to the Corporate Europe Observatory. \u201cGerman business lobby groups have done their utmost to use the German law as a lever to keep European ambitions in check,\u201d says Friends of the Earth. At the final vote in Strasbourg\u2019s last plenary session before the EU election, MEPs approved a text that entered into force in July and will affect companies with more than 1,000 employees and an annual turnover of more than \u20ac450m (\u00a3376m). The German conglomerates in the Atoyac will fall within the scope of the EU regulation from 2027 onwards, when they will be obliged to integrate due diligence into their business policies to comply with the directive. BASF publicly welcomed the new regulations, while Bayer joined a group of companies that publicly condemned German chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s manoeuvres to water down the directive. Finnish Green MEP Heidi Hautala, the directive\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d rapporteur, says these companies no longer opposed the new directive \u201cpartly because of the concessions agreed between member states\u201d. \u201cIn some ways,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are in the direction they wanted to go.\u201d Journalismfund Europe supported this story",

But in fact it was Garrett Morris who kicked that door down.</p> \n<p>For five seasons, beginning with SNL\u2019s launch in 1975, he broke ground as the show\u2019s only Black cast member, dutifully serving as the show\u2019s Black conscience.

Otherwise, he is as sharp as ever, reflecting on his tremendous life over a two-hour Zoom call from Los Angeles while puffing on a joint.</p> \n<p>As Morris tells it, had it been up to his pious New Orleans family, his career would have never happened. The last thing his grandmother told him before he moved to New York was: \u201cYou will never succeed.\u201d She did her part to make sure of it, calling ahead to tell Morris\u2019s aunt in the Bronx to turn him away on sight. In previous interviews Garrett has talked about being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raxq3IsmgJA\">a child of rape</a>, a trauma that made it difficult for his family to fully accept him.</p> \n<p>For an uncomfortably long stretch in the early 60s, Morris was unhoused and living on the streets of Harlem. Facing serious jail time for vagrancy, he caught a break from a sympathetic judge \u2013 who set Morris up with a room at a local YMCA until he could find a job. It was there, while holding a self-directed singing rehearsal in the Y\u2019s auditorium, that Morris crossed paths with a prolific singer called Ned Wright. \u201cNed hears me sing and says, \u2018There\u2019s a job for you, with the Harry Belafonte Folk Singers.\u2019\u201d As Morris toured the country as part of one of the biggest acts around, he was forced to reckon with segregated laws that sometimes forbade his Black and white bandmates from staying in the same hotel.</p> \n<p>The racism shaped his views of America and show business and, eventually, promoted his move into the world of experimental Harlem theater \u2013 which was under constant police surveillance. \u201cEvery three months or so, the cops would be coming up the stairs with AK-47s,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe third time it happened, I said, \u2018Call me an Uncle Tom if you want to, but I gotta find another line of work.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>SNL was nominally a safer work environment, but it still aspired to be thought of as edgy. Though hired by the producer Lorne Michaels into SNL\u2019s writers\u2019 room in 1975 for the debut season, Morris was also tasked with recruiting Black actors as supporting performers. All the while, he found it difficult writing jokes with preppy white guys like Tom Schiller and Al Franken.</p> \n<p>\u201cI will say to the end of my days: Lorne\u2019s writers had a lot of racism going on,\u201d Morris says, \u201cLorne himself? Zero racism. Because, remember, when I was hired I was the only Black writer. Lorne wanted to have somebody Black on TV at night-time. People didn\u2019t want that. They were clamoring to make it all white. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<p>And yet, Morris assumed his days on SNL were numbered when Michaels called him to the Studio 8H green room early in production for a one-on-one meeting. But when he walked in, he saw Michaels was watching <a href=\"https://www.criterionforum.org/Review/cooley-high-the-criterion-collection-blu-ray#google_vignette\">Cooley High</a>, the Black cinema classic in which Morris has a meaty part as a history teacher. Apparently, Gilda Radner, Laraine Newman and Jane Curtin had put Michaels on to it. \u201cBecause of that, I was asked to audition for the Not Ready for Prime Time Players [the working title for SNL],\u201d Morris says, \u201cand I went from being a writer to being part of the group.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morris\u2019s time on the show wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d call fun. \u201cI made a lot of bad choices,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a coke fiend.\u201d But in his defense, SNL had a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/us-news/saturday-night-lives-first-season-was-fueled-by-drugs-and-booze-sources/\">pretty serious drugs problem</a> at the time. Throughout his five years on SNL, Morris fought against attempts to pigeonhole him into stereotypical Black roles. \u201cIt really threw me when we were going through the first show,\u201d Morris says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a skit, but I was watching another one. I said to Lorne, \u2018There\u2019s a doctor in this skit. Why don\u2019t I play the doctor?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Garrett, people might be thrown by a Black doctor.\u2019 Now mind you I had come from New Orleans, where you\u2019re surrounded by Black medical doctors and<strong> </strong>Black PhDs. In all big cities down south, for that matter.\u201d</p> \n<p>Somewhat reluctantly, he scored his breakout with Chico Escuela, the Dominican Major Leaguer whose one line is \u201cbase-e-bol been beddy-beddy good to me\u201d. And fans really liked him as the deaf interpreter on the Update desk who simply said Chevy Chase\u2019s news lines louder, instead of signing them. Throughout, Morris, who came to SNL as an accomplished playwright, did what he could to imbue the stereotypical roles with intellect and nobility.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, SNL\u2019s white writers failed to appreciate Morris as more than a Black utility player. As a result, the Black performers who followed Morris on the show publicly expressed their concerns about being similarly used. None were louder about it than Murphy, who made Morris\u2019s name a byword for racial typecasting. It hurt. \u201cI feel proud that I was a minuscule part of the beginning of SNL,\u201d Morris says, \u201cthat I created the chair for the non-white performer.\u201d</p> \n<p>After 99 episodes, Morris moved on from SNL to one-off parts on sitcoms like The Love Boat, Who\u2019s the Boss? and Married \u2026 with Children. And while he\u2019d often join forces with other SNL alums, Morris only worked with Michaels once after leaving the show on the 1993 Coneheads film. By then, Morris had already moved to Martin \u2013 the Martin Lawrence small-screen vehicle that has been described as the I Love Lucy of Black TV. Morris played Stan, the skinflint radio station boss that time forgot. The gig was going well until Morris was shot in an LA car park during a botched hold-up attempt.</p> \n<p>\u201cSomething happened to this day that I\u2019ll never understand,\u201d says Morris. \u201cWhile I\u2019m going to get what amounted to 10 operations, I get a script that says, \u2018Stan sells the radio station and moves to China.\u2019 My makeup lady was in the hospital room at the time, and I had her read it. I said, \u2018It sounds like I\u2019m being fired.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Luckily for Morris, Foxx was waiting with his own network TV project to pick up Morris as soon as Martin dropped him. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t do any background checks, either!\u201d Morris jokes. He wound up scoring a lead role as Uncle Junior \u2013 the gambling addict father figure who runs the family business, an LA hotel \u2013 and The Jamie Foxx Show went on to a 100-episode run, the bar for syndication.</p> \n<p>After The Jamie Foxx Show, Morris strung together bit parts in film (Ice Cube\u2019s The Longshots) and TV (Family Guy) before landing another mega sitcom role in 2 Broke Girls as Earl, the tart-tongued diner cashier who\u2019s stuck in his 60s heyday. So what if it was another supporting role. That sitcom ran for 138 episodes, longer than any of his other hits, and paid him more than he\u2019d ever made on TV.</p> \n<p>Morris was not slated to be involved with the SNL feature film Saturday Night. But then Lamorne Morris, the New Girl star tapped to play the SNL pioneer (no relation), reached out to his namesake after being explicitly told not to by the director, Jason Reitman. (\u201cI wanted to make sure he was actually going through this stuff,\u201d Lamorne <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/features/saturday-night-lamorne-morris-garrett-morris-snl-host-1236174690/\">told Variety</a>.)</p> \n<p>It\u2019s just one of a number of ways that this generation\u2019s Black performers look out for Morris. Robin Thede, the creator of A Black Lady Sketch Show, is one of a number of Black writers who have scrambled to cast Morris in their projects. Their respect for him means the world. \u201cI like what I see coming up,\u201d Morris says. \u201cI have no doubt that the new crop of comics will hold us in good stead.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for SNL, he still watches, of course \u2013 but can\u2019t help feeling as if something\u2019s missing. \u201cI don\u2019t see the courage,\u201d he says, \u201cthe experimental impulses. That was the whole core of what happened the first 10 years. I keep expecting it to attack in a funny way and bring out the foibles not only of individuals but of the government and all that. And nowadays, although people still check it out, I think they\u2019re catering to too many people too much of the time.\u201d</p>",

As a result, the Black performers who followed Morris on the show publicly expressed their concerns about being similarly used. None were louder about it than Murphy, who made Morris\u2019s name a byword for racial typecasting. It hurt. \u201cI feel proud that I was a minuscule part of the beginning of SNL,\u201d Morris says, \u201cthat I created the chair for the non-white performer.\u201d After 99 episodes, Morris moved on from SNL to one-off parts on sitcoms like The Love Boat, Who\u2019s the Boss? and Married \u2026 with Children. And while he\u2019d often join forces with other SNL alums, Morris only worked with Michaels once after leaving the show on the 1993 Coneheads film. By then, Morris had already moved to Martin \u2013 the Martin Lawrence small-screen vehicle that has been described as the I Love Lucy of Black TV. Morris played Stan, the skinflint radio station boss that time forgot. The gig was going well until Morris was shot in an LA car park during a botched hold-up attempt. \u201cSomething happened to this day that I\u2019ll never understand,\u201d says Morris. \u201cWhile I\u2019m going to get what amounted to 10 operations, I get a script that says, \u2018Stan sells the radio station and moves to China.\u2019 My makeup lady was in the hospital room at the time, and I had her read it. I said, \u2018It sounds like I\u2019m being fired.\u2019\u201d Luckily for Morris, Foxx was waiting with his own network TV project to pick up Morris as soon as Martin dropped him. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t do any background checks, either!\u201d Morris jokes. He wound up scoring a lead role as Uncle Junior \u2013 the gambling addict father figure who runs the family business, an LA hotel \u2013 and The Jamie Foxx Show went on to a 100-episode run, the bar for syndication. After The Jamie Foxx Show, Morris strung together bit parts in film (Ice Cube\u2019s The Longshots) and TV (Family Guy) before landing another mega sitcom role in 2 Broke Girls as Earl, the tart-tongued diner cashier who\u2019s stuck in his 60s heyday. So what if it was another supporting role. That sitcom ran for 138 episodes, longer than any of his other hits, and paid him more than he\u2019d ever made on TV. Morris was not slated to be involved with the SNL feature film Saturday Night. But then Lamorne Morris, the New Girl star tapped to play the SNL pioneer (no relation), reached out to his namesake after being explicitly told not to by the director, Jason Reitman. (\u201cI wanted to make sure he was actually going through this stuff,\u201d Lamorne told Variety.) It\u2019s just one of a number of ways that this generation\u2019s Black performers look out for Morris. Robin Thede, the creator of A Black Lady Sketch Show, is one of a number of Black writers who have scrambled to cast Morris in their projects. Their respect for him means the world. \u201cI like what I see coming up,\u201d Morris says. \u201cI have no doubt that the new crop of comics will hold us in good stead.\u201d As for SNL, he still watches, of course \u2013 but can\u2019t help feeling as if something\u2019s missing. \u201cI don\u2019t see the courage,\u201d he says, \u201cthe experimental impulses. That was the whole core of what happened the first 10 years. I keep expecting it to attack in a funny way and bring out the foibles not only of individuals but of the government and all that. And nowadays, although people still check it out, I think they\u2019re catering to too many people too much of the time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Peter Perrett\u2019s third solo album opens with a track called I Wanna Go With Dignity. You could suggest that\u2019s par for the course: a certain morbidity has hung around Perrett\u2019s writing from the start, perhaps an inevitable consequence of his lifestyle choices. \u201cI always flirt with death / I look ill but I don\u2019t care about it,\u201d opened Another Girl, Another Planet, the most famous song by his old band the Only Ones, part of an oeuvre that also included Why Don\u2019t You Kill Yourself?, Creature of Doom, Curtains for You and From Here to Eternity. He was still at it 35 years after the Only Ones split: recorded after he had finally conquered his addictions, his debut solo album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/29/peter-perrett-how-the-west-was-won-review-the-only-ones\">How the West Was Won</a> opened with a fantasy of killing himself and ended with Perrett wishing he could pass \u201cin a hail of bullets\u201d.</p>    <p>Nevertheless, a genuine sense of finality does hang around The Cleansing. Perrett himself has compared it to \u201cJohnny Cash doing his best work right at the end\u201d. From its title to its dimensions \u2013 a double album twice as long, at 70 minutes, as 2019\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/07/peter-perrett-humanworld-review\">Humanworld</a> \u2013 to the cross-generational array of collaborators, including Johnny Marr and Carlos O\u2019Connell of Fontaines DC (whose presence inevitably carries the tang of homage) it\u2019s hard to avoid the sense of a last splurge from an artist who has unexpectedly managed to make it into his 70s, despite his best efforts to the contrary. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome,\u201d he keeps singing on its opening track, a man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aware of his mortality.</p> <p>Remarkably, his health issues don\u2019t seem to have affected Perrett\u2019s voice much \u2013 you can make out a hint of huskiness, but it\u2019s otherwise pretty much the Lou Reed-by-way-of-south London drawl of the late 70s. What\u2019s striking about The Cleansing is what he\u2019s singing. Perrett\u2019s most famous songs exist in an icy emotional landscape in which a blithe disregard for his own welfare is matched by a marked callousness towards others: whether by default or by design, they seemed to unsparingly capture a junkie\u2019s fatalistic self-destruction and numbed solipsism. You might expect a certain degree of rueful reflection from a cleaned-up septuagenarian surveying the wreckage of his past, which The Cleansing duly delivers on Do Not Resuscitate, Set the House on Fire\u2019s saga of improbably enduring love and the closing Crystal Clear: \u201cYou thought you\u2019d teach them all the lesson, but it seems you weren\u2019t that clever.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E68lB25r7CY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E68lB25r7CY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Peter Perrett: Disinfectant \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s similarly hard-won wisdom on Solitary Confinement and Survival Mode; the spectacularly bleak Less Than Nothing, meanwhile, depicts old age and failing health in the kind of unflinching terms with which Perrett once depicted anaesthetised indifference. More startling is what happens when Perrett turns his gaze outwards and the amount of empathy he displays for others: the litany of suicides in I Wanna Go With Dignity, the girl spiralling out of control in Disinfectant, the subject of There for You, struggling with their mental health (\u201cit\u2019s too late when people die \u2026 I don\u2019t want to let you down\u201d).</p> <p>The sound is equally striking. Anyone who knows Perrett\u2019s work might anticipate the songs being well written. You can aim a number of criticisms at his back catalogue, from the over-production that bedevilled the Only Ones\u2019 albums to the fact that there just isn\u2019t that much of it, but when he\u2019s managed to rouse himself into making records, his songwriting abilities have seldom failed him, and they don\u2019t here. For a man who recently told an interviewer \u201cmy body is crawling on its knees and my mind\u2019s dying on its feet\u201d, The Cleansing sounds remarkably vital and dynamic. The music swings and punches and roars along: a mass of distorted guitars, occasionally underpinned with a Suicide-evoking electronic pulse, as on Women Gone Bad, or the title track. If it feels faintly bizarre to say that a set of songs largely concerned with decline, death and regret are possessed of joie de vivre, it\u2019s nevertheless true.

      "bodyText": "Peter Perrett\u2019s third solo album opens with a track called I Wanna Go With Dignity. You could suggest that\u2019s par for the course: a certain morbidity has hung around Perrett\u2019s writing from the start, perhaps an inevitable consequence of his lifestyle choices. \u201cI always flirt with death / I look ill but I don\u2019t care about it,\u201d opened Another Girl, Another Planet, the most famous song by his old band the Only Ones, part of an oeuvre that also included Why Don\u2019t You Kill Yourself?, Creature of Doom, Curtains for You and From Here to Eternity. He was still at it 35 years after the Only Ones split: recorded after he had finally conquered his addictions, his debut solo album How the West Was Won opened with a fantasy of killing himself and ended with Perrett wishing he could pass \u201cin a hail of bullets\u201d. Nevertheless, a genuine sense of finality does hang around The Cleansing. Perrett himself has compared it to \u201cJohnny Cash doing his best work right at the end\u201d. From its title to its dimensions \u2013 a double album twice as long, at 70 minutes, as 2019\u2019s Humanworld \u2013 to the cross-generational array of collaborators, including Johnny Marr and Carlos O\u2019Connell of Fontaines DC (whose presence inevitably carries the tang of homage) it\u2019s hard to avoid the sense of a last splurge from an artist who has unexpectedly managed to make it into his 70s, despite his best efforts to the contrary. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome,\u201d he keeps singing on its opening track, a man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aware of his mortality. Remarkably, his health issues don\u2019t seem to have affected Perrett\u2019s voice much \u2013 you can make out a hint of huskiness, but it\u2019s otherwise pretty much the Lou Reed-by-way-of-south London drawl of the late 70s. What\u2019s striking about The Cleansing is what he\u2019s singing. Perrett\u2019s most famous songs exist in an icy emotional landscape in which a blithe disregard for his own welfare is matched by a marked callousness towards others: whether by default or by design, they seemed to unsparingly capture a junkie\u2019s fatalistic self-destruction and numbed solipsism. You might expect a certain degree of rueful reflection from a cleaned-up septuagenarian surveying the wreckage of his past, which The Cleansing duly delivers on Do Not Resuscitate, Set the House on Fire\u2019s saga of improbably enduring love and the closing Crystal Clear: \u201cYou thought you\u2019d teach them all the lesson, but it seems you weren\u2019t that clever.\u201d There\u2019s similarly hard-won wisdom on Solitary Confinement and Survival Mode; the spectacularly bleak Less Than Nothing, meanwhile, depicts old age and failing health in the kind of unflinching terms with which Perrett once depicted anaesthetised indifference. More startling is what happens when Perrett turns his gaze outwards and the amount of empathy he displays for others: the litany of suicides in I Wanna Go With Dignity, the girl spiralling out of control in Disinfectant, the subject of There for You, struggling with their mental health (\u201cit\u2019s too late when people die \u2026 I don\u2019t want to let you down\u201d). The sound is equally striking. Anyone who knows Perrett\u2019s work might anticipate the songs being well written. You can aim a number of criticisms at his back catalogue, from the over-production that bedevilled the Only Ones\u2019 albums to the fact that there just isn\u2019t that much of it, but when he\u2019s managed to rouse himself into making records, his songwriting abilities have seldom failed him, and they don\u2019t here. For a man who recently told an interviewer \u201cmy body is crawling on its knees and my mind\u2019s dying on its feet\u201d, The Cleansing sounds remarkably vital and dynamic. The music swings and punches and roars along: a mass of distorted guitars, occasionally underpinned with a Suicide-evoking electronic pulse, as on Women Gone Bad, or the title track. If it feels faintly bizarre to say that a set of songs largely concerned with decline, death and regret are possessed of joie de vivre, it\u2019s nevertheless true. In fact, that might be one of the secrets of The Cleansing\u2019s success: the world-weariness of the words is never reflected in the sound. Given his history, fans could be forgiven for special pleading on Perrett\u2019s behalf \u2013 a round of applause for still being alive \u2013 but The Cleansing doesn\u2019t require special pleading. Its two predecessors were surprisingly good, this is genuinely great. Circumstances dictate that you\u2019d struggle to call it a fresh start, but it\u2019s a distinct emotional shift away from the music that made him a cult hero. It feels oddly like Peter Perrett stepping out of the shadows cast by his former band, even as he stares down the gathering darkness.

Once dismissed as the pipe dream of fringe extremists, the idea is gaining momentum thanks to Israel\u2019s military success in Gaza and political support from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition.</p> <p>Last week, near Be\u2019eri, a border kibbutz devastated by the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, the pro-settlement organisation Nachala held a \u201cPreparing to Resettle Gaza\u201d conference, laying out its vision for the strip\u2019s future. The event was given a green light by the Israeli military despite the fact the area is still technically a closed military zone. Several hundred people showed up, including government ministers and Knesset members.</p> <p>The atmosphere at the two-day conference was festive, marking the Sukkot harvest celebration: there was singing and dancing, and popcorn and candy floss. The area was awash in the blue and white of the Israeli flag, and most of the men attending carried pistols or rifles.</p> <p>Adults took part in planning sessions in which speakers pointed out strategic areas on maps of Gaza, or milled about stands representing rightwing political parties and the Jewish supremacist group Lehava. Children enjoyed a puppet show and petting zoo.</p> <p>\u201cWe plan to take what we have acquired in the years of settling Judea and Samaria and to do the same thing here in Gaza,\u201d Nachala\u2019s chair, Daniella Weiss, a veteran of the settler movement, told those attending, using the Israeli nomenclature for the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>\u201cI want to tell you now, that in less than a year, you can call and ask me: \u2018Did you succeed in fulfilling your dream?\u2019 And the answer will be yes \u2026 Each of you will witness how Jews go to Gaza and Arabs will disappear from Gaza.\u201d</p> <p>The Palestinian population of Gaza would \u201cgo to different countries of the world,\u201d she said, without elaborating on how or why.</p>    <p>The Sukkot conference was the third big event this year promoting the return of settlers to Gaza, despite the fact that the movement does not have mainstream support among the Israeli public.</p> <p>Israeli settlement building in the occupied territories is illegal under international law and in effect kills off a two-state solution. Settlers argue they have religious and historical ties to the land, and that settlements are necessary for security.

      "bodyText": "From a few points on the periphery between Israel and Gaza, it is possible to see the bombed-out ruins of the besieged Palestinian territory; every so often, the boom and thud of airstrikes and artillery fire send plumes of grey and white smoke into the wide autumn sky. For most onlookers, the scene is apocalyptic \u2013 but for rightwing Israelis who want to resettle the strip, it is a promising new horizon. Once dismissed as the pipe dream of fringe extremists, the idea is gaining momentum thanks to Israel\u2019s military success in Gaza and political support from Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition. Last week, near Be\u2019eri, a border kibbutz devastated by the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, the pro-settlement organisation Nachala held a \u201cPreparing to Resettle Gaza\u201d conference, laying out its vision for the strip\u2019s future. The event was given a green light by the Israeli military despite the fact the area is still technically a closed military zone. Several hundred people showed up, including government ministers and Knesset members. The atmosphere at the two-day conference was festive, marking the Sukkot harvest celebration: there was singing and dancing, and popcorn and candy floss. The area was awash in the blue and white of the Israeli flag, and most of the men attending carried pistols or rifles. Adults took part in planning sessions in which speakers pointed out strategic areas on maps of Gaza, or milled about stands representing rightwing political parties and the Jewish supremacist group Lehava. Children enjoyed a puppet show and petting zoo. \u201cWe plan to take what we have acquired in the years of settling Judea and Samaria and to do the same thing here in Gaza,\u201d Nachala\u2019s chair, Daniella Weiss, a veteran of the settler movement, told those attending, using the Israeli nomenclature for the occupied West Bank. \u201cI want to tell you now, that in less than a year, you can call and ask me: \u2018Did you succeed in fulfilling your dream?\u2019 And the answer will be yes \u2026 Each of you will witness how Jews go to Gaza and Arabs will disappear from Gaza.\u201d The Palestinian population of Gaza would \u201cgo to different countries of the world,\u201d she said, without elaborating on how or why. The Sukkot conference was the third big event this year promoting the return of settlers to Gaza, despite the fact that the movement does not have mainstream support among the Israeli public. Israeli settlement building in the occupied territories is illegal under international law and in effect kills off a two-state solution. Settlers argue they have religious and historical ties to the land, and that settlements are necessary for security. Increasing political backing at home, as well as from Republicans and evangelical Christian groups in the US, has allowed settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and the West Bank to rocket in recent years, choking Palestinian life. The rightwing movement is arguably at the peak of its powers. Netanyahu returned to office two years ago at the helm of the most extremist coalition in Israeli history. His cabinet features the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, ultra-right politicians eager to provide government backing for settler activities. Over the past year of war with Hamas, several members of the prime minister\u2019s Likud party have also openly endorsed resettling Gaza. Amira Hass, the well-known Ramallah-based Israeli journalist and author, said: \u201cI say this not as a prophecy, but as a warning: the idea of resettling Gaza must be taken very seriously. When settlers first talked about going to Homesh [in the West Bank], and Sinai, and everywhere else, people didn\u2019t believe them. But the movement is one of the best organised political forces in Israel for the past 30 years. We are not talking about a bunch of dreamers \u2026 these are people with vast political and financial resources and a proven track record.\u201d Last December, Harey Zahav, a housebuilding company operating in Israeli settlements, released an image showing sketches of new homes among the destroyed remains of housing blocks along the Mediterranean shore in Gaza. \u201cA house on the beach is not a dream!\u201d the advertisement said, adding the company was \u201cworking to prepare the ground\u201d for a return to Gush Katif, a settlement in Gaza forcibly evicted by the military after Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal in 2005. Much of the Israeli right maintains that withdrawing from Gaza was a strategic mistake that allowed Hamas to amass power. In January, thousands of people, including government ministers and Knesset members, attended another Nachala gathering in Jerusalem. A month later, rightwing activists stormed the Erez crossing into northern Gaza, erecting a symbolic \u201coutpost\u201d before the army removed it, and in May, thousands took part in a Nachala-led rally in the border city of Sderot. The Sukkot conference comes a year into Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and as it becomes clearer that Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to outline a \u201cday after\u201d plan for the strip is likely to result in permanent military reoccupation. The ferocious renewed Israeli offensive on the northern third of Gaza, now in its fourth week, appears to be designed to force the remaining population to leave, leading to accusations of the war crime of forcible transfer. The Israeli military and government deny systemically trying to empty the area, but the operation has been enthusiastically embraced by the settler movement. \u201cIn these critical days, we want to raise awareness that only settlements [in Gaza] will bring about the security we had 20 years ago,\u201d one attender, Itzik Fitoussi, who was evicted from Gaza in 2005, and lost a son, who was in the military, on 7 October 2023, told Reuters. Resettling Gaza is not official Israeli policy, and the prime minister has repeatedly said that the idea is \u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201cnever in the cards\u201d. Nonetheless, senior Israeli defence officials recently told the Israeli daily Haaretz that the government is planning to annex large parts of the Palestinian territory. Speaking from her home in Kedumim, a settlement near Nablus, Weiss, a spry and animated 79, said she and others in Nachala had already begun to form \u201cnuclei\u201d keen to establish new settlement communities in Gaza. The groups were made up of former Gaza residents as well as recruits apparently newly seduced by the idea, she said. \u201cWe have six such groups, and each one includes hundreds of families,\u201d she said. \u201cAs of [six weeks ago], we had more than six or seven hundred families enrolled.\u201d Since the war in Gaza began, there has been renewed international focus on Israeli settlements and settler violence in the West Bank. Unprecedented pushback has come in the form of US, British, and EU sanctions. Weiss, under sanctions from Canada herself, says she is undeterred by criticism from abroad, pointing to what she claims is her personal success of establishing 300 settlements in the West Bank, where 500,000 Israeli settlers now live. \u201cI took all my experience from 50 years of dealing with settling the mountains, and I\u2019m mobilising it to create a new reality in Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think what I am saying is imaginary, some kind of fantasy.

In the biggest fiscal measures of Wednesday\u2019s budget, raising an additional \u00a325bn a year by the end of the parliament, Rachel Reeves announced an increase of 1.2 percentage points on the national insurance paid by employers, with the salary threshold at which this begins falling from \u00a39,100 a year to \u00a35,000.

      "body": "<p>In 2015, when I first played as Maxine Caulfield in the original <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/14/life-is-strange-episode-one-review\">Life Is Strange</a>, it was only the second time I had ever played a game starring a teenaged girl. (The first time was The Last of Us: Left Behind, which came out the year before.) It was an awkward game in a few ways, particularly its cringeworthy (mis)use of teen slang, but the intense, life-changing and sometimes conflicted relationship between Max and her (more than) friend Chloe rung true. It carried the whole game, actually, more than Max\u2019s time-rewinding powers or the murder mystery that powered the plot. I <em>believed </em>in Max and Chloe. The end of that game forces you into a horrible choice between, as Max would put it, two shitty futures, proving that even time travellers must live with the consequences of their actions. The reverberations of that choice run through this sequel, nine years later.</p> <p>Grownup Max is now artist in residence at a prestigious arts college, placing her somewhere between the students, with their parties and dramatic breakups and secret societies, and the teachers in the faculty, whose pettiness and preoccupations with their own agendas rarely paint them in a flattering light. She abandoned her home town and stopped using her time-rewinding powers after the events of the first Life Is Strange. Now she is tentatively trying to form new relationships in this fresh place. And, as she discovers when one of her new friends is murdered, she has a new power, too. She can slip between timelines, investigating the murder both in the timeline where it happened, and in an alternative reality where it didn\u2019t.</p>    <p>I\u2019ll say it upfront: Double Exposure does not stick the landing. There is so much potential in this setup and these characters, but it just doesn\u2019t quite come together. Some characters are great, believable and consistent; others, such as the cop competing with Max to solve the murder, behave ridiculously, or are maddeningly inconsistent, like Vinh the playboy actor who alternately sneers at Max and confides in her. There are some truly excellent individual scenes and moments here, particularly the intimate ones between Max and her friend Safi, and Max and the cute bartender she has a gigantic crush on: whoever wrote their first date deserves a raise. There are also two really good end-of-chapter twists in the story that made me really want to know how things were going to turn out.</p> <p>But none of it quite comes together in the end. There are plenty of small holes in the plot that, together, almost cause it to unravel. In service of this sometimes dodgy plot, characters do things that simply don\u2019t make sense, causing me to shout \u201c<em>W</em><em>hy</em> would you do that?\u201d at the screen on more than one occasion. I purposely screwed over one character again and again just to see how they\u2019d react, but they still seemed keen to be friends \u2013 because, it turned out, the story needed them later. The portrayal of grief and its effects, too, which really should be a key theme of the game for all kinds of reasons, is tonally off. I was so preoccupied by this that it really killed my sense of personal investment in Max and her story, and narrative games <em>rely </em>on their players feeling invested.</p> <p>The journal that once provided a little more insight into adolescent Max\u2019s inner life returns here, alongside messages and a social media network that live on her phone, letting you see conversations between characters and catch up on what happened to the surviving folk from Max\u2019s home town. I personally hated this; phone notifications kept popping up relentlessly as I was exploring the beautiful surrounds of Caledon University, and much as in real life, I ended up getting overwhelmed and ignoring them entirely. But they do provide some much-needed further context on the people surrounding Max and their relationships with each other.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBwB4behjRg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBwB4behjRg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure trailer \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnod\">Life Is Strange was a clever twist</a> on the idea of choice and consequence in narrative games: how does it change things if you can always rewind and pick a different option? Double Exposure\u2019s message is very different: a grownup Max is now determined to live in the present, however hard it is. This Max knows that nothing feels consequential if you can simply undo it. But she hasn\u2019t lost her spark; she\u2019s still thoughtful, determined, and just that little bit cringe. It has been a pleasure to be reunited with her. There are some wonderful lines and concepts in this game, enough to make me all the more frustrated that it\u2019s so inconsistent. The ending, particularly, was infuriating, though it does set things up intriguingly for another sequel. I hope that Deck Nine can build on this with whatever comes next.</p> <p>\u2022 Life Is Strange: Double Exposure is out now; \u00a349.99</p>",

The Conservative leadership candidate, who was then the immigration minister, received a six-month driving ban in April 2023 for driving his Land Rover at 68mph in a 40mph zone on the M1 on 5 August 2022. It has been revealed through a freedom of information request shared with the Guardian that Jenrick\u2019s use of the government car service (GCS) increased sharply between April and October 2023, the period when he was not allowed to drive. Over the course of 13 sitting days of parliament, from Monday 17 April to Sunday 14 May 2023, Jenrick used the service for 51 separate journeys. This was 55% more than the 33 journeys he took from Wednesday 26 October to Wednesday 16 November 2022, just before his driving ban was imposed. These two sets of 13 parliamentary sitting days were chosen to allow a comparison to be made with Jenrick\u2019s then Home Office colleague and former Tory leadership rival Tom Tugendhat, who was also banned from driving for six months, from 17 November 2022 until 17 May 2023. Tugendhat made 26 journeys using the GCS from Wednesday 26 October to Wednesday 16 November 2022, immediately before his ban was imposed. But from November until May 2023, Tugendhat made just 11 separate journeys with the service. If Jenrick\u2019s pattern of government car use was replicated in all the other weeks when parliament was sitting, the data suggests he would have made a minimum of 200 GCS journeys during the six-month ban. The ministerial code says: \u201cMinisters are permitted to use an official car for official business and for home to office journeys on the understanding that they are using the time to work. Where practicable, ministers are encouraged to use public transport.\u201d Questions have been raised over whether Jenrick needed a GCS car to travel from his home to his office during a working week in Westminster, as his main London residence is a five-minute walk from the Home Office headquarters. A source close to Jenrick said: \u201cThese journeys are only usable for ministerial business and have to be signed off by civil servants.

In July, the Guardian reported that Badenoch used her official ministerial car to go to a gym in Knightsbridge twice a week on the way to work, leaving the driver waiting for an hour each time.

The footage is apparently in a Swiss bank vault somewhere, and nobody who knows about it is prepared to say anything that makes a lick of sense.</p> <p>What tips this from being a comic novel into something more like a conceptual art project is that, foolishly or heroically, Ayoade has <em>actually written</em> the complete works of Harauld Hughes, in three volumes \u2013 Four Films, Plays Prose Pieces Poetry and The Models Trilogy \u2013 released, apparently, as limited editions, alongside the novel. So you can now read or even perform Platform, or The Awful Woman from Space. They come with straight-faced prefaces, timelines, deleted scenes, critical essays, the lot.

But there are differences, too. For Pinter\u2019s fabled love of cricket, substitute a fierce interest in badminton.</p> <p>Why badminton? The same reason, I suspect, why \u201cHarauld\u201d, and why the facial likeness between Ayoade and his subject. Because it\u2019s funny and a bit offbeat and random, and why not? Ayoade\u2019s book is full of such touches of mild absurdity. Its comic tenor is part satirical and part pure whimsy, and it\u2019s very beguiling.</p> <p>In the satirical mode, as he travels from interview to interview with pretentious Director Dan, Tony Camera and a stoner soundman called Wiggsy, Ayoade is excellently droll on the making of presenter-led telly \u201cdocs\u201d (it bugs our hero that Dan calls them that, but telly people undeniably do).

      "bodyText": "After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America\u2019s business leaders came out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now \u2013 as the Harris campaign brands Trump a \u201cfascist\u201d and Trump threatens retribution against \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d \u2013 there appears to be a conspiracy of silence. In fact, as the nation heads to the polls in an election that is too close to call, some of America\u2019s most powerful chief executives appear to be cozying up to Trump again. In public, only a small handful of business leaders are backing Trump. In private it\u2019s a different story. At least, that\u2019s how Trump is telling it. Over the last few weeks, he\u2019s bragged about the warm reception he\u2019s receiving from CEOs. At a recent rally, he said that the Google chief, Sundar Pichai, had called him with praise about his photoshoot at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania. The Apple chief, Tim Cook, reportedly called him to discuss the company\u2019s legal troubles in Europe. Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg was said to have called him over the summer after his assassination attempt. And then, after years of fielding attacks from Trump over his ownership of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos blocked the paper\u2019s endorsement of Kamala Harris. Bezos said the paper wouldn\u2019t do endorsements, as it had for half a century, to avoid perceptions of media bias. It all seems like an about-face compared with a few years ago, when the same executives were praising Joe Biden\u2019s win and openly criticizing Trump over the January 6 attack. And Trump is very much the same person: he has continued to insist that the insurrection was actually a \u201cday of love\u201d and has made clear he will not accept the results of the election if he loses. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way we\u2019re gonna lose, because they cheat,\u201d he said at a rally in September. But what may appear as silence from America\u2019s chief executives is actually restraint, according to some in the business community. \u201cThey have an obligation to work with whomever is president, so they don\u2019t want to come across as hostile and unable to work with him,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale professor who tracks the political preferences of C-suite executives. \u201cBut what is an undeniable historic fact is that there has never been in American history a less popular president with the nation\u2019s business leadership than Donald Trump.\u201d In an open letter in support of Harris, a dozen former CEOs brought together by Sonnenfeld said Trump was \u201canti-business\u201d. \u201cWhile each of us has different political affiliations, we are coming together to vote for Kamala Harris in this presidential election \u2013 and we believe the majority of sitting CEOs will do the same,\u201d the letter reads.

With many questioning the accuracy of political polling, supporters <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1843132050242777187\">including</a> Elon Musk, have started to claim such estimates are more accurate.</p> <p>As of Wednesday, Polymarket, one leading service, put Trump\u2019s chances of winning back the presidency at about 67%, with Harris at 33%. Another, Kalshi, put Trump at 62% and Harris at 38%.</p> <p>And while Trump\u2019s audience last Tuesday was not interested in gambling on the result of the presidential election, many others appear to be getting involved. High-profile legal battles, promotion by the likes of Musk and Trump, and growing media coverage, have helped propel the activity into the spotlight as the campaign gathered steam.</p> <p>Interest around betting on this election is \u201corders of magnitude larger\u201d than previous ballots, according to Thomas Gruca, a professor of marketing at the University of Iowa, and director of Iowa Electronic Markets, an election-focused futures market first established in 1988.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-big-bet\">America\u2019s gambling boom</a>, led by the legalization of sports betting, \u201chas increased the number of people who like to throw away their money on things they don\u2019t understand\u201d, said Gruca. \u201cPeople think, \u2018I picked the Raiders-Jets game, therefore, I can pick a president.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He also pointed to opinion polling errors at previous elections, and how many polls this time around suggest the contest is extremely tight. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at the polls in the last 15 minutes, so I don\u2019t know who\u2019s winning. In previous years there was a lot of clarity.\u201d</p> <p>In the magazines and newspapers section of Apple\u2019s iPhone store, Polymarket has <a href=\"https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6648798962?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings\">reigned supreme</a> in the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/magazines-newspapers-apps/6021?chart=top-free\">top spot</a>, leaving the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and, yes, the Guardian, in its wake. Another platform, Kalshi, has likewise <a href=\"https://app.sensortower.com/overview/1632713844?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings\">surged up</a> the store\u2019s chart of financial apps.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that these markets have been becoming more popular as trust in the media has been declining,\u201d said Harry Crane, a professor of statistics at Rutgers University. \u201cThe public wants information and is looking for sources of information it can trust.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Should you have turned to, say, Polymarket, on Wednesday and bet on Trump, you would receive $1 for every 67 cents you wagered if he wins the election. If you bet on Harris, on the same platform, on the same day, you would receive $1 for every 33 cents wagered if she wins.</p> <p>These bets are bids on political futures contracts.

      "bodyText": "Most gamblers might want to sit out the US election. It\u2019s too close to call with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck, according to official polls. But the former president\u2019s campaign has latched on to signs he says prove he\u2019s actually \u201cleading\u201d. In a close race, Trump and his allies claim some \u201cgambling polls\u201d, as he described them last week, put him significantly ahead of Harris. \u201cLike, 65 to 35, or something like that.\u201d The irony of touting an apparent lead in betting markets at a Believers and Ballots campaign event in Georgia aimed at Christian voters was not lost on Trump. \u201cBut nobody here gambles,\u201d he continued. \u201cDoes anybody here gamble? No, no, no, no. Great Christians don\u2019t gamble, do they? Oh no.\u201d The \u201cgambling polls\u201d Trump cited are forecasts generated by several election betting platforms, which put his chances of regaining the White House markedly ahead of his Democratic rival\u2019s. With many questioning the accuracy of political polling, supporters including Elon Musk, have started to claim such estimates are more accurate. As of Wednesday, Polymarket, one leading service, put Trump\u2019s chances of winning back the presidency at about 67%, with Harris at 33%. Another, Kalshi, put Trump at 62% and Harris at 38%. And while Trump\u2019s audience last Tuesday was not interested in gambling on the result of the presidential election, many others appear to be getting involved. High-profile legal battles, promotion by the likes of Musk and Trump, and growing media coverage, have helped propel the activity into the spotlight as the campaign gathered steam. Interest around betting on this election is \u201corders of magnitude larger\u201d than previous ballots, according to Thomas Gruca, a professor of marketing at the University of Iowa, and director of Iowa Electronic Markets, an election-focused futures market first established in 1988. America\u2019s gambling boom, led by the legalization of sports betting, \u201chas increased the number of people who like to throw away their money on things they don\u2019t understand\u201d, said Gruca. \u201cPeople think, \u2018I picked the Raiders-Jets game, therefore, I can pick a president.\u2019\u201d He also pointed to opinion polling errors at previous elections, and how many polls this time around suggest the contest is extremely tight. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at the polls in the last 15 minutes, so I don\u2019t know who\u2019s winning. In previous years there was a lot of clarity.\u201d In the magazines and newspapers section of Apple\u2019s iPhone store, Polymarket has reigned supreme in the top spot, leaving the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and, yes, the Guardian, in its wake. Another platform, Kalshi, has likewise surged up the store\u2019s chart of financial apps. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that these markets have been becoming more popular as trust in the media has been declining,\u201d said Harry Crane, a professor of statistics at Rutgers University. \u201cThe public wants information and is looking for sources of information it can trust.\u201d Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Should you have turned to, say, Polymarket, on Wednesday and bet on Trump, you would receive $1 for every 67 cents you wagered if he wins the election. If you bet on Harris, on the same platform, on the same day, you would receive $1 for every 33 cents wagered if she wins. These bets are bids on political futures contracts. Buying a contract drives its price \u2013 or the perceived probability of it happening \u2013 higher. This ecosystem spans far beyond the race for the White House. Other markets on Kalshi include the margin of victory in the Senate, which state will have the closest presidential election result and what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates two days after the election. But how reliable are the headline figures? \u201cI think you should take them seriously,\u201d said Grant Ferguson, political scientist at Texas Christian University. \u201cThe people who bet on these markets largely think they know more than the average person as to how things are going.\u201d Leading platforms put Hillary Clinton ahead on election day in 2016 (she did win the popular vote if not the presidency), and Joe Biden in the lead in 2020, \u201cbut by less than the polling, in both cases\u201d, said Ferguson. 2024 will be the biggest test of these predictions so far. \u201cBroadly these markets are actually quite efficient \u2013 particularly they\u2019re quite good at things that are 50:50, 60:40,\u201d said Eric Zitzewitz, professor of economics at Dartmouth College. \u201cIn the sort of circumstance we\u2019re in right now ... I take that pretty seriously.\u201d Provided a market is run \u201cefficiently, or with good rules, the prices before the event happens will reflect what the smart people think, and not just random people\u201d, suggested Gruca.

Polymarket is also scrutinizing activity on its platform to ensure users are outside the US, amid reports of domestic usage. \u201cThe markets are only as smart as the people trading in them,\u201d said Gruca. \u201cIf you are dumb as a rock and have a lot of money, you can move the markets in whatever direction you want by simply moving money.\u201d",

In a rare intervention, the Washington-based IMF backed her increase in investment and extra spending to ease the financial pressure on public services and boost growth. A spokesperson for the fund said new budget rules showed the government was committed to bringing down the UK\u2019s debts over the longer term. \u201cWe support the envisaged reduction in the deficit over the medium term, including by sustainably raising revenue,\u201d they said, adding that the IMF approved of the government\u2019s \u201cfocus on boosting growth through a needed increase in public investment while addressing urgent pressures on public services\u201d. Meanwhile, a leading UK thinktank has warned that despite Reeves\u2019s push to invest, the budget would not end Britain\u2019s record as \u201cstagnation nation\u201d. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s assessment of Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years said the chancellor had made a \u201cdecisive shift from the planned cuts set out by the last government, with better-funded public services and greater public investment coming from higher taxes and more borrowing\u201d. It said the rise in public investment, reversing planned cuts set out by the previous Tory administration, meant spending on public infrastructure would be maintained at about 2.6% of annual national income in each of the next five years. \u201cThis would be the highest five-year average in the UK since 1980-81, and bring the country close to the OECD average,\u201d the thinktank said. However, it warned that Labour\u2019s spending spree to inject \u00a370bn a year into the economy from increases in day-to-day and investment spending had \u201cnot yet delivered a decisive shift away from Britain\u2019s record as a stagnation nation\u201d. The foundation\u2019s verdict came after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s independent forecaster, concluded that while the budget would probably improve public services and give public investment a boost, it would do little to lift economic growth over the next five years. In a blow to Reeves, who had claimed before the budget that her measures would give the economy a boost, the OBR said a hefty rise in business taxes would limit the economy\u2019s expansion to 1.5% in the final year of the parliament, down from 2% next year. Reeves said in her speech to parliament that the OBR had agreed that her plans would improve the UK\u2019s growth prospects by 1.5% over the longer term. The Resolution Foundation said a generous outcome for the NHS in the budget left many other Whitehall departments making difficult decisions over the next five years. The health service will receive 40% of the \u00a335bn increase to day-to-day public service spending between 2023-24 and 2025-26. As a result, the 2025-26 health budget would account for 42% of all departmental spending, up from 31% in 2007-08, it said. Between 2025-26 and 2029-30 spending will increase by 1.3% on average across all Whitehall departments.

Tax and benefit changes outlined in the budget would \u201cfall on everyone\u2019s shoulders\u201d once the combined impact of welfare cuts, an increase in employer national insurance rises and tax rises on consumer goods are felt evenly across the income distribution. \u201cThe poorest half of households face a 0.8% reduction in their annual income on average, while the richest half face a 0.6% decrease,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, increases to capital gains and inheritance taxes (not included in the modelling of day-to-day tax and benefits) are more progressive, so wealthy households will face the largest cash impact overall.\u201d Mike Brewer, the thinktank\u2019s interim chief executive, said: \u201cRachel Reeves\u2019s first ever budget was never going to be a crowd-pleaser, given the profound and often conflicting challenges she faced, from failing public services to perilous public finances, weak growth and stagnating living standards. \u201cWith Britain finally turning the page on its longstanding failure to invest thanks to a \u00a3100bn boost to public capital spending, the hope is that this short-term pain will eventually turn into a long-term living standards gain.

      "body": "<p>For most bands, the main perk of living in a slightly rundown mansion-cum-artistic community on the city\u2019s edge would be having licence to make an enormous racket. For <a href=\"https://exeasterislandhead.bandcamp.com/\">Ex-Easter Island Head</a>, says Benjamin Fair, it\u2019s that \u201cwe get to play quietly\u201d.</p> <p>The four members of the Liverpool minimalists are sitting in Benjamin Duvall\u2019s slate-grey bedroom/rehearsal space around the edge of their circular setup: guitars laid flat on keyboard stands, often with sticks wedged under the fretboard strings ready to create a giant reverberant twang, and mallets for hitting them on the floor; a drum kit deconstructed between the stations; haptic motors extracted from mobile phones primed to dance across the surface of the strings and cymbals. The band\u2019s old amps are stacked in a corner behind Andrew Hunt, who joined in 2019 and suggested jettisoning them. \u201cIt eliminates any hum so you\u2019re just hearing the strings,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When they perform, the first 10 minutes of their set shiver into being from near-total silence. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to start quiet and get loud than blow people away and then try and get them to come with you into this quiet space,\u201d says Hunt. For that opening spell, says Duvall, \u201cwe\u2019re more listening than we are playing\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2009, this sensitive approach has steadily marked out Ex-Easter Island Head (EEIH) among the UK\u2019s finest experimental acts. Their intricate sound and percussive approach to stringed instruments is hypnotic, eerily mechanical and shimmering, leading to performances alongside the likes of William Basinski, Colin Stetson and Rhys Chatham. The titles of their first five albums made their processes plain: Mallet Guitars One\u2013Three; Large Electric Ensemble; Twenty-Two Strings. Their latest album follows suit, although its namesake is more mercurial. Norther is named after the strong wind that blows down the Wirral, which also became an instrument on the record. Duvall is a fiend for aeolian harps \u2013 literal wind instruments \u2013 and for Norther, they installed one on the roof of Bidston Observatory in Birkenhead, an artistic research centre and one of the highest points in the area, recording the sounds that blew through with a contact mic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIx0QWwuG8o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rIx0QWwuG8o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Ex-Easter Island Head: Norther \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Duvall goes behind the partition to fetch the DIY harp \u2013 a tall, wooden telegraph-style pole with two small silver mixing bowls (the resonators), each suspended on three lengths of fishing line (the harp strings). Up at the observatory, the rocks have also been shaped by the wind, creating a \u201cbarren and mysterious\u201d landscape, says Duvall. \u201cThe harp also has that mysterious thing because there\u2019s no attack, no pluck, it just glides.\u201d On the album, it floats over the band\u2019s glistening microtonalities and rhythmic intricacies, creating a tingling, melancholy rush of a journey. Where their earlier records were pure documents of their live setup, this time they allowed themselves to act like \u201csculptors\u201d, says Fair, not bound by what they could reproduce live.</p> <p>This week in late October, Duvall is fresh from lecturing on aeolian instruments at Liverpool University. The fascination, he says, is that \u201cit\u2019s almost like hidden music \u2013 this is something we\u2019ve been thinking about over the years. We\u2019re coaching these tonalities and sounds out of instruments that are kind of otherworldly. Also, you\u2019re opening yourself up to collaboration with something you don\u2019t have full \u2013 or indeed any \u2013 control over.\u201d The haptic motors are the same: quick to credit their friend Vitalija Glovackyte of Hyperdawn for giving them the idea, they let me run one over a cymbal, and the motor jumps around with skittish charm, producing a sound like metallic rainfall.</p> <p>In another part of the album, the band sample their voices on phones then play the recordings through their guitar strings, which they replicate live. Each member enthusiastically picks apart their process and its significance. They\u2019re fascinated by the intersection between old and new technology, and with taking unconventional approaches to their hardware. They kindly nod at my theory that their ethos might be one of harmony: the use of the wind suggesting a cooperation between man and weather; the old and new tech a similar one in the age of AI threatening creativity. \u201cAeolian instruments offer an interesting way of engaging with the climate crisis,\u201d says Duvall. \u201cThey\u2019re almost like antennae receiving weather data and reproducing it as sound.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cTo some extent what we do is based on a kind of ecological idea of arrangement, placing sounds in relation to each other where they can affect each other,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cAnd any time you\u2019re doing something different with an instrument, you\u2019re kind of saying: things can be done differently, you can change things structurally and have a significant impact.\u201d</p> <p>Some experimental music can be fiercely dry live, but EEIH are conscious of being proper performers, laying bare the connection between gesture and sounds that many listeners assume must be electronic (though the wind is played on a sampler). Their shows have caused listeners to break out in giggles, as when they sing into their phones. They\u2019re not quite the Blue Man Group; perhaps more like the best science lesson you never had. \u201cWe always joke among ourselves afterwards: how dare they laugh!\u201d says Jon Hering. \u201cGetting a chuckle from the audience is not something every band would get.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn their early day, EEIH played serious serial minimalism with no wave leanings, but made it swing like rock\u2019n\u2019roll and look like a dignified laboratory experiment,\u201d says Stewart Lee, a fan. \u201cIt was as beautiful to look at as it was to listen to, like some kind of dance piece for clockwork mannequins scored by executive desk toys. It was art, but your ass could follow it. If I had to convince some suspicious parent squares from the school gate that Wire magazine art-wank could move them and make them move I would take them to EEIH, but luckily none of them speak to me.\u201d</p> <p>Some fans are drawn to the mechanical side of things and want to inspect their gear afterwards, they say, while others are drawn to the emotion. The latter is a word that comes up a lot as we talk, a new frontier for a band conscious that they\u2019ve been described as \u201cboffiny\u201d. When they formed in 2009, says Duvall, they were obsessed with a \u201cminimalist mindset \u2013 holding a sound for a really long time, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/mar/25/contemporary-music-guide-la-monte-young\">La Monte Young</a> or Steve Reich\u2019s Two Pianos, process music. We\u2019ve always looked at the music as having emotional heft, but it\u2019s an emotion that\u2019s quite slippery and shimmery. Some people get joyousness or melancholy from it.\u201d By the time they made the self-evidently beautiful Norther they felt assured that the processes were integral enough that they could \u201cgo to town on the emotion\u201d, says Hering.</p> <p>\u201cIt also makes us a little bit less hermetically sealed,\u201d says Duvall. \u201cIt invites a little bit more of the world in and that was something that was worth exploring at this point.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuQeu2QUReU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZuQeu2QUReU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Ex-Easter Island Head performing at Church of Sound, London \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Norther arrives eight years since their last record. At the risk of being impolite, EEIH seem unburdened by any pressure to reach vast audiences or clock up ever-greater successes. Part of that is the \u201ccold, hard reality of day jobs\u201d, says Duvall, a receptionist at Liverpool University who is branching out into lecturing; Hering teaches music to children with disabilities, often as part of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra; Fair works at the local arena; Hunt is the only full-time musician, with various projects (including releasing as Dialect on RVNG Intl, whose T-shirt he\u2019s wearing today). But it\u2019s also the result of using limited means, says Duvall. \u201cWhen you\u2019re working with a reduced palette, you want to make sure everything you\u2019re saying with it is proper, you know?\u201d Each new album necessitates a new setup, meaning the band is essentially learning a new language each time around \u2013 and they have no fixed roles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/22/composer-oliver-coates-on-the-cello-chaos-and-connection-the-best-music-is-out-there-in-nature\">Composer Oliver Coates on the cello, chaos and connection: \u2018The best music is out there in nature\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing that keeps EEIH going during the lapses between releases is their work in education. They\u2019ve led three massive school projects in recent years, including teaching pupils about aeolian instruments. It\u2019s an education for them too, interacting with young people who haven\u2019t yet formed fixed ideas about music, and being called on to explain their own approach. \u201cKids won\u2019t be afraid to be like: \u2018So you\u2019re not on the telly?\u2019\u201d says Duvall. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t make any money? No one\u2019s making you doing this? <em>Why</em> are you doing it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat in itself is valuable for kids,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cWhy do you do this weird thing? Oh, you just like doing it and sometimes you get paid? That\u2019s a mind-blowing concept for some kids.\u201d</p> <p>Hering talks about the neglected concept of the \u201ccommunity musician\u201d \u2013 how as with food, music is \u201ca fabric of life that weaves through many different things. It can be within your schooling, your work, your social life, your community or city, in the streets. It\u2019s really important for musicians too \u2013 not just \u2018I get up on stage and do my thing and people clap\u2019, but using my skills I\u2019ve honed in all these different contexts and find what it can bring. I think that makes you a much more well-rounded musician and person.\u201d</p> <p>The band\u2019s structure reflects this idea of the cooperative, as well as the rich potential of deep listening. \u201cWe\u2019ve got these very spread-out parts that interlock to make something as a whole,\u201d says Fair. \u201cI get a sense of what I\u2019m doing and how that forms part of something I can\u2019t do by myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something doubling the bit of the rhythm you\u2019re doing,\u201d says Duvall. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re playing and you hear the other person\u2019s sound, you lose ownership of your own.

Experts believe North Korea possesses short-range nuclear missiles that can strike South Korea, but are sceptical of Pyongyang\u2019s claims that it is able to strike more distant targets using missiles tipped with miniaturised nuclear warheads. Thursday\u2019s launch came less than a week before American voters go to the polls to elect a new president. North Korea has used missile launches and other provocations to draw attention to itself in the run-up to elections and anniversaries in the US. Kim Jong-un has also been encouraged to step up his weapons programme by the war in Ukraine. About 10,000 North Korean troops are thought to have been sent to Russia in preparation for possible deployment in Ukraine. On Wednesday, South Korea said more than 3,000 had been moved close to battlefields in western Russia. Pyongyang is already supplying Russian forces with ammunition and missiles as part of a mutual defence pact agreed this summer between Kim and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. This week defence chiefs in the US and South Korea urged North Korea to withdraw its troops from Russia, while the US\u2019s envoy to the UN, Robert Wood, warned that North Korean soldiers entering Ukraine would \u201csurely return in body bags\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Living in a remote, mountainous region of Tennessee during her teenage years, Alicia remembers feeling lonely. \u201cMy parents were missionaries and we moved around a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cI come from a conservative Christian background and didn\u2019t go to school, so my upbringing was very different from that of other kids my age.\u201d By 1997, she had started \u201ctrawling the internet for friends\u201d and connecting with people across the world. \u201cThere was a website called Key Pals that was like an online connection platform. It gave you basic details and email addresses of other people who had registered.\u201d</p> <p>She sent emails to lots of kids her age, including Tola, a young girl living in London. \u201cMy parents were software engineers and quite progressive about encouraging us to use the internet,\u201d says Tola. \u201cI was regularly using chatrooms.\u201d She responded to Alicia quickly, telling her about a holiday she was taking to the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park in Atlanta. \u201cI thought it was close to where she was living, but in reality it was miles away,\u201d she says. </p> <p>They bonded quickly over their love of reading, and Tola sent her a handwritten letter. \u201cWe\u2019d talked about the difference between American and British sweets, so she sent me some chewing gum,\u201d says Alicia. They emailed consistently over the next few years, before losing touch when Tola went to university.</p> <p>Alicia went on to live in Honduras with her family before training as a nurse and moving to Atlanta. Tola stayed in London and got married, building a career in journalism, PR and modelling. In 2010, they reconnected on Facebook, after Alicia found her profile online. \u201cTola\u2019s profile picture was of her in a wedding dress with long braids. I thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s all grown up\u2019\u201d, she says. \u201cI was in awe of her modelling pictures. She was so leggy and sophisticated.\u201d</p>    <p>Tola was delighted to catch up again, despite going through a negative patch in her life. \u201cI\u2019d lost a baby and got divorced. I was going through a period of drinking and partying.\u201d She shared what was going on with Alicia, who was incredibly supportive. \u201cShe really listened to me and was non-judgmental.\u201d</p> <p>They stayed in touch online over the next few years. Alicia moved to Los Angeles and started a family, while Tola took a sabbatical to work at a ski resort. In 2016, Tola went to the Coachella festival in California with friends, and the pair decided to meet in person for the first time. \u201cWe had only seen pictures of each other and never even had a video call,\u201d says Tola. \u201cI was so nervous, it felt like a first date.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia admits she was equally nervous, but as soon as they began chatting, the conservation flowed naturally. \u201cWe had such a fantastic time,\u201d she says. After that they stayed in touch on WhatsApp, sharing every aspect of each other\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u201cI knew I wanted to visit her family,\u201d says Tola. \u201cI\u2019d found it too hard to be around people who have kids when I first lost the baby, but I\u2019d always loved children. Alicia has two daughters and I really wanted to spend time with them.\u201d Although Alicia\u2019s husband was \u201ca bit unsure\u201d at first, they planned for Tola to visit them for a week in LA in 2018. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure because we\u2019d only met in person once, but he ended up getting on really well with her,\u201d says Alicia. \u201cOne day I went out with Tola and we spoke for hours about religion. She is Christian and I\u2019m now agnostic after a conservative upbringing. But it didn\u2019t matter that we had different perspectives on it.\u201d</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"38167a85-c3be-4127-b1ca-b6c56d15c043\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p>A year later, Alicia moved to North Carolina for a nursing job at a university. Tola continued modelling, wrote a book, and began working for a Christian media brand as a creative director. In 2021, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. \u201cI\u2019d moved from London to Cheltenham by then, but was going back and forth for treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia says it was a challenging time. \u201cI\u2019d only met her in person twice, but I was trying to figure out if I could fly there. I felt very helpless.\u201d Thankfully, Tola made a good recovery and, now that she is in remission, the pair are hoping to meet up again.</p> <p>Alicia says that although their lives have been completely different, they have \u201calways fascinated each other\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a very organic and comfortable camaraderie that we have. Our friendship is really open and receptive, we listen to each other and always want to know what is going on in each other\u2019s lives.\u201d</p> <p>Tola describes her friend as steadfast. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of friends that come and go, but she feels like a constant,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing will shock Al \u2013 she\u2019s hard to impress and she\u2019s hard to offend. I love how open she has been to receiving me and all my craziness in her life.\u201d</p>",

Alicia moved to Los Angeles and started a family, while Tola took a sabbatical to work at a ski resort. In 2016, Tola went to the Coachella festival in California with friends, and the pair decided to meet in person for the first time. \u201cWe had only seen pictures of each other and never even had a video call,\u201d says Tola. \u201cI was so nervous, it felt like a first date.\u201d Alicia admits she was equally nervous, but as soon as they began chatting, the conservation flowed naturally. \u201cWe had such a fantastic time,\u201d she says. After that they stayed in touch on WhatsApp, sharing every aspect of each other\u2019s lives. \u201cI knew I wanted to visit her family,\u201d says Tola. \u201cI\u2019d found it too hard to be around people who have kids when I first lost the baby, but I\u2019d always loved children. Alicia has two daughters and I really wanted to spend time with them.\u201d Although Alicia\u2019s husband was \u201ca bit unsure\u201d at first, they planned for Tola to visit them for a week in LA in 2018. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure because we\u2019d only met in person once, but he ended up getting on really well with her,\u201d says Alicia. \u201cOne day I went out with Tola and we spoke for hours about religion. She is Christian and I\u2019m now agnostic after a conservative upbringing. But it didn\u2019t matter that we had different perspectives on it.\u201d A year later, Alicia moved to North Carolina for a nursing job at a university. Tola continued modelling, wrote a book, and began working for a Christian media brand as a creative director. In 2021, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. \u201cI\u2019d moved from London to Cheltenham by then, but was going back and forth for treatment.\u201d Alicia says it was a challenging time. \u201cI\u2019d only met her in person twice, but I was trying to figure out if I could fly there. I felt very helpless.\u201d Thankfully, Tola made a good recovery and, now that she is in remission, the pair are hoping to meet up again. Alicia says that although their lives have been completely different, they have \u201calways fascinated each other\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a very organic and comfortable camaraderie that we have. Our friendship is really open and receptive, we listen to each other and always want to know what is going on in each other\u2019s lives.\u201d Tola describes her friend as steadfast. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of friends that come and go, but she feels like a constant,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing will shock Al \u2013 she\u2019s hard to impress and she\u2019s hard to offend. I love how open she has been to receiving me and all my craziness in her life.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You might laugh off Halloween as little more than kids dressed as ghouls demanding sweets and leaving sticky fingerprints on doorbells. But we\u2019re all susceptible to the spine-tingling embrace of the supernatural, at least when it comes for us in the seductive guise of the gothic. We never seem to weary of it. Indeed, as a major exhibition, Gothic Modern, opens in Helsinki before visiting other European capitals, it may be time we recognised this idiom for what it is: the style that won\u2019t die.</p>    <p>Gothic began as the architectural pattern-book that furnished the great medieval cathedrals and churches of Europe, all flying buttresses and pointed arches. But it fell out of favour after the Reformation, when it was seen as an idolatrous efflorescence of popery. Henry VIII ransacked the churches and monasteries and these \u201cbare ruined choirs\u201d, as Shakespeare called them, became the setting for tales of sex and death and the occult, by the Bard himself and other hands.</p> <p>By the time gothic was ripe for reappraisal by the Romantics, many of its most historic sites were wrecks \u2013 and nothing could have pleased the likes of Wordsworth, Coleridge and Turner more. The old marbles seemed to be repositories of the sublime, a numinous quality capable of arousing strong feelings in the beholder. They were a refuge from the clamour of the dawning industrial age. The first gothic novel was Horace Walpole\u2019s The Castle of Otranto published in 1764. Bram Stoker wrote Dracula, Mary Shelley breathed life into Frankenstein\u2019s monster, and these and other gothic abominations have stalked popular culture ever since, trailing blood and neck-bolts, surviving pitchforks and stakes through the heart, endlessly reinvented for thrills, for laughs, for musicals and cartoons and fridge magnets.</p> <p>A century or so after the Romantic writers and painters rediscovered gothic, so did a group we think of as pioneers of modern art: Van Gogh, Munch, the Finnish artist Helene Schjerfbeck and others. At least that\u2019s according to the curators of Gothic Modern. Like sextons in a cluttered boneyard, they hope to break new ground with the show, which is at the Ateneum in Helsinki, part of the Finnish National Gallery.</p> <p>Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff, co-curator of the exhibition, says: \u201cWe\u2019re showing that early modern artists weren\u2019t just looking forward to abstraction and to Picasso and Matisse and so on, but they were also looking back, to the gothic art of the northern Renaissance, to painters such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Holbein.\u201d</p>    <p>For the artists of 100 years ago, the advent of the machine age brought social upheaval, growing nationalism and the outbreak of world war, and they turned to the gothic to express their unease. This emerged in extraordinary visions of sexuality, death and trauma. More than 200 artworks at the Ateneum range from paintings, drawings and prints to sculpture and furniture. Key exhibits include Munch\u2019s The Sun<em> </em>(1910-13) and Arnold B\u00f6cklin\u2019s Self-Portrait With Death Playing the Fiddle (1872).</p> <p>One of the best-known works in the show is a painting that Van Gogh made as a student: it\u2019s a head-and-bony-shoulders of a skeleton, with a smouldering cigarette clamped between its teeth. Its mordant swagger feels very contemporary: it could have been made last week, perhaps by Banksy or Damien Hirst. It\u2019s an exceptional loan from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where it\u2019s the most popular artwork among young visitors. Art history has tended to treat Skull of a Skeleton With Burning Cigarette (1885-6) as a juvenile joke, says Von Bonsdorff. \u201cBut this clearly recalls the Danse Macabre, a subject explored by D\u00fcrer and Holbein. We know from Van Gogh\u2019s letters to his brother Theo that he was looking at Holbein and thinking about him at the time he painted the smoking skull.\u201d</p>    <p>The exhibition suggests that people\u2019s preoccupations are pretty similar wherever you go and throughout time \u2013 we all have an appointment with the ultimate gothic scene-stealer, death, after all \u2013 but there are winsome local variations. The Finnish painter Hugo Simberg depicts skeletons contentedly absorbed in tending pot plants in The Garden of Death (1896): an allotment out of a Tim Burton storyboard. And according to Nordic folklore, the bearer of bad tidings to a stricken hearth isn\u2019t the Grim Reaper but an old woman. Several artists in the exhibition depict this black widow plodding through the snow to make her unwelcome house calls.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t all doom and gloom, though of course people are paying good money to see precisely that. The exhibition is organised into themes including \u201cerotic devotions\u201d, nature and the uncanny, and the \u201cdance of death\u201d. Munch contributes several sickly, colour-saturated sex-scapes. Death in the form of sexually transmitted disease, which was often fatal in his day, is an unseen presence in these trysts, joining Munch\u2019s lovers in morbid threesomes. With the sepulchral and the sensual laid out in this inviting smorgasbord \u2013 or <em>voileipapoyta</em>, as a cold spread is called in Finland \u2013 the Ateneum hopes its show will appeal to young audiences.</p> <p>Fiona Sampson, author of In Search of Mary Shelley, says the gothic resonates with young people because of its qualities of overstatement and hyperbole. \u201cIt feels enough for the intensity of emotion we have at that stage of life, before \u2013 perhaps \u2013 it\u2019s knocked out of us. Gothic is also subversive. It looks backwards, sideways, forwards: anywhere but <em>here. </em>It articulates the way life can feel scary and uncanny. Millennial anxiety is the sense that the world, or the world as we know it, is going to end. With the climate crisis, pandemic and wars, there\u2019s plenty to make young people today feel their world is indeed ending.\u201d</p>    <p>Manchester-based academic Xavier Aldana Reyes consumes gothic material with the avidity of a deathwatch beetle. He\u2019s co-president of the International Gothic Association, a group of scholars researching this aspect of popular culture, and he has contributed to the Death Studies Podcast. He says the gothic is often seen as outsider art. \u201cIt\u2019s now typically associated with feminist, queer and anti-racist messages, especially in its contemporary iterations. Because it speaks the language of fear, it provides a good platform through which to explore the violence of marginalisation and inequality: it\u2019s become almost a truism that communities who have experienced social injustices can sympathise with the plight of the monster\u201d.</p> <p>Aldana Reyes\u2019s hitlist of current gothic attractions includes the novels of Laura Purcell and Sarah Perry\u2019s Melmoth. \u201cOften books will hark back to foundational texts like Frankenstein, Melmoth the Wanderer, Dracula and Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIn film, we might include the recent sequel, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and the Demi Moore film The Substance, which to some extent rethinks The Picture of Dorian Gray and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde<em> </em>through body horror.\u201d</p> <p>Even the new biopic about Donald Trump, The Apprentice, has been seen by some reviewers as yet another remake of the Frankenstein story, with Roy Cohn, Trump\u2019s mentor, as the dark genius who applied the jump leads and jolted his monster into life.</p> <p>Gothic is everywhere, instantly recognisable and yet uncanny, as befits any view of human experience that deals with the great unknowable, death.

      "bodyText": "The budget is likely to mean smaller pay rises for workers because of the impact on businesses, Rachel Reeves has conceded. The chancellor said she recognised \u201cthere will be consequences\u201d to her first budget, which includes \u00a340bn in tax rises, more than half of which come from increasing tax on businesses. At the heart of the budget is an increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions (NICs) projected to raise \u00a325bn by the end of this parliament. Companies said the measures would make it more expensive for them to hire people and give pay rises, and therefore risked affecting economic growth. \u201cI recognise there will be consequences,\u201d Reeves told BBC Breakfast. \u201cIt will mean that businesses will have to absorb some of this through profit and it is likely to mean that wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been.\u201d The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides independent fiscal oversight, said it assumed companies would \u201cpass on most but not all of their higher tax costs to employees\u201d. In 2025-26, according to its estimates, 60% of these costs will be passed on to workers and consumers via lower wages and higher prices. But the International Monetary Fund endorsed the investment and spending on public services in the budget, as well as sustainable tax rises. In an unusual move, the Washington-based watchdog said: \u201cWe support the envisaged reduction in the deficit over the medium term, including by sustainably raising revenue.\u201d Reeves said the decision to raise businesses\u2019 NICs was \u201ca difficult one\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve tried to protect the smallest businesses from its impact, but the alternative would have been pretending that the pressures on the public finances didn\u2019t exist.\u201d She added: \u201cI had to make difficult decisions about how to raise the money that is needed.

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of US voters from across the country shared with the Guardian how they are coping with the stress of the looming election, and which issues and possible outcomes make them the most anxious or concerned.</p> <p>Here are six of them.</p> <h2>\u2018I worry about a further erosion of women\u2019s rights\u2019</h2> <p>As a gynecologist in Georgia, I worry about a further erosion of women\u2019s rights. Pregnancy is already dangerous here. Once Roe was overturned, the six-week ban went into effect and we quickly saw we couldn\u2019t provide medically appropriate care to our patients.</p> <p>It also created a lot of fear and confusion amongst healthcare providers who didn\u2019t want to put their license or livelihood on the line. The confusion was the purpose of the law, causing delays in care and \u201cpreventing\u201d abortion. Unfortunately all it did was mean that patients had to be very sick before a doctor would intervene. We are seeing women bear the consequences \u2013 getting very sick, unable to get pregnant again, losing babies, and in some cases, dying.</p> <p>As a queer family with children, our marriage, rights, privacy and ability to make healthcare decisions [may] be impacted. We can\u2019t watch TV as is, with all the hateful anti-trans ads. It\u2019s hard to sleep. <strong>B, an obstetrician gyn</strong><strong>ecologist, from Georgia</strong></p> <h2>\u2018We need a strong leadership to handle international problems, whoever wins the election\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m worried that other countries don\u2019t realize what motivates Americans to vote for Trump. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the best president we\u2019ve ever had, he\u2019s kind of like a New York playboy. But I think he had a good successful term, despite being an amateur politician, rather than a career one.</p> <p>The continuous character assassination of him when he first ran was a slick orchestration. Every newspaper was immediately against him, it was like somebody had pressed a button, like a set-up or something. This motivated me to vote for him, to oppose the organised media and political establishment.</p> <p>People in Europe seem to think we\u2019re simple-minded for voting for him, but we\u2019re not. We all just felt \u2013 \u2018Let\u2019s try him for a while.\u2019 We\u2019re all so tired of liberals from California running the country. They created a machine of sorts, and Trump startled that machine.</p> <p>I hope Trump gets his second term now, and I\u2019m very much impressed by his running mate. But I\u2019m concerned about the ability of both Trump and Harris to handle the many international problems we have now, such as threats from Russia. The dollar is losing security. In the Middle East, anything could happen. It\u2019s important that we have a good leadership who can sort this all out, whoever wins. <strong>Rob, a retired computer programmer, from Maine</strong></p> <h2>\u2018American democracy will survive another excruciating Trump term\u2019</h2> <p>Calling the re-election of Trump the end of democracy is dramatic. Calling his return to power the end of democracy as we know it, is apt.</p> <p>I believe America\u2019s democracy, flawed and vulnerable as it may be, is resilient enough to withstand another Trump term. I think it\u2019s politically expedient to proclaim that a second Trump term would drive us directly into purely despotic rule.</p> <p>The day-to-day of watching [Trump] run the country that I love would be excruciating, again, but I think what really is nightmare fuel is [the prospect of a] Vance presidency, which feels likely and could [entail] a dismantling of nearly all social goods left in the US.</p> <p>Under either man, US support for beleaguered or aspiring democracies could crater; alliances with Nato and other democratically aligned organizations could be severed or allowed to atrophy. But perhaps most dishearteningly, the election of a Maga Republican would signal that the leader of the free world would now be supplanted by a leader of the strongman world.</p> <p>What makes it worse is the countervailing hope of a Democratic term or two, where the country would finally have room to heal. They actually give me hope, and I would grieve the loss of hope.</p> <p>I\u2019m not drinking at the moment, on purpose. Quit weed, too. I feel this is too serious to drown it out. <strong>Nile Curtis, 48, a massage therapist, from Hawaii</strong></p> <h2>\u2018America is now unable to discuss different viewpoints\u2019</h2> <p>Our greatest concern about the election, aside from the outcome, is the potential eruption of violence. The inflammatory rhetoric, the noxious stereotypes and the intractable position of Trump\u2019s supporters who might or might not like him, but will vote for him anyway, is proof that the US is currently incapable of conducting any sort of discourse. Regardless of who wins, the threat of impending doom feels very real.</p> <p>We are older parents of a disabled adult. While the economy is a pressing issue for everyone, social security seems to be in danger. As people who are closer in age to retirement, and caring for a disabled adult, we are unsure of the impact either candidate would have on our \u201cbigger picture\u201d, but we feel that Mr Trump\u2019s rhetoric brings an added layer of threatening behavior from people on both sides, who have become increasingly defensive and unwilling to accept and discuss different viewpoints.</p> <p>How do we manage our anxieties around these issues? We keep to ourselves. We do not engage in political or ideological discussions with anyone and limit our time watching and reading the news. The constant barrage of reporting, which has become pseudo-journalistic in pursuit of increasing [audience] numbers, appears to be geared to stoke the anxiety. The 24/7 news cycle has injected a stream of fear into everyone. <strong>MG, a mother and grandmother, from North Carolina</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m tired of having to vote against a candidate instead of voting for one\u2019</h2> <p>I want to vote for a president who supports the causes that I\u2019m most concerned with: climate change, healthcare, cost of living, availability of housing. I will vote for Harris, but more as a vote against Trump.</p> <p>I think the Democratic party has shown that they\u2019re willing to invest in renewable energy, which is fantastic. But I\u2019m concerned with the promotion of record oil and gas numbers by the Democratic campaign this election cycle. That being said, I think the Republican party would be significantly worse.</p> <p>I believe that not enough housing is being constructed, period, and what is being built is only for those who can afford it.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of US voters from across the country shared with the Guardian how they are coping with the stress of the looming election, and which issues and possible outcomes make them the most anxious or concerned. Here are six of them. \u2018I worry about a further erosion of women\u2019s rights\u2019 As a gynecologist in Georgia, I worry about a further erosion of women\u2019s rights. Pregnancy is already dangerous here. Once Roe was overturned, the six-week ban went into effect and we quickly saw we couldn\u2019t provide medically appropriate care to our patients. It also created a lot of fear and confusion amongst healthcare providers who didn\u2019t want to put their license or livelihood on the line. The confusion was the purpose of the law, causing delays in care and \u201cpreventing\u201d abortion. Unfortunately all it did was mean that patients had to be very sick before a doctor would intervene. We are seeing women bear the consequences \u2013 getting very sick, unable to get pregnant again, losing babies, and in some cases, dying. As a queer family with children, our marriage, rights, privacy and ability to make healthcare decisions [may] be impacted. We can\u2019t watch TV as is, with all the hateful anti-trans ads. It\u2019s hard to sleep. B, an obstetrician gynecologist, from Georgia \u2018We need a strong leadership to handle international problems, whoever wins the election\u2019 I\u2019m worried that other countries don\u2019t realize what motivates Americans to vote for Trump. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the best president we\u2019ve ever had, he\u2019s kind of like a New York playboy. But I think he had a good successful term, despite being an amateur politician, rather than a career one. The continuous character assassination of him when he first ran was a slick orchestration. Every newspaper was immediately against him, it was like somebody had pressed a button, like a set-up or something. This motivated me to vote for him, to oppose the organised media and political establishment. People in Europe seem to think we\u2019re simple-minded for voting for him, but we\u2019re not. We all just felt \u2013 \u2018Let\u2019s try him for a while.\u2019 We\u2019re all so tired of liberals from California running the country. They created a machine of sorts, and Trump startled that machine. I hope Trump gets his second term now, and I\u2019m very much impressed by his running mate. But I\u2019m concerned about the ability of both Trump and Harris to handle the many international problems we have now, such as threats from Russia. The dollar is losing security. In the Middle East, anything could happen. It\u2019s important that we have a good leadership who can sort this all out, whoever wins. Rob, a retired computer programmer, from Maine \u2018American democracy will survive another excruciating Trump term\u2019 Calling the re-election of Trump the end of democracy is dramatic. Calling his return to power the end of democracy as we know it, is apt. I believe America\u2019s democracy, flawed and vulnerable as it may be, is resilient enough to withstand another Trump term. I think it\u2019s politically expedient to proclaim that a second Trump term would drive us directly into purely despotic rule. The day-to-day of watching [Trump] run the country that I love would be excruciating, again, but I think what really is nightmare fuel is [the prospect of a] Vance presidency, which feels likely and could [entail] a dismantling of nearly all social goods left in the US. Under either man, US support for beleaguered or aspiring democracies could crater; alliances with Nato and other democratically aligned organizations could be severed or allowed to atrophy. But perhaps most dishearteningly, the election of a Maga Republican would signal that the leader of the free world would now be supplanted by a leader of the strongman world. What makes it worse is the countervailing hope of a Democratic term or two, where the country would finally have room to heal. They actually give me hope, and I would grieve the loss of hope. I\u2019m not drinking at the moment, on purpose. Quit weed, too. I feel this is too serious to drown it out. Nile Curtis, 48, a massage therapist, from Hawaii \u2018America is now unable to discuss different viewpoints\u2019 Our greatest concern about the election, aside from the outcome, is the potential eruption of violence. The inflammatory rhetoric, the noxious stereotypes and the intractable position of Trump\u2019s supporters who might or might not like him, but will vote for him anyway, is proof that the US is currently incapable of conducting any sort of discourse. Regardless of who wins, the threat of impending doom feels very real. We are older parents of a disabled adult. While the economy is a pressing issue for everyone, social security seems to be in danger. As people who are closer in age to retirement, and caring for a disabled adult, we are unsure of the impact either candidate would have on our \u201cbigger picture\u201d, but we feel that Mr Trump\u2019s rhetoric brings an added layer of threatening behavior from people on both sides, who have become increasingly defensive and unwilling to accept and discuss different viewpoints. How do we manage our anxieties around these issues? We keep to ourselves. We do not engage in political or ideological discussions with anyone and limit our time watching and reading the news. The constant barrage of reporting, which has become pseudo-journalistic in pursuit of increasing [audience] numbers, appears to be geared to stoke the anxiety. The 24/7 news cycle has injected a stream of fear into everyone. MG, a mother and grandmother, from North Carolina \u2018I\u2019m tired of having to vote against a candidate instead of voting for one\u2019 I want to vote for a president who supports the causes that I\u2019m most concerned with: climate change, healthcare, cost of living, availability of housing. I will vote for Harris, but more as a vote against Trump. I think the Democratic party has shown that they\u2019re willing to invest in renewable energy, which is fantastic. But I\u2019m concerned with the promotion of record oil and gas numbers by the Democratic campaign this election cycle. That being said, I think the Republican party would be significantly worse. I believe that not enough housing is being constructed, period, and what is being built is only for those who can afford it. There\u2019s a lot of short-term Airbnb-type rentals in Portland that further reduce the housing stock, and I\u2019m concerned about ever being able to afford a house. I think for gen Z the biggest issues aren\u2019t being reflected by either campaign. The rapid spread of disinformation on divisive, extremist social media [is another one]. I have close friends and family who are queer and am increasingly concerned with the way anti-LGBT rhetoric has, I feel, exploded back into popularity. I\u2019m frustrated that the Harris campaign has made an effort to expand rightwards and not leftwards. This will be my second presidential election and I\u2019m tired of having to vote against a candidate instead of voting for one. Nate, 24, Ocean engineer, Portland, Maine \u2018I no longer trust Trump after January 6\u2019 My voting record is quite mixed.

Yet that hasn\u2019t stopped millennia of godly scholars and lay Christians acting as if he had. According to these finger-waggers, extrapolating from biblical apocrypha, exegesis and their own personal fantasies, women are either morally superior or corrupt whores. Likewise, same-sex love is at one moment the emotional glue that binds celibate monastic communities and at another a sin that requires participants to be stoned.</p> <p>In this masterly book, the ecclesiastical historian Diarmaid MacCulloch sets out to show that the source for Christianity\u2019s confused teachings on sex, sexuality and gender is its own untidy DNA. Woven lumpily from two distinct traditions, Greek and Judaic, each crafted in distinct ways for at least a century before Jesus\u2019s putative arrival on Earth, the Christian church remains an essentially heterogenous affair. MacCulloch conceives it as \u201ca family of identities\u201d, by which he means Roman Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox, as well as a myriad other sects and splinter groups, some of which have long disappeared. And, like all families, there has been tremendous potential for bickering and bad feeling. This is obvious enough when the subject for debate is, say, the&nbsp;precise nature of the Trinity. But introduce human genitalia as the topic under discussion, and the result is slammed doors and sullen silences.</p> <p>Even at this remove and working from texts that have been washed through several translations, you can still feel the tightly wound twist of anger and desire at work whenever an individual theologian marches into the classroom to offer sex ed. Take John Chrysostom, AKA Golden-Mouth, who was bishop of both Antioch and Constantinople in the fourth century and obsessed with sexual relations between men. A modern critic has worked out that Chrysostom wrote more about sex than any writer before Freud except an obscure 12th-century Benedictine called Peter Damian (this impulse to tot up the smutty references in old books seems in itself a tad obsessive). It was Chrysostom who came up with the rule that \u201cpassive homosexuals\u201d forfeited their right to be considered men and should therefore be stoned to death.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Saint Jerome, writing from Rome about the same time, specialised in getting hot under the&nbsp;clerical collar about female heterosexual desire. He explained to one widow that if she remarried it would be \u201clike a dog returning to its vomit\u201d and that having another baby would only mean more poo to clean up. All of which tells us more about Saint Jerome than the lived experience of the woman he was hectoring who, one can\u2019t help noticing, was called Furia.</p> <p>Other sexual debates have been less scatological but no less bodily. In the early years, there was a long and solemn conversation about which of Mary\u2019s orifices the Holy Spirit used to get her pregnant. A suggestion probably from the second century posited the eyes as the place where the spirit entered. An anonymous Egyptian authority suggested the nose, which sounds ticklish. The point of these theories was really to keep Mary\u2019s sex organs decently shrouded. This was not only to make paintings of the Annunciation more seemly, but also to ensure the Virgin\u2019s virginity remained intact. Yet even this careful scaffolding couldn\u2019t solve the question of whether the act of giving birth to Jesus wouldn\u2019t have ruptured the Holy Mother\u2019s hymen anyway, making her virginity moot. It was a conundrum that kept clever men busy in their libraries for centuries.</p> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking that it was only the early patriarchs who felt entitled to cast a theology in their own image. But as MacCulloch carefully shows, resourceful women found ways of subverting paradigms to their own pleasurable ends. Catherine of Siena, the 14th-century mystic, rapturously imagined herself marrying Christ using his circumcised foreskin as her wedding ring. Another Dominican nun, Adelheid of Frauenburg, wrote about her longing to be suckled by the Virgin Mary.</p> <p>This sort of thing quickly gets embarrassing, and it was to neutralise the feverish imaginings of canonised celibates that the church pivoted in the early modern period to promoting family life instead. In the various Reformed churches, marriage now became the highest good, not just for devout congregations but their clergy, too. Anxieties about Mary\u2019s hymen and Joseph\u2019s cuckoldry were replaced by an ideal family modelled on that of a well-to-do tradesman\u2019s in&nbsp;a&nbsp;northern European city. Jesus acquired some siblings (they had previously been shadowy), and there was a&nbsp;newly discovered grandmother in the form of Saint Anne. Even Mary Magdalene could now be rehabilitated from a whore with seven devils inside her (according to Luke\u2019s gospel) into a slightly racy aunt.</p> <p>It is these enduring Christian \u201cfamily values\u201d that have come to seem increasingly damaging. MacCulloch deals candidly with the clumsy and often cruel way in which churches in the post-second world war period dragged their feet on contraception, gay and lesbian rights and the ordination of women. His book is not in any sense a campaigning document, but he concludes with the mild and sensible suggestion that what is desperately needed is a general agreement that the church\u2019s teachings on sexuality have little to do with scripture and everything to do with the muddled fears, fantasies and self-interest of subsequent commentators and the historical societies in which they lived. The best thing to do now would be to look beyond the old and often damaging dogma and take proper notice of how real people, in all their splendid variety, organise their sex lives most comfortably when left to their own devices.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Lower Than the Angels: A History of Sex and Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch is published by Allen Lane (\u00a335).

      "body": "<h2><strong>Billy \u2013 Black Christmas</strong></h2>    <p>You wouldn\u2019t have Michael Myers if it weren\u2019t for Billy from Black Christmas. We\u2019re not talking casual inspiration here. According to director Bob Clark, John Carpenter asked him what he would do with a sequel to his now 50-year-old cult holiday horror pic. Clark responded that his killer who preys on assertive and sexually empowered young women would escape from an institution and return to town \u2026 on Halloween. A genre was born.</p> <p>Black Christmas set the template for the slasher movie: the misogynistic violence, the final girl trope and POV shots trapped in the killer\u2019s perspective all came together in the Canadian classic. But its largely unseen villain stands apart from the calm, calculated and ruthless killers that he made way for. Billy is all uncontrollable rage; and all too real because of it. The grisly violence he unleashes is pent-up perversion and toxic energy, which is easily pinned on any other male character in the movie and beyond. And it\u2019s most viscerally felt in the horrifying sounds \u2013 a medley of ungodly pleasure and pain \u2013 that we hear in his prank calls, the ones that are pointedly \u201ccoming from inside the house\u201d. <em>Radheyan Simonpillai</em></p> <h2><strong>Annie Wilkes \u2013 Misery</strong></h2>    <p>When a famous mystery writer, Paul Sheldon, gets into a snowy car accident, a local woman named Annie Wilkes saves his life and takes him in. Played as equally demonic and saccharine by Kathy Bates, Annie\u2019s the original toxic superfan, a genre of obsessive human all-too-prevalent on social media today. Annie loves Paul so much that it hurts \u2013 mostly him, such as in the scene where Annie takes a sledgehammer to his ankles after she reads his latest manuscript and discovers he\u2019s killed off her favorite character. One of my deepest-held truths is that people who are most adverse to swearing are usually secretly evil \u2026 and maybe I got that from Annie, who hates cussing. No movie line evokes as much guttural fear for me than one of her \u201ccockadoodles\u201d or \u201cdirty birds\u201d. <em>Alaina Demopoulos</em></p> <h2><strong>M3gan \u2013 M3gan</strong></h2>    <p>There\u2019s something that just feels very satisfying about marrying the creepy potential of children\u2019s toys and AI into a campy-yet-horrifying movie. Whereas nightmarish toys have been a horror movie staple for decades now, the genre is still feeling out the grotesque potential of AI \u2013 what unites them is that both invoke time-honored fears that items devised by humans to serve us will find ways to turn the tables. If M3gan plays its eponymous villain equally for frights and laughs, that\u2019s probably for the best (how else to make a hyper-intelligent children\u2019s toy deliver a chilling monologue just before slashing a neck?) and it\u2019s also true to the film\u2019s point \u2013 a murderous AI nannybot is equal parts absurd and terrifying.</p> <p>Whether you view her as fundamentally a scary doll or AI run amok, what works best about M3gan is her uncanniness, the way she tries to be human but just can\u2019t quite get there. That, I would argue, it what scares us the most \u2013 the small-yet-consequential gaps between ourselves and the beings that we create in our image, resulting in grotesque consequences. The unique way that M3gan spins out its title character\u2019s not-quite-human uncanniness is what makes this film memorable and powerful within the overcrowded horror world. <em>Veronica Esposito</em></p> <h2><strong>Count Orlok - Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror</strong></h2>    <p>FW Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror is famously an unauthorised, copyright-nudged adaptation of Bram Stoker\u2019s novel Dracula, but I can\u2019t be alone, surely, in finding Murnau\u2019s dome-headed ghoul Count Orlok a thousand times nastier than anything Francis Ford Coppola, Terence Fisher or Tod Browning ever dreamed up. We\u2019re more used to the prince of the undead as a cloak-swirling drama queen, but the stiff-limbed, claw-fingered plague-carrier of the story\u2019s earliest film iteration is powerful enough to haunt everyone\u2019s nightmares more than a century later.</p> <p>The scene in which Orlok smells blood \u2013 literally \u2013 after Thomas Hutter (Murnau\u2019s tweak on Dracula\u2019s Jonathan Harker) cuts his hand at the dinner table, is still alarmingly freaky, while the way he seems to float through space is genuinely disturbing. Robert Eggers tries to jazz him up a bit in his new remake of Nosferatu, but in all honesty, it\u2019s really not necessary; the relief you feel when Murnau has Orlok vanish in a blaze of sunlight is never going to be surpassed. One for the ages. <em>Andrew Pulver</em></p> <h2><strong>Nancy \u2013 The Craft</strong></h2>    <p>Great villains are not made by outfits alone, but did anyone ever look as good as Nancy Downs while trying to spook an ex-friend to death? Or at any other point in the 1996 witch flick The Craft: the layers of rosaries under her studded dog collar, her vinyl trench, red sunglasses and burgundy lipstick, her short slicked hair getting more dishevelled as the mean teenage witch with a jealousy problem and a noose in her locker becomes more powerful \u2013 and more unhinged.</p> <p>The movie\u2019s plot insists that Nancy, played with insouciant sourness by Fairuza Balk, is corrupted by the powerful magic she and her friends harness as they cast ambitious spells. But her backstory \u2013 poor girl at the fancy school, creep for a stepfather, and worst of all, friends who talk behind her back about how she wishes she wasn\u2019t \u201cwhite trash\u201d \u2013 makes her megalomaniac joyride seem more like a depiction of a woman relishing the chance to do things her way for a change. Which is why, when Nancy gets her just deserts \u2013 confinement in a mental institution \u2013 it feels like a betrayal. In real life, Balk <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/2017/10/16/the-craft-fairuza-balk-witch-rumors/\">bought a struggling occult shop</a> in LA. I prefer that ending. <em>Francesca Carington</em></p> <h2><strong>Michael Myers \u2013 Halloween</strong></h2>    <p>There have been so many incarnations of Michael Myers \u2013 between misbegotten cash-in sequels, more ambitious decades-later follow-ups, remakes, and countless ripoffs \u2013 that you\u2019d think the slasher of that genre\u2019s 1980s boom would have long lost his power to scare, much like how his William Shatner mask was gradually flattened and distorted into an amorphous white blob. Yet going back to John Carpenter\u2019s original 1978 Halloween, there\u2019s something implacably frightening about Myers from his very first scene, when we\u2019re introduced to him via a point-of-view shot as he murders his teenage sister \u2013 and he turns out to be just six years old.</p> <p>From that point, it\u2019s difficult to view Myers (or The Shape, as the credits refer to his adult form) as anything but a lost, overgrown child, forever wandering the streets of his home town of Haddonfield. He\u2019s a ghostly shape made of flesh, and while later versions variously made that body supernaturally powerful, freakishly strong or informed by scarred-childhood cliches, it\u2019s the manifestation of evil in a kindergarten-aged shape that I\u2019ve found increasingly upsetting as I get older (and have a kid of my own). <em>Jesse Hassenger</em></p> <h2><strong>Hugo \u2013 Dead of Night</strong></h2>    <p>Hugo is the final boss of Ealing\u2019s 1945 portmanteau horror Dead of Night, the uncanny psychopath in the film\u2019s last and most terrifying tale. Michael Redgrave gives a spine-tingling performance as both the unfortunate ventriloquist Maxwell Frere and his scheming dummy Hugo, whose risqu\u00e9 banter gets them both in trouble, and who appears to be conniving to leave him for another voice-thrower. Hugo\u2019s clacking mouth may be forced into a grin but it has teeth \u2013 he draws blood when he bites his owner\u2019s hand. His glassy eyes and raspy voice are inhumanly creepy as they are, but more so when we see the same expression on Maxwell\u2019s face and hear the same scratchy sounds emerge from his mouth. Ultimately, this nightmarish film leaves us guessing, panic-stricken, whether it is more terrifying for a dummy to come alive and drive you to murder, or to lose your mind so much that you believe something so improbable. <em>Pamela Hutchinson</em></p> <h2><strong>Stuart \u2013 Hostel: Part II</strong></h2>    <p>While the setting of the Hostel franchise may seem the fanciful stuff of exploitation-flick daydreams \u2013 an all-inclusive Slovak resort where guests can inflict whatever torments they so please on abducted human captives \u2013 its clientele is nonetheless chillingly plausible. The second installment follows a pair of grown bros finally bumped off the waiting list as they prep for a more intense indulgence of experience than a coke-fueled Vegas weekend; writer-director Eli Roth introduces them in the classic active/passive dynamic movie friendships always assume, only to reverse it when push comes to stab. Once the theretofore apprehensive Stuart (imbued with lifelike ambivalence by Broadway treasure Roger Bart) has his quarry at his mercy, a dormant bloodlust rushes out of a decent family man to show its true face. Eased by a safe space that affords him both a position of power as well as social sanctioning, he\u2019s free to release the torrents of bile even he might not have realized he was holding back, his hunger for violence sharpening itself into hatred for his wife. That outwardly ordinary people may harbor unconscionable cruelty and spend their lives waiting for an opportunity to rationalize its expression is a horrifying notion, all the more so for how the past year of geopolitics has proven this diagnosis correct and common. <em>Charles Bramesco</em></p> <h2><strong>The Entity \u2013 It Follows</strong></h2>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/oct/31/halloween-frightening-terrifying-art-horror-films-haunted-ruins-sinister-songs\">\u2018Just too frightening\u2019 \u2013 the most terrifying art, from horror films to haunted ruins and sinister songs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy to temporarily get away from \u201cthe entity\u201d in It Follows. It\u2019s also ultimately impossible, unless you have sexual contact with another person, in which case the curse passes like a dead venereal disease. In David Robert Mitchell\u2019s instant cult-horror classic, the supernatural \u201cit\u201d of the title moves with the slow, relentless pace of an old-school zombie but it can never be distracted from its target. Like death itself, the entity carries with it the terror of inevitability: there\u2019s no stopping it and it will track you down to the end of the earth, no GPS required. That the characters can only save themselves by condemning another person makes it a morally taxing villain, too, and the fact that no one else can see it coming leaves victims to a lonely, gruesome fate. <em>Scott Tobias</em></p> <h2><strong>Rose the Hat \u2013 Doctor Sleep</strong></h2>    <p>It was hard to know what to make of Mike Flanagan\u2019s 2019 horror Doctor Sleep, a film that was half-sequel to Stephen King\u2019s The Shining and half-sequel to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s adaptation of it, a fascinating yet ungainly case of awkwardly serving one too many masters (a recent watch of the three-hour director\u2019s cut proved to be far more fulfilling). But one thing was frighteningly undeniable. As Rose the Hat, the film\u2019s chief antagonist, Rebecca Ferguson was a true villain for the ages, a bewitching swirl of sensuality, pragmatism, malevolence and the dress sense of a boho Willy Wonka. She leads a travelling band, or cult, of misfits, whose survival rests on consuming the souls of murdered psychic children. In the film\u2019s most terrifying scene, she leads an attack on Jacob Tremblay\u2019s young baseball player, who cries out to no avail as she inflicts more and more pain to better the taste of his \u201csteam\u201d (it reportedly led to tears on set and even caused King to tap out). It\u2019s a bold, boundary-pushing death, and an always self-possessed Ferguson goes all the way with it, embodying the sort of eerie, indefinable evil that haunted our childhood nightmares and still has the ability to haunt us still. <em>Benjamin Lee</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Billy \u2013 Black Christmas You wouldn\u2019t have Michael Myers if it weren\u2019t for Billy from Black Christmas. We\u2019re not talking casual inspiration here. According to director Bob Clark, John Carpenter asked him what he would do with a sequel to his now 50-year-old cult holiday horror pic. Clark responded that his killer who preys on assertive and sexually empowered young women would escape from an institution and return to town \u2026 on Halloween. A genre was born. Black Christmas set the template for the slasher movie: the misogynistic violence, the final girl trope and POV shots trapped in the killer\u2019s perspective all came together in the Canadian classic. But its largely unseen villain stands apart from the calm, calculated and ruthless killers that he made way for. Billy is all uncontrollable rage; and all too real because of it. The grisly violence he unleashes is pent-up perversion and toxic energy, which is easily pinned on any other male character in the movie and beyond. And it\u2019s most viscerally felt in the horrifying sounds \u2013 a medley of ungodly pleasure and pain \u2013 that we hear in his prank calls, the ones that are pointedly \u201ccoming from inside the house\u201d. Radheyan Simonpillai Annie Wilkes \u2013 Misery When a famous mystery writer, Paul Sheldon, gets into a snowy car accident, a local woman named Annie Wilkes saves his life and takes him in. Played as equally demonic and saccharine by Kathy Bates, Annie\u2019s the original toxic superfan, a genre of obsessive human all-too-prevalent on social media today. Annie loves Paul so much that it hurts \u2013 mostly him, such as in the scene where Annie takes a sledgehammer to his ankles after she reads his latest manuscript and discovers he\u2019s killed off her favorite character. One of my deepest-held truths is that people who are most adverse to swearing are usually secretly evil \u2026 and maybe I got that from Annie, who hates cussing. No movie line evokes as much guttural fear for me than one of her \u201ccockadoodles\u201d or \u201cdirty birds\u201d. Alaina Demopoulos M3gan \u2013 M3gan There\u2019s something that just feels very satisfying about marrying the creepy potential of children\u2019s toys and AI into a campy-yet-horrifying movie. Whereas nightmarish toys have been a horror movie staple for decades now, the genre is still feeling out the grotesque potential of AI \u2013 what unites them is that both invoke time-honored fears that items devised by humans to serve us will find ways to turn the tables. If M3gan plays its eponymous villain equally for frights and laughs, that\u2019s probably for the best (how else to make a hyper-intelligent children\u2019s toy deliver a chilling monologue just before slashing a neck?) and it\u2019s also true to the film\u2019s point \u2013 a murderous AI nannybot is equal parts absurd and terrifying. Whether you view her as fundamentally a scary doll or AI run amok, what works best about M3gan is her uncanniness, the way she tries to be human but just can\u2019t quite get there. That, I would argue, it what scares us the most \u2013 the small-yet-consequential gaps between ourselves and the beings that we create in our image, resulting in grotesque consequences. The unique way that M3gan spins out its title character\u2019s not-quite-human uncanniness is what makes this film memorable and powerful within the overcrowded horror world. Veronica Esposito Count Orlok - Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror FW Murnau\u2019s Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror is famously an unauthorised, copyright-nudged adaptation of Bram Stoker\u2019s novel Dracula, but I can\u2019t be alone, surely, in finding Murnau\u2019s dome-headed ghoul Count Orlok a thousand times nastier than anything Francis Ford Coppola, Terence Fisher or Tod Browning ever dreamed up. We\u2019re more used to the prince of the undead as a cloak-swirling drama queen, but the stiff-limbed, claw-fingered plague-carrier of the story\u2019s earliest film iteration is powerful enough to haunt everyone\u2019s nightmares more than a century later. The scene in which Orlok smells blood \u2013 literally \u2013 after Thomas Hutter (Murnau\u2019s tweak on Dracula\u2019s Jonathan Harker) cuts his hand at the dinner table, is still alarmingly freaky, while the way he seems to float through space is genuinely disturbing. Robert Eggers tries to jazz him up a bit in his new remake of Nosferatu, but in all honesty, it\u2019s really not necessary; the relief you feel when Murnau has Orlok vanish in a blaze of sunlight is never going to be surpassed. One for the ages. Andrew Pulver Nancy \u2013 The Craft Great villains are not made by outfits alone, but did anyone ever look as good as Nancy Downs while trying to spook an ex-friend to death? Or at any other point in the 1996 witch flick The Craft: the layers of rosaries under her studded dog collar, her vinyl trench, red sunglasses and burgundy lipstick, her short slicked hair getting more dishevelled as the mean teenage witch with a jealousy problem and a noose in her locker becomes more powerful \u2013 and more unhinged. The movie\u2019s plot insists that Nancy, played with insouciant sourness by Fairuza Balk, is corrupted by the powerful magic she and her friends harness as they cast ambitious spells. But her backstory \u2013 poor girl at the fancy school, creep for a stepfather, and worst of all, friends who talk behind her back about how she wishes she wasn\u2019t \u201cwhite trash\u201d \u2013 makes her megalomaniac joyride seem more like a depiction of a woman relishing the chance to do things her way for a change. Which is why, when Nancy gets her just deserts \u2013 confinement in a mental institution \u2013 it feels like a betrayal. In real life, Balk bought a struggling occult shop in LA. I prefer that ending. Francesca Carington Michael Myers \u2013 Halloween There have been so many incarnations of Michael Myers \u2013 between misbegotten cash-in sequels, more ambitious decades-later follow-ups, remakes, and countless ripoffs \u2013 that you\u2019d think the slasher of that genre\u2019s 1980s boom would have long lost his power to scare, much like how his William Shatner mask was gradually flattened and distorted into an amorphous white blob. Yet going back to John Carpenter\u2019s original 1978 Halloween, there\u2019s something implacably frightening about Myers from his very first scene, when we\u2019re introduced to him via a point-of-view shot as he murders his teenage sister \u2013 and he turns out to be just six years old. From that point, it\u2019s difficult to view Myers (or The Shape, as the credits refer to his adult form) as anything but a lost, overgrown child, forever wandering the streets of his home town of Haddonfield. He\u2019s a ghostly shape made of flesh, and while later versions variously made that body supernaturally powerful, freakishly strong or informed by scarred-childhood cliches, it\u2019s the manifestation of evil in a kindergarten-aged shape that I\u2019ve found increasingly upsetting as I get older (and have a kid of my own). Jesse Hassenger Hugo \u2013 Dead of Night Hugo is the final boss of Ealing\u2019s 1945 portmanteau horror Dead of Night, the uncanny psychopath in the film\u2019s last and most terrifying tale. Michael Redgrave gives a spine-tingling performance as both the unfortunate ventriloquist Maxwell Frere and his scheming dummy Hugo, whose risqu\u00e9 banter gets them both in trouble, and who appears to be conniving to leave him for another voice-thrower. Hugo\u2019s clacking mouth may be forced into a grin but it has teeth \u2013 he draws blood when he bites his owner\u2019s hand. His glassy eyes and raspy voice are inhumanly creepy as they are, but more so when we see the same expression on Maxwell\u2019s face and hear the same scratchy sounds emerge from his mouth. Ultimately, this nightmarish film leaves us guessing, panic-stricken, whether it is more terrifying for a dummy to come alive and drive you to murder, or to lose your mind so much that you believe something so improbable. Pamela Hutchinson Stuart \u2013 Hostel: Part II While the setting of the Hostel franchise may seem the fanciful stuff of exploitation-flick daydreams \u2013 an all-inclusive Slovak resort where guests can inflict whatever torments they so please on abducted human captives \u2013 its clientele is nonetheless chillingly plausible. The second installment follows a pair of grown bros finally bumped off the waiting list as they prep for a more intense indulgence of experience than a coke-fueled Vegas weekend; writer-director Eli Roth introduces them in the classic active/passive dynamic movie friendships always assume, only to reverse it when push comes to stab. Once the theretofore apprehensive Stuart (imbued with lifelike ambivalence by Broadway treasure Roger Bart) has his quarry at his mercy, a dormant bloodlust rushes out of a decent family man to show its true face. Eased by a safe space that affords him both a position of power as well as social sanctioning, he\u2019s free to release the torrents of bile even he might not have realized he was holding back, his hunger for violence sharpening itself into hatred for his wife. That outwardly ordinary people may harbor unconscionable cruelty and spend their lives waiting for an opportunity to rationalize its expression is a horrifying notion, all the more so for how the past year of geopolitics has proven this diagnosis correct and common. Charles Bramesco The Entity \u2013 It Follows It\u2019s easy to temporarily get away from \u201cthe entity\u201d in It Follows. It\u2019s also ultimately impossible, unless you have sexual contact with another person, in which case the curse passes like a dead venereal disease. In David Robert Mitchell\u2019s instant cult-horror classic, the supernatural \u201cit\u201d of the title moves with the slow, relentless pace of an old-school zombie but it can never be distracted from its target. Like death itself, the entity carries with it the terror of inevitability: there\u2019s no stopping it and it will track you down to the end of the earth, no GPS required. That the characters can only save themselves by condemning another person makes it a morally taxing villain, too, and the fact that no one else can see it coming leaves victims to a lonely, gruesome fate. Scott Tobias Rose the Hat \u2013 Doctor Sleep It was hard to know what to make of Mike Flanagan\u2019s 2019 horror Doctor Sleep, a film that was half-sequel to Stephen King\u2019s The Shining and half-sequel to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s adaptation of it, a fascinating yet ungainly case of awkwardly serving one too many masters (a recent watch of the three-hour director\u2019s cut proved to be far more fulfilling). But one thing was frighteningly undeniable. As Rose the Hat, the film\u2019s chief antagonist, Rebecca Ferguson was a true villain for the ages, a bewitching swirl of sensuality, pragmatism, malevolence and the dress sense of a boho Willy Wonka. She leads a travelling band, or cult, of misfits, whose survival rests on consuming the souls of murdered psychic children. In the film\u2019s most terrifying scene, she leads an attack on Jacob Tremblay\u2019s young baseball player, who cries out to no avail as she inflicts more and more pain to better the taste of his \u201csteam\u201d (it reportedly led to tears on set and even caused King to tap out). It\u2019s a bold, boundary-pushing death, and an always self-possessed Ferguson goes all the way with it, embodying the sort of eerie, indefinable evil that haunted our childhood nightmares and still has the ability to haunt us still.

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s roll out the red carpet for the midseason-ish awards. A quick note, these awards are based on what has happened through eight weeks. They\u2019re not projections on how the awards race will stack up at the end of the year.</p> <h2>Offensive player of the year</h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles; Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings; Ja\u2019Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals; Derrick Henry, Baltimore Ravens.</p> <p>Did even the Ravens think adding Henry would go this smoothly? The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/17/derrick-henry-running-back-baltimore-ravens-nfl\">ageless back is on track to crack 2,000 at 30 years old</a>. After a wobbly opening week against the Chiefs, Henry has run over and around every defense he has faced. He leads the league in rushing yards, yards from scrimmage, touchdowns and has tacked on the longest run of the season for good measure. The only player with more explosive rushes than Henry this season is \u2026 Lamar Jackson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/30/nfl-trend-watch-tom-bradys-dreadful-vocabulary-and-the-lions-supercharged-offense\">NFL trend watch: Tom Brady\u2019s dreadful vocabulary and the Lions\u2019 supercharged offense</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Typically, a team adding a veteran running back is the kind of move that draws offseason column inches but fails to move the championship needle. But Henry has helped the Ravens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/17/derrick-henry-running-back-baltimore-ravens-nfl\">reimagine their offense</a> around Jackson, making the team more viable for a deep postseason run.</p> <p>Jackson is still the key Jenga block. Without Henry, the Ravens could still put together an excellent offense. Without Jackson, they would be in trouble. But pairing the two together has pushed Baltimore\u2019s offense to a new level. They have the most distinctive and effective running game in the league; teams accustomed to generic ground attacks look shell-shocked when they face the Jackson-Henry tandem.</p> <p>Somehow, pairing the best downhill runner in the NFL with the league MVP has been better in reality than it was in theory.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong><em> </em>Henry</p>    <h2>Defensive player of the year</h2> <p><strong>Nominees: </strong>TJ Watt, Pittsburgh Steelers; Brian Branch, Detroit Lions; Will Anderson, Houston Texans; Dexter Lawrence, New York Giants; Chris Jones, Kansas City Chiefs; Aidan Hutchinson, Detroit Lions; Nick Bosa, San Francisco 49ers. </p> <p>There are a dizzying array of candidates this season. Before <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41778959/lions-hutchinson-carted-serious-injury\">his season-ending leg injury</a>, Hutchinson was waltzing away with the award. With Hutchinson missing time, it\u2019s tempting to hand the award to Brian Branch, Detroit\u2019s do-everything safety, slot corner and part-time linebacker. Branch is the secret sauce to the Lions\u2019 defensive success, a multi-positional star who plays with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK00PjxTeBU\">unteachable, two-steps ahead vision</a>.</p> <p>But Branch is the hipster pick. The logical choice is TJ Watt. The Steelers\u2019 edge-rusher continues to take over games single-handedly. He\u2019s up to 6.5 sacks this season and has forced four fumbles, recovering two. Against the run, he has been flat-out unblockable, clocking up 14 run stops. No one with his sack total is close to the double-digit mark.</p> <p>What\u2019s remarkable about Watt is not that he wins, but <em>how. </em>Anderson, Hutchinson and Myles Garrett have multiple ways to puncture the backfield and rock quarterbacks. They stack move on top of move. Hutchinson aside, the league\u2019s great and good shuffle across the defensive formation. Not Watt. He doesn\u2019t attack from weird angles. He doesn\u2019t have a deep bag of tricks. He doesn\u2019t get any schematic help. He lines up in one spot \u2013 as a left-side defensive end \u2013 and lets it rip.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1851099889813623054\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Game.

Watt has one move: a dip-and-rip, speed rush. He explodes off the line, arcs around the opposing right tackle and closes to the quarterback. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>For most of his career, Watt tried <em>stuff</em>. But he has now traded out unpredictability for efficiency. The idea is not to win every rep, but that when he does win, it\u2019s quick and clean, giving him a chance not just to pressure or drop a quarterback, but to attack the ball and force a fumble. His<a href=\"https://x.com/RGIII/status/1851107028309033263\"> historic forced fumble figures</a> are not an accident, they\u2019re by design. Watt has elected to chase gamechanging plays rather than beef up his pressure figures.</p> <p>Watt\u2019s metrics this season won\u2019t blow you away. He\u2019s totted up 28 total pressures, putting him 28th in the league \u2013 and second on his own team<em> </em>behind Cameron Heyward. In terms of pass-rush win rate (how often he\u2019s beating his blocker), he\u2019s 37th in the league, behind <em>two </em>teammates \u2013 Heyward and rotational rusher Nick Herbig. But there is plenty of context. No pass-rusher has drawn more double teams, been <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-chip-percentage-week-8\">chipped as often, or been gameplanned against</a> as much as Watt.</p> <p>He may not hit all the traditional benchmarks, but no defender has been as valuable to their unit as Watt.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong><em> </em>Watt</p>    <h2>Offensive rookie of the year</h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong> Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders; Malik Nabers, New York Giants; Brock Bowers, Las Vegas Raiders; Brian Thomas Jr, Jacksonville Jaguars.</p> <p>In a stacked class, this is not particularly close. Jayden Daniels is lapping the field. Daniels has proven to be every bit the dual threat he was in college, as comfortable breaking away for an explosive run as he is dicing up defenses from the pocket. Eight weeks into his career, he is navigating games with the confidence of a five-year vet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1850683356742312348\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"nl\" dir=\"ltr\">A;FK;JD;KJF;LAKEJFLKJVAL;KEJL;JF;EFJ;LFAKJ<br><br>JAYDEN DANIELS HAIL MARY! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Commanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@COMMANDERS</a> WIN! <a href=\"https://t.co/BsQ0Z84Rko\">pic.twitter.com/BsQ0Z84Rko</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1850683356742312348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>Daniels leads the league in the <a href=\"https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/\">RBSDM quarterback composite</a>, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for that value. That data extends back to 2010. In that time, no rookie or first-year starter (including Patrick Mahomes!) has led the field through the opening eight weeks of a season.</p> <p>Does anyone deserve this more than Washington fans? Like Andy Dufresne, they escaped through a sewage pipe, this one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/15/daniel-snyder-washington-commanders-sale\">of Dan Snyder\u2019s ownership</a> and have emerged with a rookie quarterback playing at an MVP level. Next up, Zihuatanejo, or, you know, a playoff win.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> Daniels</p> <h2>Defensive rookie of the year</h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong> Jared Verse, LA Rams; Evan Williams, Green Bay Packers; Laiatu Latu, Indianapolis Colts; Quinyon Mitchell, Philadelphia Eagles; T\u2019Vondre Sweat, Tennessee Titans. </p> <p>The Rams were never going to replace Aaron Donald\u2019s Hall of Fame <em>impact</em>.<em> </em>But they approached last offseason hoping to recreate Donald\u2019s <em>production</em> in the aggregate, drafting a pair of rookies they hoped could one day headline a group that would stop them pining for Donald.</p> <p>Midway through the season, they\u2019ve gotten more than they bargained for. Jared Verse, the 19th overall pick, is already a legitimate star. He has picked up only 2.5 sacks in seven games, but he\u2019s spent the bulk of those games camped in opposing backfields. Verse had notched 32 total pressures this season, good for ninth in the league, and only Hutchinson has a better per snap pressure rate.</p> <p>Again: Verse is a rookie! Rookie edge-rushers are supposed<em> </em>to be flashy. Sometimes their sack production is inflated but their under-the-hood numbers do not stack up to scrutiny. Verse is the inverse. He\u2019s an every-down wrecking ball who hasn\u2019t quite been able to close. Eventually, the sack total will tick up. But in the first eight weeks of his career he\u2019s played at a Pro Bowl level.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> Verse.</p>    <h2>Coach of the year</h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong> Matt LaFleur, Green Bay Packers; Dan Campbell, Detroit Lions; Dan Quinn, Washington Commanders; Mike Tomlin, Pittsburgh Steelers; Andy Reid, Kansas City Chiefs, Kevin O\u2019Connell, Minnesota Vikings. </p> <p>Picking a coach of the year is tricky at the best of times. Good luck figuring it out this year. You can toss up the names of any of the three coaches at the top of the NFC North and plump for whichever hits the ground first. Campbell has turned the Lions into a certified juggernaut. Then you have Tomlin, who has the Steelers first in the AFC North despite making a quarterback change. And there is Reid, who has the two-time defending champs off to an undefeated start, even if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/24/patrick-mahomes-kansas-city-chiefs-quarterback-nfl-interceptions\">vibes have felt a little off</a> at times.</p> <p>In terms of pure coaching, LaFleur building a successful offense around Malik Willis in the absence of Jordan Love is as strong a case as any coach has put together. It\u2019s also tough to look past Quinn, who has put the ecosystem in place to allow Daniels to shine and has the Commanders in contention for a division title in what was expected to be a rebuilding year.</p> <p>But O\u2019Connell ties both those ideas together. As the author of the Vikings offense, he has helped to rejuvenate Sam Darnold\u2019s career, constructing a top-10 unit by points per game around the journeyman quarterback. O\u2019Connell also deserves kudos for signing off on Minnesota\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dailynorseman.com/2024/10/2/24256385/how-the-vikings-defensive-scheme-under-brian-flores-works\">confuse-and-clobber</a> defense. Brian Flores is the architect of the Vikings\u2019 puzzling, erratic, delightful unit, but O\u2019Connell hired Flores and his approach \u2013 a style that would have made plenty of other head coaches shudder.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong> O\u2019Connell</p> <h2>Most Valuable Player</h2> <p><strong>Nominees:</strong> Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills; Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens; Jared Goff, Detroit Lions; Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders; CJ Stroud, Houston Texans.</p> <p>This is tight. Goff is having the best stretch of his career, torching the preconceived notion that he is merely a function of Detroit\u2019s system. Stroud has kept the Texans\u2019 offense afloat despite facing as much <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzWWfdU-U64\">incoming fire</a> as any quarterback in the league.</p> <p>But there are two standout candidates: Allen and Jackson.</p> <p>Jackson, the reigning MVP, remains the keystone of the Ravens offense. He is running a more prolific offense than Allen.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s roll out the red carpet for the midseason-ish awards. A quick note, these awards are based on what has happened through eight weeks. They\u2019re not projections on how the awards race will stack up at the end of the year. Offensive player of the year Nominees: Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles; Justin Jefferson, Minnesota Vikings; Ja\u2019Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals; Derrick Henry, Baltimore Ravens. Did even the Ravens think adding Henry would go this smoothly? The ageless back is on track to crack 2,000 at 30 years old. After a wobbly opening week against the Chiefs, Henry has run over and around every defense he has faced. He leads the league in rushing yards, yards from scrimmage, touchdowns and has tacked on the longest run of the season for good measure. The only player with more explosive rushes than Henry this season is \u2026 Lamar Jackson. Typically, a team adding a veteran running back is the kind of move that draws offseason column inches but fails to move the championship needle. But Henry has helped the Ravens reimagine their offense around Jackson, making the team more viable for a deep postseason run. Jackson is still the key Jenga block. Without Henry, the Ravens could still put together an excellent offense. Without Jackson, they would be in trouble. But pairing the two together has pushed Baltimore\u2019s offense to a new level. They have the most distinctive and effective running game in the league; teams accustomed to generic ground attacks look shell-shocked when they face the Jackson-Henry tandem. Somehow, pairing the best downhill runner in the NFL with the league MVP has been better in reality than it was in theory. Winner: Henry Defensive player of the year Nominees: TJ Watt, Pittsburgh Steelers; Brian Branch, Detroit Lions; Will Anderson, Houston Texans; Dexter Lawrence, New York Giants; Chris Jones, Kansas City Chiefs; Aidan Hutchinson, Detroit Lions; Nick Bosa, San Francisco 49ers. There are a dizzying array of candidates this season. Before his season-ending leg injury, Hutchinson was waltzing away with the award. With Hutchinson missing time, it\u2019s tempting to hand the award to Brian Branch, Detroit\u2019s do-everything safety, slot corner and part-time linebacker. Branch is the secret sauce to the Lions\u2019 defensive success, a multi-positional star who plays with unteachable, two-steps ahead vision. But Branch is the hipster pick. The logical choice is TJ Watt. The Steelers\u2019 edge-rusher continues to take over games single-handedly. He\u2019s up to 6.5 sacks this season and has forced four fumbles, recovering two. Against the run, he has been flat-out unblockable, clocking up 14 run stops. No one with his sack total is close to the double-digit mark. What\u2019s remarkable about Watt is not that he wins, but how. Anderson, Hutchinson and Myles Garrett have multiple ways to puncture the backfield and rock quarterbacks. They stack move on top of move. Hutchinson aside, the league\u2019s great and good shuffle across the defensive formation. Not Watt. He doesn\u2019t attack from weird angles. He doesn\u2019t have a deep bag of tricks. He doesn\u2019t get any schematic help. He lines up in one spot \u2013 as a left-side defensive end \u2013 and lets it rip. That\u2019s not an exaggeration. Watt has one move: a dip-and-rip, speed rush. He explodes off the line, arcs around the opposing right tackle and closes to the quarterback. That\u2019s it. For most of his career, Watt tried stuff. But he has now traded out unpredictability for efficiency. The idea is not to win every rep, but that when he does win, it\u2019s quick and clean, giving him a chance not just to pressure or drop a quarterback, but to attack the ball and force a fumble. His historic forced fumble figures are not an accident, they\u2019re by design. Watt has elected to chase gamechanging plays rather than beef up his pressure figures. Watt\u2019s metrics this season won\u2019t blow you away. He\u2019s totted up 28 total pressures, putting him 28th in the league \u2013 and second on his own team behind Cameron Heyward. In terms of pass-rush win rate (how often he\u2019s beating his blocker), he\u2019s 37th in the league, behind two teammates \u2013 Heyward and rotational rusher Nick Herbig. But there is plenty of context. No pass-rusher has drawn more double teams, been chipped as often, or been gameplanned against as much as Watt. He may not hit all the traditional benchmarks, but no defender has been as valuable to their unit as Watt. Winner: Watt Offensive rookie of the year Nominees: Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders; Malik Nabers, New York Giants; Brock Bowers, Las Vegas Raiders; Brian Thomas Jr, Jacksonville Jaguars. In a stacked class, this is not particularly close. Jayden Daniels is lapping the field. Daniels has proven to be every bit the dual threat he was in college, as comfortable breaking away for an explosive run as he is dicing up defenses from the pocket. Eight weeks into his career, he is navigating games with the confidence of a five-year vet. Daniels leads the league in the RBSDM quarterback composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for that value. That data extends back to 2010. In that time, no rookie or first-year starter (including Patrick Mahomes!) has led the field through the opening eight weeks of a season. Does anyone deserve this more than Washington fans? Like Andy Dufresne, they escaped through a sewage pipe, this one of Dan Snyder\u2019s ownership and have emerged with a rookie quarterback playing at an MVP level. Next up, Zihuatanejo, or, you know, a playoff win. Winner: Daniels Defensive rookie of the year Nominees: Jared Verse, LA Rams; Evan Williams, Green Bay Packers; Laiatu Latu, Indianapolis Colts; Quinyon Mitchell, Philadelphia Eagles; T\u2019Vondre Sweat, Tennessee Titans. The Rams were never going to replace Aaron Donald\u2019s Hall of Fame impact. But they approached last offseason hoping to recreate Donald\u2019s production in the aggregate, drafting a pair of rookies they hoped could one day headline a group that would stop them pining for Donald. Midway through the season, they\u2019ve gotten more than they bargained for. Jared Verse, the 19th overall pick, is already a legitimate star. He has picked up only 2.5 sacks in seven games, but he\u2019s spent the bulk of those games camped in opposing backfields. Verse had notched 32 total pressures this season, good for ninth in the league, and only Hutchinson has a better per snap pressure rate. Again: Verse is a rookie! Rookie edge-rushers are supposed to be flashy. Sometimes their sack production is inflated but their under-the-hood numbers do not stack up to scrutiny. Verse is the inverse. He\u2019s an every-down wrecking ball who hasn\u2019t quite been able to close. Eventually, the sack total will tick up. But in the first eight weeks of his career he\u2019s played at a Pro Bowl level. Winner: Verse. Coach of the year Nominees: Matt LaFleur, Green Bay Packers; Dan Campbell, Detroit Lions; Dan Quinn, Washington Commanders; Mike Tomlin, Pittsburgh Steelers; Andy Reid, Kansas City Chiefs, Kevin O\u2019Connell, Minnesota Vikings. Picking a coach of the year is tricky at the best of times. Good luck figuring it out this year. You can toss up the names of any of the three coaches at the top of the NFC North and plump for whichever hits the ground first. Campbell has turned the Lions into a certified juggernaut. Then you have Tomlin, who has the Steelers first in the AFC North despite making a quarterback change. And there is Reid, who has the two-time defending champs off to an undefeated start, even if the vibes have felt a little off at times. In terms of pure coaching, LaFleur building a successful offense around Malik Willis in the absence of Jordan Love is as strong a case as any coach has put together. It\u2019s also tough to look past Quinn, who has put the ecosystem in place to allow Daniels to shine and has the Commanders in contention for a division title in what was expected to be a rebuilding year. But O\u2019Connell ties both those ideas together. As the author of the Vikings offense, he has helped to rejuvenate Sam Darnold\u2019s career, constructing a top-10 unit by points per game around the journeyman quarterback. O\u2019Connell also deserves kudos for signing off on Minnesota\u2019s confuse-and-clobber defense. Brian Flores is the architect of the Vikings\u2019 puzzling, erratic, delightful unit, but O\u2019Connell hired Flores and his approach \u2013 a style that would have made plenty of other head coaches shudder. Winner: O\u2019Connell Most Valuable Player Nominees: Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills; Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens; Jared Goff, Detroit Lions; Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders; CJ Stroud, Houston Texans. This is tight. Goff is having the best stretch of his career, torching the preconceived notion that he is merely a function of Detroit\u2019s system. Stroud has kept the Texans\u2019 offense afloat despite facing as much incoming fire as any quarterback in the league. But there are two standout candidates: Allen and Jackson. Jackson, the reigning MVP, remains the keystone of the Ravens offense. He is running a more prolific offense than Allen. But the Bills\u2019 quarterback is putting together the best season of his career with a slightly higher degree of difficulty than Jackson. In his seventh season, Allen has sanded off some of the rougher edges of his game. He has tossed only one interception against 14 touchdowns this season, cutting down on the mind-numbing turnovers that have trailed him in previous years. Part of that is due to getting rid of the ball quicker than at any point in his career, which has seen him morph into the most efficient passer in the league. And that\u2019s all without curbing his trademark aggressiveness or playmaking instincts \u2013 Allen still leads the league in big-time throw rate, according to Pro Football Focus. At this stage of his career, the Bills go as Allen goes. And he has the team positioned to rip off their fifth successive AFC East title. He edges out Jackson \u2013 just. Winner: Allen",

She has deployed the tropes and played with the imagery, but always left the reader with a way out \u2013 the option to interpret her work as magical realism, or psychological drama. The Hotel is different. In this new book of short stories, she fully, deliciously commits to the genre, via a series of brief, chilling tales of ghosts and witches, monsters and manifestations; rooms that change shape and \u201cfootsteps close behind you but no one there when you turn\u201d.</p> <p>The connective tissue is The Hotel of the title: nameless throughout, but always capitalised; looming over every sentence in which it appears. The stories take us back through The Hotel\u2019s history: its ill-starred construction; the people who are drawn to and undone by it; the semi-sentience that roils and twitches within its walls. In&nbsp;Johnson\u2019s work, landscapes have always set the tone and powered the action, and The Hotel is no exception: the flat, wet land of the Fens dampens its walls and sucks at its foundations, refusing readers firm footing. The building itself, with its \u201clong chimneys, narrow windows \u2026 stained glass which dims the light\u201d, has shouldered its way up from the site of a farm in which, many years earlier, a woman lived and died. We learn in the opening story that the woman was guilty of the dual sins of childlessness and second sight, which led her neighbours to drown her in the farm\u2019s pond. Her ghost goes on to haunt The Hotel \u2013 most clearly via the eerie repetition of the phrase \u201cI WILL SEE YOU SOON\u201d, which she scratches on her door in the minutes before her murder, and which resurfaces throughout the collection on walls and mirrors and in notepads and emails \u2013 but she is not the source of its curse. Rather, it is the land itself that is haunted. \u201cWhat is in this land is&nbsp;some possessive quality, some unquietness,\u201d says the woman. \u201cIt is clear to me that there are places which have as much personality as any person or animal and this is one of them.\u201d</p> <p>After her drowning, the farm is burned down and the land sits, sodden and empty, until a construction crew arrives at the \u201cslick, miserable place\u201d to wrestle it into submission. Gradually, grudgingly, the land loosens its grip and The Hotel takes shape, and for some people, in some lights, that shape seems good: there are \u201cbig fires in the bar and the rooms are warm, dressing gowns hang from the backs of the bathroom doors\u201d. But for other people, The Hotel acts like a&nbsp;hurtful magnet, dragging them ineluctably towards itself \u2013 and once it has them in its orbit, it is reluctant to let them go. The Hotel, we learn, is \u201can&nbsp;unclear archive, a great collector\u201d; those it touches once are haunted by it, compelled to return. A girl falls into a&nbsp;queasy friendship with the child of another guest, and does something so&nbsp;terrible to her that, when she reappears as a grown woman in a later story, she rationalises it as a dream. But \u201cwhen [a] job came up at The Hotel I found myself applying without really meaning to \u2026 it feels right to be back here in a way I cannot quite explain\u201d. In an earlier tale, the women who clean The Hotel leave at the end of their shifts, but wake from sleep to find themselves \u201cstood outside of The Hotel, waiting\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Hotel is a palimpsest: layers of earth and history, and the intersecting lives of its victims, have piled up together to form it. As we move through the collection, we come to understand that it is a palimpsest of previous tales, too. The echoes of other giants of the genre \u2013 Stephen King\u2019s The Shining, most obviously, but also Shirley Jackson\u2019s We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Bluebeard, The Blair Witch Project, Lars von Trier\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/07/lars-von-trier-the-kingdom\">The Kingdom</a> and even Hansel and Gretel \u2013 resonate throughout, deepening and complicating it. In The Hotel, Johnson has given us a deftly constructed new version of a horror collection, with stories that slip in like mist under the door, just right for Halloween.

      "body": "<p>After several tumultuous years, the former Banksy associate Steve Lazarides saw the writing on the wall. Between the challenges of the pandemic, the escalating cost of living, mental health struggles and a weighty financial setback from his now-defunct manufacturing company, Lazarides suddenly found himself longing to reclaim his first love, photography.</p> <p>To dedicate himself to his craft fully, he is selling his one-of-a-kind collection of Banksy artwork and artifacts. \u201cThis has been a large part of my life for the last 25 years, whether I was working with him or not,\u201d Lazarides said over a Zoom call from London last week. \u201cI just want it out of my in-tray and to go back to concentrating on taking photographs again.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not that Lazarides hasn\u2019t spent time behind the lens over the last two and a half decades. In 2019 he published Banksy Captured, a behind the scenes chronicle of Banksy as told through Lazarides\u2019s photos and anecdotes, followed by a second volume a year later. Still, Lazarides says: \u201cI never got the time to put into photography that I really wanted to so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at now. I\u2019m also currently editing through a couple hundred thousand images that I shot in a pre-Banksy time.\u201d</p> <p>To clear his plate, Lazarides has enlisted the help of Julien\u2019s Auctions, where the aptly titled <a href=\"https://www.juliensauctions.com/en/auctions/under-duress-the-banksy-archive-of-steve-lazarides-565\">Under Duress: The Banksy Archive of Steve Lazarides</a> is set to go live today at Julien\u2019s Los Angeles-based warehouse and online.</p>    <p>Featuring original artwork, including a painting of Hooded Figure, a hand-cut stencil of Drill Rat, and a drawing of Burning Police Car, and more than 40 prints, including Rude Copper, Love Is In The Air (AKA Flower Thrower), and Bomb Hugger, the trove also offers a glimpse into Banksy\u2019s creative process with concept sketches of Paparazzi Rat and Every Time I Make Love To You, I Think of Someone Else. The diversity of miscellaneous items ranges from a 2002 original domain name registration certificate to limited edition Puma Clydes worn by Banksy at his 2003 Turf War exhibition.</p> <p>Lazarides first met Banksy in 1997 in Bristol, where he was sent by the London-based magazine Sleazenation to photograph and interview the street artist. \u201cI saw his shit on the street and it fucking blew me away. It was totally different from any other shit I was seeing,\u201d Lazarides says. \u201cThat stencil thing, it was political, cheeky and funny. And he could put it in insane places that you couldn\u2019t really get with a full piece of graffiti.\u201d From there, their connection quickly evolved, with Lazarides soon after becoming Banksy\u2019s agent, manager and gallerist.</p> <p>As close as they were, though, Lazarides says their relationship wasn\u2019t always easy. He describes working with Banksy as \u201cfull tilt\u201d and notes the prolific artist\u2019s unrelenting pace made their dynamic \u201cvery intense\u201d. Nonetheless, Lazarides admires Banksy\u2019s dedication to his art, calling him \u201cthe real deal\u201d. He recalls with a warm smile occasions when they would meet for drinks, and Banksy would slip outside to tag the bar, returning swiftly, and smelling like spray paint, before their pints were even served.</p>    <p>By 2008, however, the demanding 24/7 gig had taken its toll on Lazarides. \u201cBanksy\u2019s a full-time job, and I wanted to look after other artists, so he went his way, and I went mine,\u201d he says. Thereafter, and up until last year, Lazarides worked as an art dealer, gallerist and art promoter.</p> <p>He grew disillusioned, however, by the commercialization of art. \u201c\u2018How much is it, and how much will it be worth in three years?\u2019 That\u2019s all it was,\u201d he says lamenting the art inquiries he fielded regularly. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with the whole art world at the moment.\u201d It marks a stark contrast from his origins with Banksy. \u201cHe never went into it for money. We didn\u2019t even know you could make money,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fine art. This was on the streets for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Lazarides stands to make a lot of money from today\u2019s auction, which is estimated to yield $1-2m. A circa 2004 print of Banksy\u2019s iconic artwork Girl with Balloon, which will kick off Thursday\u2019s auction, has already attracted an offer of $60,000 in early bidding online. Ironically, Lazarides loathes the globally beloved masterpiece. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the Girl with Balloon print,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody thinks this is a happy scene, and I\u2019m like: \u2018Nah, it\u2019s a little girl losing her heart. Where do you see happiness in that, you sick motherfucker?\u2019 There is no happiness in it.\u201d</p> <p>However, Lazarides lauds the infamous shredding of a 2006 Girl with Balloon painting, which, orchestrated by Banksy, self-destructed in its canvas at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in 2018, just after it was sold for more than $1m. \u201cThat, alone, earns Banksy a place in art history,\u201d Lazarides says. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the strongest pieces of performance art I\u2019ve seen in fucking years. It was bold and provocative, and it took planning.\u201d Three years later, the shredded remains, which Banksy named Love Is In The Bin, sold for $25.4m at Sotheby\u2019s.</p>    <p>Despite the notorious prank, Lazarides says Banksy \u201cseems to be pretty supportive of this [auction], which I am very happy about\u201d. How does he know that he has Banksy\u2019s blessing? Averting his eyes, Lazarides turns evasive. \u201cAh, you know, just through them vibes coming through the sky,\u201d he says, before breaking into a grin with a mischievous glint in his eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/article/2024/aug/18/its-wanton-vandalism-the-unwanted-consequences-of-owning-a-banksy\">\u2018It\u2019s wanton vandalism\u2019: the unwanted consequences of owning a Banksy </a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Lazarides readily offers that he last saw Banksy \u201cdisappearing through the crowd at a Massive Attack gig\u201d.

      "bodyText": "After several tumultuous years, the former Banksy associate Steve Lazarides saw the writing on the wall. Between the challenges of the pandemic, the escalating cost of living, mental health struggles and a weighty financial setback from his now-defunct manufacturing company, Lazarides suddenly found himself longing to reclaim his first love, photography. To dedicate himself to his craft fully, he is selling his one-of-a-kind collection of Banksy artwork and artifacts. \u201cThis has been a large part of my life for the last 25 years, whether I was working with him or not,\u201d Lazarides said over a Zoom call from London last week. \u201cI just want it out of my in-tray and to go back to concentrating on taking photographs again.\u201d It\u2019s not that Lazarides hasn\u2019t spent time behind the lens over the last two and a half decades. In 2019 he published Banksy Captured, a behind the scenes chronicle of Banksy as told through Lazarides\u2019s photos and anecdotes, followed by a second volume a year later. Still, Lazarides says: \u201cI never got the time to put into photography that I really wanted to so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at now.

executive <strong>Mike Henry</strong> defended BHP\u2019s climate transition action plan at the company\u2019s annual general meeting yesterday, arguing controversial carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could help achieve its emissions reductions targets.</p> <p>Climate activists Lock the Gate Alliance protested BHP\u2019s \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and shareholders questioned how the company could meet its goal of net-zero scope-three emissions, those produced indirectly up or down the value chain, while mining coal into the next century.</p> <p>One shareholder asked why BHP was over-investing in a risky, unproven technology like CCUS when other commercial-scale technologies were more effective at reducing emissions.</p> <p>MacKenzie said, as well as exploring other ways to reduce emissions from steel production, that:</p> <p>\u201cYes, unapologetically, we\u2019re looking at CCUS because it\u2019s a potential solution to create near-zero blast furnace base, which is the dominant technology out there today,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Simon Nicholas,</strong> lead steel analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said there were no

don\u2019t see how they\u2019re going to meet their scope-three emissions goal.</p> <p>You just can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re still mining coal and sending your low-grade iron ore to be processed

main roads in some Australian suburbs, exposing children to deadly car pollution, according to a new report.</p> <p>A Climate Council report, released today, finds that about one in six schools and childcare centres across our capital cities are located within 100 metres of a busy road. That equates to more than 2,300 childcare centres and 827 schools.</p> <p>Children are particularly at risk from air pollution, because they inhale more air per kilogram of body weight and have faster breathing rates. The closer they are, the higher the risk.</p> <p>Outdoor air pollution was blamed for 4,250 premature deaths in 2021, plus a rise in asthma, heart disease and lung cancer, among other ailments.</p> <p>Car crashes are the leading cause of death for children globally. Air pollution costs about $6.2bn a year in Australia.</p> <p>The Climate Council CEO, <strong>Amanda McKenzie,</strong> said it was time to phase out \u201cpolluting cars\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s give more people in our cities better travel options, so it\u2019s easier for more people to use shared and active means of getting around our cities - like walking, riding a bike, or taking public transport - more often. This will rapidly clean up our neighbourhoods, reduce air and climate pollution at the same time, and create healthier and safer spaces for our kids to thrive in.</p> </blockquote> <p>The suburbs of Perth City in Perth and Boroondara in Melbourne were the least healthy, with 55.3% and 51.9% of schools exposed to car pollution. The Victorian capital had the worst record of any capital city, with 24% of all schools exposed.</p> <p>The Victorian planning system is often criticised for forcing new development on to main roads in order to avoid opposition by incumbent landowners living in safer and more attractive neighbourhood streets.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-30T20:47:34.118Z\">at 8.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6722961a8f086f851f56f82c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-basford-canales\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-30T20:35:51.273Z\">8.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greens announce plan for unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Greens have announced an ambitious plan to offer unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare, expected to cost about $5.9bn over the next 10 years, as it narrows in on inner-city Labor seats ahead of the next federal election.</p> <p>The minor party\u2019s flagship election policy will be launched in the Melbourne seat of Macnamara, held by Labor\u2019s <strong>Josh Burns,</strong> on Thursday and expands on its push for 1,000 free local healthcare clinics across the country.</p> <p>Under the proposal, the Greens would remove the cap of 10 subsidised mental health sessions a year as part of a person\u2019s mental health plan after it was halved from 20 in late 2022.</p> <p>It would also offer free psychologist sessions at the proposed local healthcare clinics.</p> <p>In addition to removing the cap, the Greens say they would lift the minimum Medicare rebate for clinical or registered psychologists to $150 and extend the subsidised sessions to provisional psychologists.</p> <p>According to the Parliamentary Budget Office\u2019s analysis, the changes would cost $5.9bn over 10 years in addition to the $31.7bn for 1000 new local healthcare clinics.</p> <p>The Greens say the cost would be covered under the party\u2019s big corporations tax, which would raise $514bn in government revenue over the decade.</p> <p>The party\u2019s leader, <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you\u2019re putting off mental healthcare because you can\u2019t afford it, you\u2019re not alone ... 1 in 3 big corporations pay no tax.

Before we go, let\u2019s recap the big headlines: Up to 55% of schools and childcare centres are unsafely close to main roads in some Australian suburbs, exposing children to deadly car pollution, a new report found. The Greens announced an ambitious plan to offer unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare, expected to cost about $5.9bn over the next 10 years, as it narrows in on inner-city Labor seats ahead of the next federal election. Consumers and small businesses reported more than 10,000 scams in 2023/24 \u2013 an 81% increase from the year before, according to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority\u2019s annual review. Anthony Albanese insisted he never contacted then Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce directly, nor through an intermediary, to share travel plans or seek flight upgrades, rejecting the claim in a new book that he solicited them from the airline\u2019s boss while he was transport minister. Protesters gathered outside the Woolworths Group Limited annual general meeting. The chair, Scott Perkins, was asked a question about Tim Tams in the meeting, after it was recently disclosed that shoppers in the UK pay less for the Australian-made chocolate biscuit. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began proceedings in the federal court against Optus. A woman snorkelling in the middle of the ocean off the coast of Queensland was bitten by a shark. Peter Dutton admitted his office asked mining billionaire Gina Rinehart for a lift on her private jet to a Bali bombing memorial, after claiming the government wouldn\u2019t help him get a flight on a government plane. NSW Health has issued a public health alert for blood-borne virus risk, advising clients of Fresh Cosmetic Clinic to get tested \u201cdue to infection control breaches in the clinic,\u201d as put in a media release. The Victorian government will cut more than 130 positions from its bushfire forest service and close six regional locations, acknowledging budget restraints. We will be back tomorrow to do it all again! A little weather update from Guardian Australia\u2019s economics correspondent: An Australian diplomat\u2019s partner at the centre of an alleged drunken fight and immunity storm in New Zealand has been charged and summoned to face court, AAP reports. A 37-year-old man, who has not been publicly identified, has been charged with summary offences assault, according to Wellington newspaper The Post. The offence can lead to a jail sentence of up to six months or a fine of up to $4,000. The charge follows an alleged street fight in the aftermath of Australia\u2019s Bledisloe Cup loss in the Kiwi capital in September. Police detained the man but released him after finding a diplomatic immunity card in his wallet, according to The Post. . More than 700 new ranger jobs across the country reserved for Indigenous women The addition of 1,000 new ranger jobs across the country has been welcomed by Indigenous land management groups but they say more funding is needed to support their work. Patrick O\u2019Leary, the chief executive of Country Needs People, which supports ranger groups across Australia, welcomed the $355m funding commitment. It\u2019s great to see the first stage of rollout of the new Indigenous ranger positions announced and the federal government delivering on their long-term commitment. This won\u2019t be the last funding round and there will need to be further rounds of ranger job funding following the next federal election. Up to 770 of the new ranger roles will be set aside for Indigenous women, who play an important role in protecting women\u2019s sites, preserving cultural knowledge and practices. The Victorian government will cut more than 130 positions from its bushfire forest service and close six regional locations, acknowledging budget restraints. A restructure document presented to staff on Wednesday outlined a \u201cneed to fit within a sustainable budget envelope\u201d and to \u201crefine our operating model\u201d. According to the document obtained by Guardian Australia, the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action\u2019s bushfire forest services group will be cut from 1,932 positions to 1,795. Most jobs (47) will go from the forest fire operations unit, 33 will go from the conservation regulation division, 41 from infrastructure and resources and 16 from policy and planning. Staff at Lysterfield, Wangaratta, Mount Beauty, Rainbow, Shepparton and Plenty Gorge will be transferred to other locations. Staff will only be based at Tidal River, Wonthaggi and Nelson seasonally. The restructure was influenced, in part, by the transfer of the Parks Victoria fire program to the department in July 2023. Here\u2019s how the document outlines the change: We have not reviewed our whole operation model since 2017. We need to update our operating model and adjust to changed priorities, context, technologies and ways of working. There is an emergency warning for fire in north Queensland. A large fire is burning near Warruma Swamp Road between Onyx Street and Harrison Road. It is expected to affect the Kennedy Highway very soon. The Queensland fire department is advising residents to leave immediately and warns that it will soon be too dangerous to drive. Go to the department\u2019s website for latest updates. Local shares down to round out worst month since April The local sharemarket has fallen in its final session of October to end the month lower before a pivotal week for markets, AAP has reported. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished Thursday down 20.4 points, or 0.25%, at 8,160, while the broader All Ordinaries fell 17.4 points, or 0.21%, to 8,422.1. After reaching a record high of 8,384.5 earlier in October, a two-week losing streak saw the ASX200 end the month down 1.3% \u2013 its biggest monthly fall since April. Consumer staples were the worst performers on Thursday, down 1.6%, with supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths both falling after reporting softer trading. Market-moving developments next week include the US election, interest rate decisions from the Australian, US and UK central banks and more details on China\u2019s fiscal stimulus package. The Australian dollar was buying US65.65 cents, from US65.40 cents at Wednesday\u2019s ASX close. Woolworths shareholders vote to keep selling farmed salmon despite alleged threat to Maugean skate Woolworths will continue to sell farmed salmon that allegedly threatens the existence of a rare fish after shareholders voted down a resolution to stop the practice, AAP reports. A handful of protesters outside the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Sydney on Thursday held signs accusing Woolworths of killing the Maugean skate, a prehistoric ray estimated to number between 40 to 120 individuals in the wild. Inside, the chair, Scott Perkins, assured shareholders the board took the issue very seriously: Responsible sourcing of seafood is important to our business, and underpinned by our seafood sourcing policy, our policy requires all own-branded seafood sold in Australia to be third-party certified or independently verified as ecologically responsible. The remaining wild skates live exclusively in Tasmania\u2019s Macquarie Harbour, where salmon farming has been linked to problematic drops in available oxygen. Perkins said Woolworths \u201cis not perfect\u201d but rejected allegations it misled customers by inflating prices on products before lowering them and calling it a discount. Labor accused of playing down drug reform summit Labor has been accused of trying to minimise the impact of a once-in-a-generation drug reform summit amid last-minute changes and sector concern over its handling, AAP has reported. The long-promised NSW Drug Summit begins on Friday in the regional city of Griffith, before hearings in Lismore and Sydney. All but the opening speeches in Griffith had been closed off to media until a late decision to allow in reporters to hear the co-chairs summarise each session. Lists of the 49 groups attending were also circulated to media on Thursday as the government sought to hose down complaints of some stakeholders being left out, including a Griffith homelessness organisation. Advocates want serious consideration of community drug checking, improved funding of addiction services and changes to policing. NSW woman dies after being run over in her driveway last week A woman has died in hospital a week after being run over in the state\u2019s west, NSW police have said in a statement: About 5.50pm on Wednesday (23 October 2024), emergency services were called to Agland Crescent, Orange, following reports a woman had been run over in her driveway. The 70-year-old woman was treated by NSW Ambulance before being airlifted to Liverpool hospital in a critical condition. The driver \u2013 a 73-year-old \u2013 was taken to Orange hospital for mandatory testing. On Thursday (31 October 2024), police were informed the woman had died at the hospital. A report will be prepared for the information of the coroner. Victoria\u2019s V/Line reports highest ever patronage V/Line has reported its highest ever patronage after the government capped fares on all regional train and coach services in Victoria. In its 2023-24 report, tabled in parliament today, the regional rail provider said 23.8m trips were taken in the financial year - the highest patronage ever recorded on the V/Line rail network. In his foreword, V/Line\u2019s chief executive Matt Carrick wrote: This growth has been spurred by record investment in our network and the introduction of the regional fare cap, which capped the daily price of a regional fare to the price of a metropolitan fare. Since the introduction of the regional fare cap, patronage on our service has continued to go from strength to strength, with many of our passengers taking advantage of reduced fares to travel around the state for major events and festivals, and to connect with family and friends. The annual report said its busiest day ever was 24 April 2024 \u2013 the day before the Anzac Day public holiday. The biggest increases in patronage were on the long-haul routes including the Albury, Echuca, Swan Hill and Warrnambool lines. It said by the end of the 2023-24 financial year, the fare cap had saved passengers $74m since it was introduced. Under the fare cap, which was introduced following the 2022 state election, anyone can travel anywhere in the state serviced by the V/Line without paying more than $10.60 a day \u2013 even less on weekends and for concessions. Thanks for joining me on the blog today! Handing over to Cait Kelly, who will keep you updated with the afternoon\u2019s news. ABC journalist Matt Peacock dies aged 72 Matt Peacock, the ABC journalist who uncovered the corruption and spin of the asbestos industry over three decades, has died aged 72 after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. Peacock was the author of Killer Company: James Hardie Exposed, which detailed his role in uncovering the asbestos scandal. In 2012 his dogged ABC journalism was portrayed by actor Ewan Leslie in the ABC miniseries Devil\u2019s Dust. Towards the end of his 40-year career at the ABC he was a senior reporter on 7.30 and the staff elected director on the ABC board. ABC chair Kim Williams said Peacock was dedicated to pursuing the health impacts of asbestos in different communities, defending the marginalised and giving a voice to people who needed their story to be told. \u201cOur audiences trusted him and knew him as a courageous and principled journalist who pursued those who hid from their responsibilities,\u201d Williams said. He loved the ABC and believed in its integrity and standards, and he urged his colleagues to uphold these values without compromise. Matt further represented these values as staff elected ABC Board member from 2013 where he tirelessly advocated for the role of the ABC and the importance of the journalism it delivered. After retiring from the ABC, he was just as vocal as a member of the ABC alumni. NSW Health has issued a public health alert for blood-borne virus risk, advising clients of Fresh Cosmetic Clinic to get tested \u201cdue to infection control breaches in the clinic,\u201d as put in a media release. Dr Vicky Sheppeard, director of South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Public Health Unit (SESLHD PHU), said clients who had injections or underwent any invasive procedure \u2013 such as breast implants, facial or nasal line carving \u2013 should \u201csee their GP as soon as possible and ask to be tested for blood-borne viruses\u201d. Fresh Cosmetic Clinic is no longer operating at 630 George Street, according to the statement. Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) notified SESLHD PHU of concerns relating to \u201cpotential risks to public health arising from practices at the Fresh Cosmetic Clinic\u201d. SESLHD PHU inspected the clinic on 22 October and reviewed evidence provided by the HCCC. They identified some procedures conducted the clinic \u201cmay have posed a risk to clients of exposure to blood borne viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV\u201d. Sheppeard said: Blood borne viruses can be spread between clients where injections or invasive procedures are carried out without stringent infection control. People infected with blood borne viruses may not show symptoms for many years, so it is important to be tested to see if there is silent infection. There are effective treatments for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. NSW Health and the HCCC are working to consider whether any other action needs to be taken. Dump day at Victorian parliament For those who celebrate, today is dump day at Victoria\u2019s parliament. As I wrote last year, dump day is when the government releases a bewildering number of annual reports at once, presumably so that journalists and other interested parties are rendered physically incapable of taking them all in. Today though, 131 annual reports, including dozens of reports from Victoria\u2019s health services and emergency service agencies, have been delayed until next sitting week. The opposition finance spokesperson, Jess Wilson, says it\u2019s \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. She said: With so many government agencies sinking further into debt and services continuing to deteriorate under Labor, Victorians deserve to know the exact financial position of their frontline health, emergency service, justice and environment authorities. We\u2019ll let you know what we find as we trawl through the other 173 documents that have been tabled in parliament. Peter Dutton has admitted his office asked mining billionaire Gina Rinehart for a lift on her private jet to a Bali bombing memorial, after claiming the government wouldn\u2019t help him get a flight on a government plane. Just days ago, Dutton said \u201cno\u201d when asked by a journalist if he\u2019d personally asked Rinehart for help with flights. But on Thursday he conceded his office had in fact made such a request to Australia\u2019s richest person. Dutton declared the flight on his register of interests in November 2022, disclosing flights between Rockhampton, Sydney and Mackay \u201cto attend Bali bombing memorial ... courtesy of Hancock Prospecting\u201d, Rinehart\u2019s mining company. He said on Thursday that his office was unable to secure commercial flights for that route, and that a charter jet would have cost about $40,000. Dutton claimed his office had requested a special-purpose flight, or a VIP jet available to politicians under some circumstances, but alleged the government \u201cplayed games, and they didn\u2019t offer that flight\u201d. \u201cThe cheaper option for the taxpayer was for my office to speak to Mrs Rinehart\u2019s office as to whether the plane might be available. That was at zero cost to the taxpayer,\u201d he said. Just two days ago, Dutton had shrugged off questions about that flight. According to a transcript distributed by his office on Tuesday, at a press conference Dutton was asked by a journalist: \u201cHave you ever personally asked Gina Rinehart to fly around Australia?\u201d His answer, according to the transcript, was a flat \u201cno\u201d. Dutton\u2019s answer on Thursday was that his office had spoken to Rinehart\u2019s office about flights, a distinction to the question on Tuesday about whether he\u2019d \u201cpersonally\u201d asked Rinehart herself. Australia Institute recommends five changes to anti-corruption commission The Australia Institute has recommended five changes to the National Anti-Corruption Commission, including: Bringing forward the statutory review of the Nacc Allowing public hearings whenever it is in the public interest to do so. Implementing a Whistleblower Protection Authority. Ensuring the parliamentary committee which oversees the Nacc is not controlled by the government of the day. Broadening the powers of the Nacc inspector. Bill Browne, director, Democracy &amp; Accountability Program at the Australia Institute: A review into the Nacc is already planned, but for years in the future \u2013 bringing it forward would allow the Nacc to course correct before it goes too far adrift. An early adverse finding against the Nacc commissioner by the Inspector poses a serious risk to public confidence in the anti-corruption watchdog. Expanding the scope of the Nacc inspector and allowing for a non-government majority on the committee scrutinising the Nacc would improve oversight of this important body. Canberra Liberals leader ousted by deputy after election loss Canberra Liberals leader Elizabeth Lee has been ousted by her deputy as the party engages in soul-searching while facing a quarter century in opposition. Leanne Castley has taken over the Canberra Liberals leadership and becomes the ACT opposition leader in a Halloween spill at the local Legislative Assembly. Conservative Liberal MLA Jeremy Hanson \u2013 himself a former opposition leader \u2013 announced his intention to challenge for the leadership almost immediately after it became clear his party couldn\u2019t form government. Numbers were always going to be tight in a partyroom of nine, with lines split between moderates backing Lee and conservatives backing Hanson. - Australian Associated Press A woman who was snorkelling in the middle of the ocean off the coast of Queensland has been bitten by a shark. Paramedics were called to assist a woman in her 50s who was bitten by a shark about 10 hours offshore \u2013 or 200 km \u2013 from Mackay on Wednesday afternoon. It\u2019s understood she was on a boat in the middle of the ocean and snorkelling when the attack occurred. She suffered lacerations to her lower leg. Navy vessel HMAS Warramunga was in the area and caught up with the woman\u2019s boat to provide medical assistance before sailing to Mackay Harbour. Paramedics took over when she arrived at 12.45am on Thursday and transported the woman to Mackay Base hospital in a stable condition. - Australian Associated Press Australia\u2019s export prices extend their retreat and why your cuppa is getting more costly We usually focus a lot on demand in Australia but, as a trading nation, what\u2019s happening globally has a big influence on our growth prospects. As a commodity exporter, in particular, we can mostly thank China for pushing up the value of energy and mineral exports for the past couple of decades. And since China\u2019s economy is now struggling \u2013 particularly the real estate bit that uses a lot of resources \u2013 commodity prices are generally sinking, as the ABS\u2019s September quarter data shows: Lower prices mean smaller mining profits (to the extent they remain in Australia) and smaller royalty payments (harder to avoid) flowing into government coffers. (Translation: there\u2019s little chance of a third federal budget surplus in a row) Weak Chinese demand extends to oil, which is why import prices of petroleum products are on the skids (despite Middle East tensions). The fact that electric vehicles account for half of all auto sales in China (easily the biggest car market nowadays), suggests oil demand there has peaked too. And if you\u2019re about to grab a coffee or tea, it\u2019s worth noting how much prices of those commodities are rising. Hope the charts don\u2019t put you off your lunch. Weak retail sales suggest people are holding on to their tax cuts Whether the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates soon hinges mostly on how it sees demand aligning with supply in the economy. RBA staff have repeatedly said there remains \u201cexcessive\u201d demand so, until that ends, it won\u2019t be confident that inflation will remain \u201csustainably\u201d within its 2%-3% target. As we saw with yesterday\u2019s September quarter inflation figures, the annual headline consumer price rate had dropped back to 2.8% (a tick), but core inflation was still at 3.5% (better than 4% in the June quarter, but not a tick). Today, we\u2019ve had a couple more ABS data points to consider, including retail spending. It was basically flat for September, or less than the 0.3% growth economists had tipped. From a year ago, spending was up 2.3%, and hence a shrinkage of about a 0.5 percentage point if we deduct inflation. That\u2019s telling us, it would seem, that households are saving most of their stage three tax cuts that started from 1 July (which will please the RBA). A separate ABS release on building approvals saw an uptick in September of 4.4%, reversing the revised drop of 3.9% in August. The more approvals the better, but as the above chart shows, the numbers fluctuate a lot. Victoria, by the way, easily led the number of approvals last month, countering perhaps some of the financial commentary lately about its poor economic prospects and performance. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission has commenced proceedings in the federal court against Optus, alleging the telecommunications company engaged in unconscionable conduct \u201cwhen selling telecommunications goods and services to hundreds of consumers, that they often did not want or need, and in some cases then pursuing consumers for debts resulting from these sales,\u201d as put in an ACCC statement. The ACCC said many of these customers were experiencing vulnerability or disadvantage: \u2026 such as living with a mental disability, diminished cognitive capacity or learning difficulties, being financially dependent or unemployed, or having limited financial and legal literacy. ACCC also said many impacted customers were First Nations Australian from regional and remote areas, or were people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said: This case concerns allegations of very serious conduct, as our case is that Optus sold goods to consumers experiencing vulnerability which they did not need, did not want and could not afford.\u201d We also allege that Optus\u2019 unconscionable conduct continued after management became aware of deficiencies in its systems that were being exploited by sales staff, and despite this, failed to implement fixes. An Optus spokesperson said: Optus acknowledges the ACCC\u2019s media release. We are currently reviewing the claims made by the ACCC and will respond in more detail in due course. Woolworths chair Scott Perkins has been asked a question about Tim Tams at the company\u2019s annual meeting, after it was recently disclosed that shoppers in the UK pay less for the Australian-made chocolate biscuit than those shopping at Coles and Woolworths. The shareholder also asked Perkins why Tim Tam pack sizes are sometimes smaller than they used to be, an issue known as \u201cshrinkflation\u201d. Perkins responded: \u201cWe work with our suppliers on all sorts of packaging formulations the whole time, but we don\u2019t control the price of Tim Tams overseas.\u201d Provided we are transparent, customers can make their own minds up and actually adjust their budget spend on unit price and units themselves. The ability of Australian supermarkets to charge more for locally produced products than overseas retailers has been linked to the limited competition in the local sector, dominated by Coles and Woolworths. Woolworths chair says company \u2018disappointed\u2019 with ACCC court action The Woolworths chair, Scott Perkins, told shareholders today that the supermarket chain disagrees with the consumer regulator\u2019s assessment of its promotional activity that has resulted in court action. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is suing Woolworths and rival Coles in the federal court over allegations they misled shoppers by offering \u201cillusory\u201d discounts on hundreds of common supermarket products. Perkins said in his opening address at the annual general meeting that: Woolworths Group is not perfect, and I\u2019m sure we will learn things from some of these inquiries, but we remain firmly supportive of our teams and their conduct and the customer-first culture that so strongly underpins Woolworths Group today. Specifically, we were disappointed with the ACCC\u2019s announcement to commence proceedings, and while we disagree with their assessment that the price dropped program was misleading, we are committed to working constructively with them. I want to stress that we take our responsibility on pricing very seriously. The major retailers are accused of inflating the prices of groceries for a short period, before placing them in their \u201cPrices Dropped\u201d or \u201cDown Down\u201d promotions. The regulator has said it would seek \u201ca significant penalty\u201d after the major retailers allegedly profited from the sale of tens of millions of products sold through promotions the regulator claimed breached consumer law. Coles announces plans for third automated distribution centre, to be built in Melbourne Coles has announced it will spend $880m to expand its use of automated distribution into Victoria, with its third centre to be built in Melbourne\u2019s west. The supermarket giant announced plans for the Truganina site this morning as it released quarterly results that showed sales revenue grew 2.9% across the Coles group to $10.5bn. In a statement to shareholders this morning, Coles said it was ramping up the use of its automated distribution centres (ADC) in Queensland \u2013 which opened in 2023 \u2013 and NSW \u2013 which opened earlier this year. The company said it expected construction on the Victorian ADC to begin in 2025, which would increase its overall capital expenditure by $100m to $1.3bn this financial year. In a conference call with journalists this morning, the Coles chief executive, Leah Weckert, said: We\u2019re excited for this further investment in technology to enhance product availability and improve efficiency across our supply chain. Wesfarmers to reshape e-commerce Catch business Perth-based conglomerate Wesfarmers has issued an upbeat assessment of its performance, with Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks proving to be popular destinations for households and businesses grappling with rising costs. But not all of its business units are doing so well. In 2019, Wesfarmers paid $230m for e-commerce company Catch Group, which is known for its daily deals. After some initial success, Catch\u2019s annual revenue has fallen sharply in recent years, prompting Wesfarmers to reshape the business. Wesfarmers said today that Catch\u2019s transaction value \u201ccontinues to be impacted by weaker discretionary demand and increasing competitive intensity\u201d. Plans are under way to increase the utilisation of Catch\u2019s e-commerce distribution centres to support growth and improve the efficiency of Kmart and Target home deliveries. Rising electricity use pushes up emissions even as renewable records fall Australia has a target of reducing 2005-level greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, and much of that reduction is supposed to come from the electricity sector. Unfortunately, the trend so far this year hasn\u2019t been heading in the right direction, with emissions rising in each of the first three quarters of this year (although the March quarter was only marginally higher), as we note here this morning: That we are flush with clean energy resources is obvious if you cast a glance out your window right now (renewables are providing two-thirds of the National Electricity Market, according to the OpenNEM website). As the Australian Energy Market Operator notes, the pace of construction of new solar and wind farms is picking up. Part of the problem, though, is we\u2019re not that great at harnessing the extra generation, with curtailments of output from solar farms on the rise in the September quarter. The power sector accounts for about a third of our emissions and happens to have the most competitive non-fossil fuel alternatives (compared with, say, industry and farming). We need to do a better job if we\u2019re to cut emissions at the pace implied by our targets. Protesters are gathered outside the Woolworths Group Limited annual general meeting, at the Woolworths Group support office in Sydney \u2013 here are some pics: ATO reminder to do your tax returns The Australian Taxation Office is urging Australians who haven\u2019t lodged their income tax returns yet to hurry up and lodge before 31 October \u201cto avoid potential penalties\u201d. The ATO assistant commissioner, Rob Thomson, said more than 9.4 million Australians have already lodged them \u2013 and a further 1.5 million self-preparer taxpayers are expected to need to lodge this year. Thomson said: A reminder to those who\u2019ve done the right thing and deliberately held off finalising their tax return until pre-filled information is available, now\u2019s the time to log back into the app or myTax, finalise and press lodge. For those who haven\u2019t yet started, it\u2019s not scary or complicated. People with simple affairs will find that you should be able to lodge your tax return in the time it takes to cook a frozen pizza. British band Coldplay opened their Australian tour in Melbourne last night without all four members on stage for the first time. Their bassist Guy Berryman had fallen ill, and couldn\u2019t perform. The band posted on Instagram: Tonight was the first time in our band\u2019s history that we\u2019ve played a show without all four members onstage. Guy was taken ill unexpectedly just before the show. Thank you for carrying us through it. Young man dies in multi-vehicle crash in Queensland\u2019s Bundaberg Region A fatal multi-vehicle traffic crash last night at Elliot in Queensland\u2019s Bundaberg Region last night is being investigated by the police forensic crash Unit. Police said three vehicles \u2013 a Toyota Hilux and two Yamaha motorcycles \u2013 crashed at the Cedars Road and Childers Road intersection around 6pm last night. \u201cSadly, a 20-year-old Thabeban man died at the scene, and two other men sustained minor injuries,\u201d the police statement said. Anthony Albanese insists he never contacted then Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce directly, nor through an intermediary, to share travel plans or seek flight upgrades, rejecting the claim in a new book that he solicited them from the airline\u2019s boss while he was transport minister. The prime minister\u2019s office says Albanese did not contact Joyce by phone, email, text message or any other direct means and also did not directly contact Qantas government relations executive Andrew Parker, as has been alleged in some media reports. The clarification comes after Albanese\u2019s office issued a statement on Wednesday evening saying that \u201cthe prime minister did not ever call Alan Joyce seeking an upgrade\u201d. All travel has been appropriately declared and is a matter of public record. Albanese is arguing he booked flights using Qantas\u2019 booking systems in the normal way. He has not clarified whether this included using the direct line available for members of the invitation-only Qantas Chairman\u2019s Lounge, to which most federal MPs have been gifted membership. He has also not clarified whether Parker or any other executive may have been involved in arranging upgrades in the background \u2013 only that Albanese did not directly ask Parker, Joyce or anyone representing them personally, about upgrades. In his book The Chairman\u2019s Lounge, published this week, the journalist Joe Aston alleged that Albanese had asked Joyce multiple times to upgrade his class of travel while he was serving in the transport portfolio. The government has described Aston as a former Liberal adviser who attended a Liberal party fundraiser earlier this year. Having avoided directly confirming or denying the specific allegation for several days, Albanese has now clarified his position in a conversation reported by 2GB presenter Ben Fordham and confirmed by the prime minister\u2019s office. His explanation for the delay in responding is that it has taken some days to go back through decades of records of what is understood to be more than 6,000 flights to check the circumstances of any upgraded travel. A spokesperson for Albanese said it was the Coalition which had questions to answer about travel. The only people that need to look at the rules are [shadow transport minister] Bridget McKenzie and Peter Dutton. They\u2019ve got some serious explaining to do. Shadow transport minister investigating her own history of flight upgrades The shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, is investigating her own history of flight upgrades, the Australian Financial Review reported this morning. McKenzie critiqued Anthony Albanese earlier this week after claims were made that he contacted former Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce for flight upgrades while transport minister. \u201cI don\u2019t know of another transport minister who had a hotline to the CEO of Qantas to request freebies for family holidays,\u201d McKenzie said on the Today show on Tuesday morning. McKenzie originally claimed she had received one upgrade in 2018, which she declared. The AFR asked McKenzie about two more Qantas business class upgrades to Canberra and Auckland. She responded that she is reviewing her entire travel record since being elected in 2011, the paper reports. The paper also says McKenzie is inquiring with three airlines to assist with her review. Man dies after being hit by vehicle on NSW highway A man has died after being hit by a vehicle at Harpers Hill, north-west of Maitland, last night. Emergency services were called to the New England Highway at Harpers Hill about 9.30pm last night. They found a man, believed to be in his 30s, who had been struck by a vehicle, which failed to stop, NSW police said in a statement. The man was treated by paramedics but died at the scene. He is yet to be formally identified. A crime scene has been established, which specialist police from the Crash Investigation Unit with examine. Albanese denies calling, texting or emailing Qantas staff or ex-CEO to ask for upgrade Anthony Albanese has said he has not called, texted or emailed former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce for flight upgrades, Ben Fordham said in a 2GB segment this morning. The PM on Wednesday denied ever calling Joyce for free Qantas flight upgrades during his time as transport minister and opposition leader. This morning Fordham said \u201cwe spoke to Anthony Albanese last night\u201d to \u201cfill in some gaps\u201d: The question was asked, did you ever text Alan Joyce about flight upgrades? The PM\u2019s answer: no. Did you ever email Alan Joyce about flight upgrades? The PM\u2019s answer again: no. Did you ever share with Alan Joyce any flights or travel plans without specifically asking for an upgrade? The PM replied: no. Was there someone else at Qantas you were seeking upgrades from or sharing your travel plans with? Again the PM replied: no. Anthony Albanese says he had just booked the economy flights and get an upgrade to the front of the plane, and he wasn\u2019t asking for anything. That\u2019s what he\u2019s told us. Fordham also said he asked why Albanese has \u201cwaited to long to specifically deny the allegation\u201d: The prime minister says it\u2019s taken a number of days to go through all of his records. He says he\u2019s checked his history of text messages with Alan Joyce, and there\u2019s nothing there about upgrades. He says it\u2019s taken a long time to go through emails because they go back several decades. The PM says he didn\u2019t want to come out earlier in the week and issue a complete denial in case he\u2019d missed something. That\u2019s why he ordered an internal audit of his records. The PM tells 2GB breakfast, and I quote, over 30 years, there could have been a mistake, but we\u2019ve gone through the records and there are none. Now, several days after this first blew up, Anthony Albanese says it didn\u2019t happen. No calls, no texts, no emails. BHP defends coal and carbon capture plans amid questions from skeptics Australia\u2019s largest mining company defends its plans to continue digging up coal, arguing nascent green steel technology won\u2019t be enough to meet global demand. Chair Ken MacKenzie and chief executive Mike Henry defended BHP\u2019s climate transition action plan at the company\u2019s annual general meeting yesterday, arguing controversial carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could help achieve its emissions reductions targets. Climate activists Lock the Gate Alliance protested BHP\u2019s \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and shareholders questioned how the company could meet its goal of net-zero scope-three emissions, those produced indirectly up or down the value chain, while mining coal into the next century. One shareholder asked why BHP was over-investing in a risky, unproven technology like CCUS when other commercial-scale technologies were more effective at reducing emissions. MacKenzie said, as well as exploring other ways to reduce emissions from steel production, that: \u201cYes, unapologetically, we\u2019re looking at CCUS because it\u2019s a potential solution to create near-zero blast furnace base, which is the dominant technology out there today,\u201d he said. Simon Nicholas, lead steel analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said there were no commercial-scale CCUS plants for coal-based steelmaking in the world. He told AAP: BHP is the only one that is a metallurgical coal miner. It\u2019s in their interests to convince people that CCUS is going to solve the problem and allow us to continue to using metallurgical coal and the low-grade iron ore that BHP is continuing to mine. I don\u2019t see how they\u2019re going to meet their scope-three emissions goal. You just can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re still mining coal and sending your low-grade iron ore to be processed in blast furnaces, because CCUS will never reduce emissions by enough. \u2013 via AAP Thousands of Australians have been swindled out of their money as the number of reported scams hits record highs. Consumers and small businesses reported more than 10,000 scams in 2023/24 \u2013 an 81% increase from the year before, according to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority\u2019s annual review released today While this spike in complaints was one of the most worrying trends in the past financial year, the authority\u2019s chief ombudsman David Locke noted there had been a downturn in the last quarter that had continued into the new period. \u201cThis is encouraging but definitely not a cause for complacency,\u201d he said. Anti-scam initiatives launched by the federal government and big banks appear to have helped dampen numbers. \u201cBut there is still a long way to go,\u201d Locke said. Of the more than 10,000 complaints the authority helped resolve where consumers were scammed out of money, seven in 10 were dealt with in 60 days. \u2013 via AAP Up to 55% of schools and childcare centres are unsafely close to main roads in some Australian suburbs, exposing children to deadly car pollution, according to a new report. A Climate Council report, released today, finds that about one in six schools and childcare centres across our capital cities are located within 100 metres of a busy road. That equates to more than 2,300 childcare centres and 827 schools. Children are particularly at risk from air pollution, because they inhale more air per kilogram of body weight and have faster breathing rates. The closer they are, the higher the risk. Outdoor air pollution was blamed for 4,250 premature deaths in 2021, plus a rise in asthma, heart disease and lung cancer, among other ailments. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for children globally. Air pollution costs about $6.2bn a year in Australia. The Climate Council CEO, Amanda McKenzie, said it was time to phase out \u201cpolluting cars\u201d. Let\u2019s give more people in our cities better travel options, so it\u2019s easier for more people to use shared and active means of getting around our cities - like walking, riding a bike, or taking public transport - more often. This will rapidly clean up our neighbourhoods, reduce air and climate pollution at the same time, and create healthier and safer spaces for our kids to thrive in. The suburbs of Perth City in Perth and Boroondara in Melbourne were the least healthy, with 55.3% and 51.9% of schools exposed to car pollution. The Victorian capital had the worst record of any capital city, with 24% of all schools exposed. The Victorian planning system is often criticised for forcing new development on to main roads in order to avoid opposition by incumbent landowners living in safer and more attractive neighbourhood streets. The Greens have announced an ambitious plan to offer unlimited mental health sessions on Medicare, expected to cost about $5.9bn over the next 10 years, as it narrows in on inner-city Labor seats ahead of the next federal election. The minor party\u2019s flagship election policy will be launched in the Melbourne seat of Macnamara, held by Labor\u2019s Josh Burns, on Thursday and expands on its push for 1,000 free local healthcare clinics across the country. Under the proposal, the Greens would remove the cap of 10 subsidised mental health sessions a year as part of a person\u2019s mental health plan after it was halved from 20 in late 2022. It would also offer free psychologist sessions at the proposed local healthcare clinics. In addition to removing the cap, the Greens say they would lift the minimum Medicare rebate for clinical or registered psychologists to $150 and extend the subsidised sessions to provisional psychologists. According to the Parliamentary Budget Office\u2019s analysis, the changes would cost $5.9bn over 10 years in addition to the $31.7bn for 1000 new local healthcare clinics. The Greens say the cost would be covered under the party\u2019s big corporations tax, which would raise $514bn in government revenue over the decade. The party\u2019s leader, Adam Bandt, said: If you\u2019re putting off mental healthcare because you can\u2019t afford it, you\u2019re not alone ... 1 in 3 big corporations pay no tax. The Greens will make big corporations pay their fair share of tax so you can see a psychologist for free and get unlimited mental health appointments through Medicare.\u201d The minor party is looking to pick up more seats in inner-city suburbs after its historic result at the 2022 federal election when it won four seats in the lower house. With polls suggesting Labor and the Coalition could both fall short of a parliamentary majority next election, the Greens could be key to forming a minority government. The party has said it is targeting the Labor-held electorates of Macnamara, Wills, Richmond, and Perth, and Liberal-held Sturt. Good morning, and welcome to another Guardian Australia live blog. Here are the top overnight stories: Customers who have suffered through Broken Hill\u2019s mass outages are set for a temporary reprieve on their bills as locals continue to be hit with night-time power cuts in sweltering conditions. Two power companies \u2013 Origin and EnergyAustralia \u2013 have agreed to defer bills to those who have been affected by the outages that crippled the region for the better part of a week. The inspector of the National Anti-Corruption Commission released an excoriating review of the Nacc\u2019s decision not to investigate robodebt corruption referrals, finding it to be \u201caffected by apprehended bias\u201d. The federal anti-corruption watchdog\u2019s conflict of interest is \u201creally concerning\u201d because it relates to \u201cthe person at the top\u201d, Geoffrey Watson SC, a former counsel assisting to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption, has said. New research has found people living in remote Indigenous communities are paying more than double the capital city prices for everyday groceries including flour, tasty cheese, apples and milk. And a report by the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO has checked \u201cvital signs of Australia\u2019s climate\u201d \u2013 and they show Australia becoming hotter, more dangerous, and that temperature trends will only worsen. \u201cIt is a wicked problem,\u201d Dr Karl Braganza at BoM said.

      "body": "<p>The remarkable second act of Hugh Grant\u2019s career continues \u2026 or maybe third act, if we include the earlier period in which he appeared to withdraw from the movie romcom-lead frontline to concentrate on making brilliant investments in property and contemporary art, before returning as a lethally outrageous character actor and scene-stealer. Now Grant is making his horror debut (if we don\u2019t include his appearance in Ken Russell\u2019s The Lair of the White Worm from 1988) and does it with typical insouciance and cheek, starring in a verbose and disturbing chamber piece about religion from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods; it feels as if George Bernard Shaw wanted to make a scary movie without songs inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/06/the-book-of-mormon-review-a-visionary-musical-masterpiece-genital-jokes-and-all\">The Book of Mormon</a>.</p> <p>Maturity and the chiller genre have added a certain something to Grant\u2019s habitual mannerisms, on display as ever here: the sudden mischievous grin and the wide-eyed conspiratorial \u201ceek!\u201d grimace of mock dismay. He plays a donnish and bespectacled Brit called Mr Reed living in the US in a remote, eccentrically proportioned house. Like Grant\u2019s ageing thespian Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2, this man is vain enough to keep a photo of his younger self about the place. Mr Reed has expressed a diffident interest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so the Mormons have sent round two missionaries to discuss this with him; not strapping young men as would normally be the case in non-horror-film real life, but two twentysomething women. These are the innocent Sister Paxton (Chloe East) and the marginally more worldly Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher), who in the first scene reacts with unjudging sisterly amusement when Paxton recounts her shock at accidentally watching a porn film and expressing her earnest belief that the female lead\u2019s unsimulated expression of despair proves the need to live a godly life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW1o_WvHVtQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aW1o_WvHVtQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Mr Reed is a model of avuncular kindliness and quizzical hospitality when these two appear on his doorstep; he invites them in, the door clicking firmly shut behind them, and offers blueberry pie. When Paxton and Thatcher politely inform Mr Reed that they cannot be alone with him without another woman present, he suavely offers to bring his wife in from the kitchen. Paxton and Barnes eagerly assent, but there appears to be a strange and disquieting delay in this wife actually appearing.</p> <p>As for Mr Reed, he appears oddly insistent on discussing the various forms of religion with them, his friendliness worryingly starting to wane as the steely glint behind his glasses increases. With various amusing supporting materials from popular culture, Mr Reed discourses on belief systems as iterations or theme-variations on earlier pagan or mythic forms and gets testy and thin-lipped when Barnes contradicts him. With hooded eyes, he asks these impeccably mannered young women if they still believe that his wife really does exist in another room, as he has assured them, and what is it precisely that makes them believe that? A need to survive, perhaps, in this world as well as the next? Heretic is gruesome and bizarre and preposterous, the third aspect made palatable by Grant\u2019s dapper performance of evil.</p> <p>\u2022 Heretic is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 November and Australian cinemas from 8 November</p>",

      "bodyText": "The remarkable second act of Hugh Grant\u2019s career continues \u2026 or maybe third act, if we include the earlier period in which he appeared to withdraw from the movie romcom-lead frontline to concentrate on making brilliant investments in property and contemporary art, before returning as a lethally outrageous character actor and scene-stealer. Now Grant is making his horror debut (if we don\u2019t include his appearance in Ken Russell\u2019s The Lair of the White Worm from 1988) and does it with typical insouciance and cheek, starring in a verbose and disturbing chamber piece about religion from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods; it feels as if George Bernard Shaw wanted to make a scary movie without songs inspired by The Book of Mormon. Maturity and the chiller genre have added a certain something to Grant\u2019s habitual mannerisms, on display as ever here: the sudden mischievous grin and the wide-eyed conspiratorial \u201ceek!\u201d grimace of mock dismay. He plays a donnish and bespectacled Brit called Mr Reed living in the US in a remote, eccentrically proportioned house. Like Grant\u2019s ageing thespian Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2, this man is vain enough to keep a photo of his younger self about the place. Mr Reed has expressed a diffident interest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so the Mormons have sent round two missionaries to discuss this with him; not strapping young men as would normally be the case in non-horror-film real life, but two twentysomething women. These are the innocent Sister Paxton (Chloe East) and the marginally more worldly Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher), who in the first scene reacts with unjudging sisterly amusement when Paxton recounts her shock at accidentally watching a porn film and expressing her earnest belief that the female lead\u2019s unsimulated expression of despair proves the need to live a godly life. Mr Reed is a model of avuncular kindliness and quizzical hospitality when these two appear on his doorstep; he invites them in, the door clicking firmly shut behind them, and offers blueberry pie. When Paxton and Thatcher politely inform Mr Reed that they cannot be alone with him without another woman present, he suavely offers to bring his wife in from the kitchen. Paxton and Barnes eagerly assent, but there appears to be a strange and disquieting delay in this wife actually appearing. As for Mr Reed, he appears oddly insistent on discussing the various forms of religion with them, his friendliness worryingly starting to wane as the steely glint behind his glasses increases. With various amusing supporting materials from popular culture, Mr Reed discourses on belief systems as iterations or theme-variations on earlier pagan or mythic forms and gets testy and thin-lipped when Barnes contradicts him. With hooded eyes, he asks these impeccably mannered young women if they still believe that his wife really does exist in another room, as he has assured them, and what is it precisely that makes them believe that? A need to survive, perhaps, in this world as well as the next? Heretic is gruesome and bizarre and preposterous, the third aspect made palatable by Grant\u2019s dapper performance of evil. \u2022 Heretic is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 November and Australian cinemas from 8 November",

Jasper Jolly and Peter Walker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-key-points-at-a-glance\">set out the key points here</a>.</p> <p>Some of the big-ticket items that we knew were coming: an increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, worth \u00a325bn a year by the end of this parliament; an increase in the higher rate of capital gains tax from 20% to 24%; VAT on private school fees; a new rule allowing borrowing of up to \u00a350bn over the next five years to invest in major infrastructure; a 6.7% rise in the minimum wage; and a \u00a322.6bn increase to the NHS budget.</p> <p>The biggest surprise was that Reeves decided not to extend the Conservatives\u2019 freeze on tax bands, which has meant that many people pay a higher rate of tax on some of what they earn if their salaries merely rise in line with inflation.

Two-thirds of that will go on current spending, and one-third on capital spending. Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that the real-terms growth in public service funding of 1.5% a year \u201cisn\u2019t particularly generous\u201d, and the plans amounted to \u201ca short-term cash injection, with a promise of belt-tightening in the future\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the OBR says tax receipts will increase by \u00a336.2bn a year from next year; while that is a record as a share of GDP, 38%, John Burn-Murdoch of the FT <a href=\"https://x.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1851658431607758872\">points out</a> that the same thing is true almost everywhere. Borrowing will be up by \u00a332.3bn. Public investment will average 2.6% of GDP over the course of the parliament, against 1.7% under the plans set out by Jeremy Hunt in the spring.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The impact: a growth spurt that may tail off</strong></p> <p>The Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-calculator-better-or-worse-off\">a budget calculator</a> that will help you figure out if you will be better or worse off as a result of the changes announced by Reeves. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-tax-benefits-pensions\">here are some case studies</a> that illustrate how they will affect different groups. You can see a reasonably positive response from voters in Reeves\u2019 constituency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/theyve-won-me-over-chancellors-constituents-welcome-budget\">here</a>, and a more negative view from employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/bosses-reeves-tax-rises-employers-national-insurance-contributions\">here</a>.</p> <p>The Treasury\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/672156834da1c0d41942a8c9/Impact_on_households.pdf\">impact assessment</a> (pdf) suggests that the measures announced by Reeves will have the greatest direct benefit for the poorest, and cost the richest the most: when benefits from public services are taken into account, the bottom decile of income distribution will see a 3.5% improvement against their net income, while the top decile will see a 0.5% reduction.</p> <p>The OBR forecasts slightly stronger growth over the next couple of years, largely because the budget is expected to stimulate demand \u2013 but it says that growth will then tail off over the last three years of the current parliament, and actually slow against previous expectations. The size of the economy would be \u201clargely unchanged\u201d in five years\u2019 time, it adds. Such forecasts are usually a bit off \u2013 but if this one proves broadly correct, it would leave Labour a long way off its promise of \u201cthe highest sustained growth in the G7\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The Tories\u2019 reaction: \u2018Broken promise after broken promise\u2019</strong></p> <p>In his last major appearance at the dispatch box, Rishi Sunak had two main messages: Labour has broken its pledge not to raise taxes on working people, and the fallout is Reeves and Starmer\u2019s responsibility, not his and Hunt\u2019s. He said the budget contained \u201cbroken promise after broken promise\u201d, and amounted to a betrayal of Starmer\u2019s pledge to restore trust to British politics.</p> <p>He also hotly contested Reeves\u2019s characterisation of a dire economic inheritance, arguing that the chancellor had inherited lower borrowing than other major economies and the second-lowest debt in the G7. \u201cLabour\u2019s claims about their inheritance are purely ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are her choices, so stop blaming everyone else and take responsibility for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBroken promises\u201d appeared to be the take that <a href=\"https://x.com/NJ_Timothy/status/1851617744959008841\">many other Tory MPs</a> wanted to hammer home on social media. Meanwhile, Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick called it \u201cthe biggest heist in modern history\u201d, and his rival Kemi Badenoch said it was a plan that amounted to \u201chigher taxes, more borrowing, and lower growth\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The markets\u2019 reaction: cost of government borrowing increases</strong></p> <p>When Reeves started to speak, the cost of government borrowing on international markets fell a little. But as she set out her plans, the 10-year gilt yield \u2013 a measure of how much the exchequer pays on its debt \u2013 climbed to 4.39%, the highest it has been in five months.</p> <p>That impact was to be expected, and can be understood as the natural price of seeking to borrow more to fund investment. And it was somewhat blunted by the government\u2019s efforts to prepare the ground for its plans by pre-briefing them so extensively.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/economics/article/kwarteng-test-passed-ministers-are-wise-to-be-cautious-b9rcrrkfq\">In the Times</a> (\u00a3), Panmure Liberium chief economist Simon French concluded that ultimately, the \u201cinitial reaction of financial markets will trigger huge sighs of relief in the Treasury and at the Bank of England\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-goes-back-to-the-future-with-a-tax-and-spend-budget\">characterised the change to borrowing costs</a> as \u201cmodest\u201d and said that they did not amount to a major threat.</p> <p>The impact is not on the scale seen after Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 mini-budget, a cost memorably described as the \u201cmoron premium\u201d, perhaps because investors are broadly convinced that Reeves will stick to her fiscal rules and the UK will be good for the money. But it does mean that the pressure on those investments to deliver long-term economic benefits is even higher.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The left\u2019s reaction: some progress, but disappointment</strong></p> <p>While there was a broad welcome on the left for the chancellor\u2019s decision to borrow more to fund investment, many criticised the government for not going far enough on this or a range of other changes.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/30/budget-britain-rachel-reeves-labour-tax-public-services-panel\">this panel of reaction</a>, the political economist Sahil Dutta argues that \u201cdespite progress on public investment, Labour\u2019s budget still reflects a failed status quo\u201d. He says that Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules will funnel money towards the developers who will get the infrastructure contracts, while the workers who are critical to sectors like social care and the NHS are undervalued.</p> <p>Hannah Peaker, director of policy at the New Economics Foundation, similarly applauded the change on borrowing but said Reeves had not gone far enough. \u201cIn one sense, I welcome her courage in challenging and changing the fiscal rules that have been holding us back,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cOn the other hand, I wish she\u2019d had more courage in challenging the very wealthiest in our society to pay their fair share \u2026 It was a real missed opportunity to do that.\u201d</p> <p>And on ITV\u2019s Peston last night, former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that \u201cThey\u2019ve thought, we can tackle the health service, people will forgive us in terms of the tax rises that have taken place, and I can understand that political gamble.

It was Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years; it was the first budget ever to be delivered by a female chancellor; and, as a share of GDP, it takes taxes to their highest level since comparable records began.

And the hostile reaction from the rightwing papers this morning is only a preview of how difficult the political climate will continue to be. Today\u2019s newsletter explains the key policies, the impact and the reaction. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK news | Keir Starmer has warned Tory leadership contenders Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch against undermining the police investigation into the Southport attack. Jenrick said information about the attack was \u201cconcealed\u201d, while Badenoch said that the government and police \u201chave questions to answer\u201d. Spain | At least 95 people were dead after torrential rains in southern and eastern Spain on Tuesday brought flash floods that raged through towns and cut off roads and railway lines.

India | The Canadian government has publicly alleged that India\u2019s home affairs minister, Amit Shah \u2013 closest political ally of the prime minister, Narendra Modi \u2013 was behind a recent series of plots to murder and intimidate Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. US election | Donald Trump dressed as a sanitation worker and appeared in the cab of a garbage truck in Wisconsin as he sought to capitalise on a gaffe by Joe Biden. Biden appeared to call Trump supporters \u201cgarbage\u201d but later said he was referring to a comedian\u2019s \u201chateful rhetoric\u201d about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally. In depth: \u2018We must restore economic stability\u2019 At 77 minutes, Reeves\u2019s budget was longer than any in the last 14 years, and longer than the last one delivered by a Labour chancellor, Alistair Darling. Her top line was this: \u201cThe only way to improve living standards, and the only way to drive economic growth is to invest, invest, invest \u2026 we must restore economic stability and turn the page on the last 14 years.\u201d Here\u2019s how she tried to do it, and how it was received. *** The detail: big tickets, little rabbits Among the well-trailed major changes that formed the brunt of the budget, there were a couple of smaller surprises as well \u2013 maybe not quite rabbits, but at least a couple of voles with which to amaze voters. Jasper Jolly and Peter Walker set out the key points here. Some of the big-ticket items that we knew were coming: an increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions, worth \u00a325bn a year by the end of this parliament; an increase in the higher rate of capital gains tax from 20% to 24%; VAT on private school fees; a new rule allowing borrowing of up to \u00a350bn over the next five years to invest in major infrastructure; a 6.7% rise in the minimum wage; and a \u00a322.6bn increase to the NHS budget. The biggest surprise was that Reeves decided not to extend the Conservatives\u2019 freeze on tax bands, which has meant that many people pay a higher rate of tax on some of what they earn if their salaries merely rise in line with inflation. She did, however, maintain the freeze on fuel duty \u2013 when giant cockroaches rule the earth in the year 6000, they will still be paying 52.95p a litre \u2013 and reduced duty on draught alcoholic drinks, meaning, as she said, \u201ca penny off a pint in the pub\u201d. Taken together, the OBR says, the budget increases spending by \u00a370bn a year. Two-thirds of that will go on current spending, and one-third on capital spending. Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that the real-terms growth in public service funding of 1.5% a year \u201cisn\u2019t particularly generous\u201d, and the plans amounted to \u201ca short-term cash injection, with a promise of belt-tightening in the future\u201d. Meanwhile, the OBR says tax receipts will increase by \u00a336.2bn a year from next year; while that is a record as a share of GDP, 38%, John Burn-Murdoch of the FT points out that the same thing is true almost everywhere. Borrowing will be up by \u00a332.3bn. Public investment will average 2.6% of GDP over the course of the parliament, against 1.7% under the plans set out by Jeremy Hunt in the spring. *** The impact: a growth spurt that may tail off The Guardian has a budget calculator that will help you figure out if you will be better or worse off as a result of the changes announced by Reeves. And here are some case studies that illustrate how they will affect different groups. You can see a reasonably positive response from voters in Reeves\u2019 constituency here, and a more negative view from employers here. The Treasury\u2019s impact assessment (pdf) suggests that the measures announced by Reeves will have the greatest direct benefit for the poorest, and cost the richest the most: when benefits from public services are taken into account, the bottom decile of income distribution will see a 3.5% improvement against their net income, while the top decile will see a 0.5% reduction. The OBR forecasts slightly stronger growth over the next couple of years, largely because the budget is expected to stimulate demand \u2013 but it says that growth will then tail off over the last three years of the current parliament, and actually slow against previous expectations. The size of the economy would be \u201clargely unchanged\u201d in five years\u2019 time, it adds. Such forecasts are usually a bit off \u2013 but if this one proves broadly correct, it would leave Labour a long way off its promise of \u201cthe highest sustained growth in the G7\u201d. *** The Tories\u2019 reaction: \u2018Broken promise after broken promise\u2019 In his last major appearance at the dispatch box, Rishi Sunak had two main messages: Labour has broken its pledge not to raise taxes on working people, and the fallout is Reeves and Starmer\u2019s responsibility, not his and Hunt\u2019s. He said the budget contained \u201cbroken promise after broken promise\u201d, and amounted to a betrayal of Starmer\u2019s pledge to restore trust to British politics. He also hotly contested Reeves\u2019s characterisation of a dire economic inheritance, arguing that the chancellor had inherited lower borrowing than other major economies and the second-lowest debt in the G7. \u201cLabour\u2019s claims about their inheritance are purely ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are her choices, so stop blaming everyone else and take responsibility for them.\u201d \u201cBroken promises\u201d appeared to be the take that many other Tory MPs wanted to hammer home on social media. Meanwhile, Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick called it \u201cthe biggest heist in modern history\u201d, and his rival Kemi Badenoch said it was a plan that amounted to \u201chigher taxes, more borrowing, and lower growth\u201d. *** The markets\u2019 reaction: cost of government borrowing increases When Reeves started to speak, the cost of government borrowing on international markets fell a little. But as she set out her plans, the 10-year gilt yield \u2013 a measure of how much the exchequer pays on its debt \u2013 climbed to 4.39%, the highest it has been in five months. That impact was to be expected, and can be understood as the natural price of seeking to borrow more to fund investment. And it was somewhat blunted by the government\u2019s efforts to prepare the ground for its plans by pre-briefing them so extensively. In the Times (\u00a3), Panmure Liberium chief economist Simon French concluded that ultimately, the \u201cinitial reaction of financial markets will trigger huge sighs of relief in the Treasury and at the Bank of England\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott characterised the change to borrowing costs as \u201cmodest\u201d and said that they did not amount to a major threat. The impact is not on the scale seen after Liz Truss\u2019s 2022 mini-budget, a cost memorably described as the \u201cmoron premium\u201d, perhaps because investors are broadly convinced that Reeves will stick to her fiscal rules and the UK will be good for the money. But it does mean that the pressure on those investments to deliver long-term economic benefits is even higher. *** The left\u2019s reaction: some progress, but disappointment While there was a broad welcome on the left for the chancellor\u2019s decision to borrow more to fund investment, many criticised the government for not going far enough on this or a range of other changes. In this panel of reaction, the political economist Sahil Dutta argues that \u201cdespite progress on public investment, Labour\u2019s budget still reflects a failed status quo\u201d. He says that Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules will funnel money towards the developers who will get the infrastructure contracts, while the workers who are critical to sectors like social care and the NHS are undervalued. Hannah Peaker, director of policy at the New Economics Foundation, similarly applauded the change on borrowing but said Reeves had not gone far enough. \u201cIn one sense, I welcome her courage in challenging and changing the fiscal rules that have been holding us back,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cOn the other hand, I wish she\u2019d had more courage in challenging the very wealthiest in our society to pay their fair share \u2026 It was a real missed opportunity to do that.\u201d And on ITV\u2019s Peston last night, former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that \u201cThey\u2019ve thought, we can tackle the health service, people will forgive us in terms of the tax rises that have taken place, and I can understand that political gamble. But there\u2019s so much more.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Of the hundreds of thousands of stories of grief in Gaza, Wael al Dahdouh\u2019s is one of the best-known. Nesrine Malik\u2019s profile for the long read of the Al Jazeera journalist, who lost his wife and two children to an Israeli airstrike, is a devastating microcosm of the war\u2019s impact: as she writes of a family video, \u201ca record of all that was lost\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A teenager who broke into the home of Emma Lovell, alongside another teen who stabbed her to death, has been found not guilty of murder in a case that shocked Queensland in December 2022. In a Brisbane court on Thursday, the now 18-year-old \u2013 who cannot be named for legal reasons as he was 17 on the night Lovell was killed \u2013 was also found not guilty of manslaughter and not guilty of malicious act with intent. He was found guilty of one count of burglary by break in the night in company, and one count of assault occasioning bodily harm in company. Lovell was murdered by the teenager\u2019s companion on the lawn outside her North Lakes home, north of Brisbane\u2019s CBD, on 27 December 2022. Her husband, Lee Lovell, was also stabbed twice in the back and kicked in the head in the attempted robbery. The teenager is being remanded in custody while a pre-sentencing report is prepared by the Queensland youth justice department and will be sentenced by Justice Michael Copley on 4 December. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Last month he pleaded not guilty to four charges, including murder and assault occasioning bodily harm. Due to the high-profile nature of the case, the murder trial was held before a judge rather than a jury, with Justice Copley alone determining the man\u2019s fate. In May, his partner in the home invasion was found guilty and sentenced to 14 years in prison for the \u201cparticularly heinous\u201d murder of Emma Lovell in Brisbane in 2022. He was 17 at the time of the murder. In court on Thursday the accused teen, dressed in a pressed white button-up shirt and grey pants, did not speak and kept his emotions contained as the judge delivered his verdict. Lee Lovell, who was largely composed throughout last month\u2019s trial, was visibly distressed after the verdict, which he said robbed his late wife of justice. \u201cYou can\u2019t appeal a judge-only trial, so I\u2019ve just got to suck it up,\u201d he told reporters outside court. Lovell, who testified and was present throughout the trial, was asked if he would return for the sentencing. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m slightly wasting my time coming along for a burglary charge,\u201d he said. Lovell said families were \u201cthe ones having to live with this afterwards and they [perpetrators of crime] get to carry on doing whatever they are doing\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones with the life sentence,\u201d he said. No reasons have yet been given for the latest verdict. However, during the trial last month, the defence barrister Laura Reece argued that CCTV footage did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that her client knew his companion was carrying a knife throughout the evening in which they roamed the streets of Brisbane\u2019s outer northern suburbs with at least two others. The crown prosecutor David Nardone himself had conceded a murder conviction rested entirely upon the fact that the accused knew his companion was armed. He told the court that CCTV footage showed it was \u201cunavoidable\u201d that the accused saw his companion\u2019s blade and, given the two teenagers had already formed a common purpose to steal from the Lovell home, he was therefore \u201cjointly liable for possession of the knife\u201d. But Reece argued during the trial that the infrared footage used as evidence against her client did not show him looking in the direction of the blade held by his companion and did not accurately reflect the gloom. She also argued that, even if he did know his companion was armed, audio and video captured of the violent melee showed her client exhorting him to stop his violence and flee the scene.",

In white letters against a bright red background, on the cover of his election manifesto, and in speech after speech. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/30/budget-britain-rachel-reeves-labour-tax-public-services-panel\">Yesterday\u2019s budget</a> was his once-in-a-government chance to show voters what he means by that, a heavy load borne by Rachel Reeves. Not only will she set the government\u2019s direction for the next five years; she has to refresh an administration not even four months old but already flagging under petty scandal, office politics and dwindling popularity.</p> <p>Her budget does deliver some welcome change, but it is no gamechanger. It stops our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/budget-2024-key-points-at-a-glance\">hospitals and schools from collapsing</a>, but the sums for local councils and other less-loved public services will not be enough to help them rebuild. It taxes wealth a little more, but not enough to upset big asset owners. It certainly does not reset the relationship between how wealth and work is taxed, as Starmer and Reeves were promising until quite recently.</p> <p>The best news is the extra money; most of the bad news is how some of it will be raised. Billions will be pumped into the NHS and schools, and fast. Day to day spending for public services over the next couple of years will shoot up. After that, the investment tails off \u2013 so much so that Reeves seems to be leaving herself room for another cash injection around 2027. In January, my colleague Denis Campbell reported that Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex, had suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/26/crumbling-english-hospitals-cause-over-100-patient-care-disruptions-week\">40 leaks of raw sewage</a> in recent years, which left staff \u201cnauseous and too sick to work\u201d. That is the scale of the repair job to be done in just one hospital in one Labour new town. Our public services will need extra billions for years to come.</p> <p>Yet to bring in this money, Starmer and Reeves are also exposing their government to two great dangers. The first is trust: they have just unveiled the biggest tax-raising budget since Norman Lamont in 1993, after an entire election where they vowed that the only new taxes Labour would levy were the footling sums at the back of its manifesto. The fault is entirely theirs, for throwing out promises that they knew they\u2019d have to break. Some of us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/25/election-pm-change-politics-keir-starmer-rishi-sunak\">pointed out</a> that relying on an unprecedented surge of growth to pay the bills was simply not plausible. Far better to level with the public and argue that your parents getting seen by doctors or your kids getting taught in good schools requires income that ultimately means higher taxes. It is an argument that Gordon Brown made, with patience and skill, to pump money into the NHS, and it would have been better and simpler for Reeves and Starmer to have argued their case, rather than dream up stealth tax rises.</p> <p>One immediate consequence is that the national insurance paid by employers will rise, with the <a href=\"https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/OBR_Economic_and_fiscal_outlook_Oct_2024.pdf\">Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicting</a> that about 75% of the cost of this will be passed on to workers as their pay is held down. Among those suffering this pay squeeze will be the teachers at your local nursery and the staff at the care home around the corner. All because Labour strategists were not willing to argue their case.</p> <p>For years now, the hard right \u2013 the dark money thinktanks, the Farage-ists, GB News and TalkTV \u2013 have kindled suspicions that all politicians are self-serving liars, who will say one thing before a poll and pick your pockets directly after.

      "body": "<p>UK lenders are scrambling to assess the fallout of last week\u2019s landmark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/25/consumers-win-uk-car-finance-case-could-billions-compensation\">court of appeal ruling on car finance</a>.</p> <p>The judgment on \u201csecret\u201d commission payments could have far-reaching implications for lenders, beyond those covered by an continuing investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The consumer champion Martin Lewis suggests the row \u201chas the potential to shake up more than just car finance\u201d.</p> <p>So what has happened and could you be entitled to a payout?</p>  <h2>How did we get here?</h2>  <p>In January, the FCA launched an investigation into discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) on car loans issued between 2007 and 2021.</p> <p>The practice meant car dealerships and brokers had the power to set interest rates on car loans, and earn higher commission along the way. DCAs were<a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps20-8-motor-finance-discretionary-commission-models-and-consumer-credit-commission-disclosure\"> eventually banned</a> by the FCA in 2021 because of concerns they were incentivising dealers to charge higher interest rates.</p> <p>The City regulator\u2019s investigation could ultimately lead to a multibillion-pound compensation scheme funded by the lenders that sat behind the arrangements. The FCA has already warned car lenders to <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-statement-regarding-motor-finance-firms-financial-resources\">hold back cash for potential payouts</a>, which some analysts believe could add up to \u00a38bn-\u00a313bn.</p> <p>The watchdog had been due to issue its decision in September, but pushed its deadline to the end of May 2025 after lenders struggled to provide all the data in time. But that delay also gave it time to judge the outcome of a test case against specialist lenders Close Brothers and FirstRand Bank.</p> <h2>What happened last week?</h2>  <p>On Friday, the court of appeal ruled on that test case, upholding a decision that it was unlawful for the two lenders to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/30/fleecing-the-man-off-the-street-car-dealers-investigated-over-high-interest-rates\">paid a \u201csecret\u201d commission to car dealers</a> without borrowers\u2019 knowledge.</p> <p>Judges said consumers needed to know all the material facts that could affect their borrowing decision, including the total commission to car dealers and how it was calculated, in order to be able to consent to the loan.</p> <p>Some lawyers have speculated that customers could collectively receive billions of pounds in compensation as a result and in some cases have their car loan written off or rescinded.</p> <p>It could also spark complaints and payouts about other types of commission payments related to motor finance and potentially other loans and financial products.</p> <p>The FCA has said it was carefully considering the court of appeal decision, which both Close Brothers and FirstRand plan to challenge in the supreme court.</p> <h2>How have UK lenders reacted? </h2>  <p>They have been racing to determine what it means for their businesses and how much they may have to pay out. Some say it sets a much higher bar for disclosing commission arrangements, and securing customers\u2019 consent, than they previously thought necessary under FCA rules.</p> <p>Close Brothers \u2013 which had already cancelled its dividend and launched plans to strengthen its balance sheet by \u00a3400m in response to the FCA investigation \u2013 has halted new car loans since the ruling, which has sent its shares plunging by 37% since Friday.</p> <p>Santander UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/29/santander-uk-delays-results-car-loan-ruling-bank\">delayed the release </a>of its third-quarter results on Tuesday at the last minute, while Lloyds Banking Group, which is the most exposed among high street banks, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/30/lloyds-suspends-commission-payments-after-seismic-ruling-on-uk-car-finance\">scrapped commission payments</a> for new loans across its \u00a315bn Black Horse motor finance arm.</p> <p>Lloyds has already put aside \u00a3450m for potential payouts, but analysts at RBC Capital suggest it will need to put aside \u00a32.5bn to \u00a33.9bn in the worst case scenario. Its shares are down 13% since Friday.</p> <p>The ruling could end up costing Santander UK \u00a31.1bn, while Barclays \u2013 which ditched its motor finance business in 2019 \u2013 may end up taking a \u00a3357m hit.

      "bodyText": "UK lenders are scrambling to assess the fallout of last week\u2019s landmark court of appeal ruling on car finance. The judgment on \u201csecret\u201d commission payments could have far-reaching implications for lenders, beyond those covered by an continuing investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The consumer champion Martin Lewis suggests the row \u201chas the potential to shake up more than just car finance\u201d. So what has happened and could you be entitled to a payout? How did we get here? In January, the FCA launched an investigation into discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) on car loans issued between 2007 and 2021. The practice meant car dealerships and brokers had the power to set interest rates on car loans, and earn higher commission along the way. DCAs were eventually banned by the FCA in 2021 because of concerns they were incentivising dealers to charge higher interest rates. The City regulator\u2019s investigation could ultimately lead to a multibillion-pound compensation scheme funded by the lenders that sat behind the arrangements. The FCA has already warned car lenders to hold back cash for potential payouts, which some analysts believe could add up to \u00a38bn-\u00a313bn. The watchdog had been due to issue its decision in September, but pushed its deadline to the end of May 2025 after lenders struggled to provide all the data in time. But that delay also gave it time to judge the outcome of a test case against specialist lenders Close Brothers and FirstRand Bank. What happened last week? On Friday, the court of appeal ruled on that test case, upholding a decision that it was unlawful for the two lenders to have paid a \u201csecret\u201d commission to car dealers without borrowers\u2019 knowledge. Judges said consumers needed to know all the material facts that could affect their borrowing decision, including the total commission to car dealers and how it was calculated, in order to be able to consent to the loan. Some lawyers have speculated that customers could collectively receive billions of pounds in compensation as a result and in some cases have their car loan written off or rescinded. It could also spark complaints and payouts about other types of commission payments related to motor finance and potentially other loans and financial products. The FCA has said it was carefully considering the court of appeal decision, which both Close Brothers and FirstRand plan to challenge in the supreme court. How have UK lenders reacted? They have been racing to determine what it means for their businesses and how much they may have to pay out. Some say it sets a much higher bar for disclosing commission arrangements, and securing customers\u2019 consent, than they previously thought necessary under FCA rules. Close Brothers \u2013 which had already cancelled its dividend and launched plans to strengthen its balance sheet by \u00a3400m in response to the FCA investigation \u2013 has halted new car loans since the ruling, which has sent its shares plunging by 37% since Friday. Santander UK delayed the release of its third-quarter results on Tuesday at the last minute, while Lloyds Banking Group, which is the most exposed among high street banks, has scrapped commission payments for new loans across its \u00a315bn Black Horse motor finance arm. Lloyds has already put aside \u00a3450m for potential payouts, but analysts at RBC Capital suggest it will need to put aside \u00a32.5bn to \u00a33.9bn in the worst case scenario. Its shares are down 13% since Friday. The ruling could end up costing Santander UK \u00a31.1bn, while Barclays \u2013 which ditched its motor finance business in 2019 \u2013 may end up taking a \u00a3357m hit. Analysts estimate that the much-smaller Close Brothers could suffer a \u00a3252m blow. Who could be in line for compensation? Potentially millions of people. Across the UK, an estimated 80% to 90% of new cars, and an increasing number of used vehicles, are bought with finance, and lenders issued \u00a316.9bn in car loans last year. In terms of the FCA investigation, you could be entitled to a payout if you used motor finance to buy a new or secondhand motor vehicle \u2013 for example, a car, van, campervan or motorbike \u2013 between 6 April 2007 and 28 January 2021, and the finance provider and car dealer used a DCA. When we say motor finance, we typically mean personal contract purchase plans and hire purchase. DCAs were by far the most common commission arrangement before they were banned in 2021, and were included in three-quarters of all loans between 2007 and 2020. In theory, those who signed up to multiple car finance agreements during the 14 years will be potentially eligible for several payouts. Broadly speaking, this does not apply if you took out your car finance on or after 28 January 2021, or you used a car leasing agreement such as personal contract hire, or another type of commission arrangement was used, such as flat fee or fixed rate. However, the latest court case stands to broaden the scope of payouts beyond loans that involved DCAs, and potentially beyond motor finance. \u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance all commissions may be looked at,\u201d Lewis has said. \u201cI\u2019ve already asked the FCA to ensure that, if that\u2019s the case, you wouldn\u2019t be prevented from complaining again.\u201d How much could I get, and when? As to how much, it\u2019s too soon to say and everyone\u2019s circumstances are different, but for car finance claims, probably more than \u00a31,000 on average. Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, previously predicted the FCA would ultimately either set up a compensation scheme where it ordered all companies to pay redress to all affected customers, even if they had not complained, or publish rules under which companies must pay out redress to complainants based on a set formula. The regulator has indicated that for a typical \u00a310,000, four-year car finance deal where a DCA was used, a customer might have paid \u00a31,100 too much interest. However, there could be a requirement for firms to pay interest on top of that. Lots of consumers submitting complaints about their car finance are using claims management firms and law firms to do the legwork. One such firm, LawPlus Solicitors, said its clients \u201care achieving compensation awards of \u00a31,500 on average per car finance agreement\u201d, while another, Bott and Co Solicitors, said the average payout for mis-sold car finance was estimated at about \u00a31,600. As for timings, some people have already received redress: there have been Financial Ombudsman Service rulings in this area, while some individuals have taken their cases to court and won. In terms of any official compensation scheme, if the FCA decides to put one in place, it looks likely to start making payments to people in 2026. In terms of the wider court ruling, and other loans with commission arrangements, lenders are waiting for further FCA guidance. Analysts at Jefferies said that, given the likely supreme court case, \u201ca final ruling may not emerge until the second half of next year\u201d. What should I do if I think I\u2019m owed money? You can act now or wait to see how things pan out. The FCA has extended the period of time motor finance firms can deal with DCA complaints while the regulator investigates, but MoneySavingExpert believes it is worth logging a complaint now to help reduce the risk of being ruled out if a future time limit is imposed. It has a tool on its site where you answer a few questions and it creates a template email to send to the relevant lender.

Birmingham city council is the latest local authority considering a ban on cycling in pedestrian-only parts of the city centre, prompting a backlash from some residents who fear it could block key routes for commuters and shoppers and push cyclists on to congested roads. A report to the council states that a rise in food and parcel couriers moving around the city \u201cat speed and without care for other pedestrians\u201d has created a \u201cdangerous combination\u201d of cyclists and pedestrians in areas with high footfall. It recommended adding cycling to the city\u2019s public spaces protection order (PSPO), which aims to tackle antisocial behaviour by banning large gatherings, street drinking, graffiti and loud noise in the city centre, and issuing fines to those who do not comply. Active travel campaigners who oppose the proposal say they understand there is an issue with a growing number of delivery drivers using powerful e-bikes in the city centre to pick up orders. \u201cIf you have someone zipping by at 20mph on one of those things, it does create a risk,\u201d said Mat MacDonald, the chair of the campaign group Better Streets for Birmingham. \u201cBut there is already ample legislation to deal with that.

He is considered the first person to portray Africans and Afro-descendants positively in the country\u2019s historiography.</p>    <p>But we also wanted to highlight how the choices made by white individuals \u2013 particularly wealthy people \u2013 continue to prevent descendants of those enslaved from accessing the wealth they created and still generate.</p> <p>\u201cRacism isn\u2019t like some kind of gas floating in the atmosphere; it\u2019s a human construct, just like slavery,\u201d said the historian and writer Yna\u00ea Lopes dos Santos in an interview for the book. \u201cSlavery endured for so long because Brazil\u2019s political elite was made up of enslavers.\u201d </p> <p>Until slavery was abolished in 1888 \u2013 the last country in the Americas to do so \u2013 state and federal laws had denied black people, even those who were free, access to schools. This resulted in a disproportionate rate of illiteracy even decades after abolition.</p> <p>One of the most significant remnants of the slaveholding mentality still prevalent in the country is the fact that almost every middle- or upper-class family employs at least one domestic worker \u2013 predominantly women and Black individuals who generally work excessive hours for low pay.</p> <p>In the 19th century, enslaved domestic women used to endure shifts of 12-15 hours a day \u2013 often even longer than the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/aug/18/coffee-plantation-brazil-jongo\"> notoriously gruelling routines on plantations</a> \u2013 along with numerous instances of sexual abuse committed by their enslavers, a reality that is still <a href=\"https://www.migalhas.com.br/quentes/401926/domestica-forcada-a-abotoar-calca-de-empregador-sera-indenizada\">perpetuated by some employers today</a>.</p> <p>After abolition, it took 70 years for a law to equate domestic work with other professions in Brazil, which happened only in 2013. Just two congressmen voted against it at the time \u2013 one said he had made a mistake, and the other was Jair Bolsonaro, the former president, who <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MidiaNINJA/posts/721662598187578/\">still proudly stands by his decision</a>.</p>    <p>Cases of racism, such as the job advertisement for caregivers, rarely have consequences, despite being against the <a href=\"https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/l7716.htm\">law</a>. </p> <p>In the 2019 case, the agency responsible for the ad excluding \u201cblack and overweight\u201d women got away with a fine of 5,000 reais (\u00a3675).</p> <p>Despite centuries of enslavement and, after abolition, decades of persecution and neglect, Black people were crucial in transforming Brazil into a democracy. The Black women\u2019s movements\u2019 struggle was <a href=\"https://pp.nexojornal.com.br/linha-do-tempo/2020/a-institucionaliza%c3%a7%c3%a3o-da-sa%c3%bade-da-popula%c3%a7%c3%a3o-negra-no-sus\">instrumental, for example, in the creation of Brazil\u2019s public healthcare system</a>, now available to the entire population and nonexistent before 1988, although the country falls short of providing equal conditions of citizenship for all.</p> <p>Thanks to the Black movement\u2019s fight for education, not only are Afro-descendants able to access universities, but so are poor white young people, Indigenous people and those with disabilities, as the affirmative action laws implemented since the early 2000s have been extended to everyone without the means to afford private education.</p> <p>\u201cWe built Brazil,\u201d Jurema Werneck, a prominent activist for public health rights and the country\u2019s executive director of Amnesty International, told me. \u201cOnce we understood that we would have to stay here, we decided that this country should be ours, and we would leave our new marks, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><p>Projeto Querino by Tiago Rogero is published by <a href=\"https://www.fosforoeditora.com.br/\">F\u00f3sforo</a></p></li> </ul>",

Preferably white,\u201d said an advertisement for a job vacancy in S\u00e3o Paulo, published in 1912 in one of Brazil\u2019s largest newspapers. In 2019, in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state, a message in a WhatsApp group for caregivers advertised 10 positions at an agency: \u201cThe only requirements: must not be black or fat, and need at least three months of experience.\u201d The century separating the two job ads is a stark example of how more than 350 years of slavery continue to affect Brazilian society: Black people were, and in many cases still are, overlooked even for the lowest-paid positions. Despite making up more than half of the population (55%), Afro-Brazilians form the base of every socioeconomic indicator, overwhelmingly dominating the statistics on hunger, poverty, gender-based violence and the victims of homicides committed by criminals or the police. Brutal deaths of Black people at the hands of police occur frequently in Brazil. Of the 6,393 people killed by officers in 2023, 82.7% were Black. Wrongful convictions of Black individuals are also alarmingly common. It is impossible to get your head around Latin America\u2019s largest country without understanding its history, particularly from an Afrocentric perspective. No other country in the world imported more enslaved Africans: 4.864 million people were disembarked during the transatlantic slave trade \u2013 12 times greater than the number of enslaved Africans sent to the US and three times that of all of Spanish America. Even in Brazil, most people do not know this history, so I decided to write a book about it, published this month (for now, only in Portuguese). Projeto Querino is based on a journalistic project that involved a team of more than 40 people, over two years and seven months of work. Inspired by the New York Times\u2019 1619 Project, it launched in 2022 as a podcast produced by R\u00e1dio Novelo and a series of magazine articles. Before joining the Guardian in April, I spent another year conducting further research and writing the book. A central idea was to understand and illustrate how Black people participated in crucial moments of Brazilian history \u2013 such as independence in 1822 or the extensively delayed abolition of slavery in 1888 \u2013 something that some school curriculums and parts of the media refuse to acknowledge. Its name is a tribute to Manuel Raimundo Querino (1851-1923), a groundbreaking Brazilian intellectual born free in Bahia state. He is considered the first person to portray Africans and Afro-descendants positively in the country\u2019s historiography. But we also wanted to highlight how the choices made by white individuals \u2013 particularly wealthy people \u2013 continue to prevent descendants of those enslaved from accessing the wealth they created and still generate. \u201cRacism isn\u2019t like some kind of gas floating in the atmosphere; it\u2019s a human construct, just like slavery,\u201d said the historian and writer Yna\u00ea Lopes dos Santos in an interview for the book. \u201cSlavery endured for so long because Brazil\u2019s political elite was made up of enslavers.\u201d Until slavery was abolished in 1888 \u2013 the last country in the Americas to do so \u2013 state and federal laws had denied black people, even those who were free, access to schools. This resulted in a disproportionate rate of illiteracy even decades after abolition. One of the most significant remnants of the slaveholding mentality still prevalent in the country is the fact that almost every middle- or upper-class family employs at least one domestic worker \u2013 predominantly women and Black individuals who generally work excessive hours for low pay. In the 19th century, enslaved domestic women used to endure shifts of 12-15 hours a day \u2013 often even longer than the notoriously gruelling routines on plantations \u2013 along with numerous instances of sexual abuse committed by their enslavers, a reality that is still perpetuated by some employers today. After abolition, it took 70 years for a law to equate domestic work with other professions in Brazil, which happened only in 2013. Just two congressmen voted against it at the time \u2013 one said he had made a mistake, and the other was Jair Bolsonaro, the former president, who still proudly stands by his decision. Cases of racism, such as the job advertisement for caregivers, rarely have consequences, despite being against the law. In the 2019 case, the agency responsible for the ad excluding \u201cblack and overweight\u201d women got away with a fine of 5,000 reais (\u00a3675). Despite centuries of enslavement and, after abolition, decades of persecution and neglect, Black people were crucial in transforming Brazil into a democracy. The Black women\u2019s movements\u2019 struggle was instrumental, for example, in the creation of Brazil\u2019s public healthcare system, now available to the entire population and nonexistent before 1988, although the country falls short of providing equal conditions of citizenship for all. Thanks to the Black movement\u2019s fight for education, not only are Afro-descendants able to access universities, but so are poor white young people, Indigenous people and those with disabilities, as the affirmative action laws implemented since the early 2000s have been extended to everyone without the means to afford private education. \u201cWe built Brazil,\u201d Jurema Werneck, a prominent activist for public health rights and the country\u2019s executive director of Amnesty International, told me. \u201cOnce we understood that we would have to stay here, we decided that this country should be ours, and we would leave our new marks, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u201d Projeto Querino by Tiago Rogero is published by F\u00f3sforo",

Fresh Cosmetic Clinic is no longer operating at 630 George Street after South Eastern Sydney Local Health District\u2019s public health unit inspected the clinic on 22 October and reviewed evidence from the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC). The public health unit identified that some procedures conducted may have risked exposing clients to viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

According to the HCCC statement, evidence obtained during the investigation found that non-registered persons at the clinic were performing invasive cosmetic procedures including injecting botox and dermal fillers such as hyaluronic acid. \u201cThese procedures must be undertaken by registered health practitioners,\u201d the HCCC said. The HCCC also found non-registered persons at the clinic were administering prescription-only medicines in procedures including the injection of botox, hyaluronic acid and anaesthetics, which were not prescribed by a registered medical practitioner. The commission also found some of the clinic\u2019s stocks of medication were expired, and that it was displaying registration certificates of registered practitioners who did not work at the clinic. \u201cMembers of the public attending the clinic believe that they are undergoing procedures performed by registered health practitioners when they are not,\u201d the HCCC said. \u201cA number of people may have had an adverse reaction to the procedures being performed by the clinic.\u201d On 30 October the HCCC imposed an interim prohibition order on the clinic to prevent the health organisation from providing health services of any kind for a period of eight weeks.

      "body": "<p>Wael al-Dahdouh was live on air when he realised something was wrong. It was 25 October 2023, about 5pm, and Al Jazeera\u2019s bureau chief in Gaza was standing on the roof of the channel\u2019s office building, speaking about the day\u2019s airstrikes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bloody night,\u201d said Dahdouh, his voice playing over live images of the skyline, as explosions flared on the horizon.</p> <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dahdouh noticed his nephew Hamdan, a producer with Al Jazeera, looking agitated. Then Dahdouh\u2019s mobile phone, slotted in his flak jacket, began to ring. Hamdan reached over, pulled the phone out and answered it. It was an odd thing to do while they were on air, Dahdouh thought. Alarmed, he addressed Hamdan. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Dahdouh asked, still audible to viewers. After a few seconds on the phone, Hamdan angrily kicked a wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dahdouh asked. Hamdan replied: \u201cYour daughter. The girl is in the hospital. They have struck the place where your wife and family are.\u201d Dahdouh took the phone. As viewers continued to see live scenes from Gaza, they could hear Dahdouh\u2019s rising alarm and Hamdan\u2019s flustered interjections in the background. Then the transmission cut to the studio in Doha.</p> <p>On the phone was Dahdouh\u2019s 21-year-old daughter, Khulood, who was bewildered and unable to give him a clear idea of what was happening. He hung up and rushed to Nuseirat camp seven miles away, where his wife and seven of his eight children had been sheltering in an Israeli-designated safe zone. When he arrived about 40 minutes later, Dahdouh found a chaotic scene. People were digging in the rubble with their hands, using their mobile phone torches to see. Some were in tears, others wailing the names of the dead. In the debris, Dahdouh found his 18-month-old grandson, Adam, covered in dust, unconscious. Cradling the boy in his arms, Dahdouh raced to al-Aqsa martyrs hospital 15 minutes away.</p> <p>In the melee outside the hospital, Dahdouh found Khulood. When she saw Adam\u2019s body in her father\u2019s arms, she began screaming and stroking her nephew\u2019s face. Then she collapsed, taking Dahdouh down with her, still clutching the toddler. Dahdouh staggered to his feet. Inside the building, he handed Adam to a doctor and began to search for the rest of his family, lurching through the throngs also looking for their loved ones, through corridors full of the wounded. Dahdouh\u2019s reporting had made him famous in Gaza, and as he continued his search, asking if anyone had seen his wife and children, he started to realise that people were avoiding him, as if they knew something he didn\u2019t. Then an ambulance brought in his youngest son, 12-year-old Yahya. His skull was exposed and his head drenched in blood, but he was conscious. Dahdouh rushed him to a doctor who began to sew up his wounds on the spot. There was no anaesthetic. Yahya screamed in pain, until a dose of anaesthetic was finally found and administered.</p> <p>As he waited by Yahya\u2019s side, another of Dahdouh\u2019s daughters, as well as his mother-in-law and several cousins, were all brought in to the hospital. He learned from them that Adam\u2019s mother and three of his other daughters had survived the strike. His eldest son, 27-year-old Hamza, was in the south of Gaza, safe. Six of his eight children were now accounted for \u2013 either safe or, like Yahya, injured but alive. But Dahdouh\u2019s wife and two more of his children were still missing. The mortuary was the only place he had not looked.</p> <p>As Dahdouh walked into the makeshift morgue in the grounds of the hospital, known as the \u201cmartyr\u2019s tent\u201d, the press and members of the public filmed every moment. Gaza is a small place, at its narrowest point less than four miles wide, and Dahdouh had been reporting there for almost three decades. He was a figure that many Palestinians in Gaza had either met or felt that they knew. Dahdouh could barely walk through the crowds that gathered around him. Some just stared, others shouted words of support or reached out to comfort him.</p> <p>In the morgue, Dahdouh found the bodies of his 15-year-old son, Mahmoud, his seven-year-old daughter, Sham, and his wife, Amina. Dahdouh picked up Sham and, his face twisted in grief, spoke to her. He fell to his knees next to his wife\u2019s body and held her hand. As he moved from corpse to corpse, the arms of strangers, some of them children, reached out to steady him. It was as he knelt down by Mahmoud\u2019s bloodied body that he let out his first cry, then uttered a phrase that would reverberate around the Arab world: \u201cThey took revenge on us through our children.\u201d</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"e8c64e8a-25a6-4dc0-bb3c-41cd867c8ecd\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>In the hours that followed, videos, pictures and accounts of Dahdouh\u2019s tragedy spread quickly across social media. On the day his family members were killed, Dahdouh became a symbol of the devastating losses faced by Palestinians in Gaza and the particular plight of Palestinian journalists.</p> <p>It was less than three weeks since the start of the war, but the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-11-1-2023-children-killed-4a352398b32887e60a658e0270f0a021\">estimated casualties</a> already included thousands of children, and Dahdouh\u2019s own children became totemic of all the others that were being pulled out of the rubble. The dangers facing reporters in Gaza were also becoming apparent. About 20 had been killed, a figure that a senior figure at the Committee to Protect Journalists called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208019720/journalist-deaths-gaza-israel-hamas\">unprecedented</a>\u201d. In all the images of Dahdouh at the morgue, he is still in his flak jacket, the word \u201cPress\u201d emblazoned on it. Here was not only the most senior Palestinian journalist in Gaza, but \u2013 as Israel has blocked international press from entering \u2013 the most high-profile reporter in Gaza full stop, covering a war that the whole world was watching. His job and stature had offered no protection from the assault.</p> <p>Dahdouh had barely stepped out of the hospital before he was being interviewed. For weeks he had reported the deaths of others, and now he was the story. In the air raid that claimed his wife and two of his children, Dahdouh\u2019s brother\u2019s five grandchildren \u2013 all under 10 \u2013 were also killed. His grandson Adam, the 18-month-old he had found in the rubble, was declared dead in hospital. \u201cWe suspected that the Israeli occupation would punish Palestinians in Gaza collectively for October 7th,\u201d Dahdouh told his Al Jazeera colleagues in his first interview, minutes after discovering his family\u2019s bodies. \u201cAnd sadly, this is what happened.\u201d</p> <p>What he did next made him into the emblem not just of the war\u2019s toll, but of tenacity in the face of unfathomable loss. On the afternoon of 26 October, the cameras followed him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qHtrmVfuoIk\">as he led</a> the funeral prayer for his family. Dahdouh\u2019s son Yahya stood next to him, head bowed and bandaged, his hands clasped on his chest, his mother\u2019s body wrapped in a blanket on the ground before him. Dahdouh\u2019s voice rang out in prayer, followed by a chorus from the men lined up behind him. After the prayer, Dahdouh stroked the head of baby Adam, wrapped in a small white shroud, one last time before he was buried.</p> <p>A few hours later, after several attempts by his editors to dissuade him, Dahdouh was back on the air. On screen, he received condolences from the anchor in the Doha studios and then he began to speak, clearly and calmly, about his role as a journalist. It was a \u2018\u2018duty\u201d, he said, \u201cin such historic and exceptional circumstances to continue our coverage with professionalism and transparency, despite everything\u201d. Then he launched into a report on the latest developments in Gaza.</p> <p>Dahdouh didn\u2019t realise the impact would be so huge. The journalist so committed to his mission that he had returned to work hours after burying his family became a global story. Murals of Dahdouh in his helmet and flak jacket began to appear not only in <a href=\"https://www.dailysabah.com/gallery/graffiti-in-support-of-palestinian-journalist-father/images\">Idlib in Northern Syria</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2468356/media\">in London</a>, and <a href=\"https://fotos.europapress.es/actualidadinternacional/f5711185\">in Dublin</a>. Only after such tributes began to appear, and pro-Palestine protests gathered momentum in the streets of western cities in November, did he understand how many were watching. Dahdouh had covered four wars in Gaza over the previous two decades, but they had not attracted anywhere near the same levels of public attention, sympathy, mobilisation. This war was different.</p>    <p>It was different for Dahdouh, too. The moment he was back on screen, he saw the public\u2019s pride in him. For days, he could barely walk in the street without being offered not only condolences but encouragement. He started receiving calls from strangers. \u201cYou do not know me,\u201d one said. \u201cI have lost all my children and my entire family, but in your honour, and in solidarity with you, I will stand firm.\u201d</p> <p>He was no longer seen as just a high-profile reporter, but a bearer of Gaza\u2019s grief and a symbol of its people\u2019s character. And in a war where so many journalists had already been killed, Dahdouh\u2019s new, magnified role potentially placed him in the crosshairs. He was an experienced war reporter, but this was the first time he felt he might be personally targeted for doing his job.</p> <p>Over the weeks and months that followed, he became increasingly conscious that he would have to decide between two responsibilities \u2013 one towards his work, now more important than ever, and another towards his family. For almost three months Dahdouh juggled both, until it was no longer possible to avoid choosing between them.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"0738424c-2639-4727-ad73-e953d9fca3eb\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t cry over my children like everyone else,\u201d Dahdouh told me this summer as we sat in his living room in Doha, where he now lives. In Gaza, he felt he had to be the pillar of strength that others needed. His old life was gone, and he could not pause for a moment to take stock or process what was happening. He spoke of this period with a touch of the mystical, with wonder at his own response to his calamity, and the response it drew from others.</p> <p>In person, Dahdouh was much like his familiar screen persona: composed, easy in his skin, accustomed to holding court. He exuded a cool authority, eschewing vernacular in favour of formal journalistic classical Arabic. But every once in a while another side of him emerged, mischievous and self-deprecating, like a father who commands fearful respect but leavens it with moments of warmth.</p> <p>Dahdouh was born to a large family \u2013 he is one of eight brothers and eight sisters \u2013 in northern Gaza in 1970. The Dahdouhs had been there, farming the land, for generations. It was a harsh life, which depended on physically exhausting work, but for most of Dahdouh\u2019s childhood, it was a normal life, too. There was always enough to eat and a roof over everyone\u2019s head. His youth was a \u201crich period\u201d, Dahdouh told me, full of activities and friends. Swimming was his \u201cfirst love\u201d, he said. The beach was close to the farm and during school holidays he \u201clived in the sea\u201d. Adel Zaanoun, now a journalist for Agence France-Presse, grew up with Dahdouh in the neighbourhood of Zeitoun. He described a younger Dahdouh with admiration, pride and affectionate mockery. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it now, seeing how bald he is,\u201d Zaanoun told me, \u201cbut then he had a big beautiful head of hair, and every time he won a match or scored a goal he would shake his head vigorously to taunt the losers, his mane swaying like a lion\u2019s.\u201d Dahdouh \u201cwas always restless, always loved being the centre of attention\u201d, recalled Zaanoun.</p> <p>As Dahdouh and his brothers grew older \u2013 some dropping out of school early to join the farm, others taking on casual work \u2013 their father became passionate about the importance of studying and pursuing a different kind of life. But Israeli military occupation, which began in 1967, confounded those who heeded such advice. Education could seem like a remote and indulgent pursuit when the future was so uncertain.</p> <p>After becoming the first in his family to finish secondary school, in 1988 Dahdouh received a scholarship to study medicine in Iraq. But the first intifada, or uprising, which began in Gaza in December 1987 and spread to the rest of the occupied territories, scuppered his plans. Days before Dahdouh was due to depart to Iraq to start his medical degree, the Israeli army had come to his home in the middle of the night and arrested him. He was 17.</p> <p>After three months of interrogation and detention, Dahdouh was charged with what he calls \u201cthe usual activities of the intifada\u201d \u2013 throwing stones, burning car tyres, and confrontations with armed forces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In keeping <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/200411_punitive_house_demolitions\">with a policy</a> practised during the intifada to deter participation in anti-occupation activity, Israeli authorities demolished his family\u2019s home. \u201cHouse demolitions were regular during this time,\u201d Zaanoun told me. \u201cSometimes they would half-demolish a house as a warning.\u201d One or two rooms would be left for the residents to shelter in. If the warning wasn\u2019t heeded, forces would return and demolish it all.</p> <p>Dahdouh served his time in prisons across Gaza. In institutions run by the police, such as Gaza central prison, he found that inmates were able to collectively pressure authorities to secure basic rights. In the military prisons where he spent about half his sentence, life was much worse. The soldiers were inexperienced, he said, preoccupied not with managing prisoners but breaking their morale.<strong> </strong>Water was rationed and prisoners did not bathe for weeks at a time. The sewers regularly overflowed, and their effluence was left to stagnate. Over the seven years he ended up spending in prison, he said, he was allowed only two visits by his family. </p> <p>After he was released in 1995 at the age of 24, Dahdouh tried again to pursue his medical degree in Iraq, but Israeli authorities prevented him from leaving. There were no medical schools at the time in Gaza, but the Islamic University of Gaza had recently launched a new degree, journalism and media studies. Dahdouh enrolled. He got married. (\u201cI had lost seven years,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cso there was no time to waste.\u201d) In 1998, he began reporting for Al Quds, the largest newspaper across the Palestinian territories and two years later, during the second intifada, Dahdouh began picking up some freelance radio and TV work.</p> <p>Rushdi Abualouf, who would go on to become a longtime BBC correspondent, met Dahdouh as a fellow journalism student in Gaza. He recalls this period as one where he, Dahdouh, Zaanoun and a handful of others were the only professionally trained reporters working in Gaza. Together they formed a pioneering mini-generation. \u201cWe covered every political event in Gaza,\u201d Abualouf told me. \u201cYasser Arafat knew us all by name and would ask after us if we didn\u2019t show up to a press conference.\u201d</p> <p>This was a time when satellite TV was becoming a sweeping force across the region. Major news channels, including the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya and the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera, had begun broadcasting, and satellite dishes were becoming cheaper, bringing these new free-to-view channels to a far broader audience. On the airwaves, Arabs met one another for the first time. They gasped at the licentiousness of the Lebanese, with their female pop stars in racy music videos. And they were captivated by the political discussion shows, on Al Jazeera in particular. The first time many Arabs saw their own unelected leaders and Israeli officials face questioning was not on their own censored state channels, but on Arab satellite TV. Debate shows, such as Al Jazeera\u2019s The Opposite Direction, featured criticism of hitherto untouchable parties, such as royal families in the Gulf. Guests frequently came to blows, with the host having to physically intervene. (This made for great TV, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y14h6qBnxTQ\">clips of certain altercations</a> still circulate online, having become part of popular culture.)</p> <p>For Dahdouh, this period seemed almost in the realms of fantasy. Just a few years earlier he had been in prison; now, as a budding broadcast journalist, he was part of a media revolution. By 2004, he was working for Al Jazeera. The life that he had planned to start outside Gaza had been cut off before it could begin, but here, at home, he had found something that felt like a calling.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"36c284b4-a1f2-4841-96fa-1fdf1cb78ee8\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>Dahdouh has covered every conflict in Gaza since Israeli authorities withdrew from the strip in 2005. Over the years, war reporting became a sort of cottage industry in Gaza. When work was scarce, locals could freelance as producers, camera operators, drivers and fixers, building a trusted community where juniors learned from senior professionals such as Dahdouh. His nephew and longtime field producer and cameraman, Hamdan, told me that Dahdouh was \u201ca school\u201d for younger journalists. Almost all of his colleagues with whom I spoke referred to Dahdouh only as Abu Hamza, the father of Hamza, his eldest son, which is a common honorific in the Arab world denoting respect and affection.</p> <p>After the strike that killed his wife and children, Dahdouh remained in Gaza City, while he sent his four daughters and his son Yahya to relative safety in the centre of the Gaza Strip. Working in a team of four \u2013 made up of his nephew Hamdan plus a driver and an editor \u2013 Dahdouh continued to report from the field. What viewers didn\u2019t see was that, whenever Dahdouh was on air, behind the camera was a large crowd, packed tight, craning to hear what he was saying. \u201cWhenever people would see him, they would run, pushing each other, to come and listen to him, to hear the news and get updates on their areas,\u201d Hamdan said. There was \u201cno internet or electricity, and local radio stations were destroyed early in the war,\u201d and so, alongside his role as an international correspondent, Dahdouh became a roving one-man local news station.</p> <p>Dahdouh was now living in the Al Jazeera office, and going straight from there to report each day. This was a \u201cvery difficult period\u201d, he told me. Airstrikes were escalating, as Israel laid the ground for a siege of Gaza City and an extension of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-calls-humanitarian-pauses-gaza-aid-israel-raids-enclave-2023-10-26/\">ground invasion</a> that had begun on 28 October. Hamdan told me that what he and Dahdouh saw, would \u201cmake the hair stand on your head. We walked over body parts.\u201d The nights were the hardest. \u201cNo electricity, no people, the sound of the explosions would shake the building. No sleep,\u201d said Dahdouh. When Israeli ground forces entered Gaza City on <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-troops-roll-into-gaza-city-as-ground-offensive-intensifies-idf-toll-rises/\">2 November</a>, Dahdouh could look out of the office window and see the tanks rolling in.</p> <p>Dahdouh and his team began to receive messages from family and friends pleading with them to leave. Dahdouh wanted to remain, but after a discussion with his team, he came to see that if they stayed, they would almost certainly be killed or detained, and their work would end. So on <a href=\"https://www.watanserb.com/en/2023/11/10/defying-displacement-al-jazeera-correspondent-wael-eldahdouhs-harrowing-journey-amid-gaza-airstrikes/\">10 November,</a> they took off their press jackets and helmets and left the office. Moments after they departed, the tanks arrived at the entrance of the Al Jazeera building.</p> <p>Leaving northern Gaza, the place where he had grown up and where the fighting was most intense, was a \u201cvery, very, very bitter experience\u201d for Dahdouh. \u201cI felt it was a defeat,\u201d he said. He and his team set up a new operation in Khan Younis and began reporting from all over the central Gaza Strip and Rafah in the south. Meanwhile, the number of journalists working in Gaza was shrinking. On 14 December, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/killings-of-journalists-and-their-family-members-in-gaza-dec14-2023/\">the UN raised</a> the alarm over the \u201cunprecedented rate of journalists and media workers who have been killed in Gaza\u201d. By then, according to the UN figures, 50 journalists in Gaza had been confirmed killed.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"0b02e627-2d99-4f2b-927c-ea10b916f6b3\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>On 15 December, Dahdouh and cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa went to the aftermath of an airstrike on a school building in Khan Younis. They travelled to the site in an ambulance, accompanying three members of the civil defence forces, a government department responsible for emergency services, who had, through the Red Cross, secured permission from the Israeli military to be in the area.</p> <p>They arrived at noon. With Israeli drones circling above, Dahdouh and Abu Daqqa reported for more than two hours. Then, as they made their way back to their vehicle, a drone struck. It felt like a storm engulfing him, Dahdouh said. In the moments before he passed out, he was convinced that his time had come. Seven weeks after his family members were killed, he would now also die. He imagined himself in a kind of video game. There would be no more moves or levels to unlock. \u201cGame over Abu Hamza,\u201d he said to himself.</p> <p>But he came to. His hearing was gone and his arm was numb. As he staggered towards shelter, he realised blood was spurting out of his shoulder. Nearby, he found the dead bodies of the three civil defence workers. Then he saw Abu Daqqa some distance away, on the ground but conscious, gesturing with his hand. Bleeding heavily, Dahdouh tried to get help for his colleague and old friend, but when he found ambulance workers nearby, they said they could not reach Abu Daqqa, fearing that they would be struck as well.</p> <p>Dahdouh was taken to hospital. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aljazeerachannel/videos/1113569219632913/\">Footage shows him</a> lying on a bed, medical workers staunching the flow of blood from his arm, as he calls for Abu Daqqa to be saved. \u201cSamer was with me in the place. Samer was screaming,\u201d Dahdouh kept saying, between cries of agony as he was being treated. \u201cCoordinate with the Red Cross,\u201d he said. \u201cMake someone go and get him.\u201d</p>    <p>Al Jazeera\u2019s bureau chief in Ramallah, Walid al-Omari, followed protocol by contacting the International Committee of the Red Cross to request that they seek Israeli permission for an ambulance. Crucial hours passed as the rescue crews waited for IDF approval to access the location safely. Al Jazeera began to broadcast a live counter on its news channel, showing the hours and minutes that were passing without Samer receiving assistance. About five hours after the airstrike, permission and facilitation to access the site was granted. When ambulances reached him half an hour later, they found Abu Daqqa dead. He was the first Al Jazeera journalist to be killed in Gaza since the start of the war. </p> <p>Dahdouh spent one night in intensive care. The next day he was at his friend\u2019s funeral, stroking his face and sobbing. His eldest son, Hamza, stood behind him and a sea of bodies once again formed around Dahdouh as he buried a loved one. And once again, Dahdouh was back on air hours later, this time with his arm bandaged and cannulas sticking of out of his wrists.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"e3457dfb-aa84-4b0d-b71b-50e05164556e\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>One of Dahdouh\u2019s nicknames is <em>Al Jabal</em>, the mountain. \u201cI am a stubborn man,\u201d Dahdouh said to me, explaining why he chose not to leave after his injury. He had experienced so much loss, seen so much death and come so close to dying himself that he no longer had any fear. \u201cLife and death,\u201d to him, \u201chad become the same.\u201d All that he cared about was that when death came, it would find him \u201con his feet\u201d. He was certain that as long as he was alive, no matter how badly injured, he would stay in Gaza and keep reporting.</p> <p>\u201cSo many high profile people called him to persuade him,\u201d Zaanoun, his childhood friend, told me. For most Palestinians in Gaza, leaving was impossible, but Dahdouh was in a different position. Al Jazeera had sometimes managed to extract permission from the Israeli authorities for staff members and their families to be evacuated. Zaanoun and others told him his departure would not be seen as a defeat. He had done enough and it was time to take care of his family, and himself. Without urgent medical care, he might lose his arm. Besides, he had become too totemic now. The risk of him being targeted by Israel was higher than ever, they said. What would be his value to anyone if he was killed?</p> <p>Three days after the airstrike, Dahdouh decided that he would go along with the steps required to leave Gaza \u2013 but he harboured a secret plan. If his family was allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing, he would go with them to the border. Once they had crossed, he would then turn back. He would trust Hamza with the responsibility of \u201cleading the Dahdouhs into the future\u201d.</p> <p>Hamza was not just the eldest son, but Dahdouh\u2019s support and backbone. A journalist who had learned the trade from his father, Hamza had recently joined Al Jazeera himself. Over the years, when Dahdouh was away from home on assignment, it had been Hamza who took his place. Dahdouh spoke of his son with pride: he was kind, generous, ambitious. When he had divulged his plan to Hamza in the final week of December, his son told him he\u2019d had the same idea, except in his version, his father would cross and Hamza would return. Dahdouh overruled him, and they waited for permission to come through.</p> <p>In late December, the Egyptian Journalists\u2019 Syndicate received approval for Dahdouh and his remaining grandchildren, children and their spouses to leave on 2 January, via the Rafah crossing. They began preparations, but the night before their departure, Dahdouh realised that the list of those approved was missing the names of one daughter and two grandchildren.</p>    <p>Over the next few days, as Dahdouh waited for the correct paperwork to come through, he remained in Khan Younis, continuing his reporting. Hamza did the same, reporting on his beat in Rafah, covering the aftermath of airstrikes in the city, and particularly those near the Kuwaiti hospital where he was based.</p> <p>Then, on 7 January, as Dahdouh was in the field, he received news that Hamza had been injured. Dahdouh made his way to the site of the attack, took one look at the car his son had been in when it was struck and knew that he was dead. He found him in the morgue of the Kuwaiti hospital. Hamza was in a body bag. Dahdouh pulled him out of it and embraced him. He felt something. He could have sworn Hamza hugged him back.</p> <p>As he described to me what he saw, Dahdouh paused and, drawing on decades of professional habit, prepared, as he often did, to come up with a concluding thought, some note of fatalism and determination as he closed the scene and handed back to the studio. But nothing came. He drew a deep breath. \u201cIt was all out of my hands,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On the day of Hamza\u2019s funeral, the public swirled around a dazed Dahdouh. Once again, Dahdouh became the conduit for an entire society\u2019s grief. Children clustered around him as he received condolences. An <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wissamgaza/reel/C15FCDcuO_a/\">elderly woman placed her hand</a> on Dahdouh\u2019s head and prayed for him. Dahdouh\u2019s tragedy was international news. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who was in Doha at the time, called the killing an \u201cunimaginable loss\u201d. As a parent, he couldn\u2019t \u201cbegin to imagine the horror\u201d that Dahdouh had experienced, \u201cnot once, but now twice\u201d.</p> <p>During our conversation in Doha, I offered Dahdouh a break several times and suggested returning at a later date if he preferred. He refused, saying that he needed to get it all out in one go. The one break Dahdouh accepted during our hours of conversation was when we came to the subject of Hamza. To him, Hamza had a special place. As the conversation extended into the evening, a pattern appeared, one of referring to Hamza, then circling away from him into another anecdote or observation. At one point, after he had spoken of finding his son\u2019s body in the morgue, Dahdouh tried to capture Hamza in words. He began to speak about all he was poised to achieve as a journalist. Then Dahdouh paused, reaching again to strike a note of reconciliation with what happened. He shook his head. \u201cThat was his story,\u201d was all he could say.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"bcfc0f78-11d0-4888-8ce2-9859113427f0\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>Two days after Hamza\u2019s killing, Dahdouh went with his family to the border, now with a complete list of evacuees. He ensured that they would all be allowed to pass safely, then, as he had always planned to do, he turned back. His place was in Gaza, even if it seemed only a matter of time before he was killed, too.</p> <p>But a few days after his family crossed, Dahdouh began to yield. Hamza\u2019s death had changed everything. Rushdi Abualouf, who has known Dahdouh for 30 years, described it as the \u201cknockout punch\u201d. Without Hamza, Dahdouh felt less certain of his family\u2019s fate abroad. The logic of departure, which he previously dismissed out of hand, became more persuasive. \u201cIn war, it is the women and children,\u201d Dahdouh said, explaining his change of heart, \u201cwho break your back.\u201d At Hamza\u2019s funeral, one of Dahdouh\u2019s daughters had kissed her brother\u2019s corpse then wrapped her hands around her father, <a href=\"https://x.com/InsiderWorld_1/status/1743993604572365202\">crying</a>. \u201cPlease stay with us,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cwe have no one left but you.\u201d</p>    <p>So in the second week of January, he prayed. He resorted to the <em>istikhara</em>, in which the supplicant seeks God\u2019s help in making a choice, places the decision in his hands and asks for <em>yaqeen</em>, a serene state of knowledge and enlightenment. Dahdouh felt that contentment after the prayer in his decision to leave Gaza and join his family.</p> <p>On 16 January, Dahdouh crossed into Egypt, then departed to Doha. He handed over to a younger journalist, Ismail al-Ghoul, in northern Gaza, the most dangerous part of the strip, and told him that if he also wished to stop working and seek refuge with his family in the south, no one would blame him. Al Ghoul refused. A few months later, he was dead.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"af52ec01-ec13-4bb5-99c2-a11d2b5c6fad\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>Over the past year, longstanding tensions between Israel and Al Jazeera, which is funded by Qatar, have turned into open conflict. In May, the Knesset unanimously voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/05/israel-shuts-down-local-al-jazeera-offices-in-dark-day-for-the-media\">ban Al Jazeera</a> in Israel, which it described as a threat to Israeli security and a propaganda tool for Hamas. On the same day, Al Jazeera offices in occupied East Jerusalem were raided by Israeli authorities and equipment confiscated. </p> <p>In mid-July, at Al Jazeera\u2019s headquarters in Doha, I met with Tamer al-Mishaal, who runs the Gaza reporting team. He spoke of Dahdouh with concern, but without pity or alarm. At least he was now safe. Al Mishaal\u2019s focus was on the remaining correspondents in Gaza, who needed a couple of hours each day just to secure food and clean water. In addition to what he called Dahdouh\u2019s family\u2019s \u201cextermination\u201d, al-Mishaal said that Moamen Al Sharafi, a reporter based in south Gaza, <a href=\"https://x.com/osamabinjavaid/status/1732480309139046553\">had lost 22 members</a> of his family in a single bombing. Their bodies are still under the rubble. On 31 July, al-Mishaal lost two members of his team: Dahdouh\u2019s replacement, Ismail al-Ghoul, and cameraman Rami al-Refee were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Two hours before the attack they had been broadcasting live from Gaza City. </p> <p>In September, Israeli soldiers closed down Al Jazeera\u2019s office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/middleeast/al-jazeera-ramallah-israel-raid-intl/index.html\">claiming that the</a> channel was \u201cinciting terror\u201d and \u201csupporting terrorist activities\u201d. Then, on 7 October 2024, Al Jazeera cameraman Ali Attar was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/10/9/video-al-jazeera-cameraman-in-critical-condition-after-israeli-attack\">injured during a strike</a> outside al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza, where he was sheltering with other civilians. Two days later, a sniper drone opened fire on another Al Jazeera cameraman, Fadi al-Wahidi, and a team of other journalists as they were reporting on the assault on Jabalia refugee camp in the north of Gaza. All were wearing Press flak jackets. Al Wahidi was shot in the neck. Attar and al-Wahidi remain in critical condition, the latter in a coma. </p> <p>When I spoke with al-Mishaal, the Gaza field editor, again in October, his tone had changed. In the summer, he had been preoccupied with the logistical challenges on the ground, but he sounded collected, even proud. Now, he spoke with urgency, almost in panic, barely drawing breath. Over recent months, attacks against journalists had escalated. His men were dying. Despite international pressure, Israel had not granted permission for Attar and al-Wahidi to be evacuated. \u201cEvery minute that passes without treatment brings them closer to death,\u201d al-Mishaal said. </p> <p>Al Jazeera maintains that there is a clear pattern of Israel targeting journalists in order to silence them. Israel has denied this. In December, after the death of Samer Abu Daqqa, the IDF said that it \u201ctakes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists. The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.\u201d In June 2024, the IDF <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-response-to-guardian-report-idf-says-it-does-not-target-all-hamas-media-journalists/\">stated that</a> even those who worked for the Hamas-run al-Aqsa media network \u2013 23 of whom had been killed since the start of the war \u2013 were not targets. \u201cThe IDF does not see Hamas\u2019s media networks, or journalists, as such, as members of Hamas military wing,\u201d said the IDF in a statement in response <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/grey-zone-how-hamas-linked-journalists-legitimate-targets\">to a Guardian investigation</a>. \u201cAccordingly, IDF does not target journalists as such.\u201d </p> <p>In most cases where journalists have been killed, the IDF has described such incidents as tragic accidents or collateral damage. However, in some cases, such as the killing of al-Ghoul, the IDF has alleged that those targeted posed an active threat or were secret operatives for Hamas or other militant groups. (These allegations have been strongly denied. In al-Ghoul\u2019s case, Reporters Without Borders described Israel\u2019s claims as \u201cbased on insufficient, questionable evidence\u201d.)</p> <p>When Dahdouh\u2019s son, Hamza, was killed in January, the IDF first claimed he was struck \u201cas a terrorist operating an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops\u201d. The aircraft Hamza was flying was a small drone used for gathering footage. The next day, the IDF seemed to walk back this allegation, hinting that the killing was a mistake. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told NBC that \u201cevery journalist that dies, it\u2019s unfortunate\u201d. The drone they were flying made them appear to be \u201cterrorists\u201d, he said, and there would be an investigation.</p> <p>Two days later, the IDF claimed that it had evidence that Hamza and Mustafa Thuraya, a freelance video journalist killed with him, were members of militant groups and that the drone they were flying posed \u201can immediate threat\u201d. In March, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/gaza-journalists-killed-israel-al-jazeera-footage/\">Washington Post retrieved</a> the memory card of the drone Thuraya was operating, and found that \u201cno Israeli soldiers, aircraft or other military equipment are visible in the footage taken that day\u201d. When the Post presented this information to the IDF, the Israeli army stated that it had \u201cnothing further to add\u201d. </p> <p>Since the summer, Israel\u2019s stance towards Al Jazeera has hardened further. In October, <a href=\"https://x.com/IDF/status/1849088691450339461\">the IDF claimed</a> that it had uncovered evidence that six Al Jazeera journalists currently working in Gaza are active high-ranking military members of Hamas and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/18/what-is-palestinian-islamic-jihad-and-what-is-its-relationship-with-hamas\">Islamic Jihad</a>. (These claims of terrorist affiliation before a journalist has been killed \u201cis something that we haven\u2019t really seen before at all\u201d, Jodie Ginsberg, head of the Committee to Protect Journalists [CPJ], told me.) The IDF also said that it had found <a href=\"https://x.com/avichayadraee/status/1849438119021400325?s=46&amp;amp;t=R353ej5FcwRygEa18CWvPQ\">evidence showing</a> \u201chow Hamas controls the press coverage on Al Jazeera to suit its interests\u201d, allegedly telling Al Jazeera how to cover certain incidents or stories they want suppressed. Al Jazeera rejected Israel\u2019s allegations about its journalists as a \u201cfabricated\u201d and \u201cblatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region\u201d. Regarding the claims of Hamas coordination, Al Jazeera called them \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d by Israel \u201cto conceal its crimes\u201d.</p> <p>Independently assessing these claims and counterclaims is made harder by the fact that no foreign journalists have been allowed to report in Gaza for more than a year. Meanwhile, it is Palestinian journalists alone who are carrying out the work of covering the war on the ground, despite the exceptional dangers they face. According to the CPJ, since the start of the war, Israel has killed at least 123 Palestinian journalists. </p> <h2 data-note-id=\"5c42ed89-8f9a-4fce-ba57-c439be6465c2\" data-type=\"subhead\">* * *</h2> <p>Dahdouh\u2019s house in Doha is a bustling, sparse but well appointed home. With him are his four daughters, three in-laws, and three grandchildren. His son Yahya, now healed, is with them, too. As Dahdouh spoke, I could hear children running around, a TV, and at some point, the cry of a young baby, Amani, named after her grandmother, Dahdouh\u2019s late wife. In the hall across from where we sat hung the words \u201cBaby Girl\u201d, spelled in big bright balloon letters. In the living room was a framed picture of Hamza, wearing his Press helmet and flak jacket. </p> <p>Whenever emotion encroached upon his narrative, Dahdouh cleared his throat or coughed, most often when he spoke of the children he had lost. Without prompting, he resurrected them, talking about them as if they were still alive. Hamza was the beloved eldest. Mahmoud was a boy of such energy, such vivaciousness. He went to the American school, a prestigious English-language school, Dahdouh said, with some pride. Mahmoud was a budding journalist who loved to tell stories. Sham was the darling youngest daughter, mischievous and doted on. One by one, he summoned them, smiling, then tailed off as it seemed to occur to him anew that they were dead. Sometimes he would just shake his head, as if to snap himself into a reality that he still couldn\u2019t believe was upon him. Two days before the war started last year, he had been planning his first trip to Europe \u2013 a holiday in Paris for New Year\u2019s \u2013 with his old friends Zaanoun and Abualouf. \u201cThere was no talk of war, only of the future,\u201d Abualouf said. </p> <p>At times, as we spoke, Dahdouh lost track. On one occasion he said that he had lost four of eight children, counting their names off on his fingers. His son-in-law corrected him. He had five children left, not four. Dahdouh had counted Adam, his grandson, among his own children. A macabre mix-up ensued, with Dahdouh\u2019s son-in-law reminding him that Adam was his son, not Dahdouh\u2019s. </p> <p>His days were filled with anxiety, as he braced for bad news from home. He felt only \u201cbitterness and impotence\u201d in his transformation from someone who was at the \u201cheart of events\u201d to someone who is just watching. He slept badly. The nerves in his arm were not healing. He was regaining feeling, not movement. The arm was encased in a black contraption that ran from his shoulder to the tips of his fingers, and was clearly giving him some discomfort. His days were spent doing physiotherapy, and receiving guests and well wishers. Zaanoun and Abualouf have visited him several times in Doha. </p> <p>Two days after we met, Dahdouh departed to Germany to receive further treatment. It was slow, he told me when I spoke to him in October, but there was progress. And \u201cin respect for an old man\u201d, he said, the European weather had been kind to him. He mentioned that in two days, it would be exactly one year since his wife, two children and grandson were killed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/the-real-reason-the-israel-palestine-peace-process-always-fails\">Israel-Palestine: the real reason there\u2019s still no peace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Dahdouh spoke of death, he did so with a forensic focus on the details. He himself was nowhere in the picture. He spoke as a reporter, rather than as a father, a grandfather, a husband, a friend. He was so used to performing his job while controlling his grief that journalism became his protection from breakdown. But it also prevented him from mourning, from lingering on the life that was lost. </p> <p>Glimpses of that life can be found in the archives. There is a particular clip that stays in my mind. In the last few seconds of a 2016 Al Jazeera documentary on Dahdouh and his colleagues, he is swimming in the sea off the coast of Gaza. He is diving underwater, gliding just beneath the surface, seemingly weightless, then coming up for air. He emerges, wearing a mismatched T-shirt and pair of shorts, then sits on the beach, looking refreshed, at ease. With him are a small group of boys and young men chatting, laughing and calling to each other. Among them are his sons Hamza and Mahmoud. The buildings of Gaza stretch into the sky behind them. In that moment of normality there is a record of all that was lost \u2013 a time before Dahdouh, his family and all of Gaza were engulfed by war. On the beach that day, there was a future. A sand fight breaks out, and they all start ducking and hopping, flinging fistfuls of sand at each other. Then together, they all dive into the sea. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, listen to our podcasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read\">here</a> and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wael al-Dahdouh was live on air when he realised something was wrong. It was 25 October 2023, about 5pm, and Al Jazeera\u2019s bureau chief in Gaza was standing on the roof of the channel\u2019s office building, speaking about the day\u2019s airstrikes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bloody night,\u201d said Dahdouh, his voice playing over live images of the skyline, as explosions flared on the horizon. Out of the corner of his eye, Dahdouh noticed his nephew Hamdan, a producer with Al Jazeera, looking agitated. Then Dahdouh\u2019s mobile phone, slotted in his flak jacket, began to ring. Hamdan reached over, pulled the phone out and answered it. It was an odd thing to do while they were on air, Dahdouh thought. Alarmed, he addressed Hamdan. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Dahdouh asked, still audible to viewers. After a few seconds on the phone, Hamdan angrily kicked a wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dahdouh asked. Hamdan replied: \u201cYour daughter. The girl is in the hospital. They have struck the place where your wife and family are.\u201d Dahdouh took the phone. As viewers continued to see live scenes from Gaza, they could hear Dahdouh\u2019s rising alarm and Hamdan\u2019s flustered interjections in the background. Then the transmission cut to the studio in Doha. On the phone was Dahdouh\u2019s 21-year-old daughter, Khulood, who was bewildered and unable to give him a clear idea of what was happening. He hung up and rushed to Nuseirat camp seven miles away, where his wife and seven of his eight children had been sheltering in an Israeli-designated safe zone. When he arrived about 40 minutes later, Dahdouh found a chaotic scene. People were digging in the rubble with their hands, using their mobile phone torches to see. Some were in tears, others wailing the names of the dead. In the debris, Dahdouh found his 18-month-old grandson, Adam, covered in dust, unconscious. Cradling the boy in his arms, Dahdouh raced to al-Aqsa martyrs hospital 15 minutes away. In the melee outside the hospital, Dahdouh found Khulood. When she saw Adam\u2019s body in her father\u2019s arms, she began screaming and stroking her nephew\u2019s face. Then she collapsed, taking Dahdouh down with her, still clutching the toddler. Dahdouh staggered to his feet. Inside the building, he handed Adam to a doctor and began to search for the rest of his family, lurching through the throngs also looking for their loved ones, through corridors full of the wounded. Dahdouh\u2019s reporting had made him famous in Gaza, and as he continued his search, asking if anyone had seen his wife and children, he started to realise that people were avoiding him, as if they knew something he didn\u2019t. Then an ambulance brought in his youngest son, 12-year-old Yahya. His skull was exposed and his head drenched in blood, but he was conscious. Dahdouh rushed him to a doctor who began to sew up his wounds on the spot. There was no anaesthetic. Yahya screamed in pain, until a dose of anaesthetic was finally found and administered. As he waited by Yahya\u2019s side, another of Dahdouh\u2019s daughters, as well as his mother-in-law and several cousins, were all brought in to the hospital. He learned from them that Adam\u2019s mother and three of his other daughters had survived the strike. His eldest son, 27-year-old Hamza, was in the south of Gaza, safe. Six of his eight children were now accounted for \u2013 either safe or, like Yahya, injured but alive. But Dahdouh\u2019s wife and two more of his children were still missing. The mortuary was the only place he had not looked. As Dahdouh walked into the makeshift morgue in the grounds of the hospital, known as the \u201cmartyr\u2019s tent\u201d, the press and members of the public filmed every moment. Gaza is a small place, at its narrowest point less than four miles wide, and Dahdouh had been reporting there for almost three decades. He was a figure that many Palestinians in Gaza had either met or felt that they knew. Dahdouh could barely walk through the crowds that gathered around him. Some just stared, others shouted words of support or reached out to comfort him. In the morgue, Dahdouh found the bodies of his 15-year-old son, Mahmoud, his seven-year-old daughter, Sham, and his wife, Amina. Dahdouh picked up Sham and, his face twisted in grief, spoke to her. He fell to his knees next to his wife\u2019s body and held her hand. As he moved from corpse to corpse, the arms of strangers, some of them children, reached out to steady him. It was as he knelt down by Mahmoud\u2019s bloodied body that he let out his first cry, then uttered a phrase that would reverberate around the Arab world: \u201cThey took revenge on us through our children.\u201d * * * In the hours that followed, videos, pictures and accounts of Dahdouh\u2019s tragedy spread quickly across social media. On the day his family members were killed, Dahdouh became a symbol of the devastating losses faced by Palestinians in Gaza and the particular plight of Palestinian journalists. It was less than three weeks since the start of the war, but the estimated casualties already included thousands of children, and Dahdouh\u2019s own children became totemic of all the others that were being pulled out of the rubble. The dangers facing reporters in Gaza were also becoming apparent. About 20 had been killed, a figure that a senior figure at the Committee to Protect Journalists called \u201cunprecedented\u201d. In all the images of Dahdouh at the morgue, he is still in his flak jacket, the word \u201cPress\u201d emblazoned on it. Here was not only the most senior Palestinian journalist in Gaza, but \u2013 as Israel has blocked international press from entering \u2013 the most high-profile reporter in Gaza full stop, covering a war that the whole world was watching. His job and stature had offered no protection from the assault. Dahdouh had barely stepped out of the hospital before he was being interviewed. For weeks he had reported the deaths of others, and now he was the story. In the air raid that claimed his wife and two of his children, Dahdouh\u2019s brother\u2019s five grandchildren \u2013 all under 10 \u2013 were also killed. His grandson Adam, the 18-month-old he had found in the rubble, was declared dead in hospital. \u201cWe suspected that the Israeli occupation would punish Palestinians in Gaza collectively for October 7th,\u201d Dahdouh told his Al Jazeera colleagues in his first interview, minutes after discovering his family\u2019s bodies. \u201cAnd sadly, this is what happened.\u201d What he did next made him into the emblem not just of the war\u2019s toll, but of tenacity in the face of unfathomable loss. On the afternoon of 26 October, the cameras followed him as he led the funeral prayer for his family. Dahdouh\u2019s son Yahya stood next to him, head bowed and bandaged, his hands clasped on his chest, his mother\u2019s body wrapped in a blanket on the ground before him. Dahdouh\u2019s voice rang out in prayer, followed by a chorus from the men lined up behind him. After the prayer, Dahdouh stroked the head of baby Adam, wrapped in a small white shroud, one last time before he was buried. A few hours later, after several attempts by his editors to dissuade him, Dahdouh was back on the air. On screen, he received condolences from the anchor in the Doha studios and then he began to speak, clearly and calmly, about his role as a journalist. It was a \u2018\u2018duty\u201d, he said, \u201cin such historic and exceptional circumstances to continue our coverage with professionalism and transparency, despite everything\u201d. Then he launched into a report on the latest developments in Gaza. Dahdouh didn\u2019t realise the impact would be so huge. The journalist so committed to his mission that he had returned to work hours after burying his family became a global story. Murals of Dahdouh in his helmet and flak jacket began to appear not only in Idlib in Northern Syria, but in London, and in Dublin. Only after such tributes began to appear, and pro-Palestine protests gathered momentum in the streets of western cities in November, did he understand how many were watching. Dahdouh had covered four wars in Gaza over the previous two decades, but they had not attracted anywhere near the same levels of public attention, sympathy, mobilisation. This war was different. It was different for Dahdouh, too. The moment he was back on screen, he saw the public\u2019s pride in him. For days, he could barely walk in the street without being offered not only condolences but encouragement. He started receiving calls from strangers. \u201cYou do not know me,\u201d one said. \u201cI have lost all my children and my entire family, but in your honour, and in solidarity with you, I will stand firm.\u201d He was no longer seen as just a high-profile reporter, but a bearer of Gaza\u2019s grief and a symbol of its people\u2019s character. And in a war where so many journalists had already been killed, Dahdouh\u2019s new, magnified role potentially placed him in the crosshairs. He was an experienced war reporter, but this was the first time he felt he might be personally targeted for doing his job. Over the weeks and months that followed, he became increasingly conscious that he would have to decide between two responsibilities \u2013 one towards his work, now more important than ever, and another towards his family. For almost three months Dahdouh juggled both, until it was no longer possible to avoid choosing between them. * * * \u2018I couldn\u2019t cry over my children like everyone else,\u201d Dahdouh told me this summer as we sat in his living room in Doha, where he now lives. In Gaza, he felt he had to be the pillar of strength that others needed. His old life was gone, and he could not pause for a moment to take stock or process what was happening. He spoke of this period with a touch of the mystical, with wonder at his own response to his calamity, and the response it drew from others. In person, Dahdouh was much like his familiar screen persona: composed, easy in his skin, accustomed to holding court. He exuded a cool authority, eschewing vernacular in favour of formal journalistic classical Arabic. But every once in a while another side of him emerged, mischievous and self-deprecating, like a father who commands fearful respect but leavens it with moments of warmth. Dahdouh was born to a large family \u2013 he is one of eight brothers and eight sisters \u2013 in northern Gaza in 1970. The Dahdouhs had been there, farming the land, for generations. It was a harsh life, which depended on physically exhausting work, but for most of Dahdouh\u2019s childhood, it was a normal life, too. There was always enough to eat and a roof over everyone\u2019s head. His youth was a \u201crich period\u201d, Dahdouh told me, full of activities and friends. Swimming was his \u201cfirst love\u201d, he said. The beach was close to the farm and during school holidays he \u201clived in the sea\u201d. Adel Zaanoun, now a journalist for Agence France-Presse, grew up with Dahdouh in the neighbourhood of Zeitoun. He described a younger Dahdouh with admiration, pride and affectionate mockery. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it now, seeing how bald he is,\u201d Zaanoun told me, \u201cbut then he had a big beautiful head of hair, and every time he won a match or scored a goal he would shake his head vigorously to taunt the losers, his mane swaying like a lion\u2019s.\u201d Dahdouh \u201cwas always restless, always loved being the centre of attention\u201d, recalled Zaanoun. As Dahdouh and his brothers grew older \u2013 some dropping out of school early to join the farm, others taking on casual work \u2013 their father became passionate about the importance of studying and pursuing a different kind of life. But Israeli military occupation, which began in 1967, confounded those who heeded such advice. Education could seem like a remote and indulgent pursuit when the future was so uncertain. After becoming the first in his family to finish secondary school, in 1988 Dahdouh received a scholarship to study medicine in Iraq. But the first intifada, or uprising, which began in Gaza in December 1987 and spread to the rest of the occupied territories, scuppered his plans. Days before Dahdouh was due to depart to Iraq to start his medical degree, the Israeli army had come to his home in the middle of the night and arrested him. He was 17. After three months of interrogation and detention, Dahdouh was charged with what he calls \u201cthe usual activities of the intifada\u201d \u2013 throwing stones, burning car tyres, and confrontations with armed forces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In keeping with a policy practised during the intifada to deter participation in anti-occupation activity, Israeli authorities demolished his family\u2019s home. \u201cHouse demolitions were regular during this time,\u201d Zaanoun told me. \u201cSometimes they would half-demolish a house as a warning.\u201d One or two rooms would be left for the residents to shelter in. If the warning wasn\u2019t heeded, forces would return and demolish it all. Dahdouh served his time in prisons across Gaza. In institutions run by the police, such as Gaza central prison, he found that inmates were able to collectively pressure authorities to secure basic rights. In the military prisons where he spent about half his sentence, life was much worse. The soldiers were inexperienced, he said, preoccupied not with managing prisoners but breaking their morale. Water was rationed and prisoners did not bathe for weeks at a time. The sewers regularly overflowed, and their effluence was left to stagnate. Over the seven years he ended up spending in prison, he said, he was allowed only two visits by his family. After he was released in 1995 at the age of 24, Dahdouh tried again to pursue his medical degree in Iraq, but Israeli authorities prevented him from leaving. There were no medical schools at the time in Gaza, but the Islamic University of Gaza had recently launched a new degree, journalism and media studies. Dahdouh enrolled. He got married. (\u201cI had lost seven years,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cso there was no time to waste.\u201d) In 1998, he began reporting for Al Quds, the largest newspaper across the Palestinian territories and two years later, during the second intifada, Dahdouh began picking up some freelance radio and TV work. Rushdi Abualouf, who would go on to become a longtime BBC correspondent, met Dahdouh as a fellow journalism student in Gaza. He recalls this period as one where he, Dahdouh, Zaanoun and a handful of others were the only professionally trained reporters working in Gaza. Together they formed a pioneering mini-generation. \u201cWe covered every political event in Gaza,\u201d Abualouf told me. \u201cYasser Arafat knew us all by name and would ask after us if we didn\u2019t show up to a press conference.\u201d This was a time when satellite TV was becoming a sweeping force across the region. Major news channels, including the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya and the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera, had begun broadcasting, and satellite dishes were becoming cheaper, bringing these new free-to-view channels to a far broader audience. On the airwaves, Arabs met one another for the first time. They gasped at the licentiousness of the Lebanese, with their female pop stars in racy music videos. And they were captivated by the political discussion shows, on Al Jazeera in particular. The first time many Arabs saw their own unelected leaders and Israeli officials face questioning was not on their own censored state channels, but on Arab satellite TV. Debate shows, such as Al Jazeera\u2019s The Opposite Direction, featured criticism of hitherto untouchable parties, such as royal families in the Gulf. Guests frequently came to blows, with the host having to physically intervene. (This made for great TV, and clips of certain altercations still circulate online, having become part of popular culture.) For Dahdouh, this period seemed almost in the realms of fantasy. Just a few years earlier he had been in prison; now, as a budding broadcast journalist, he was part of a media revolution. By 2004, he was working for Al Jazeera. The life that he had planned to start outside Gaza had been cut off before it could begin, but here, at home, he had found something that felt like a calling. * * * Dahdouh has covered every conflict in Gaza since Israeli authorities withdrew from the strip in 2005. Over the years, war reporting became a sort of cottage industry in Gaza. When work was scarce, locals could freelance as producers, camera operators, drivers and fixers, building a trusted community where juniors learned from senior professionals such as Dahdouh. His nephew and longtime field producer and cameraman, Hamdan, told me that Dahdouh was \u201ca school\u201d for younger journalists. Almost all of his colleagues with whom I spoke referred to Dahdouh only as Abu Hamza, the father of Hamza, his eldest son, which is a common honorific in the Arab world denoting respect and affection. After the strike that killed his wife and children, Dahdouh remained in Gaza City, while he sent his four daughters and his son Yahya to relative safety in the centre of the Gaza Strip. Working in a team of four \u2013 made up of his nephew Hamdan plus a driver and an editor \u2013 Dahdouh continued to report from the field. What viewers didn\u2019t see was that, whenever Dahdouh was on air, behind the camera was a large crowd, packed tight, craning to hear what he was saying. \u201cWhenever people would see him, they would run, pushing each other, to come and listen to him, to hear the news and get updates on their areas,\u201d Hamdan said. There was \u201cno internet or electricity, and local radio stations were destroyed early in the war,\u201d and so, alongside his role as an international correspondent, Dahdouh became a roving one-man local news station. Dahdouh was now living in the Al Jazeera office, and going straight from there to report each day. This was a \u201cvery difficult period\u201d, he told me. Airstrikes were escalating, as Israel laid the ground for a siege of Gaza City and an extension of the ground invasion that had begun on 28 October. Hamdan told me that what he and Dahdouh saw, would \u201cmake the hair stand on your head. We walked over body parts.\u201d The nights were the hardest. \u201cNo electricity, no people, the sound of the explosions would shake the building. No sleep,\u201d said Dahdouh. When Israeli ground forces entered Gaza City on 2 November, Dahdouh could look out of the office window and see the tanks rolling in. Dahdouh and his team began to receive messages from family and friends pleading with them to leave. Dahdouh wanted to remain, but after a discussion with his team, he came to see that if they stayed, they would almost certainly be killed or detained, and their work would end. So on 10 November, they took off their press jackets and helmets and left the office. Moments after they departed, the tanks arrived at the entrance of the Al Jazeera building. Leaving northern Gaza, the place where he had grown up and where the fighting was most intense, was a \u201cvery, very, very bitter experience\u201d for Dahdouh. \u201cI felt it was a defeat,\u201d he said. He and his team set up a new operation in Khan Younis and began reporting from all over the central Gaza Strip and Rafah in the south. Meanwhile, the number of journalists working in Gaza was shrinking. On 14 December, the UN raised the alarm over the \u201cunprecedented rate of journalists and media workers who have been killed in Gaza\u201d. By then, according to the UN figures, 50 journalists in Gaza had been confirmed killed. * * * On 15 December, Dahdouh and cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa went to the aftermath of an airstrike on a school building in Khan Younis. They travelled to the site in an ambulance, accompanying three members of the civil defence forces, a government department responsible for emergency services, who had, through the Red Cross, secured permission from the Israeli military to be in the area. They arrived at noon. With Israeli drones circling above, Dahdouh and Abu Daqqa reported for more than two hours. Then, as they made their way back to their vehicle, a drone struck. It felt like a storm engulfing him, Dahdouh said. In the moments before he passed out, he was convinced that his time had come. Seven weeks after his family members were killed, he would now also die. He imagined himself in a kind of video game. There would be no more moves or levels to unlock. \u201cGame over Abu Hamza,\u201d he said to himself. But he came to. His hearing was gone and his arm was numb. As he staggered towards shelter, he realised blood was spurting out of his shoulder. Nearby, he found the dead bodies of the three civil defence workers. Then he saw Abu Daqqa some distance away, on the ground but conscious, gesturing with his hand. Bleeding heavily, Dahdouh tried to get help for his colleague and old friend, but when he found ambulance workers nearby, they said they could not reach Abu Daqqa, fearing that they would be struck as well. Dahdouh was taken to hospital. Footage shows him lying on a bed, medical workers staunching the flow of blood from his arm, as he calls for Abu Daqqa to be saved. \u201cSamer was with me in the place. Samer was screaming,\u201d Dahdouh kept saying, between cries of agony as he was being treated. \u201cCoordinate with the Red Cross,\u201d he said. \u201cMake someone go and get him.\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s bureau chief in Ramallah, Walid al-Omari, followed protocol by contacting the International Committee of the Red Cross to request that they seek Israeli permission for an ambulance. Crucial hours passed as the rescue crews waited for IDF approval to access the location safely. Al Jazeera began to broadcast a live counter on its news channel, showing the hours and minutes that were passing without Samer receiving assistance. About five hours after the airstrike, permission and facilitation to access the site was granted. When ambulances reached him half an hour later, they found Abu Daqqa dead. He was the first Al Jazeera journalist to be killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Dahdouh spent one night in intensive care. The next day he was at his friend\u2019s funeral, stroking his face and sobbing. His eldest son, Hamza, stood behind him and a sea of bodies once again formed around Dahdouh as he buried a loved one. And once again, Dahdouh was back on air hours later, this time with his arm bandaged and cannulas sticking of out of his wrists. * * * One of Dahdouh\u2019s nicknames is Al Jabal, the mountain. \u201cI am a stubborn man,\u201d Dahdouh said to me, explaining why he chose not to leave after his injury. He had experienced so much loss, seen so much death and come so close to dying himself that he no longer had any fear. \u201cLife and death,\u201d to him, \u201chad become the same.\u201d All that he cared about was that when death came, it would find him \u201con his feet\u201d. He was certain that as long as he was alive, no matter how badly injured, he would stay in Gaza and keep reporting. \u201cSo many high profile people called him to persuade him,\u201d Zaanoun, his childhood friend, told me. For most Palestinians in Gaza, leaving was impossible, but Dahdouh was in a different position. Al Jazeera had sometimes managed to extract permission from the Israeli authorities for staff members and their families to be evacuated. Zaanoun and others told him his departure would not be seen as a defeat. He had done enough and it was time to take care of his family, and himself. Without urgent medical care, he might lose his arm. Besides, he had become too totemic now. The risk of him being targeted by Israel was higher than ever, they said. What would be his value to anyone if he was killed? Three days after the airstrike, Dahdouh decided that he would go along with the steps required to leave Gaza \u2013 but he harboured a secret plan. If his family was allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing, he would go with them to the border. Once they had crossed, he would then turn back. He would trust Hamza with the responsibility of \u201cleading the Dahdouhs into the future\u201d. Hamza was not just the eldest son, but Dahdouh\u2019s support and backbone. A journalist who had learned the trade from his father, Hamza had recently joined Al Jazeera himself. Over the years, when Dahdouh was away from home on assignment, it had been Hamza who took his place. Dahdouh spoke of his son with pride: he was kind, generous, ambitious. When he had divulged his plan to Hamza in the final week of December, his son told him he\u2019d had the same idea, except in his version, his father would cross and Hamza would return. Dahdouh overruled him, and they waited for permission to come through. In late December, the Egyptian Journalists\u2019 Syndicate received approval for Dahdouh and his remaining grandchildren, children and their spouses to leave on 2 January, via the Rafah crossing. They began preparations, but the night before their departure, Dahdouh realised that the list of those approved was missing the names of one daughter and two grandchildren. Over the next few days, as Dahdouh waited for the correct paperwork to come through, he remained in Khan Younis, continuing his reporting. Hamza did the same, reporting on his beat in Rafah, covering the aftermath of airstrikes in the city, and particularly those near the Kuwaiti hospital where he was based. Then, on 7 January, as Dahdouh was in the field, he received news that Hamza had been injured. Dahdouh made his way to the site of the attack, took one look at the car his son had been in when it was struck and knew that he was dead. He found him in the morgue of the Kuwaiti hospital. Hamza was in a body bag. Dahdouh pulled him out of it and embraced him. He felt something. He could have sworn Hamza hugged him back. As he described to me what he saw, Dahdouh paused and, drawing on decades of professional habit, prepared, as he often did, to come up with a concluding thought, some note of fatalism and determination as he closed the scene and handed back to the studio. But nothing came. He drew a deep breath. \u201cIt was all out of my hands,\u201d he said. On the day of Hamza\u2019s funeral, the public swirled around a dazed Dahdouh. Once again, Dahdouh became the conduit for an entire society\u2019s grief. Children clustered around him as he received condolences. An elderly woman placed her hand on Dahdouh\u2019s head and prayed for him. Dahdouh\u2019s tragedy was international news. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who was in Doha at the time, called the killing an \u201cunimaginable loss\u201d. As a parent, he couldn\u2019t \u201cbegin to imagine the horror\u201d that Dahdouh had experienced, \u201cnot once, but now twice\u201d. During our conversation in Doha, I offered Dahdouh a break several times and suggested returning at a later date if he preferred. He refused, saying that he needed to get it all out in one go. The one break Dahdouh accepted during our hours of conversation was when we came to the subject of Hamza. To him, Hamza had a special place. As the conversation extended into the evening, a pattern appeared, one of referring to Hamza, then circling away from him into another anecdote or observation. At one point, after he had spoken of finding his son\u2019s body in the morgue, Dahdouh tried to capture Hamza in words. He began to speak about all he was poised to achieve as a journalist. Then Dahdouh paused, reaching again to strike a note of reconciliation with what happened. He shook his head. \u201cThat was his story,\u201d was all he could say. * * * Two days after Hamza\u2019s killing, Dahdouh went with his family to the border, now with a complete list of evacuees. He ensured that they would all be allowed to pass safely, then, as he had always planned to do, he turned back. His place was in Gaza, even if it seemed only a matter of time before he was killed, too. But a few days after his family crossed, Dahdouh began to yield. Hamza\u2019s death had changed everything. Rushdi Abualouf, who has known Dahdouh for 30 years, described it as the \u201cknockout punch\u201d. Without Hamza, Dahdouh felt less certain of his family\u2019s fate abroad. The logic of departure, which he previously dismissed out of hand, became more persuasive. \u201cIn war, it is the women and children,\u201d Dahdouh said, explaining his change of heart, \u201cwho break your back.\u201d At Hamza\u2019s funeral, one of Dahdouh\u2019s daughters had kissed her brother\u2019s corpse then wrapped her hands around her father, crying. \u201cPlease stay with us,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cwe have no one left but you.\u201d So in the second week of January, he prayed. He resorted to the istikhara, in which the supplicant seeks God\u2019s help in making a choice, places the decision in his hands and asks for yaqeen, a serene state of knowledge and enlightenment. Dahdouh felt that contentment after the prayer in his decision to leave Gaza and join his family. On 16 January, Dahdouh crossed into Egypt, then departed to Doha. He handed over to a younger journalist, Ismail al-Ghoul, in northern Gaza, the most dangerous part of the strip, and told him that if he also wished to stop working and seek refuge with his family in the south, no one would blame him. Al Ghoul refused. A few months later, he was dead. * * * Over the past year, longstanding tensions between Israel and Al Jazeera, which is funded by Qatar, have turned into open conflict. In May, the Knesset unanimously voted to ban Al Jazeera in Israel, which it described as a threat to Israeli security and a propaganda tool for Hamas. On the same day, Al Jazeera offices in occupied East Jerusalem were raided by Israeli authorities and equipment confiscated. In mid-July, at Al Jazeera\u2019s headquarters in Doha, I met with Tamer al-Mishaal, who runs the Gaza reporting team. He spoke of Dahdouh with concern, but without pity or alarm. At least he was now safe. Al Mishaal\u2019s focus was on the remaining correspondents in Gaza, who needed a couple of hours each day just to secure food and clean water. In addition to what he called Dahdouh\u2019s family\u2019s \u201cextermination\u201d, al-Mishaal said that Moamen Al Sharafi, a reporter based in south Gaza, had lost 22 members of his family in a single bombing. Their bodies are still under the rubble. On 31 July, al-Mishaal lost two members of his team: Dahdouh\u2019s replacement, Ismail al-Ghoul, and cameraman Rami al-Refee were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Two hours before the attack they had been broadcasting live from Gaza City. In September, Israeli soldiers closed down Al Jazeera\u2019s office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, claiming that the channel was \u201cinciting terror\u201d and \u201csupporting terrorist activities\u201d. Then, on 7 October 2024, Al Jazeera cameraman Ali Attar was injured during a strike outside al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza, where he was sheltering with other civilians. Two days later, a sniper drone opened fire on another Al Jazeera cameraman, Fadi al-Wahidi, and a team of other journalists as they were reporting on the assault on Jabalia refugee camp in the north of Gaza. All were wearing Press flak jackets. Al Wahidi was shot in the neck. Attar and al-Wahidi remain in critical condition, the latter in a coma. When I spoke with al-Mishaal, the Gaza field editor, again in October, his tone had changed. In the summer, he had been preoccupied with the logistical challenges on the ground, but he sounded collected, even proud. Now, he spoke with urgency, almost in panic, barely drawing breath. Over recent months, attacks against journalists had escalated. His men were dying. Despite international pressure, Israel had not granted permission for Attar and al-Wahidi to be evacuated. \u201cEvery minute that passes without treatment brings them closer to death,\u201d al-Mishaal said. Al Jazeera maintains that there is a clear pattern of Israel targeting journalists in order to silence them. Israel has denied this. In December, after the death of Samer Abu Daqqa, the IDF said that it \u201ctakes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists. The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.\u201d In June 2024, the IDF stated that even those who worked for the Hamas-run al-Aqsa media network \u2013 23 of whom had been killed since the start of the war \u2013 were not targets. \u201cThe IDF does not see Hamas\u2019s media networks, or journalists, as such, as members of Hamas military wing,\u201d said the IDF in a statement in response to a Guardian investigation. \u201cAccordingly, IDF does not target journalists as such.\u201d In most cases where journalists have been killed, the IDF has described such incidents as tragic accidents or collateral damage. However, in some cases, such as the killing of al-Ghoul, the IDF has alleged that those targeted posed an active threat or were secret operatives for Hamas or other militant groups. (These allegations have been strongly denied. In al-Ghoul\u2019s case, Reporters Without Borders described Israel\u2019s claims as \u201cbased on insufficient, questionable evidence\u201d.) When Dahdouh\u2019s son, Hamza, was killed in January, the IDF first claimed he was struck \u201cas a terrorist operating an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops\u201d. The aircraft Hamza was flying was a small drone used for gathering footage. The next day, the IDF seemed to walk back this allegation, hinting that the killing was a mistake. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told NBC that \u201cevery journalist that dies, it\u2019s unfortunate\u201d. The drone they were flying made them appear to be \u201cterrorists\u201d, he said, and there would be an investigation. Two days later, the IDF claimed that it had evidence that Hamza and Mustafa Thuraya, a freelance video journalist killed with him, were members of militant groups and that the drone they were flying posed \u201can immediate threat\u201d. In March, the Washington Post retrieved the memory card of the drone Thuraya was operating, and found that \u201cno Israeli soldiers, aircraft or other military equipment are visible in the footage taken that day\u201d. When the Post presented this information to the IDF, the Israeli army stated that it had \u201cnothing further to add\u201d. Since the summer, Israel\u2019s stance towards Al Jazeera has hardened further. In October, the IDF claimed that it had uncovered evidence that six Al Jazeera journalists currently working in Gaza are active high-ranking military members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. (These claims of terrorist affiliation before a journalist has been killed \u201cis something that we haven\u2019t really seen before at all\u201d, Jodie Ginsberg, head of the Committee to Protect Journalists [CPJ], told me.) The IDF also said that it had found evidence showing \u201chow Hamas controls the press coverage on Al Jazeera to suit its interests\u201d, allegedly telling Al Jazeera how to cover certain incidents or stories they want suppressed. Al Jazeera rejected Israel\u2019s allegations about its journalists as a \u201cfabricated\u201d and \u201cblatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region\u201d. Regarding the claims of Hamas coordination, Al Jazeera called them \u201ca desperate attempt\u201d by Israel \u201cto conceal its crimes\u201d. Independently assessing these claims and counterclaims is made harder by the fact that no foreign journalists have been allowed to report in Gaza for more than a year. Meanwhile, it is Palestinian journalists alone who are carrying out the work of covering the war on the ground, despite the exceptional dangers they face. According to the CPJ, since the start of the war, Israel has killed at least 123 Palestinian journalists. * * * Dahdouh\u2019s house in Doha is a bustling, sparse but well appointed home. With him are his four daughters, three in-laws, and three grandchildren. His son Yahya, now healed, is with them, too. As Dahdouh spoke, I could hear children running around, a TV, and at some point, the cry of a young baby, Amani, named after her grandmother, Dahdouh\u2019s late wife. In the hall across from where we sat hung the words \u201cBaby Girl\u201d, spelled in big bright balloon letters. In the living room was a framed picture of Hamza, wearing his Press helmet and flak jacket. Whenever emotion encroached upon his narrative, Dahdouh cleared his throat or coughed, most often when he spoke of the children he had lost. Without prompting, he resurrected them, talking about them as if they were still alive. Hamza was the beloved eldest. Mahmoud was a boy of such energy, such vivaciousness. He went to the American school, a prestigious English-language school, Dahdouh said, with some pride. Mahmoud was a budding journalist who loved to tell stories. Sham was the darling youngest daughter, mischievous and doted on. One by one, he summoned them, smiling, then tailed off as it seemed to occur to him anew that they were dead. Sometimes he would just shake his head, as if to snap himself into a reality that he still couldn\u2019t believe was upon him. Two days before the war started last year, he had been planning his first trip to Europe \u2013 a holiday in Paris for New Year\u2019s \u2013 with his old friends Zaanoun and Abualouf. \u201cThere was no talk of war, only of the future,\u201d Abualouf said. At times, as we spoke, Dahdouh lost track. On one occasion he said that he had lost four of eight children, counting their names off on his fingers. His son-in-law corrected him. He had five children left, not four. Dahdouh had counted Adam, his grandson, among his own children. A macabre mix-up ensued, with Dahdouh\u2019s son-in-law reminding him that Adam was his son, not Dahdouh\u2019s. His days were filled with anxiety, as he braced for bad news from home. He felt only \u201cbitterness and impotence\u201d in his transformation from someone who was at the \u201cheart of events\u201d to someone who is just watching. He slept badly. The nerves in his arm were not healing. He was regaining feeling, not movement. The arm was encased in a black contraption that ran from his shoulder to the tips of his fingers, and was clearly giving him some discomfort. His days were spent doing physiotherapy, and receiving guests and well wishers. Zaanoun and Abualouf have visited him several times in Doha. Two days after we met, Dahdouh departed to Germany to receive further treatment. It was slow, he told me when I spoke to him in October, but there was progress. And \u201cin respect for an old man\u201d, he said, the European weather had been kind to him. He mentioned that in two days, it would be exactly one year since his wife, two children and grandson were killed. When Dahdouh spoke of death, he did so with a forensic focus on the details. He himself was nowhere in the picture. He spoke as a reporter, rather than as a father, a grandfather, a husband, a friend. He was so used to performing his job while controlling his grief that journalism became his protection from breakdown. But it also prevented him from mourning, from lingering on the life that was lost. Glimpses of that life can be found in the archives. There is a particular clip that stays in my mind. In the last few seconds of a 2016 Al Jazeera documentary on Dahdouh and his colleagues, he is swimming in the sea off the coast of Gaza. He is diving underwater, gliding just beneath the surface, seemingly weightless, then coming up for air. He emerges, wearing a mismatched T-shirt and pair of shorts, then sits on the beach, looking refreshed, at ease. With him are a small group of boys and young men chatting, laughing and calling to each other. Among them are his sons Hamza and Mahmoud. The buildings of Gaza stretch into the sky behind them. In that moment of normality there is a record of all that was lost \u2013 a time before Dahdouh, his family and all of Gaza were engulfed by war. On the beach that day, there was a future. A sand fight breaks out, and they all start ducking and hopping, flinging fistfuls of sand at each other. Then together, they all dive into the sea. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

The fantasy is roughly the same as the one in The West Wing \u2013 a wide-eyed overestimate of how many people in positions of real power in the US and UK are faithful adherents to doing the right thing without fear or favour. The harsh reality is that Kate and the other conscientious characters are dealing with a British rightwing government dangerously in hock to the far right; season two builds on the horribly plausible idea that this corrupt administration has tolerated or even orchestrated terrorism against itself for political gain.</p> <p>Rory Kinnear is terrific as rogue British PM Nicol Trowbridge, a man who is essentially Boris Johnson but worse: the chippy self-regard and whiff of imperial perversion are there, but the buffoonery is toned down. We switch back from reality to fantasy with David Gyasi as Austin Dennison: terse, precise and fastidiously principled, even when it would obviously be beneficial not to be, Dennison is hard to imagine as a real foreign secretary but easy to picture in a tailcoat, moodily heading up a Bront\u00eb novel.</p>    <p>The new episodes see Kate again romantically triangulating between Dennison, the perfect man who is professionally and emotionally unavailable, and Hal, who will always let her down but knows her better than anyone ever will. So Keri Russell has three strong male foils, but The Diplomat is still her show. Kate Wyler has a lot of the ferocity and resourcefulness of Elizabeth Jennings in The Americans, only with more humour and vulnerability. Nothing will ever be a better vehicle for Russell than The Americans, but this one asks for more versatility and relatability, and Russell is easily equal to it.</p> <p>Russell has been given her second great TV role by showrunner Debora Cahn, who has, if a glance down her CV is any guide, spent her career working towards this moment. Cahn has written for The West Wing, Homeland and Grey\u2019s Anatomy, qualifying her to create a series that is several great shows all at once. Kate Wyler may never quite feel that she fits in at work, but The Diplomat should slot effortlessly into any list of the best dramas of the year.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Diplomat is on Netflix now.</p></li> </ul>",

Season two carries straight on from the explosive twist that ended the first run \u2013 it was one of the best last two minutes of any season of anything, ever \u2013 and continues to be a masterclass in \u201ctherefore/but\u201d storytelling: this happens, therefore that happens, but then this happens, therefore that happens. No moment is wasted and, before you know it, it\u2019s 2am and you\u2019re still watching. The Diplomat\u2019s politics, meanwhile, are a spicy mix of fantasy and reality. The fantasy is roughly the same as the one in The West Wing \u2013 a wide-eyed overestimate of how many people in positions of real power in the US and UK are faithful adherents to doing the right thing without fear or favour. The harsh reality is that Kate and the other conscientious characters are dealing with a British rightwing government dangerously in hock to the far right; season two builds on the horribly plausible idea that this corrupt administration has tolerated or even orchestrated terrorism against itself for political gain. Rory Kinnear is terrific as rogue British PM Nicol Trowbridge, a man who is essentially Boris Johnson but worse: the chippy self-regard and whiff of imperial perversion are there, but the buffoonery is toned down. We switch back from reality to fantasy with David Gyasi as Austin Dennison: terse, precise and fastidiously principled, even when it would obviously be beneficial not to be, Dennison is hard to imagine as a real foreign secretary but easy to picture in a tailcoat, moodily heading up a Bront\u00eb novel. The new episodes see Kate again romantically triangulating between Dennison, the perfect man who is professionally and emotionally unavailable, and Hal, who will always let her down but knows her better than anyone ever will. So Keri Russell has three strong male foils, but The Diplomat is still her show. Kate Wyler has a lot of the ferocity and resourcefulness of Elizabeth Jennings in The Americans, only with more humour and vulnerability. Nothing will ever be a better vehicle for Russell than The Americans, but this one asks for more versatility and relatability, and Russell is easily equal to it. Russell has been given her second great TV role by showrunner Debora Cahn, who has, if a glance down her CV is any guide, spent her career working towards this moment. Cahn has written for The West Wing, Homeland and Grey\u2019s Anatomy, qualifying her to create a series that is several great shows all at once. Kate Wyler may never quite feel that she fits in at work, but The Diplomat should slot effortlessly into any list of the best dramas of the year. The Diplomat is on Netflix now.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s easy to take our dental health for granted until there is a problem <strong>\u2013 </strong>and then it can be a nightmare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/30/pliers-abscesses-and-agonising-pain-britains-dental-crisis-as-seen-from-ae\">even getting an appointment</a>. But most people have some level of gum disease, and even if it doesn\u2019t hurt, it may lead to worse problems further down the line. Here is advice from dentists on how to avoid painful and costly treatment.</p> <h2>Remember that sugar really is bad for your teeth</h2> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t avoid sugar in modern diets \u2013 it is hidden everywhere,\u201d says Tristan Roberts, a dentist who works at several private clinics in central London. \u201cThe only reason we have tooth decay is because of sugar.\u201d It is striking, says Roberts, that when we look at teeth in prehistoric skulls, there is hardly any sign of decay \u2013 and yet there weren\u2019t dentists and fillings back then. \u201cAs soon as we started introducing refined sugars into the diet, decay exploded. Sugar itself doesn\u2019t cause decay but it causes bacteria in the mouth to go crazy: they eat the sugar and release lots of acid.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t forget your (electric) toothbrush</h2> <p>\u201cIf you are going to have sugar, make sure you are brushing your teeth really well,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cIn this day and age, everybody should have an electric toothbrush. It doesn\u2019t have to be a top-of-the-range one, just rechargeable, as they work better, and ideally with a pressure sensor to make sure you\u2019re brushing gently around each tooth. And then it is a case of thoroughly brushing. You need to do the front, middle, back and sides of all your teeth, especially over the gum line, so you\u2019re not just brushing over the tops of them quickly.\u201d</p> <h2>Cut down on snacks</h2> <p>\u201cThe timing of when we have sugar is just as important as the amount,\u201d says Roberts. Limit eating and drinking sweet things to no more than four times a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner and one snack, he says. If you have to have chocolate, make sure it is at those times, \u201crather than constantly grazing throughout the day when your teeth would be in a constant state of attack\u201d. Rinsing your mouth out with water or using sugar-free chewing gum straight after a sugar hit can help to reduce the acidic load on the teeth, he says.</p> <p>\u201cYour teeth can cope with breakfast, lunch and tea, but they can\u2019t really cope with much else in between, other than water,\u201d says NHS dentist Jenna Murgatroyd, who owns St Agnes Dental Practice in Cornwall. \u201cIf you are constantly bathing your teeth in food, then you are constantly feeding the bacteria, which causes decay.\u201d</p> <h2>Wait for 30 minutes after eating to brush</h2>    <p>The saliva in our mouths is really good stuff for cleaning, says Roberts. \u201cIt has got things in it such as calcium and phosphate, which is what teeth are made of, causing the teeth to go into a state of repair.\u201d It takes about half an hour after eating for saliva to remineralise the teeth, he says, so hold off on brushing until this point or you may end up brushing away the surface of your teeth. \u201cYour teeth have the ability to reharden after you\u2019ve eaten something,\u201d says Murgatroyd. \u201cIf you\u2019re brushing your teeth as soon as you\u2019ve eaten, then you are brushing off the softened enamel before it has the chance to toughen up again.\u201d</p> <h2>Brush before breakfast and last thing at night \u2026</h2> <p>You don\u2019t need to brush your teeth every time you eat, says Roberts \u2013 twice a day will suffice. \u201cIdeally, first thing in the morning to get the fluoride benefit of the toothpaste protecting teeth during the day, and then especially well last thing at night, because when we sleep our mouths are a lot drier; we haven\u2019t got the same amount of saliva that is produced during the day. Bacteria love those conditions and are a lot more likely to cause issues.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2026 and keep at it for the full two minutes</h2> <p>\u201cMost people will brush for less than a minute and think it has been two minutes,\u201d says Dr Praveen Sharma, an associate professor and honorary consultant in restorative dentistry at the Birmingham dental hospital and a scientific adviser to the British Dental Association. \u201cEven people with an electric toothbrush often don\u2019t realise that most have an inbuilt timer, which buzzes at certain intervals and buzzes a bit differently when the full two minutes is up.\u201d</p> <h2>Use fluoride toothpaste</h2> <p>\u201cFluoride makes the teeth about 10 times more resistant to erosion and decay,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cIt also has antibacterial properties that help to protect the teeth.\u201d</p> <p>Are fears about fluoride unfounded? <a href=\"https://bfsweb.org/extent/\">Most areas in the UK don\u2019t have fluoridated water</a>. In some places it occurs naturally, and some councils add fluoride to the water supply, but in minute concentrations (one part of fluoride per million parts of water). \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a significant amount of fluoride exposure if you are brushing your teeth twice a day, even if you\u2019re using high-strength fluoride toothpaste,\u201d Roberts explains. \u201cYes, it can be dangerous if you\u2019re having loads \u2013 say 1,000 times more fluoride than you would ingest from brushing your teeth. And too much fluoride can weaken your teeth. So it\u2019s just about the sweet spot of having a little bit of fluoride; you\u2019ll be fine with the concentrations that we have available.\u201d A smear of toothpaste for kids under three and a tiny pea-size blob on a brush for kids aged three to six is plenty, Roberts says.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t rinse</h2>    <p>\u201cSpit the toothpaste out but don\u2019t rinse it with anything afterwards,\u201d says Murgatroyd, to ensure you get the benefit from the toothpaste.</p> <h2>Avoid using mouthwash straight after brushing</h2> <p>\u201cAt the moment, the advice is not to use mouthwash directly after brushing your teeth,\u201d says Roberts, \u201cbecause the concentration of fluoride is a lot lower than what is in toothpaste. So either use it before brushing your teeth or any other time during the day, half an hour after brushing.\u201d</p> <h2>Brush mindfully</h2> <p>\u201cBrushing should be an exercise in mindfulness,\u201d says Sharma, \u201cwhere you\u2019re really feeling the bristles going between the tooth and gums and from tooth to tooth, listening to the sound of the brush, tasting the toothpaste.\u201d It should not be done \u201cwhile you\u2019re walking around doing other things at the same time: you need to be very present in the moment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/sep/05/the-experts-dietitians-on-20-ways-to-cut-down-on-upfs-while-still-eating-what-you-love\">The experts: dietitians on 20 ways to cut down on UPFs while still eating what you love</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Don\u2019t forget to do both sides \u2026</h2> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re right-handed,\u201d says Sharma, \u201cyou tend to spend a lot more time brushing the left side of the mouth instinctively, because it\u2019s easier to do, and you often neglect the right side. The reverse is true for left-handed people. When we\u2019re doing a dental examination, we can guess whether someone\u2019s right-handed or left-handed, because there\u2019s that level of difference in inflammation. For my right-handed patients, I advise them to start on the right and then work their way to the left. And vice versa for those who are left-handed.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2026 and the rest of your mouth</h2> <p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not essential for dental health, brushing your tongue daily will help prevent bad breath and reduce the number of potentially harmful microbes in the mouth,\u201d says Roberts. Tongue scrapers are very useful tools for this, or a soft toothbrush can also be used.</p> <p>You need to brush the gums as well, says Sharma: \u201cAngle the bristles down at 45 degrees for the bottom teeth and up at 45 degrees for the top teeth, so you are just sweeping below the gum line between the tooth and the gum, because that is an area that is often missed and where bacteria accumulates.\u201d One of Sharma\u2019s specialisms is gum disease: \u201cAlmost 90% of the population will have some level of gingivitis. You will notice redness, swelling or bleeding of the gums. Gingivitis is reversible by improving your brushing technique and visiting your dentist and hygienist.\u201d</p> <p>The more advanced form of gum disease is periodontitis, where the gum shrinks and teeth can eventually fall out. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that periodontitis isn\u2019t a painful condition,\u201d says Sharma, \u201cas it often goes unnoticed for decades.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t wet your toothbrush</h2> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t advise you to wet your toothbrush at all,\u201d says Ajit Tanday, a fellow associate professor and consultant at Birmingham (Tanday and Sharma are married), who specialises in paediatric dentistry. \u201cAdding water to your toothbrush dilutes the toothpaste and encourages more foaming, so you spit out more of the toothpaste, as opposed to letting it sit on your teeth. This goes for everyone, not just children.\u201d</p> <h2>Establish good routines as early as possible</h2>    <p>\u201cChildren learn by mirroring,\u201d says Tanday, \u201cso if you brush your teeth together as a family, they are probably going to be more inclined to do it because it\u2019s part of their routine.\u201d She recommends gently rubbing a baby\u2019s gums with a muslin even before teeth erupt to establish the habit of cleaning. With young children, use an egg timer or app to ensure they brush for two minutes and help them to make sure a thorough job has been done. Tanday says she is often asked when a child can brush independently: it is something of a myth that if they can tie their shoelaces they can brush their teeth without help. \u201cMy advice is to check every so often what their technique is like,\u201d she says.<strong> </strong>The official guidance is until seven, but you definitely should keep an eye beyond this age, Tanday says.</p> <h2>Check up on the kids </h2> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s the result of having parents who are dentists, but Tanday has noticed that her child often fibs about brushing their teeth: \u201cThey aren\u2019t a very good liar because the toothbrush is dry.\u201d At weekends she gets around this by using a disclosing tablet after toothbrushing together: when chewed, the tablet temporarily stains plaque a bright colour, making it easy to spot the areas that need more attention. </p> <h2>Flossing is non-negotiable</h2>    <p>\u201cInterdental brushes \u2013 little brushes that go between the teeth \u2013 are the gold standard,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cIf you can\u2019t use them, standard floss is also good but it is technique-sensitive and we tend to do a better job with interdental brushes. Water flossers are better than nothing, but there\u2019s only so much plaque that can be removed by rinsing alone; the teeth need to be scrubbed in between.\u201d If flossing makes your gums bleed, \u201cit is not from overbrushing, as some people think. They bleed because they have got inflammation. It just shows you need to clean them more frequently. The bleeding will stop after about a week if you are cleaning in between your teeth and brushing along the gums consistently.\u201d</p> <h2>Manage stress</h2> <p>\u201cStress has a direct impact on your gum health by affecting your immune response,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cYou may already realise the impact of stress on your immune health if you\u2019ve noticed that when you\u2019re stressed, you are more prone to get unwell. As periodontitis is an interplay between the bacteria in your mouth and your immune response to these bacteria, things that affect your immune response, such as stress, will affect your susceptibility to periodontitis.\u201d There is also an indirect effect of stress because \u201cwhen you\u2019re stressed, you may neglect your oral hygiene. All of a sudden it is less of a priority to brush as well as you need to.\u201d</p> <h2>Get tech on your side</h2> <p>Tanday suggests using an app, such as <a href=\"https://campaignresources.dhsc.gov.uk/campaigns/school-zone/healthy-eating/nhs-food-scanner-app/nhs-food-scanner-app/\">NHS food scanner</a>, so you can see the sugar content of different foods compared with how much children should have a day. This can help in developing an awareness of things such as cereal, which is a big offender for hidden sugars. \u201cIt\u2019s not about denying children treats, but making swaps such as a square of chocolate instead of Haribo. Or giving them breadsticks and hummus as a snack rather than raisins, to reduce the sugar intake even more.\u201d Fruit is OK in moderation, although its acidity can be problematic, she says. Tanday reiterates the importance of limiting sugar to mealtimes rather than for snacking.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t resort to DIY dentistry</h2> <p>\u201cMost dental ailments are preventable with good oral hygiene at home and a good diet,\u201d<strong> </strong>says Murgatroyd.<strong> \u201c</strong>I don\u2019t recommend DIY dentistry, because you can do quite a lot of damage trying to pull out your own teeth and there can be complications, too. Try to get an emergency dentist appointment as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <h2>Try not to be scared of going to the dentist</h2>    <p>\u201cWe understand that we\u2019re not everybody\u2019s favourite place to visit,\u201d says Murgatroyd. \u201cWe are trained in looking after people who are nervous about coming to see us, but the sooner you can pluck up the courage to come in, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to look after you and help guide you with your oral health journey.\u201d That said, it is quite hard to access dentistry on the NHS in the UK, she acknowledges. \u201cThe government is making it harder and harder for NHS practices to remain NHS, and that is a combination of funding and the contract itself. So it is very difficult to get an NHS dentist at the moment. On the NHS website, it is possible to search practices to see if they might be taking on new patients. But generally practices don\u2019t have a waiting list for NHS patients.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/11/the-experts-oncologists-on-the-simple-doable-everyday-things-they-do-to-try-to-prevent-cancer\">The experts: oncologists on the simple, doable, everyday things they do to try to prevent cancer</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Having a filling is probably for the best</h2> <p>\u201cWe will never force you to have fillings,\u201d says Murgatroyd, \u201cbut if we suggest them, it will be because you have decay in a tooth. If this decay is left, we may not be able to save the tooth. Generally, if a tooth is sore, the decay has gone too far and we need to either complete a root canal treatment, if this is possible, or extract the tooth.\u201d</p> <h2>A little of what you fancy does you good</h2> <p>Finally, remember that everything is OK in moderation; even dentists sometimes indulge. \u201cI would like to say on the record that I comply with all my instructions I give to my patients,\u201d laughs Sharma. \u201cNo \u2013 I have my vices, obviously. I enjoy fizzy drinks and I have a sweet tooth. But then again, I have excellent dental care available.\u201d</p>",

The reverse is true for left-handed people. When we\u2019re doing a dental examination, we can guess whether someone\u2019s right-handed or left-handed, because there\u2019s that level of difference in inflammation. For my right-handed patients, I advise them to start on the right and then work their way to the left. And vice versa for those who are left-handed.\u201d \u2026 and the rest of your mouth \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not essential for dental health, brushing your tongue daily will help prevent bad breath and reduce the number of potentially harmful microbes in the mouth,\u201d says Roberts. Tongue scrapers are very useful tools for this, or a soft toothbrush can also be used. You need to brush the gums as well, says Sharma: \u201cAngle the bristles down at 45 degrees for the bottom teeth and up at 45 degrees for the top teeth, so you are just sweeping below the gum line between the tooth and the gum, because that is an area that is often missed and where bacteria accumulates.\u201d One of Sharma\u2019s specialisms is gum disease: \u201cAlmost 90% of the population will have some level of gingivitis. You will notice redness, swelling or bleeding of the gums. Gingivitis is reversible by improving your brushing technique and visiting your dentist and hygienist.\u201d The more advanced form of gum disease is periodontitis, where the gum shrinks and teeth can eventually fall out. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame that periodontitis isn\u2019t a painful condition,\u201d says Sharma, \u201cas it often goes unnoticed for decades.\u201d Don\u2019t wet your toothbrush \u201cWe don\u2019t advise you to wet your toothbrush at all,\u201d says Ajit Tanday, a fellow associate professor and consultant at Birmingham (Tanday and Sharma are married), who specialises in paediatric dentistry. \u201cAdding water to your toothbrush dilutes the toothpaste and encourages more foaming, so you spit out more of the toothpaste, as opposed to letting it sit on your teeth. This goes for everyone, not just children.\u201d Establish good routines as early as possible \u201cChildren learn by mirroring,\u201d says Tanday, \u201cso if you brush your teeth together as a family, they are probably going to be more inclined to do it because it\u2019s part of their routine.\u201d She recommends gently rubbing a baby\u2019s gums with a muslin even before teeth erupt to establish the habit of cleaning. With young children, use an egg timer or app to ensure they brush for two minutes and help them to make sure a thorough job has been done. Tanday says she is often asked when a child can brush independently: it is something of a myth that if they can tie their shoelaces they can brush their teeth without help. \u201cMy advice is to check every so often what their technique is like,\u201d she says. The official guidance is until seven, but you definitely should keep an eye beyond this age, Tanday says. Check up on the kids Perhaps it\u2019s the result of having parents who are dentists, but Tanday has noticed that her child often fibs about brushing their teeth: \u201cThey aren\u2019t a very good liar because the toothbrush is dry.\u201d At weekends she gets around this by using a disclosing tablet after toothbrushing together: when chewed, the tablet temporarily stains plaque a bright colour, making it easy to spot the areas that need more attention. Flossing is non-negotiable \u201cInterdental brushes \u2013 little brushes that go between the teeth \u2013 are the gold standard,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cIf you can\u2019t use them, standard floss is also good but it is technique-sensitive and we tend to do a better job with interdental brushes. Water flossers are better than nothing, but there\u2019s only so much plaque that can be removed by rinsing alone; the teeth need to be scrubbed in between.\u201d If flossing makes your gums bleed, \u201cit is not from overbrushing, as some people think. They bleed because they have got inflammation. It just shows you need to clean them more frequently. The bleeding will stop after about a week if you are cleaning in between your teeth and brushing along the gums consistently.\u201d Manage stress \u201cStress has a direct impact on your gum health by affecting your immune response,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cYou may already realise the impact of stress on your immune health if you\u2019ve noticed that when you\u2019re stressed, you are more prone to get unwell. As periodontitis is an interplay between the bacteria in your mouth and your immune response to these bacteria, things that affect your immune response, such as stress, will affect your susceptibility to periodontitis.\u201d There is also an indirect effect of stress because \u201cwhen you\u2019re stressed, you may neglect your oral hygiene. All of a sudden it is less of a priority to brush as well as you need to.\u201d Get tech on your side Tanday suggests using an app, such as NHS food scanner, so you can see the sugar content of different foods compared with how much children should have a day. This can help in developing an awareness of things such as cereal, which is a big offender for hidden sugars. \u201cIt\u2019s not about denying children treats, but making swaps such as a square of chocolate instead of Haribo. Or giving them breadsticks and hummus as a snack rather than raisins, to reduce the sugar intake even more.\u201d Fruit is OK in moderation, although its acidity can be problematic, she says. Tanday reiterates the importance of limiting sugar to mealtimes rather than for snacking. Don\u2019t resort to DIY dentistry \u201cMost dental ailments are preventable with good oral hygiene at home and a good diet,\u201d says Murgatroyd. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend DIY dentistry, because you can do quite a lot of damage trying to pull out your own teeth and there can be complications, too. Try to get an emergency dentist appointment as soon as possible.\u201d Try not to be scared of going to the dentist \u201cWe understand that we\u2019re not everybody\u2019s favourite place to visit,\u201d says Murgatroyd. \u201cWe are trained in looking after people who are nervous about coming to see us, but the sooner you can pluck up the courage to come in, the sooner we\u2019ll be able to look after you and help guide you with your oral health journey.\u201d That said, it is quite hard to access dentistry on the NHS in the UK, she acknowledges. \u201cThe government is making it harder and harder for NHS practices to remain NHS, and that is a combination of funding and the contract itself. So it is very difficult to get an NHS dentist at the moment. On the NHS website, it is possible to search practices to see if they might be taking on new patients. But generally practices don\u2019t have a waiting list for NHS patients.\u201d Having a filling is probably for the best \u201cWe will never force you to have fillings,\u201d says Murgatroyd, \u201cbut if we suggest them, it will be because you have decay in a tooth. If this decay is left, we may not be able to save the tooth. Generally, if a tooth is sore, the decay has gone too far and we need to either complete a root canal treatment, if this is possible, or extract the tooth.\u201d A little of what you fancy does you good Finally, remember that everything is OK in moderation; even dentists sometimes indulge. \u201cI would like to say on the record that I comply with all my instructions I give to my patients,\u201d laughs Sharma. \u201cNo \u2013 I have my vices, obviously. I enjoy fizzy drinks and I have a sweet tooth. But then again, I have excellent dental care available.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A Greenlandic MP has accused Copenhagen of \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d after she was ordered to leave the podium in parliament for refusing to translate her speech calling out human rights abuses against the former Danish colony.</p> <p>In the speech delivered earlier this month, Aki-Matilda H\u00f8egh-Dam paid tribute to victims of the so-called Spiral contraceptive scandal in which Greenlandic women and girls say they were fitted with an intrauterine device (IUD) by Danish doctors without their knowledge or consent.</p> <p>She gave the address in Greenlandic, the official language of the autonomous territory.</p> <p>According to parliamentary protocol, MPs are permitted to speak Greenlandic in the Folketing, or Danish parliament, but only if they translate their words into Danish immediately afterwards.</p> <p>This was not something that, in the moment, H\u00f8egh-Dam was prepared to do. She said: \u201cI just felt like \u2018Why am I even translating myself? I asked for solutions so many times, why am I even translating myself to people who are so racist?\u2019 \u2026 It was so spontaneous.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking via video link from Nuuk in her parliamentary office in Copenhagen, the 28-year-old politician said that many Danish people were ignorant of how strongly influenced by their colonial history they were, even as many identified as liberal advocates of human rights.</p> <p>\u201cSo when I try to make them aware, by speaking Greenlandic, that there are actually inequalities, that the things that they\u2019ve been taught their whole lives \u2013 that they\u2019re \u2018good\u2019 colonisers trying to teach savage people how to live a good and healthy life \u2013 it\u2019s difficult for them to understand or admit that it might not have all been good,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>H\u00f8egh-Dam, who was born in Denmark and grew up in Greenland to Greenlandic-Danish parents, added: \u201cAnd when I challenge that point of view some kind of cognitive dissonance happens, as well as the wish to fight for their own language by trying to push out my language, push out any foreign language.\u201d</p> <p>Denmark ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy, as well as that of the Faroe Islands, another autonomous Danish territory. Both countries have their own parliaments, but also have two MPs each in the Folketing.</p> <p>The Spiral scandal, which is believed to have affected 4,500 women and girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1970, has focused renewed attention on Copenhagen\u2019s colonial legacy. It is believed that authorities implemented the project as a means to reduce Greenland\u2019s population.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Danish state was sued by 143 Greenlandic women alleging they were fitted with IUDs without their knowledge.</p> <p>In her speech this month, H\u00f8egh-Dam paid tribute to Greenlandic people who she said had been subjected to experiments, women who had unknowingly lost their parental rights, and the \u201clegally fatherless\u201d \u2013 Greenlandic children whose parents were unmarried and had no right to inheritance from their Danish fathers.</p> <p>Highlighting the ongoing legal inequality between Danish and Greenlandic citizens, she said: \u201cThose who were not guaranteed their legal certainty were Greenlanders, Inuit.

      "bodyText": "A Greenlandic MP has accused Copenhagen of \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d after she was ordered to leave the podium in parliament for refusing to translate her speech calling out human rights abuses against the former Danish colony. In the speech delivered earlier this month, Aki-Matilda H\u00f8egh-Dam paid tribute to victims of the so-called Spiral contraceptive scandal in which Greenlandic women and girls say they were fitted with an intrauterine device (IUD) by Danish doctors without their knowledge or consent. She gave the address in Greenlandic, the official language of the autonomous territory. According to parliamentary protocol, MPs are permitted to speak Greenlandic in the Folketing, or Danish parliament, but only if they translate their words into Danish immediately afterwards. This was not something that, in the moment, H\u00f8egh-Dam was prepared to do. She said: \u201cI just felt like \u2018Why am I even translating myself? I asked for solutions so many times, why am I even translating myself to people who are so racist?\u2019 \u2026 It was so spontaneous.\u201d Speaking via video link from Nuuk in her parliamentary office in Copenhagen, the 28-year-old politician said that many Danish people were ignorant of how strongly influenced by their colonial history they were, even as many identified as liberal advocates of human rights. \u201cSo when I try to make them aware, by speaking Greenlandic, that there are actually inequalities, that the things that they\u2019ve been taught their whole lives \u2013 that they\u2019re \u2018good\u2019 colonisers trying to teach savage people how to live a good and healthy life \u2013 it\u2019s difficult for them to understand or admit that it might not have all been good,\u201d she said. H\u00f8egh-Dam, who was born in Denmark and grew up in Greenland to Greenlandic-Danish parents, added: \u201cAnd when I challenge that point of view some kind of cognitive dissonance happens, as well as the wish to fight for their own language by trying to push out my language, push out any foreign language.\u201d Denmark ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy, as well as that of the Faroe Islands, another autonomous Danish territory. Both countries have their own parliaments, but also have two MPs each in the Folketing. The Spiral scandal, which is believed to have affected 4,500 women and girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1970, has focused renewed attention on Copenhagen\u2019s colonial legacy. It is believed that authorities implemented the project as a means to reduce Greenland\u2019s population. Earlier this year, the Danish state was sued by 143 Greenlandic women alleging they were fitted with IUDs without their knowledge. In her speech this month, H\u00f8egh-Dam paid tribute to Greenlandic people who she said had been subjected to experiments, women who had unknowingly lost their parental rights, and the \u201clegally fatherless\u201d \u2013 Greenlandic children whose parents were unmarried and had no right to inheritance from their Danish fathers. Highlighting the ongoing legal inequality between Danish and Greenlandic citizens, she said: \u201cThose who were not guaranteed their legal certainty were Greenlanders, Inuit. Those who were guaranteed their legal certainty were Danes.\u201d But now, she added, \u201cGreenlanders are standing up and speaking out\u201d. Despite having distributed printed copies of her speech to her colleagues, she was asked to leave the lectern by the speaker of the parliament, S\u00f8ren Gade, meaning that she was unable to take questions. In an interview afterwards he stood by the decision, saying that for a debate to \u201cmake sense\u201d to other MPs and people watching on television it must also be given in Danish. This was not the first time H\u00f8egh-Dam had spoken in Greenlandic in parliament. She caused controversy last year when she did so in contravention of the parliamentary rules. As a result of her action, and the ensuing debate, protocol was changed to allow MPs to speak in Greenlandic or Faroese as long as they translate themselves into Danish immediately. On that occasion, she said, it was a considered move that she had thought about \u201cfor a very, very long time\u201d. But this time it was purely spontaneous: she had made a complaint about a fellow MP whom, she said, had questioned her Greenlandic identity several times, only to be told he had the right to do so. Meanwhile, her request for simultaneous translation services had been repeatedly declined, she said. It was \u201cthis buildup of trying to come up with solutions, and trying to be accommodating, then them not even accommodating my need for being respected for my own ethnicity\u201d. H\u00f8egh-Dam, who has been in politics since she was 14 and became the youngest politician in Folketing when she was elected in 2019 aged 22, said she had become especially aware of the inequality between Danish and Greenlandic people when she met Danish relatives. \u201cIt was so obvious to me from a very young age that they weren\u2019t smarter, they weren\u2019t more intelligent, they weren\u2019t more skilled.

Victoria\u2019s Commission for Children and Young People\u2019s (CCYP) annual report, tabled in parliament on Thursday, also revealed it received notifications regarding the deaths of 43 children known to the system in 2023-24. The report described significant service failures in the case of a 12-year-old girl, referred to by the pseudonym WD, who had been in the out-of-home care system for many years. In May this year, the charges against WD were dropped. She had a \u201chistory of significant childhood trauma\u201d, an intellectual disability and was being sexually exploited while missing from out-of-home care, the report said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Victoria\u2019s principal commissioner for children and young people, Liana Buchanan, said WD\u2019s case exposed \u201csome of the most profound service system failures I have seen\u201d, with \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d. Buchanan told Guardian Australia she shared her investigation with Jacinta Allan \u2013 the first time she had personally provided a copy to the premier \u2013 to highlight the findings of the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d case. \u201cI wanted to make sure that the details of this case and the failings in this child\u2019s experience were known to everybody who mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a child with a trauma background and complex needs, and instead of safety and stability she\u2019s had 10 different residences, dozens of different workers, including some against whom she\u2019s disclosed that they\u2019ve been violent towards her.\u201d The report said WD had been placed in residential care and had spent three years cycling through 10 different temporary homes, known as \u201ccontingency care arrangements\u201d, which cost the state more than $3m, the report said. \u201cWD\u2019s experiences in these placements and the instability she faced led to a disruption in her schooling and access to supports. This also resulted in WD increasingly leaving her placement,\u201d the CCYP said. The CCYP also identified that efforts to prevent WD\u2019s absences from out-of-home care by police, child protection and care providers were \u201cineffective\u201d, and that she received \u201cinsufficient access to forensic examinations\u201d when she attended hospital outside business hours. The CCYP said while many people and services attempted to do their best to support her, their efforts to meet her needs and reduce the risks she faced \u201cfell short\u201d. The CCYP made 19 recommendations from the inquiry into WD\u2019s care, including improving the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing\u2019s oversight and reliance on contingency placements and improve responses to child sexual exploitation. Lizzie Blandthorn, the state\u2019s minister for children, said the CCYP\u2019s report showed more could be done to \u201cbetter connect services across government for children in care\u201d.

The Dodgers are in the Bronx looking to make sure they don\u2019t leave for Los Angeles without the trophy, and to do that they\u2019ll have to beat New York at Yankee Stadium, one last time.</p> <p>How did we get here? Well, in Game 4 the Yankees finally put some big runs on the board while picking themselves up off the floor, beating Los Angeles 11-4 in a contest that was close until New York broke out with five runs in the eighth inning. Do the Yankees and their fans feel better about themselves now that they haven\u2019t been swept by LA? Oh yeah, definitely. Some of their bats woke up: Anthony Volpe hit a dramatic grand slam and Austin Wells crushed a shot off the fence before launching an eighth inning home run. Even Aaron Judge showed some signs of exiting his elongated slump. </p> <p>The problem is that LA threw out the dregs of their bullpen in a game that was designed to make sure their best relievers didn\u2019t have to pitch to ensure they\u2019re fresh for Game 5. So even if the Yankees hit double digits on Tuesday, it wasn\u2019t against LA\u2019s top talent, and they likely won\u2019t see arms that are that vulnerable for the rest of the series.</p> <p>Now if the Yanks can hit some real Dodger pitching and win this Game 5, this series will get serious in earnest. It\u2019ll mean an unsettled Dodgers team schlepping west, not for a parade but for a crucial Game 6. </p> <p>Whether that happens or not is mostly in the hands of their ace Gerrit Cole, who was handed a nine-year $324m contract in 2020 for precisely this moment. Cole must carry New York deep into this ballgame, and he needs to be way more than above average: he needs to dominate. This is the game that will define him going forward, and in a big spot like this, with an arm that perhaps isn\u2019t the healthiest, I am not sure I believe in a Cole that has been hit or miss this season. A power flash from Judge would also be useful. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Dodgers are looking to their starter Jack Flaherty for a big night. The former Tiger, acquired by LA at the trade deadline, was great in Game 1 and pitched into the sixth inning before making one bad pitch to Giancarlo Stanton. Are we going to get the good Flaherty, who dominated the Mets in Game 1 of the NLCS and was strong against the Yankees on Friday, or will we see the hurler who was absolutely thrashed by the Mets in Game 5, when the Dodgers were in the same exact situation: looking to win and avoid traveling home for more baseball.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots of questions that need answering. And perhaps you have some questions, comments, thoughts or feelings you\u2019d like to get into our live coverage.

      "bodyText": "That concludes a memorable 2024 baseball season! It doesn\u2019t seem that long ago that teams broke camp, and suddenly, it\u2019s all over and winter awaits! And the best team won, that\u2019s for sure, in five games no less: just like I said (sneaking that in there). And that\u2019s it for our live World Series coverage. As always, it\u2019s been a pleasure bringing the Fall Classic to you, wherever you are. So thank you for following along with us! And having said all of that, good morning, good afternoon and good night! The Dodgers are champs! Read all about it! Trophy time! On the wheeled in stage, the owner of the Dodgers, Stan Kasten, gets a taste of the hardware, before the President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman says a few words. Now manager Dave Roberts says \u201cthis trophy belongs to everybody\u201d, which isn\u2019t true but a very nice sentiment. And I accept! \u201cOh my! World Champions!\u201d \u2013 Dave Roberts Oh, and Freeman formally is awarded the Willie Mays MVP award. \u201cThis is everything\u2026this is it right here. Not this, that one!\u201d -Freddie Freeman, who drove in 12 runs this series, distinguishing between the MVP trophy and the World Series trophy. MVP It\u2019s not official yet, but it\u2019s got to be Freddie, right? I mean, what didn\u2019t he do? New York, New York If you grew up in a house with a Brooklyn Dodgers fan like I did, you understand the significance of a Dodgers team winning a title inside the five boroughs. Baseball\u2019s bible-esque super story of the Yankees, Dodgers, Giants and Mets is central to the sport and lives on as the team from Flatbush celebrate a title in LA. How it ended From Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the Dodgers are champions for an eighth time in franchise history. And it\u2019s the fourth time they have beaten New York in doing so. Can you believe it? We were in the fifth inning and wondering how Roberts would manage the Dodgers staff to make sure they were fresh for a Game 6 in LA. But there isn\u2019t going to be a Game 6 because the Dodgers have completed the biggest comeback in a World Series clinching victory. And because the Yankees completely fell apart, committing mental error after mental error in a ghastly performance that showed exactly what they are, which is a team that wasn\u2019t true World Series caliber. But never mind that \u2013 LA celebrate a non-shortened season title for the first time since 1988. Yes, they have a loaded roster, but they\u2019re an extraordinary club who deserve to be champs. And also, manager Dave Roberts has come a very long way \u2013 he was tremendous pulling the strings for the Dodgers in this series. Swing and a miss and it\u2019s all over! The Dodgers have won the World Series!! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th It\u2019s 1-2 and the Yankees are down to their final strike! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th Wells whiffs at a breaking ball! LA are an out away from a title! And it\u2019s up to Alex Verdugo, which no Yankee fan ever wants to see, ever! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th Low and in \u2013 full count! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th Wells fouls one off and the at-bat continues! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th It\u2019s 2-2 and very tense at Yankee Stadium right now! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th Volpe grounds to third \u2013 Muncy makes the play, fires to first, in time to get the first out of this inning! Two to go for LA, and here is Austin Wells! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 9th Now Buehler, a beautiful pitcher who has been destroyed by injuries, was having an awful year before finding his old self against the Mets in the NLCS. But this is a very different situation and a very tall order. Volpe is at the plate. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Leiter gets Smith to ground out to Chisholm who makes a spin-o-rama play at third before making the throw. That\u2019s one heck of a play from a guy who never played the hot corner until recently. Great work. That said, the Dodgers take the field three outs from a World Series title! And here comes Walker Buehler, a starter, who pitched two days ago, to try and pitch LA into the history books! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Edman waves at a curveball \u2013 strike three! A huge out by Leiter! Can he get out of this jam? Will Smith is next! Two down. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Full count to Edman! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th The Yankees have committed three errors tonight and that doesn\u2019t even come close to telling the story of the shoddiest play I\u2019ve ever seen from a World Series team. Edman is even in the count 2-2. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Hernandez walks because Weaver is completely done, as everyone on the planet and Pluto knows. First and second, one out, Edman coming up, Mark Leiter Jr coming in. And nothing against Mark Leiter Jr, but I wouldn\u2019t want the season on his shoulders. That said, hey, you never know, right? Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Weaver throws over to first base for a third time, and he\u2019s not allowed to do that! That\u2019s a balk! More mental mistakes for the Yankees! Good lord is this real? So that insurance run is now in scoring position for Hernandez. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Muncy smokes a ball to right but Soto is there for the first out. Here\u2019s Kike Hernandez with one out and one on. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 9th Hernandez starts off the Dodger ninth with a base hit to left off Weaver! And Weaver must be exhausted, but really, NY have no one left of consequence. Chris Taylor runs for Hernandez. If\u2026 \u2026LA win this game it will be because the Yankees threw it away with both hands. And because Treinen and his manager have some serious stones. Rizzo chases a breaking ball in the dirt! And what an absolutely epic performance by Blake Treinen! He throws 40 plus high stress pitches, allowing no runs in 2.1 innings, striking out three to get LA within three outs of an eighth World Series title! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th Treinen is ahead 0-2 on Rizzo! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th Stanton pops the first pitch he sees into foul grond ion the right side! Betts is there \u2013 he makes the catch! Two down! It\u2019s up to Rizzo in the Yankees eighth! Roberts is sticking with Treinen. It\u2019s big boy time! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th Ball four almost hits Chisholm. Two on, one out for Stanton. Roberts is coming to the mound. Treinen has to be gassed, but LA\u2019s skipper is going to stick with him! I think that\u2019s a mistake. He looks done to me. Burt we\u2019ll find out who is right soon! Here we go! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th A pitch high in the strike zone \u2013 Chisholm was on his way to first! But it\u2019s 3-1. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th 3-0 to Chisholm! Stanton is on deck! Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th Judge cracks a double down the left field line! Muncy came very close to catching that ball at third base \u2013 wow! So life for the Yankees as a hit can tie perhaps this game. Treinen is over 30 pitches. Ouch! Chisholm at the plate. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th Full count! Foul back. We'll do it again\u2026 Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th Judge fouls one back. It\u2019s even at 2-2. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th It\u2019s 2-1 to Judge\u2026 Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, bottom 8th OK, so it\u2019s actually Soto leading off, facing Treinen, who has 21 pitches facing some very big bats. And Soto grounds to first: Freeman has it and tosses to Treinen. One out. Here\u2019s Judge in the biggest at-bat of his career. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 8th Freeman chases a pitch low and away \u2013 strike three! So the Yankees get a crucial out and end the inning to stay in touch. It\u2019s still a disaster for new York, who surrender two runs and the lead thanks to a broken bat hit and an interference call of all things. What a mess! The good news for NY? Soto is leading off. Dodgers 7-6 Yankees, top 8th Two down and runners at the corners for Freddie Freeman, who can give LA some insurance with a knock here. The call is confirmed! Now Betts comes to the plate! He skies the very first ball to centerfield and that also is going to be deep enough! Two straight sacrifice flies give LA a late lead! Can you believe this? Lux hits a fly ball to center \u2013 it\u2019s deep enough to score the tying run! LA have leveled in the eighth! And now it\u2019s runners at the corners, and it\u2019s guess who \u2013 Ohtani! But wait, hang on! The umpire is calling catchers interference on the first pitch! That puts Ohtani at first! Are you kidding me?! NY are going to challenge this, but if it stands, its a total disaster for NY. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Full count! Wow! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Check swing. Did he go? Yes he did! It\u2019s 2-2! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Ball in the dirt \u2013 Lux ahead 2-1. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Here we go! Weaver v Lux in a season defining spot! Bases full, Yanks up a run, nobody out! How will it end? Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th OK, Boone comes to get Kahnle, which was a bad selection to begin with. Luke Weaver will come in for the third straight game to do some heavy, heavy lifting. The good news for New York fans? Weaver may be crazy enough to not give a damn about the situation he\u2019s just been dropped in. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Rizzo creeps in at first base for a bunt that\u2019s not going to happen. No idea what he is thinkng. But it\u2019s 3-1! And now it\u2019s ball four! Bases loaded, nobody out! If Boone doesn\u2019t get Kahnle now he\u2019s crazy. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Meeting at the mound\u2026it\u2019s quiet in the Bronx. You can see this coming a mile away, and it\u2019s not good for Yankees fans. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th And Hernandez singles to left! Yup! The changeup thing against the Dodgers? I\u2019m a skeptic. And then Edman has a broken bat infield hit! See what I\u2019m saying? Will Smith is up, and again, he is due!! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 8th Tommy Kahnle is in for New York, which is scary for me if I\u2019m a Yankees fan. He faces Kike Hernandez. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, bottom 7th Torres grounds out to third. Inning over. To the eighth! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, bottom 7th Verdugo watches a sweeper on the corner \u2013 strike three. Two down. Here is Torres. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, bottom 7th Treinen is back out for the eighth and strikes out Wells. One down for Verdugo. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Muncy is stunned by the sweeper \u2013 strike three! LA leave two runners as the Yankees take a tiny lead into the stretch! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Full count! That just missed up and away! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Muncy fouls off a pitch \u2013 it\u2019s 1-2. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Five straight balls from Holmes. Then finally a strike. It\u2019s 1-1. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Hernandez walks. So a pair of two-out runners for Max Muncy in a huge spot right here. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Now it\u2019s 3-0. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Hernandez is ahead in the count, 2-0. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Cole walks Freeman and now here comes Aaron Boone to get Cole, an out short of seven innings. He wanted to stay in but he heads to the dugout and is saluted by the fans. He gave up five runs, though none were earned. Clay Holmes comes in to try and get Hernandez for the third out. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Betts hits a come-backer to Cole who makes the stab! He throws to first for the out! Two down, and Freddie Freeman steps to the plate. Cole on 105 pitches. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, top 7th Cole is back out for more, which makes sense to me. He\u2019s facing Ohtani, who is definitely not right. He grounds out to second for the first out. Here\u2019s Mookie Betts. Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, bottom 6th The count is full to Volpe! The runners on first and second will run with the pitch. Treinen deals, and Volpe grounds to second \u2013 Lux has it, makes the throw to first, side retired! But the Yankees regain the lead! Dodgers 5-6 Yankees, bottom 6th Rizzo walks. That\u2019s Graterol\u2019s third walk so Roberts has had enough of that nonsense and is bringing in his biggest gun to keep this game close. Closer Blake Treinen is on his way to the mound. NY need to get more runs in an inning where three batters walk, I\u2019m just going to make that extra clear. Stanton hits a fly ball deep enough to center to score Soto, who tags at third to give the Yankees a slim lead. Chisholm aggressively tags up at first and barely makes it to second! So NY have a two out runner at scoring position for Rizzo, who is seeking to extend the Yankees lead. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 6th Chisholm bounces to second \u2013 Lux tosses to Edman to get the force, but that\u2019s it. So runners at the corners for Giancarlo Stanton, who bats with everyone in the ballpark on its feet. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 6th Chisholm squares to bunt! It\u2019s foul and now he\u2019s down in the count 0-2! Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 6th Judge walks as Graterol barely misses on the up and outside part of the zone. Two on, nobody out. Here\u2019s Jazz Chisholm, who homered earlier, in a huge spot in this ballgame. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 6th It\u2019s 3-2 to Judge. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 6th Soto walks. Yikes. Now Judge is coming up. Can he make up for that insane drop in center field in the fifth? Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 6th Brusdar Graterol is in, so this should be fun. He starts off by throwing in the direction of Juan Soto, who is quickly up in the count 2-0. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, top 6th Lux pops out, inning over. Cole is on 87 pitches but bounced back well that inning. I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to take him out. It\u2019s his last start of the season \u2013 go batter by batter in the seventh. Oh, apparently we haven\u2019t had a pitcher throw 100 pitches in the postseason in two years, some 27 games? Did I hear FOX TV in the US right? If so is totally pathetic. Judge is coming up this inning for NY. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, top 6th Cole reaches back and blows a fastball by Smith. Two down. It\u2019s up to Lux in the Dodger sixth. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, top 6th Edman pops out to left. One down. Here\u2019s Smith, who I continue to believe is due. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th Torres pops out to left. Inning over! New York can\u2019t take advantage of Vesia, who eventually gets that all-important shut down inning. What an inning. What does Cole have left? Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th Vesia walks Verdugo, which is like walking a tree. It\u2019s absolutely insane. So from two outs and nobody on to two outs and bases loaded. Will Torres re-energize this crowd? Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th It\u2019s 3-0 to Verdugo. Why? Throw him a strike. He can\u2019t hit it! Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th Wells is hit in the forearm! So he takes first, and this two-out action is not what LA needed. Can Alex Verdugo deliver? He almost always doesn\u2019t. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th Volpe pokes a ball through the hole between first and second, so NY have a two-out base runner for Austin Wells. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th Rizzo lifts a fly ball to center \u2013 Hernandez is there to make the catch. Two outs. Here\u2019s Volpe. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, bottom 5th Vesia is on now to pitch, looking for that all-important shut down inning. He\u2019s off to a good start, getting Stanton to bounce out. One down for Rizzo. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, top 5th Hernandez bounces to short and Volpe makes the play. He tags second for the force play that ends this disaster of an inning for new York. LA had no hits entering the fifth. They got one, then Judge dropped a routine ball, Volpe threw a ball in the dirt, Cole didn\u2019t cover first, and LA delivered key, clutch hits. Just wow, wow, wow! Talk about a meltdown. Dodgers 5-5 Yankees, top 5th Muncy walks, and finally there\u2019s a meeting at the mound. Cole, who was rolling heading into this inning, looks totally gassed! Hernandez, who started this inning, is up for a second try at it this frame. Hernandez hits a ball over the head of Judge! The bases clear! Hernandez has a two-run double! Can you believe this? The Dodgers have scored five runs in the fifth inning thanks to some of the shoddiest defense I have ever seen in a World Series game! Absolutely inexplicable. It\u2019s deathly quiet in the Bronx! And no wonder! They can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re seeing! Nobody visits Cole. Not a pitching coach. Not a fielder. Nothing. They leave him to melt. Dodgers 3-5 Yankees, top 5th Hernandez is in the hole 0-2. Then he lets a slider away pass. It\u2019s 1-2. Freeman put bat on ball and it\u2019s a base hit to center field! Two runs come in to score! The sky is falling in the Bronx! It\u2019s a two-run game! And Cole\u2019s pitch count is soaring! Runners at the corners with two down for Hernandez! Dodgers 1-5 Yankees, top 5th Nobody can watch at Yankee Stadium after this defensive mess. It\u2019s 1-2 to Freeman. Betts grounds to first but Cole doesn\u2019t cover first! How does he not cover first? That is absolutely inexcusable and unfathomable! Three huge gaffes in this inning by NY. So far it\u2019s only cost NY a run. Can Freeman cash in more? Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, top 5th Ohtani waves at a breaking ball! That\u2019s strike three! After loading the bases, Cole has come back with two huge K\u2019s! But here comes Betts. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, top 5th Huge cut by Lux on a 1-1 pitch and it flies right by him! He was going for it all there! Now Cole comes back with more cheese \u2013 it\u2019s a 99mph fastball. Strike three! That\u2019s one down, but now Ohtani steps to the plate. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, top 5th Smith hits a grounder to shortstop \u2013 Volpe throws it to third to try and get the lead runner but the ball is in the dirt and Chisholm can\u2019t dig it out! Two errors have helped to load the bases for LA! Wow! Can Gavin Lux deliver? Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, top 5th The Dodgers have traffic on the bases on the fifth. Kike Hernandez whacks LA\u2019s first single, then Judge drops an Edman routine fly ball in center field! Whoa! So suddenly it\u2019s first and second with nobody out! Will Smith comes up in a high stakes at-bat! Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 4th Chisholm looks at strike three \u2013 inning over. The Dodgers finally have a blank frame to their name. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 4th Judge just misses a second home run, getting under a Koech pitch a lifting it sky high, short of the fence. A very loud second out! Here\u2019s Chisholm. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 4th Soto takes the first pitch he sees to right field for a hit. So first and second for Judge with just one out. Ru roh. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 4th Michel Kopech comes in for LA and walks Verdugo, which is ridiculous because he could not hit water if he fell out of a boat. Then Torres hits a super high fly ball to short which is easy for Edman. One out, here\u2019s Soto. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, top 4th Muncy flies out to center: inning over! Cole needs 49 pitches to get through four no-hit innings. Yeah, I said it. Freeman drives a ball to one of the deepest parts of Yankee Stadium \u2013 Judge is running full speed - he reaches out and makes a fantastic grab before hitting the wall! Judge has a home run and now robs Freeman of a run scoring extra base hit with phenomenal defense! It\u2019s all coming up Yankees! Now Hernandez grounds out to short \u2013 two down! Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, top 4th Dodgers manager Dave Roberts is interviewed by FOX TV in the US, and it\u2019s clear from his comments that he\u2019s thinking about Game 6 as far as the arms he puts out there tonight. If the Yankees wanted to get really creative, they\u2019d life Cole after five so he\u2019s be ready for bullpen work in Game 7. Meanwhile, Betts draws a lead off walk. Here comes Freeman. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 3rd Wells checks his swing but he went too far. Strike three, inning over. But not before another Yankee blast! Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 3rd Ryan Brasier gets Volpe to fly out to right field. Two down for Wells. Dodgers 0-5 Yankees, bottom 3rd Rizzo hits a ball on the screws but Betts makes a fine catch in right field. One out here in the third as the crowd continues to buzz. Stanton launches a ball over the short right field Yankee Stadium porch! The Bombers lineup is erupting in Game 5! The readers write! Jenna Brown is looking for retribution! \u201cI am writing about two NY Yankees fans, Austin Capobianco and John Peter, and their assault on a player, Mookie Betts. Their attack on a player was not spontaneous but planned long ago. What they did was assault and battery. They do not care about the sport or the players. It is the responsibility of the stadium and the management to provide a safe space for players and guests alike. I applaud the decision to eject the two from the stadium and then ban them from attending Game 5. But the two offenders have generated a lot of publicity. Some of their admirers make light of their assault and some praise them as heroes. Really?? At the very least, Capobianco and Peter owe baseball an authentic and public apology. If they can\u2019t do that, and until they do, MLB should ban them from all baseball stadiums.\u201d A ban seems appropriate. You cannot do that. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, top 3rd Ohtani is down in the count quickly: it\u2019s 0-2! Now he lifts a ball to left field, it\u2019s easy for Verdugo who makes the catch! Inning over! NY survive that walk, which means the worm is turning! Cole gets through three innings with just 36 pitches. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, top 3rd Cole comes back with a fastball for a strike, so now the count is full. Fans on their feet in the Bronx as they look for three perfect innings from Cole. But Lux walks! That\u2019s the first base runner for LA, and you just can\u2019t walk a guy like Lux with Ohtani on deck. As good as Cole has been, that\u2019s criminal. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, top 3rd Cole falls behind Lux 3-1, which we haven\u2019t seen much of so far. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, top 3rd Smith pops out to first base. Two down. It\u2019s up to Lux to keep this inning going. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, top 3rd Edman at the plate, down 0-2 in the count. Then he wastes a few pitches, which is what LA need to do: take any opportunity to tax Cole with extra pitches. Then he strikes out \u2013 one down. Here\u2019s Smith. Tweeting in\u2026 That\u2019s the question. Dave Roberts doesn\u2019t want to tax his bullpen too much if he\u2019s going home for a Game 6, so we could be in gar-bage time early if New York get a few more. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd Chisholm bounces to first base \u2013 Freeman tosses to Banda who is late in covering but just gets the diving runner. So that will do it \u2013 the Yankees strand three but add a run. It could have been a lot more: remember that missed opportunity if LA get back in this game later. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd Ball four \u2013 bases loaded for Jazz Chisholm with two outs. This could be the game. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd Judge is ahead in the count, 3-1. Dangerous pitch right here. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd It\u2019s 1-1 to Judge! How will it end? Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd Ball four! Soto is on, and Judge is coming to the plate with two men on base. He can really open this game up right here. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd Full count to Soto. The fans are up on their feet, looking for more Yankee runs! Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd Ball in the dirt and Verdugo takes off! He reaches second without a throw on the wild pitch. It\u2019s 2-1 to Soto who has a runner in scoring position. Dodgers 0-4 Yankees, bottom 2nd One on and one out for Torres against Banda, who has allowed just one run in 7.1 innings pitched this postseason. Three pitches and Torres is gone, strike three. Two outs. Soto is next. Verdugo lifts a Flaherty pitch over Lux who was playing in. That\u2019s an RBI base hit! The Yankees tack on here in their second inning, and after just nine batters, Jack Flaherty is done for the night! Here comes the high leverage arms of the Dodgers pen, a lot early than they would have liked. Anthony Banda is on his way into the game. He\u2019ll face the top of the lineup starting with Torres. Dodgers 0-3 Yankees, bottom 2nd Anthony Volpe, who had the dramatic grand slam in Game 4 is up and delivers a line shot down the left field line! That\u2019s extra bases for Volpe who lands at second base with a leaf off double! Wells, who had his first multi-hit game in 50 days on Tuesday is up now, but he bounces out to first. The good news? Volpe moves to third on the play. One down and the infield moves in now guarding against a fourth Yankee run as Versugo steps in. Dodgers 0-3 Yankees, top 2nd Cole fires a strike low in the zone that Muncy watches go by. Strike three. Now Hernandez pops out to right field. That\u2019s six straight retired by Cole to start this game, and he needed just 19 pitches to do it. Dodgers fans swallow hard. Dodgers 0-3 Yankees, top 2nd Teoscar Hernandez can\u2019t touch the Cole slider away. He\u2019s got it tonight, at least so far. One down. Here\u2019s Muncy. Dodgers 0-3 Yankees, bottom 1st Rizzo strikes out, but what a start for new York here in Game 5. Now Cole must deliver a shut down inning to keep this momentum going. Double trouble: Judge, then Chisholm Dodgers 0-3 Yankees, bottom 1st Flaherty needs to settle down and get some outs, because another bullpen game is not ideal for the Dodgers moving forward. Stanton hits a rope to center field \u2013 Hernandez slips, but gathers himself and makes the catch for the second out. Rizzo is next. So that will settle some stomachs in the Bronx. And so will this! A huge blast by Chisholm into the right field seats! Back-to-back home runs for the Yankees! And just like Flaherty was battered in Game 5 of the NLCS v the Mets after a great Game 1, the Yankees are battering the Dodger hurler here in the fifth game of the World Series! First pitch, Judge swings and he\u2019s all over it. It\u2019s an opposite field, two run blast that sends Yankee Stadium into a frenzy! Their MVP has delivered and given New York an early lead! Yeah, Flaherty didn\u2019t want to walk Soto there. Dodgers 0-0 Yankees, bottom 1st Flaherty falls behind the slugger \u2013 it\u2019s 3-0 to Soto before the righty sends in a strike. Then Soto lays off a pitch low and away \u2013 that\u2019s ball four! One on for Aaron Judge. Half a city expects! Dodgers 0-0 Yankees, bottom 1st OK, Cole did his thing, how about Flaherty? He\u2019s ahead on Torres 0-2 before planting a ball in the dirt. The 1-2 slider is bounced to second base \u2013 that\u2019s routine for Lux who fires to first for the first out. Now Juan Soto, in what could be his last game as a New York Yankee, steps into the batters box. Dodgers 0-0 Yankees, top 1st Freeman hits an opposite field fly ball that\u2019s well short of the fence. Catch is made, side retired! It\u2019s a 1-2-3 inning with no high stress pitches for Cole. It\u2019s exactly what he needed to come out and do. Now here come the Yankees! Dodgers 0-0 Yankees, top 1st Betts hits a little roller up the first base line. Rizzo scoops it up, steps on first base, and that\u2019s the second out. Freddie Feeman is up with nobody on, which is best practice for New York. On an unseasonably warm evening in the Bronx, Game 5 is underway! Gerrit Cole crouches down and has a few thoughts before climbing the hill and facing Shohei Ohtani. The fastball is hit high in the air to center field \u2013 Aaron Judge makes an easy catch for the first out of the game. Mookie Betts steps up to the plate. Prediction time For those of you keeping score at home, I picked the Dodgers in five games. As this is Game 5, this is my moment! Tonight, my pick comes true: the champs and the game total \u2013 nice! The score? 6-4, of course. National Anthem Tonight it\u2019s Babyface! And he\u2019s very shiny in his black jacket \u2013 I like the look. Very soothing and solid performance: I\u2019ll give him a score of 8/10, which I think puts him towards the top of the 2024 World Series national anthem standings. This is what he sounded like at the NBA All-Star Game, but tonight, there was no guitar. Tweeting in\u2026 FF = Freddie Freeman, who has hit a home run in six consecutive World Series games. Lucky seven for FF tonight? The readers say\u2026 David Athya writes: \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that the Dodgers don\u2019t win the big prize but tonight, at least, is harder to call and if the Yankees can even just take it back to Los Angeles then it keeps the drama going! Looks a straight up duel between Cole and Flaherty; whatever man is standing the longest the better chance his team have of winning. Yankees should have had a morale boost with the batting output last night. Everyone is expecting Judge to produce eventually but I think Stanton is the man to watch.\u201d Well, I don\u2019t know about unthinkable. You can imagine a scenario in which Cole delivers tonight sending everyone back to Los Angeles. Then LA would completely destroy Carlos Rodon while Yoshinobu Yamamoto keeps the Yankees bats at bay in Game 6. If Judge is going to produce in this series, he\u2019s running out of time. Lineups! I\u2019m surprised the Yankees haven\u2019t put Stanton back where he belongs, which is right behind Judge. Tommy Edman moves up the lineup for LA, which makes sense because he\u2019s the NLCS MVP. Bronx Zoo update By now you may be familiar with the Austin Capobianco and his friend who basically assaulted Mookie Betts as he chased down a foul ball near the stands in right filed Tuesday. Well, they\u2019re banned from Game 5, which makes sense. In fact, ESPN reported that the offenders were told that if they even tried to get inside Yankee Stadium for Game 5, they\u2019d be arrested. What\u2019s amazing, is that initially, the duo were told they could actually come back and watch World Series baseball. At some point, somebody from somewhere told the Yankees to lock these gentlemen out. Oh, and it turns out that Capobianco was friends with Rob Gronkowski in college, and spoke about his buddy glowingly on Wednesday. Only in America! Hello! Welcome to our live coverage of Game 5 of the 120th World Series! The Dodgers are in the Bronx looking to make sure they don\u2019t leave for Los Angeles without the trophy, and to do that they\u2019ll have to beat New York at Yankee Stadium, one last time. How did we get here? Well, in Game 4 the Yankees finally put some big runs on the board while picking themselves up off the floor, beating Los Angeles 11-4 in a contest that was close until New York broke out with five runs in the eighth inning. Do the Yankees and their fans feel better about themselves now that they haven\u2019t been swept by LA? Oh yeah, definitely. Some of their bats woke up: Anthony Volpe hit a dramatic grand slam and Austin Wells crushed a shot off the fence before launching an eighth inning home run. Even Aaron Judge showed some signs of exiting his elongated slump. The problem is that LA threw out the dregs of their bullpen in a game that was designed to make sure their best relievers didn\u2019t have to pitch to ensure they\u2019re fresh for Game 5. So even if the Yankees hit double digits on Tuesday, it wasn\u2019t against LA\u2019s top talent, and they likely won\u2019t see arms that are that vulnerable for the rest of the series. Now if the Yanks can hit some real Dodger pitching and win this Game 5, this series will get serious in earnest. It\u2019ll mean an unsettled Dodgers team schlepping west, not for a parade but for a crucial Game 6. Whether that happens or not is mostly in the hands of their ace Gerrit Cole, who was handed a nine-year $324m contract in 2020 for precisely this moment. Cole must carry New York deep into this ballgame, and he needs to be way more than above average: he needs to dominate. This is the game that will define him going forward, and in a big spot like this, with an arm that perhaps isn\u2019t the healthiest, I am not sure I believe in a Cole that has been hit or miss this season. A power flash from Judge would also be useful. Meanwhile, the Dodgers are looking to their starter Jack Flaherty for a big night. The former Tiger, acquired by LA at the trade deadline, was great in Game 1 and pitched into the sixth inning before making one bad pitch to Giancarlo Stanton. Are we going to get the good Flaherty, who dominated the Mets in Game 1 of the NLCS and was strong against the Yankees on Friday, or will we see the hurler who was absolutely thrashed by the Mets in Game 5, when the Dodgers were in the same exact situation: looking to win and avoid traveling home for more baseball. There\u2019s lots of questions that need answering. And perhaps you have some questions, comments, thoughts or feelings you\u2019d like to get into our live coverage. If so, feel free to tweet or email me and I\u2019ll do my best to make you famous. They\u2019ll be more live World Series coverage to come - stick with us! David will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look back at Tuesday night\u2019s Game 4, where the Yankees staved off elimination.",

      "bodyText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers are World Series champions for an eighth time after roaring back from five runs down to win 7-6 over the New York Yankees in a tightly wound Game 5 clincher on Wednesday night in the Bronx. The Yankees appeared bound to send a series they\u2019d once trailed 3-0 back to Los Angeles for a sixth game when Aaron Judge and Jazz Chisholm Jr pounced on Dodgers starter Jack Flaherty with back-to-back homers in the first inning, staking a 3-0 lead while igniting the rollicking sold-out crowd of 49,263. Alex Verdugo\u2019s RBI single in the second chased Flaherty after just four outs, while Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s solo shot to right in the third extended the margin to 5-0. But the Dodgers piled on five unearned runs to go level in the fifth behind a series of dreadful errors from the Yankees and RBI hits from Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, all off Yankee starter Gerrit Cole, who\u2019d brought a no-hitter into the frame. Miscues by Judge in center and Game 4 hero Anthony Volpe, compounded by Cole\u2019s failure to cover first on Betts\u2019 grounder, left the contest on a knife\u2019s edge. The Yankees nosed ahead 6-5 on a Stanton sacrifice fly in the sixth, but the Dodgers took the lead for good in the eighth on a pair of sacrifice flies by Gavin Lux and Mookie Betts off Luke Weaver after having loaded the bases with no outs against Tommy Kahnle. New York made one final push in the bottom of the eighth when Judge reached second on a one-out double off Blake Treinen and Chisholm walked on five pitches to set the table for Stanton. But Treinen coaxed the Yankees\u2019 $325m designated hitter into a pop-out to short right field before striking out Anthony Rizzo on a nasty 85mph sweeper to end the threat. \u201cI looked in his eyes. I said how you feeling? How much more you got?\u201d Roberts said of his mount visit to Treinen after walking Chisholm. \u201cHe said: \u2018I want it.\u2019 I trust him.\u201d Game 3 winner Walker Buehler, making his first relief appearance in more than six years, struck out Verdugo swinging for the final out after many of the Yankee faithful had already filed out of the stadium, putting the finishing touches on the Dodgers\u2019 second title in five years and their seventh since controversially leaving Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1958. The 30-year-old Buehler became only the second pitcher in World Series history to earn a win as a starter and record the save in the clinching victory after Madison Bumgarner, who did it for the San Francisco Giants in 2014.

He said the company was refunding customers, waiving outstanding debts, and allowing customers to keep the devices. Venter said disciplinary action, including terminations, had been taken against staff determined to be responsible for the alleged misconduct. Optus had invested more than $5m in a dedicated specialist care team and developed a new vulnerable customer policy, he said. The ACCC alleges that Optus put undue pressure on some customers to buy a large number of products, including expensive phones and accessories, while not undertaking coverage checks to see if they had Optus mobile network coverage where they lived.

In Mount Isa, the ACCC alleges that Optus acted unconscionably by pursuing debts for at least 42 consumers from Mount Isa and remote parts of the NT, despite some senior executives knowing that the debts related to contracts which were fraudulently created by a staff member at the licensee-operated store. The remainder of the cases include claims that sales staff manipulated credit check results to sell goods and services the customers could not afford, without the customers\u2019 knowledge, and failed to explain the terms and conditions of contracts in an understandable manner. The ACCC is seeking declarations and orders for penalties, non-party consumer redress, publication orders, a compliance program and costs.

Over the course of nearly a week, the prime minister has batted away questions, downplayed the growing controversy, and eventually answered the question that had been asked of him since Saturday. On Thursday morning, the prime minister\u2019s office eventually said there had been no contact of any kind from Albanese to anyone at Qantas about his flight upgrades. This is how the week unfolded. Saturday Extracts from The Chairman\u2019s Lounge, a book from former Australian Financial Review journalist Joe Aston, are published in the Nine newspapers. The book states Albanese declared flight upgrades on about 20 Qantas flights between 2009 and 2019 while he occupied various positions including transport minister, shadow transport minister and opposition leader.

Albanese, at the time, was in Samoa for the Chogm meeting. Sunday Albanese returns to Sydney. In a brief doorstop at a cultural festival, he tries to downplay the reporting and defends his conduct. \u201cFrom time to time, members of parliament receive upgrades, what\u2019s important is that they are declared,\u201d he said. The prime minister explains some flights were work-related, including one non-commercial flight to promote a new Qantas route and 10 during the Labor leadership campaign when he unsuccessfully sought to be elected party leader. Albanese is not asked whether he liaised directly with Joyce on upgrades, but he also did not rule it out proactively. Monday Albanese does not give any public comments. Numerous federal ministers are asked about the story, giving strong defences of Albanese and his disclosures. The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, calls the story \u201crumours that have been put around unsourced by a journalist\u201d. Tuesday Albanese holds a press conference in Newcastle on a Tafe announcement. After requesting journalists ask him \u201clocal questions\u201d on the announcement first, his opening answer to Qantas questions sees him go on the attack \u2013 against the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and Aston himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to declare any flights on private jets owned by billionaires like Gina Rinehart because I haven\u2019t engaged in it, as simple as that,\u201d Albanese said. Albanese\u2019s register of interests includes a declaration of a helicopter flight from billionaire Linfox owner Lindsay Fox for a \u201cprivate lunch\u201d at his Portsea mansion. Dutton accepted flights in 2022 from Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting, including a Perth-to-Pilbara air fare and flights between Sydney, Rockhampton and Mackay to attend a Bali bombing memorial. In 2023 he was flown to a party at Hancock\u2019s Pilbara mine by another billionaire rich-lister, where he praised Rinehart\u2019s contribution to Australia. Asked directly whether he had called Joyce seeking an upgrade, Albanese repeatedly evades questions, saying: \u201cWell you can\u2019t just \u2013 there\u2019s no accusation being made with any specifics at all about any of this.\u201d A journalist counters: \u201cI\u2019m asking a specific question.\u201d Albanese responds: \u201cPeople are, Peter Dutton is making this statement.

He says \u201cthe only discussions I can recall with Alan Joyce\u201d were about the first flight from Australia to Dubai on a Qantas A380. Albanese refers to Aston as a \u201cperson who is trying to sell a book\u201d and complained \u201cI don\u2019t see declarations that he\u2019s a former Liberal party staffer\u201d. Aston tweets shortly after that the information was \u201cdisclosed on the first line of the first page of the book\u201d. Wednesday Albanese does not hold any public appearances. About 6pm on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the prime minister on Wednesday says \u201cthe prime minister did not ever call Alan Joyce seeking an upgrade\u201d. \u201cAll travel has been appropriately declared and is a matter of public record.\u201d The statement does not expressly rule out other forms of contact with Joyce beyond a phone call, such as emails or text messages, nor did it deny contact with other Qantas employees seeking an upgrade.

The WSL, while it governs professional surfing, is primarily an entertainment company. Yet, a surf contest in a wave pool is the least entertaining form of surfing. The waves are all the same.

So why push this event?</p>    <p>The WSL hasn\u2019t made public how much it was paid to turn a blind eye to the problems in the UAE and bring surfing to the Gulf, but presumably it was a significant amount, given it already has its own wave pool made with the same technology in California and the event has been added to the 2025 calendar, rather than replacing another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/sydneys-laura-enerver-crowned-surfer-of-the-year-after-slaying-record-breaking-13-metre-wave\">Australian Laura Enever crowned surfer of the year for slaying biggest, heaviest waves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UAE promotes itself through the world of sport as part of a broader Gulf Cooperation Council strategy to encourage tourism and foreign investment in the region by hosting major sporting events.

Will the WSL consider the petition and prioritise the safety of its surfers, sending a message to all those watching that the rights and safety of LGBTQI people matter? Or will Wright be forced to not attend?

Yet, a surf contest in a wave pool is the least entertaining form of surfing. The waves are all the same. The turns are basically identical. Personality, risk and drama are all gone. So why push this event? The WSL hasn\u2019t made public how much it was paid to turn a blind eye to the problems in the UAE and bring surfing to the Gulf, but presumably it was a significant amount, given it already has its own wave pool made with the same technology in California and the event has been added to the 2025 calendar, rather than replacing another. The UAE promotes itself through the world of sport as part of a broader Gulf Cooperation Council strategy to encourage tourism and foreign investment in the region by hosting major sporting events. But this sports diplomacy, when it\u2019s done without actually fixing the problems it\u2019s been criticised for, is known as \u201csports-washing.\u201d It takes two to tango and the decision to bring a Championship Tour event to a location known to target and imprison critics of its government, be involved in one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world unfolding in Sudan, and impose heavy prison sentences on queer people, lies with the WSL. So what now? Will the WSL consider the petition and prioritise the safety of its surfers, sending a message to all those watching that the rights and safety of LGBTQI people matter? Or will Wright be forced to not attend? Because from where we\u2019re sitting, it seems that forcing the person who has forged a path of inclusivity in professional surfing to hide who she is is a far higher price than anyone should have to pay for the perfect wave.",

With six days until the 2024 election, more than 57.5 million Americans have already voted as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Of the 57 million, just over 30 million voted early in-person and about 27 million voted by early mail. A new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by six points in Wisconsin and five points in Michigan, key battleground states. Harris leads Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. The candidates are tied at 48% in Pennsylvania. Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Nicky Jam has withdrawn his support for Donald Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. \u201cNever in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico deserves respect,\u201d he said. Trump and Harris each held rallies in Wisconsin. Trump riffed on his appearance in a garbage truck earlier, and wore a reflective vest of the kind often worn by sanitation workers. The crowd laughed as he said that he liked the vest because it was flattering. Harris spoke to a hugely enthusiastic crowd and seemed at ease and energetic. The strongest part of her speech was when she addressed first-time voters, specifically, telling them that issues including the climate crisis, gun control and abortion restrictions weren\u2019t political to them: these were their lived experience. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, addresses progressives\u2019 concerns about voting for Harris given the administration\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war. Kamala Harris held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, this afternoon. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\u201d she said. Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remarks, Harris said that Biden had \u201cclarified his comments\u201d, adding: \u201cI strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of Republicans crossing party lines to vote against Donald Trump. The US supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: \u201cThe application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court\u2019s ruling, calling it a \u201cvictory for common sense and election fairness\u201d. Youngkin had ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks. Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying: \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be close, but we\u2019re going to win this thing.\u201d Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the better ground game, we\u2019ve got the excitement, we\u2019ve got the momentum on our side.\u201d Many Puerto Ricans who have moved to the mainland will be able to make their voices heard on 5 November, with large communities in Pennsylvania and Florida being targeted by both campaigns. Those who remain in the territory meanwhile, have made numerous efforts to become a state in their own right. The island has more people than the five smallest states combined and statehood is supported by many, but the final decision lies with Congress \u2013 and recent efforts have stalled. Those delays and persistent disfranchisement means some Puerto Ricans are eager to leave the US orbit altogether. On Tuesday, alongside elections for local politicians and an informal straw poll for their favoured presidential candidate, they will vote in their seventh non-binding referendum on status \u2013 this time putting full and partial independence up against statehood. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that that all of these decisions are being made as if we were savages, as if we were people who can\u2019t have self determination,\u201d Betancourt says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for the United States \u2013 I want to vote for the president of Puerto Rico.\u201d Read the full story here: Residents have no say over Washington\u2019s decisions that control their everyday lives, according to Karina Claudio Betancourt, a student in Puerto Rico\u2019s capital city, San Juan. \u201cElections impact us because the president decides what to do or not to do with Puerto Rico right now,\u201d they say. Betancourt points to Donald Trump\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island, and the Obama administration\u2019s imposition of a board controlling government funding. \u201cBasic transportation and health services and things that impact us day-to-day are decided by the Congress of the United States and by this fiscal oversight board, but we don\u2019t get to vote for any of that,\u201d they say. \u201cPeople are fed up.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally was meant to be a triumphant return to the city that made his name. Instead, the event has reheated simmering tensions on the island territory of Puerto Rico, where locals say they feel like second-class citizens, days out from a historic US election. Comments from a comedian at Trump\u2019s rally this week, describing Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d, might have fired up local resentment against the Republican candidate, but those who live there will be unable to show their anger through the ballot box. Residents of Puerto Rico are among the more than 3 million Americans whose votes won\u2019t count, when the country elects its president next week. Most residents of the US territories \u2013 Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Marianas \u2013 are citizens and pay federal taxes. Many have family on the mainland. But the territories have no votes in the electoral college that ultimately decides the president. \u201cThey\u2019re just basically captive to whatever Congress and the president want to do to them,\u201d says Luis Fuentes-Rohwer, a law professor at Indiana University. \u201cTo be a citizen means to be a member of the political community. Not in the US.\u201d It\u2019s one of the few things uniting the disparate territories, which range from Puerto Rico, home to 3 million citizens in the Caribbean, to American Samoa, closer to Australia than America with a population of just 50,000. Read more here: One reason for Harris\u2019s energy: as we reported earlier, a new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by six points in the state. Harris leads Trump by 51% to 45% among likely voters in Wisconsin. A tale of two Wisconsin rallies: Trump kept his relatively tight, for him \u2013 it was just over 60 minutes \u2013 while Harris spoke for her usual 20 minutes. Trump riffed on his appearance in a garbage truck earlier, and wore a reflective vest of the kind often worn by sanitation workers. The crowd laughed as he said that he liked the vest because it was flattering. Harris spoke to a hugely enthusiastic crowd and seemed at ease and energetic. The strongest part of her speech was when she addressed first-time voters, specifically, telling them that issues including the climate crisis, gun control and abortion restrictions weren\u2019t political to them: these were their lived experience. Harris ends that hugely energetic speech, in response to which she received very loud cheers from the crowd. \u201cWe love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it,\u201d Harris says. Harris\u2019s speech tonight, unsurprisingly, is a combination of last night\u2019s major address in Washington DC and her previous speeches. Her speech was interrupted near the start by a person calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and she responded quickly. If that person continued shouting \u201cCeasefire!\u201d the sound was drowned out by the crowd cheering when Harris said: \u201cI am speaking now.\u201d Harris addresses young, first-time voters: \u201cYou, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep this country safe. You, who have fewer rights than your mothers.\u201d She also addressed the climate crisis, an issue that has been on the backburner for the Democrats during this campaign. \u201cThis is not political,\u201d Harris says. \u201cThis is your lived experience\u201d. Harris repeats her line: if Trump is elected, \u201con day one he will walk into the Oval Office with an enemies list,\u201d she says. \u201cI will walk in with a to-do list focused on your needs. And at the top of my list will be bringing down your cost of living.\u201d \u201cIt is time for a new generation of leadership in America,\u201d Harris says. Harris repeats her record as a prosecutor, saying she isn\u2019t afraid of a tough fight. \u201cIf you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you.\u201d \u201cSo Madison, early voting has started [\u2026] you can vote through November 3rd. And we need you to vote early, Wisconsin,\u201d Harris says. \u201cAnd make no mistake: we will win.\u201d Harris is energetic, the crowd is energetic. Someone in the crowd is chanting: \u201cCeasefire now!\u201d Harris stops her speech. \u201cListen,\u201d she says, \u201cwe all want the war in Gaza to end.\u201d She says she will do everything in her power to make that happen. Everyone has a right to be heard, she says. \u201cBut right now, I am speaking.\u201d There is a sustained and very loud cheer from the crowd \u2013 this is one of Harris\u2019s most famous lines. Kamala Harris is on stage now in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd many of you may know when I was five years old, my parents taught at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\u201d In the days leading up to the election, mysterious monuments continue to pop up in cities across the US poking fun at candidate Donald Trump and his supporters, the Guardian\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Olivares reports: On Wednesday in Maja Park in Philadelphia, a large statue of Trump was propped up. Titled \u201cIn Honor of a Lifetime of Sexual Assault\u201d, the monument, showing Trump smiling and holding his hand in a suggestive manner, quotes from the infamous 2005 recording \u2013 leaked in 2016 \u2013 in which Trump is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monument was quickly removed, Philly Voice reported. On Sunday, a similar satirical statue was found in Portland, Oregon. It was beheaded that day and further damaged by a Portland city council candidate and Trump supporter, who filmed himself chipping away at the base of the statue. Read the full story here: Alice Herman There are 13,000 people at the Harris event in Madison, according to the Harris-Walz campaign. Kamala Harris is expected to speak in 40 minutes\u2019 time in Madison, in the swing state of Wisconsin. Trump is wrapping up. \u201cJust in conclusion\u201d, he says, and repeats various falsehoods, mainly about Harris, whom he earlier criticised for speaking about him too much. Trump begins with various things he will make America again. These include \u201chealthy\u201d, \u201cproud\u201d, \u201csafe\u201d, and, of course, \u201cgreat\u201d. Trump is once again played off by Village People\u2019s gay anthem, YMCA. Village People sent Trump a cease and desist letter in 2023 asking him to stop using the song at campaign events. The Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman is in Madison, Wisconsin for the Kamala Harris event. She reports: Mumford &amp; Sons, the British folk-pop band, is now performing \u2013 an offering to the elder millennial rallygoers, who seem way more into this set than Gracie Abrams\u2019s younger fans. (The young woman who sobbed throughout Abrams\u2019s set appears unmoved by Mumford &amp; Sons so far). Harris has rolled out a series of celebrity endorsers and performers during her rallies so far this year, from Beyonc\u00e9, who appeared at a Harris rally in Texas, to Jennifer Lopez, who is scheduled to make an appearance at a Nevada rally later this week. The Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman is in Madison, Wisconsin, for the Kamala Harris event. She reports: Gracie Abrams, a popular gen Z singer-songwriter, is performing in Madison at the Alliant Energy Center, where Harris is scheduled to speak soon. Her performance was likely a draw for some in the crowd \u2013 including the young woman in the risers to my left who has been sob-singing every lyric during Abrams\u2019s performance. Trump plays a video about Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed in Texas when she was 12 yeas old by two Venezuelan men who reportedly entered the country illegally. The video features Nungaray\u2019s mother talking about her daughter and what happened, and is incredibly sad. Trump has talked about Nungaray before. During Trump\u2019s presidential debate against then presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump repeatedly brought up her murder and assault. As Trump began speaking about his \u201cfavorite chart\u201d \u2013 the one about illegal immigration that he was talking about on stage in Butler, Pennsylvania when a gunman tried to kill him \u2013 a woman in the audience began shouting: \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d It\u2019s what Trump shouted that July afternoon as the Secret Service hustled him away, and become a rallying cry for his supporters. The audience picked up the chant, and Trump paused to soak it in, before saying: \u201cThat\u2019s an aggressive youngster. He\u2019s going to go places.\u201d Apparently he didn\u2019t get a good look at who started the chant. Trump is repeating his well-worn, racist and false statements about immigration. He claims he wants to \u201cprotect the women of our country\u201d \u2013 from immigrants. He says he is going to protect women \u201cwhether they like it or not\u201d. It is a statement with menacing undertones, given that Trump has boasted about limiting abortion access for women: a procedure that can be key to keeping women safe. He has done this despite the majority of Americans supporting abortion rights. More than 60% of Americans now believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. \u201cWe broke Roe v Wade,\u201d Trump has bragged: Meanwhile Kamala Harris has touched down in Wisconsin, where she will be speaking in 90 minutes\u2019 time. Her stepdaughter, fashion world darling Ella Emhoff, is with her, per the pool report. In a profile published this week, the New York Times called her the \u201csecond daughter of New York\u2019s downtown\u201d. Trump says he has sold 10,000 black Maga hats \u2013 it is unclear whether this is true. The red Maga hat is the most recognisable Trump supporter accessory, and was the subject \u2013 or inciting incident \u2013 of a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode. And more recently: Trump claims that his profession is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d but that if he had to do it again he would, \u201cevery time\u201d. Trump was injured during an assassination attempt in July during which the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed. In September, a second man, Ryan Wesley Routh, was charged with attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. Authorities said he spent 12 hours camped outside Donald Trump\u2019s golf course before the Secret Service spotted him with a rifle. He pleaded not guilty to attempting to assassinate the former president as well as other federal charges. The orange reflective vest Donald Trump is wearing has made him appear even more orange, at least on the Resch Center jumbotron. Trump\u2019s orange-tinged skin tone is a signature part of his appearance, something the left often mocks, and which the right has mocked back with its \u201corange man bad\u201d meme directed at liberal outrage. Trump rarely wears anything but a suit (unless he\u2019s golfing), but is clearly trying to make the most of Joe Biden\u2019s comment yesterday in which the president appeared to describe his supporters as \u201cgarbage\u201d \u2013 something the White House disputes. Trump is doing a bit now about being reluctant to wear the vest on stage, wondering whether he could wear it over a suit, and so on. He says his campaign staff told him it would make him look thinner, at which point he was sold on the idea. That gets laughs and applause from the crowd. \u201cI may never wear a blue jacket again,\u201d he says. The audience in Green Bay\u2019s Resch Center stood up for the first 10 minutes or so of Trump\u2019s speech, but now they\u2019re in their seats. It\u2019s worth settling in for a Trump speech \u2013 they\u2019ve stretched to about the 90-minute mark lately (about the length of a movie) with the ex-president riffing on all kinds of things. He just played a video of Kamala Harris mentioning his name in her speeches, which draw a huge applause. Trump plays a recording of about 15 times Kamala Harris has used his name while making speeches during an election in which he is her opponent. \u201cThat\u2019s all she talks about because she and Joe have absolutely no achievements,\u201d Trump says, falsely. He continues talking about Harris. Then Trump talks garbage. One of his advisers said: \u201cSir, the hottest word right now is garbage.\u201d He then says his campaign staff managed to organise the garbage truck on short notice, and that he felt uncomfortable driving it while wearing a suit. \u201cAnd then they said sir, we have a vest.\u201d Trum says the \u201cmost beaautiful words to me\u201d are \u201creligion, number one and love number two\u201d. He pauses, then says: \u201cand tariffs, number three\u201d. He has said this before. Trump is promising to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing, a proposal that economists say would probably mean higher prices for consumers while angering US allies. The International Monetary Fund warned this week that the tariffs could hurt global growth, as it upgraded its forecast for the UK economy. The Washington-based organisation said tariffs trigger tit-for-tat trade wars that impoverish the economies involved in the dispute and the wider global economy. A reminder of what it is Trump is riffing on: On Tuesday Biden appeared to call supporters of Donald Trump \u201cgarbage\u201d. The president clarified that he didn\u2019t mean Trump supporters, but rather the attitude of a comedian who performed at a Trump rally and made several racist statements \u2013 including calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d \u2013 towards Latinos. The official transcript had Biden saying: \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter\u2019s \u2013 his \u2013 his \u2013 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d The comment nevertheless set off echoes of Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d put-down of a section of Trump\u2019s supporters in 2016. \u201cAnd by the way, I want to thank all of our incredible sanitation workers across America,\u201d Trump says, in a continuation of his garbage-truck-driver schtick. Here is the scene my colleague Chris Stein referred to earlier \u2013 Trump answering questions from reporters while seated in a garbage truck. He falsely stated that Harris was responsible for Biden\u2019s use of the word \u201cgarbage\u201d, calling it \u201cthe comment made by really both of them\u201d. He also wildly overstated his support, calling the remark about his supporters an insult to \u201cmaybe 250 million people\u201d. Trump got 74.2m votes in 2020 (to Biden\u2019s 81.2m): \u201cWe\u2019re done with their hatred, we\u2019re done with their hysteria,\u201d Trump says of the Democrats. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s comments were the direct result of Kamala\u2019s efforts to portray everyone who is not voting for her as \u2026 subhuman,\u201d Trump says. This statement is false \u2013 Harris has been careful not to insult Trump supporters. Just before Donald Trump took the stage in Green Bay, a video played showing him in shirtsleeves with a reflective vest on, declaring: \u201cHello everybody, this is Donald J Trump. Two hundred fifty million people are not garbage.\u201d It then cut to his photo op earlier today, where he took questions while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a garbage truck and honking its horn. Now he\u2019s on stage, in the same reflective vest. Donald Trump is on stage. He starts by saying: \u201cI have to say 250 million Americans are not garbage\u201d, referring to Joe Biden\u2019s ambiguous comments yesterday. Turnout at rallies is no guarantee of election victory, but the Trump campaign must be pleased with the sight in Green Bay tonight. Just about every seat in the approximately 10,000-seat Resch Center is full, with the former president yet to take the stage. Brown county, of which Green Bay is the seat, is friendly GOP territory, voting for Republican presidents in every recent election, with the exception of when Barack Obama was first elected in 2008, and when Bill Clinton was re-elected in 1996. Donald Trump is expected to speak soon at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This is Helen Sullivan taking over our live US politics coverage. I\u2019ll bring you any key developments from Trump\u2019s speech, and Kamala Harris\u2019s speech in Wisconsin in two-and-a-half hours\u2019 time. Here\u2019s a wrap-up of the day\u2019s key events: A new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by 6 points in Wisconsin and 5 points in Michigan, key battleground states. Harris leads Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. The candidates are tied at 48% in Pennsylvania. Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Nicky Jam has withdrawn his support for Donald Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. \u201cNever in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico deserves respect,\u201d he said. Kamala Harris held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, this afternoon. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\u201d she said. Kamala Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remarks, Harris said that Biden had \u201cclarified his comments\u201d, adding, \u201cI strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of Republicans crossing party lines to vote against Donald Trump. The supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: \u201cThe application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court\u2019s ruling, calling it a \u201cvictory for common sense and election fairness\u201d. Youngkin had ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks. Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be close but we\u2019re going to win this thing.\u201d Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got the better ground game, we\u2019ve got the excitement, we\u2019ve got the momentum on our side.\u201d Donald Trump is taking questions from reporters while sitting in a garbage truck branded with his campaign logo. \u201cThis truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,\u201d Trump said. It\u2019s quite a move, days after his campaign caught flack for platforming a comedian who compared Puerto Rico with an island of garbage. Asked about reports that Elon Musk, who has become a close ally, has been in communication with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, Trump responded: \u201cElon is a great guy, he\u2019s one of our geniuses.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Chris Stein is in Green Bay, reporting on the Trump rally there. Donald Trump is holding a rally this evening in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and booked himself perhaps the best warm-up speaker he could hope to get in the football-mad city: Brett Favre, a legendary former quarterback for the Green Bay Packers NFL team. \u201cI have not done an event like this before, but I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time,\u201d Favre told the crowd at an indoor arena next to the football stadium, where quite a few people had forgone wearing Maga hats and Trump shirts in favor of Packers jerseys. One of the last small cities with an NFL team in the United States, Green Bay sits in Brown county, a Republican-leaning area of a swing state that\u2019s regarded as one of the most evenly divided in the country. After lamenting the financial damage done by inflation and the human toll of fentanyl overdoses, Favre said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already had President Trump once. We\u2019ve already seen Kamala in action. We can compare, and we know this is better.\u201d \u201cSo, it\u2019s time to pitch Kamala, and put in the star quarterback,\u201d Favre said. \u201cUSA, it\u2019s a great country. We all know that. Kamala broke it, Trump will fix it.\u201d Canvassers for Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC in Michigan were subjected to poor working conditions, unreasonable quotas, and in some cases were misled about the fact that they would be promoting Donald Trump, Wired reports. From Wired: In Michigan, canvassers and paid door knockers for the former president, contracted by a firm associated with America PAC, have been subjected to poor working conditions: A number of them have been driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul van, according to video obtained by WIRED, and threatened that their lodging at a local motel wouldn\u2019t be paid for if they didn\u2019t meet canvassing quotas. One door knocker alleges that they didn\u2019t even know they were signing up for anything having to do with Musk or Trump. A representative for Musk and America PAC did not return a request for comment. Labor grievances and disputes have been a common thread across Musk\u2019s companies. The Guardian has reported on injuries and safety issues at Tesla. Black workers at the company have also alleged race discrimination and harassment. A pregnant worker at Neuralink alleges she was forced to work with a monkey that was carrying herpes. Employees at SpaceX have sued Musk and the company for sexual harassment and whistleblower retaliation, among other wrongdoing. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, addresses progressives\u2019 concerns about voting for Kamala Harris given the administration\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war. He writes: I understand that there are millions of Americans who disagree with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the terrible war in Gaza. I am one of them. While Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages, it did not have the right to wage an all-out war against the entire Palestinian people. It did not have the right to kill 42,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of whom were children, women and the elderly, or injure over 100,000 people in Gaza. It did not have the right to destroy Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and housing and healthcare systems. It did not have the right to bomb every one of Gaza\u2019s 12 universities. It did not have the right to block humanitarian aid, causing massive malnutrition in children and, in fact, starvation. And that is why I am doing everything I can to block US military aid and offensive weapons sales to the rightwing extremist Netanyahu government in Israel. And I know that many of you share those feelings. And some of you are saying, \u201cHow can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war?\u201d And that is a very fair question. And let me give you my best answer. And that is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his rightwing friends are worse. In the Senate and in Congress Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice-president both support getting as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible. Trump has said that Netanyahu is doing a good job and that Biden is holding him back. He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. It is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office. But even more importantly, and this I promise you, after Harris wins we will, together, do everything we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu \u2013 including an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, a surge of massive humanitarian aid, the stopping of settler attacks on the West Bank, and the rebuilding of Gaza for the Palestinian people. Read the full piece here: A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia, where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disenfranchised by an unprepared election office. A lawsuit demanding an extension of Tuesday\u2019s 5pm deadline in Bucks county until today was filed this morning after long queues outside the county\u2019s election offices on the last day for applications led to security guards cutting off the line and telling some of those waiting they would not be able to apply. Videos of the scenes were widely circulated on social media, fuelling rumours of voter suppression. The Trump campaign was joined by the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick in the lawsuit alleging that voters waiting outside election offices for mail ballots were turned away empty-handed and ordered to leave after the deadline expired at 5pm on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a direct violation of Pennsylvanians\u2019 rights to cast their ballot \u2013 and all voters have a right to STAY in line,\u201d the Trump campaign said. Judge Jeffrey Trauger said in a one-page order that Bucks county voters who want to apply for an early mail ballot now have until Friday. The queues for late mail ballots were a result of Pennsylvania not having an early on-site voting system at designated spots, as is the case in some other states. Instead, voters can apply for ballots on-demand at election offices before filling them out and submitting them on the spot, a procedure that takes about 10 minutes. The flood of late applicants overwhelmed electoral workers in Bucks county\u2019s administration building in Doylestown, leading to a long queue which was cut off at around 2.45pm on Tuesday, according to CBS. Protesters interrupted Harris about 8 minutes into her remarks here. It was difficult to hear what they were saying, but I could hear the word \u201cgenocide\u201d. The crowd began chanting \u201cUSA!\u201d and Harris reminded the crowd that democracy was on the line in this election. \u201cOurs is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard. That is what is on the line in this election,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, everybody has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking.\u201d After another protester interrupted a few minutes later, she said: \u201cAt this particular moment it should be emphasized that unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy from within. He wants to put them in jail. I\u2019ll give them a seat at the table.\u201d Shawna Barnes, a 45-year old healthcare worker from Philadelphia, said she\u2019s concerned that men aren\u2019t supporting Harris in this election. When she\u2019s knocked on doors, she\u2019s noticed that the women are often all in, but the men are \u201ciffy\u201d. \u201cBlack and brown women are going to come out and support. White women of course are going to support. The men are just kind of like afraid,\u201d she said as Mr Brightside by The Killers blasted on the sound system. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about gender, I just think it\u2019s fear.\u201d Kamala Harris is speaking at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center in Harrisburg, where she is promoting her economic proposals. \"We stand for working people, we stand for middle class growth and strength,\u201d Harris said. She derided Donald Trump\u2019s tariff proposals, and warned that he would dismantle the popular Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe know what\u2019s on the line. We know that Donald Trump will try, like he has so many times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw, millions of Americans off of their health care and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d she said. Donald Trump\u2019s team is reportedly considering withholding federal grants from police departments that decline to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to ease deportations. NBC News reports that the former president\u2019s team is working on plans to force sanctuary cities such as Chicago, and states such as California to work with the federal government to help Trump deliver on his promise of mass deportations. The Guardian has not independently verified NBC\u2019s reporting. Withholding funding from police departments who decline to work with Ice will undoubtedly face legal challenges. During Trump\u2019s presidency, several states sued the administration after it cut off grants to sanctuary cities, and appealed a court decision that sided with Trump \u2013 running out the clock on Trump\u2019s term before the supreme court could issue a final decision on the matter. With six days until the 2024 election, more than 57.5 million Americans have already voted as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Of the 57 million, just over 30 million voted early in-person and about 27 million voted by early mail. I spotted Minerva Ortiz-Garcia, 68, walking around with a small Puerto Rican flag before the rally started so I stopped her to ask what she thought of the racist joke a speaker made before Donald Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. \u201cI feel horrible. I\u2019m Puerto Rican, I actually started to cry,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could someone say that about an island that is trying to survive [Hurricane] Maria?\u201d Ortiz-Garcia, a flight attendant, lives in Easton, which is in eastern Pennsylvania, a part of the state that is extremely competitive and has a huge Latino population. She said she thought many Latino voters in her part of the state were waiting for Harris to reach out to them directly. \u201cI think that people want her to say something directly,\u201d she said. I\u2019ve been chatting to a few voters at a Kamala Harris rally here at the Farm expo building in Harrisburg, where there\u2019s a vague smell of horses as the crowd swag surfs and dances to Motown hits such as We Are Family and Aretha Franklin\u2019s Respect. I just spoke with Corine Wherley, a 38-year-old librarian from Harrisburg who is attending her first political rally ever. She said she decided to come to the rally because she was so alarmed by what she heard during Donald Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. \u201cA lot of it was the rhetoric around \u2018this secret\u2019 and other things like that they\u2019re planning on doing,\u201d she said, referring to Trump\u2019s comment that he has a \u201clittle secret\u201d with House speaker Mike Johnson, that many took to be a plan to contest the election. \u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018I can do whatever I want,\u2019 and I think that\u2019s what scares me.\u201d Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Nicky Jam has withdrawn his support for Donald Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. On Wednesday, the singer posted a video on social media saying: \u201cThe reason I supported Donald Trump is because I believed it was what\u2019s best for the economy in the United States, where a lot of Latinos live \u2026 a lot of immigrants that are suffering over the state of the economy \u2026 With [Trump] being a businessman, I felt it was the right move.\u201d He went on to add: \u201cNever in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico deserves respect.\u201d In September, Nicky Jam made an appearance at one of Trump\u2019s rally during which he was misgendered by the former president. \u201cDo you know Nicky? She\u2019s hot!\u201d Trump said to the crowd, adding: \u201cWhere\u2019s Nicky? Where\u2019s Nicky? Thank you, Nicky. Great to be having you here.\u201d The battleground states for the White House overlap significantly with the states where Democrats are fighting to keep or gain majorities in state legislative chambers, noted Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC). \u201cWhile the overlap has opened some opportunities for unprecedented collaboration, this environment has also produced steep challenges for state legislative candidates to get their message out, especially through paid communication,\u201d Williams told reporters on a press call today. Williams noted that the Harris campaign was now spending more on paid ads each week than the DLCC\u2019s entire budget for this election cycle, which is $60m. The gap in resources could heighten the risk of \u201cballot rolloff\u201d, the phenomenon of voters only filling out the top of their ballot without continuing down to lower-level races. \u201cOur historical data indicates that, in presidential years, we face the challenge of ballot rolloff most acutely,\u201d Williams said. \u201cCommunicating and educating voters on who their state legislative candidates are is incredibly important to mitigate underperforming the top of the ticket.\u201d Although much of the country is focused on the presidential and congressional races, the results of this year\u2019s state legislative elections will have vast consequences on Americans\u2019 everyday lives. On a press call today, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) reported that state legislative control appears to be a true toss-up in several battleground states, reflecting the neck-and-neck nature of the presidential race. \u201cRight now, just 12 legislative seats are deciding six legislative majorities in the biggest battleground states across the country, and all our polling shows that this election will be incredibly close,\u201d said Heather Williams, president of the DLCC. Democrats are looking to maintain their narrow majorities in state legislative chambers in Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania while attempting to regain majorities in Arizona and New Hampshire. The new legislative maps in Wisconsin also represent a key opportunity for Democrats. \u201cThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, as nearly half of Americans currently have their rights protected by Democratic majorities in state legislatures,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDecisions on fundamental freedoms are happening in the states, and many of the dangers of Project 2025 and Trump\u2019s MAGA [\u2019Make America Great Again\u2019] agenda will continue to advance through our statehouses no matter the outcome at the top of the ticket.\u201d A new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by 6 points in Wisconsin and 5 points in Michigan, key battleground states. Harris leads Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. The candidates are tied at 48% in Pennsylvania. The vice president\u2019s slim advantage is due in part to \u201crelatively strong performance among White voters and White voters without college degrees, two groups which traditionally break Republican,\u201d CNN said. Here\u2019s a look at where things stand: Kamala Harris held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, this afternoon. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\u201d she said. Kamala Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remarks, Harris said that Biden had \u201cclarified his comments\u201d, adding, \u201cI strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of Republicans crossing party lines to vote against Donald Trump. The supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: \u201cThe application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court\u2019s ruling, calling it a \u201cvictory for common sense and election fairness\u201d. Youngkin had ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks. Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be close but we\u2019re going to win this thing.\u201d Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got the better ground game, we\u2019ve got the excitement, we\u2019ve got the momentum on our side.\u201d \u201cI see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time,\u201d Kamala Harris said. \u201cYou\u2019ve only known the climate crisis and are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You young leaders who grew up with active shooter drills, who are trying to keep our schools safe, you who have known fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers and are standing up to fight for freedom to make your own decisions about your own bodies. None of this for you young leaders is theoretical. This is not theoretical for you. It is not political for you. For our young leaders, this is your lived experience, and I see you, and I see your power, and I am so proud of you,\u201d she added. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\u201d Kamala Harris said. \u201cHe wants to put them in jail. I\u2019ll give them a seat at the table,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We know that is who he is but, North Carolina, that is not who we are,\u201d Kamala Harris said. \u201cIt is time for a new chapter where we stop with the pointing fingers at each other, and instead let us lock arms with one another, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us,\u201d she added. Kamala Harris is now on stage in Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates. Donald Trump is claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Pennsylvania is cheating and has filed a lawsuit against Bucks county. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote that the state is \u201ccheating, and getting caught, at large-scale levels rarely seen before\u201d. He did not specify what constituted the state\u2019s cheating. In a separate statement, Trump\u2019s campaign announced on Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Buck county for \u201cturning away voters.\u201d Again, without evidence, the campaign claimed that voters were being turned away early, saying: \u201cThe Pennsylvania Department of State made clear if voters are in line at a county elections office by 5:00PM, the counties MUST give voters the opportunity to apply for their mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania voters were turned away as early as 2:30PM.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s democracy reporter Rachel Leingang reports on the most pervasive myths and lies about US elections: Kamala Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remarks, Harris said that Biden had \u201cclarified his comments\u201d, adding, \u201cI strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.\u201d In response to whether she is worried that Biden\u2019s comments could increase the country\u2019s political divisiveness ahead of the elections, Harris said: \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear with the American public \u2013 I respect the challenges that people face, I respect the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of republicans crossing party lines to vote against Trump. \u201cI want to tune out. But I can\u2019t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets,\u201d Schwarzenegger wrote on X. \u201cTo someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. \u201cAnd I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That\u2019s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\u201d He added that electing Trump as president would be \u201cfour more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful\u201d. The legal dispute centers on a 7 August executive order by the Republican Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, ordering the state to run its voter registration rolls against DMV data on a daily basis to check for non-citizens. The justice department and civil rights groups sued, saying that the state was violating a federal law that prohibits systematic removals of voters within 90 days of a federal election. The US district judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request last week to restore the voters. Voting experts have long warned that comparing voting rolls to DMV data is not a reliable way to find non-citizens on the rolls because there may be paperwork errors and people can become naturalized after getting their driver\u2019s license. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they had identified several people who were in fact citizens but had their registrations wrongly canceled. Donald Trump and allies had distorted the removals, saying that the lower court decision meant that non-citizens were going to be placed back on the voter rolls. But the state had not provided conclusive evidence that many of those removed were non-citizens. The supreme court made the ruling to pause the lower court ruling on its emergency docket and did not give a rationale for its decision, which is customary for rulings on an expedited basis. All three liberal justices on the court \u2013 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2013 said they would not have halted a lower court ruling earlier in October ordering the state to restore the voter registrations. Virginia\u2019s Republican attorney general Jason Miyares has also lauded the supreme court\u2019s decision to strip away voting rights from approximately 1,600 people, saying: \u201cI am pleased to announce that the US Supreme Court granted Virginia\u2019s emergency stay to keep noncitizens off our voter rolls.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court\u2019s ruling that allowed the state to proceed with its removal of approximately 1,600 voter registrations, calling it a \u201cvictory for common sense and election fairness\u201d. Youngkin, who ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks, said: \u201cClean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections. Virginians also know that we have paper ballots, counting machines not connected to the internet, a strong chain of custody process, signature verification, monitored and secured drop boxes, and a \u2018triple check\u2019 vote counting process to tabulate results. Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia\u2019s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference.\u201d The supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: \u201cThe application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted. The October 25, 2024 order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia \u2026 is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought. Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In the event certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of the Court.\u201d Last week, Virginia was asked to permit more than 1,600 people to the vote after a federal judge ruled that the state had illegally revoked those rights. The Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter Sam Levine reported then that the plaintiffs who brought forth the lawsuit said that many people were being incorrectly identified as non-citizen by the Department of Motor Vehicles by checking the wrong box on a form. In a new interview with CBS Mornings, Tim Walz said, \u201cPeople are hungry to come back together \u2026 They\u2019re hungry for us to find solutions.\u201d Walz, who spoke to Good Morning America earlier this morning, said: \u201cOne that\u2019s talking about unifying us, one that\u2019s talking about bringing folks to the table \u2026 The American tradition of disagreeing and debating but still doing it in a respectful manner.\u201d He went on to add that one of the most important campaign issues was restoring federal reproductive rights across the country, saying, \u201cRestoration of Roe \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d In response to Arab American voters in Michigan who have voiced their disapproval towards Kamala Harris over her support of Israel, Walz said, \u201cThere\u2019s one ticket here that is going to find the pathway to stabilization in the Middle East, but also one that is going to respect their human rights here \u2013 push back against Islamophobia \u2013 make sure that they have the right to fully engage in our system here.\u201d A former Republican congressional candidate has been charged with stealing ballots in Indiana. Reuters reports: A Republican former congressional candidate was charged with stealing ballots during a test of a voting system in Madison county, Indiana, state police said on Tuesday. During the test on 3 October, which involved four voting machines and 136 candidate ballots marked for testing, officials discovered that two ballots were missing, according to the Indiana state police. Voter fraud is rare in the United States, and courts dismissed multiple lawsuits of alleged electoral fraud brought by former president Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies who accused Democrats of stealing the 2020 election. Trump faces the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, in a 5 November presidential election. For the full story, click here: Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be close but we\u2019re going to win this thing.\u201d Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got the better ground game, we\u2019ve got the excitement, we\u2019ve got the momentum on our side.\u201d He added that his biggest concern was that \u201cthat Donald Trump has brought up a pessimism to folks, that folks don\u2019t believe that their vote matters. Those votes do matter \u2026 Make sure you participate in this democracy. I think you\u2019re going to see Donald Trump continue to spiral downward in this really difficult and hateful rhetoric.\u201d In response to Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remark, Walz said, \u201cThe president\u2019s clarified his remarks, but let\u2019s be very clear: the vice-president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end \u2026 and what I say is, there\u2019s a place for all of us here.\u201d With the election just a few days away, here is what the presidential and vice-presidential candidates are going to be up to today, according to Politico: Donald Trump will hold a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, at 1pm ET then a rally in Green Bay Wisconsin at 7pm ET. JD Vance will hold a town hall with Democrat-turned-Republican Tulsi Gabbard in Bedford, Pennsylvania at 5.30pm ET. Kamala Harris will hold rallies in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Madison, Wisconsin. Tim Walz will make appearances on Good Morning America and CBS Mornings before holding campaign events in Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville, North Carolina. In a new interview on Fox News, Nikki Haley, a Donald Trump critic-turned ally, said now was \u201cnot a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos\u201d. Haley, who ran against Trump earlier this year before dropping out the presidential race, added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got Americans who are absolutely not going to vote for Trump. And then you\u2019ve got a percentage in the middle who like Trump\u2019s policies but don\u2019t like his style. That is what they need to focus on. So when you look at these things, it has got to be a story of addition. This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos. This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they\u2019ve got going. 53% of the electorate are women with will vote. They care about how they\u2019re being talked to, and they care about the issues \u2026\u201d When Yadira Caraveo, a Democratic party member, won the race to represent Colorado\u2019s eighth district in the House of Representatives in 2022, she eked out a victory, winning by the narrowest margin of any Democrat in the country. This November, Caraveo is facing yet another close race \u2013 one that could determine the balance of Congress. In a district where nearly 40% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the community will be decisive in crowning a winner. The battle for their votes is mostly playing out not on TV or in town halls, but on social media and local radio. \u201c[Latino voters] are listening to social media and the radio,\u201d said Sonny Subia, Colorado\u2019s volunteer state director for Lulac, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the country \u2026 Local newspapers are just as relevant as ever this election, as the DNC takes out attack ads. The adverts that paint Donald Trump as \u201cunhinged, unstable, unchecked\u201d are running in 25 local newspapers in the seven battleground states. The papers include the Delco Times and Erie Times-News in Pennsylvania or the Macomb Daily and Northern Express in Michigan. On of the ads takes up a full page and is plastered with Trump\u2019s infamous mugshot snapped during his indictment on racketeering charges in Georgia. The ad calls the former president \u201cunhinged, unstable, unchecked\u201d and \u201cunfit to lead\u201d. \u201cIn the final week of the election, Democrats are not leaving any stone unturned, reminding voters in key battleground states that their vote means the difference between chaos and revenge with Donald Trump, or a New Way Forward with Vice President Harris,\u201d Jaime Harrison, the chair of the DNC, told the New York Times. Donald Trump\u2019s extremist attacks on top Democrats as \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d and talk of deploying the military against political foes if he wins the election are stark signs Trump will endanger the rule of law in America, say former US justice department officials and scholars. Trump\u2019s threats \u2013 singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d and \u201cmore dangerous than China [and] Russia\u201d \u2013 jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek \u201crevenge\u201d against political foes led by Joe Biden. He also suggested the military could be used to quell violence at the polls from \u201cradical left lunatics\u201d. Those comments, along with Trump\u2019s adamant refusal to say clearly he will accept the election results if he is defeated, prompt critics to say Trump poses unprecedented dangers to the US constitution \u2026 The latest polls show Kamala Harris enjoys a small lead over her rival Donald Trump. However, the election is still too close to call and a small margin of error could see either candidate in the White House. The key battleground states, so named because there is no entrenched support for Democrats or Republicans and could swing either way, are Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s controversial set continues to be used as a political football by both sides of the aisle as election night draws closer. The joke that got everyone\u2019s back up was when Hinchcliffe compared Puerto Rico to a floating island of garbage. President Joe Biden said Puerto Ricans are \u201cgood, decent honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters \u2014 his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d Republicans seized on the president\u2019s line, comparing it to Hilary Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d comment during the 2016 election campaign. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Trump\u2019s running mate, said: \u201cThis is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country.\u201d Just one day earlier, Vance brushed off the Puerto Rico island-of-garbage comment, saying, \u201cWe have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.\u201d Biden backpedalled somewhat on social media: \u201cEarlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump\u2019s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage \u2013 which is the only word I can think of to describe it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHis demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That\u2019s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don\u2019t reflect who we are as a nation.\u201d If Donald Trump wins next week\u2019s election, it would be the first time in US history that a candidate wins based on such a huge lie \u2013 his falsehood that we have \u201cthe worst economy ever\u201d. The former president\u2019s Big Lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape. There\u2019s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs \u2013 a record \u2013 under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump\u2019s last year in office\u2026 Welcome to our ongoing coverage of the US election campaign as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to make their pitches to voters with less than a week to go to election day. Current president Joe Biden was forced to clarify comments he made on Tuesday after he was seen in an edited video clip saying \u201cthe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters\u201d. He said that a pro-Trump comedian\u2019s \u201chateful rhetoric\u201d about Puerto Rico was \u201cgarbage\u201d. Republican politicians and rightwing media outlets quickly picked up the clip to argue that Biden had called Trump\u2019s supporters garbage, comparing his remarks with Hillary Clinton\u2019s labeling of half of Trump supporters as belonging in \u201ca basket of deplorables\u201d in 2016. Elsewhere: Urged by some allies to apologise for racist comments made by speakers at his weekend rally, Donald Trump took the opposite approach on Tuesday, saying it was an \u201chonour to be involved\u201d in such an event and calling the scene a \u201clovefest\u201d \u2013 the same term he has used to describe the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol. Harris will spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss her campaign\u2019s plans. If elected, Harris would be the first graduate of a historically Black university to occupy the Oval Office. Michelle Obama took the stump in Georgia. The former first lady\u2019s organisation When We All Vote hosted a rally for more than 2,000 people at an arena in College Park, near Atlanta\u2019s airport \u2013 a slickly produced event that was dominated by earnest pleas to vote from a star-studded roster. JD Vance hit back at those who say Trump is a fascist, accusing Harris and her allies of disrespecting second world war veterans as he campaigned on Tuesday in one of the most hotly contested regions of battleground Michigan.",

The star-studded series of events could give the Harris campaign a boost. When Harris campaigned in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the folk band Bon Iver \u2013 from the Eau Claire area \u2013 opened for her. The Madison crowd was energetic on Wednesday night, but with less than a week to go before election day, some Democrats at the venue seemed anxious. \u201cI\u2019ve been making calls for Harris,\u201d said Mary Ann Olson, a retired teacher, who waited in pouring rain for the rally. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t win, and I didn\u2019t do anything, I think I would hate myself.\u201d Olson\u2019s daughter, Chelsea, said she was \u201creally stressed out\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can handle four more years of Donald Trump.\u201d",

The Massachusetts serviceman, 22, pleaded guilty. In a sentencing memorandum, prosecutors say he \u201cperpetrated one of the most significant and consequential violations of the Espionage Act in American history \u2026 Teixeira violated his oath, almost every day, for over a year\u201d. Teixeira\u2019s attorneys argue that he should serve 11 years for his \u201cterrible decision\u201d for which he \u201cthoroughly accepted responsibility\u201d. Sentencing is due to take place on 12 November. The leak exposed secret assessments of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, including information about troop movements and the provision of supplies and equipment to Ukrainian troops.

Instead, the event has reheated simmering tensions on the island territory of Puerto Rico, where locals say they feel like second-class citizens, days out from a historic US election. Comments from a comedian at Trump\u2019s rally this week, describing Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d, might have fired up local resentment against the Republican candidate, but those who live there will be unable to show their anger through the ballot box. Residents of Puerto Rico are among the more than 3 million Americans whose votes won\u2019t count, when the country elects its president next week. Most residents of the US territories \u2013 Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Marianas \u2013 are citizens or nationals. Many have family on the mainland, and some pay federal taxes. But the territories have no votes in the electoral college that ultimately decides the president. \u201cThey\u2019re just basically captive to whatever Congress and the president want to do to them,\u201d says Luis Fuentes-Rohwer, a law professor at Indiana University. \u201cTo be a citizen means to be a member of the political community.

Residents have no say over Washington\u2019s decisions that control their everyday lives, according to Karina Claudio Betancourt, a student in Puerto Rico\u2019s capital city, San Juan. \u201cElections impact us because the president decides what to do or not to do with Puerto Rico right now,\u201d they say. Betancourt points to Donald Trump\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island, and the Obama administration\u2019s imposition of a board controlling government funding. \u201cBasic transportation and health services and things that impact us day-to-day are decided by the Congress of the United States and by this fiscal oversight board, but we don\u2019t get to vote for any of that,\u201d they say. \u201cPeople are fed up.\u201d Guam resident Phillip Gilbert says it\u2019s unfair to leave territory voters disfranchised. \u201cI do feel robbed not being able to vote,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a service member, I especially feel that this is not fair after serving my country.\u201d The 47-year-old could register as a Washington State resident and vote absentee while stationed in Guam with the navy, but Gilbert lost the right to vote for president once he had retired in the territory. Charles Ala\u2019ilima is on the board of Right to Democracy, one of a growing number of organisations working to get territory residents \u2013 98% of whom are people of colour \u2013 more influence. \u201cThere is this othering going on of people of colour, people of the territories, right?\u201d he says. \u201cUnless [you] actually have citizenship and the right to vote, you are always going to be considered other, not a full part of the United States.\u201d While his home of American Samoa may be too small to become a state on its own, representation could just start with Congress asking the population whether they want to be a permanent part of the US, Ala\u2019ilima says. \u201cIf they put that in front of the people, I expect 99% would say we\u2019d be a permanent part of the United States \u2026 [and] the United States then has to make adjustments in their laws to allow the territory to become a full fledged part of the political process.\u201d But territories could also be given a say in the presidency by amending the constitution to grant them electoral college votes, as happened for Washington DC. Many Puerto Ricans who have moved to the mainland will be able to make their voices heard on 5 November, with large communities in Pennsylvania and Florida being targeted by both campaigns. Those who remain in the territory meanwhile, have made numerous efforts to become a state in their own right. The island has more people than the five smallest states combined and statehood is supported by many, but the final decision lies with Congress \u2013 and recent efforts have stalled. Those delays and persistent disfranchisement means some Puerto Ricans are eager to leave the US orbit altogether. On Tuesday, alongside elections for local politicians and an informal straw poll for their favoured presidential candidate, they will vote in their seventh non-binding referendum on status \u2013 this time putting full and partial independence up against statehood. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that that all of these decisions are being made as if we were savages, as if we were people who can\u2019t have self determination,\u201d Betancourt says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for the president of the United States \u2013 I want to vote for the president of Puerto Rico.\u201d Additional reporting by Mar-Vic Cagurangan in Guam",

      "bodyText": "People living in remote Indigenous communities are paying more than double the capital city prices for everyday groceries including flour, tasty cheese, apples and milk, new research has found. A basket of nine items, which also included penne pasta, beef mince, teabags, carrots and Weet-Bix cost $99.38 on average at four remote community stores in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, the research by Choice found. The same items cost $44.70 when averaged out across Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and IGA stores in all of Australia\u2019s capital cities, according to the consumer advocacy group. Choice has called on the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to explore capping the prices of essential supermarket items in remote communities. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email While the competition watchdog does not set supermarket prices, Choice wants the ACCC to recommend that the federal government develop an affordable pricing policy which could include price caps. Choice made the recommendation in its submission to the ACCC\u2019s ongoing inquiry into Australia\u2019s supermarket sector. To gather samples for its price comparison, Choice bought nine items from stores in the Great Sandy Desert and Pilbara regions in WA and in the West Daly region and on the Tiwi Islands in the NT in August. Their prices were then compared with those of identical groceries in capital centres around the country. The highest price was in the West Daly area, west of Darwin, where the items cost $110.82. Choice\u2019s Jarni Blakkarly said the price differences were \u201cpretty astounding\u201d. In capital cities, people paid $4.87 for a kilogram of apples on average, whereas the cost was $7.50 a kilo at the store Choice visited on the Tiwi Islands, he said. \u201cAvailability of food in the first place is also a big issue faced by people living in remote communities,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one store visited by our mystery shopper there was no bread to be found, and our shopper had to make do with frozen hotdog buns.\u201d Four years ago, a federal inquiry found there was a \u201ctenuous\u201d supply of affordable, nutritious food in many remote communities that had persisted despite multiple previous inquiries. Among the 2020 inquiry\u2019s recommendations was that the government establish real-time price monitoring across all remote community stores, to be reported publicly. Financial counsellor and Boandik woman Bettina Cooper said live price monitoring was a good idea but the government needed to cap the prices of essential items if it was \u201cserious about closing the gap\u201d. \u201cWe need to be closing the gap, not supporting profit-making, while our First Nations brothers and sisters in remote communities are struggling to feed their family,\u201d she said. Cooper, who works at Mob Strong Debt Help, disagreed with economists who said price caps would do little except reduce the supply of groceries. \u201cI\u2019d like to see them go and sit in a remote community and try and feed their family on a Centrelink payment and then have that conversation with them,\u201d she said. Prof Nitika Garg, a consumer behaviour researcher at the University of New South Wales, said higher prices in remote areas meant people were more likely to buy cheaper food that was less healthy but she was dubious about price caps. Before the Queensland election earlier this month, the Greens proposed capping prices on 30 essential groceries such as bread, milk and nappies across the state at January 2024 levels, with any price increases tied to wage increases. Prof Phil Lewis, who leads the University of Canberra\u2019s Centre for Labour Market Research, said capping prices did nothing but reduce supply. \u201cIf you actually try and reduce the price below what suppliers are willing to supply at, they\u2019ll stop so much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be scarcities arising in the shop.\u201d The University of Queensland\u2019s Prof John Quiggin said government subsidies such as his state\u2019s remote communities freight assistance scheme were a better way to bring down prices. \u201cWe need programs that reduce the cost of healthy food [in remote areas] and encourage people to have healthy diets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is quite a separate problem from the problem we face in general, which is that prices have gone up and wages haven\u2019t.\u201d",
