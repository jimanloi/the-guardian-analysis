For a start, he finds it impossible to get his eyebrows right: they\u2019re usually scrawled haphazardly across the upper reaches of his forehead. And while his every utterance comes suffused with bitchy energy, he flounders during any actual war-of-wits. What Dickie does have, however, is a ridiculously inflated sense of self-worth: in the grand tradition of sitcom monsters, his three defining personality traits are vanity, delusion and a spectacular dearth of talent. When his boyfriend decides he\u2019s had enough of this \u201cselfish, egotistical prick\u201d, Dickie\u2019s impulse is to soften his heart with a repulsively flat rendition of Make You Feel My Love, which is cut short when he is hit by a car. Needless to say, he doesn\u2019t get his man back.</p> <p>Dickie would probably like to think he is the star of Smoggie Queens \u2013 the brainchild of comedian Phil Dunning, who plays him \u2013 but he\u2019s not; this Middlesbrough-set sitcom (Smoggie is a nickname for someone from the area) is very much an ensemble piece. In fact, that\u2019s the whole point: the show\u2019s primary theme is \u201cchosen family\u201d \u2013 a group of friends that are a staple of LGBTQ+ communities. Dickie\u2019s clan includes kindly middle-aged drag queen Mam (played by a masterfully disguised Mark Benton; I gasped when I saw his name on the credits), stony-faced wannabe singer Sal, token heterosexual Lucinda and naive newbie Stewart, whose youth is taken as an act of outright hostility by the ageing Dickie.</p> <p>As a premise, it\u2019s a timely and novel one, and Smoggie Queens does a great job of capturing British camp sensibility: the cheerfully shonky glam, the deadpan humour, the cosy obscenity, the hearty embrace of all things tacky, unpretentious and mainstream. After that car accident, Dickie \u2013 clad in black veil and dramatically running mascara \u2013 stages a wake for his relationship. Later, we\u2019re treated to a mesmeric dance-off to B*Witched\u2019s C\u2019est la Vie at a Titanic-themed drag brunch. One of the show\u2019s major delights is its gleeful celebration of the UK\u2019s low-brow pop culture canon, from Lorraine Kelly to Girls Aloud to Stewart\u2019s scandalous revelation that he is unfamiliar with daytime TV mainstay Bargain Hunt.</p> <p>But Bargain Hunt references alone cannot buoy a sitcom for six episodes. I was very much looking forward to Smoggie Queens; Dunning\u2019s silly, mildly chaotic character comedy (often delivered in drag) has been an uproarious fixture of London\u2019s alternative scene for a few years now; he is one of the closest things we have to the satirists of extremely online millennial life who operate across the pond (see: John Early, Kate Berlant, Tim Robinson). Yet Smoggie Queens\u2019 use of Dunning\u2019s trademark humour feels strangely half-hearted.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure how much compromise was involved in its creation, but something about the comic tone doesn\u2019t quite stack up. The cartoonishly vile Dickie \u2013 whose every remark tends to be delivered in the same monotone, vocal-fried drawl \u2013 might have worked as a dark, uncompromising Julia Davis-style grotesque, yet here he is surrounded by soppiness and schmaltz. That part makes sense, because the series is all about a tight-knit queer community who look after each other: Dickie aside, Smoggie Queens radiates earnest loveliness, and the humour is safe and fairly obvious. Yet while it is often very heartwarming, the show doesn\u2019t really work as a big, lovable Gavin and Stacey-esque sitcom either. I\u2019m putting this down to a distinct lack of actual jokes. I appreciate an experimental yet broadly unfunny comedy as much as the next TV critic, but Smoggie Queens does not belong to this modern genre: it is a conventional sitcom that is simply too light on big-swing gags. (That said, there is a genuinely disturbing storyline involving Sal\u2019s abusive, toxic girlfriend, played by Peaky Blinders\u2019 Charlotte Riley.)</p> <p>The sitcom is an endangered species; Ofcom has classed scripted comedy as an \u201cat risk\u201d genre six years in a row. This means that finding fault with that rarest of beasts \u2013 a brand-new sitcom from a new (to TV) talent \u2013 feels tantamount to shooting a Siberian tiger at point blank range. But comedy is itself merciless as a category: if it\u2019s not funny enough, it hasn\u2019t done its job. Smoggie Queens is very sweet and the world it builds will delight many, but it lacks the punchlines of a properly mainstream crowd-pleaser or the transgressive shock value of a cult hit. It is marooned somewhere in the middle, a place of impressive flamboyance, but too few actual laughs.</p> <p>\u2022 Smoggie Queens is on BBC Three and iPlayer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here is Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report: Thanks for reading and ciao. Tremendously well worked goal for Roma\u2019s late equaliser, by the way. Saelemaekers\u2019 ball for the overlapping Angelino was perfectly weighted, and enabled the wing-back to get plenty of power on his cross. Hummels was there to whack it in from point-blank range. The journey back to Italy will be all the more pleasant for them. Spurs are the bookies\u2019 favourites to win the whole shebang. Playing like that, they\u2019ll produce some more classic matches, but certainly won\u2019t win it. Match report coming up. Plus any reaction that I see on my telly. Big, big result for Roma and for Ranieri in his second match in charge, as he begins his third spell in charge of his hometown club. Rangers will overtake Spurs, bumping them out of the top eight in the Europa League table. That was an amazingly entertaining game of association football. Congratulations to all involved. 90 min +4: Spurs win a corner. Roma clear. Hummels, who doesn\u2019t look 100% fit, dribbles the ball out from defence. Can someone find a winner? That is such bad luck for Forster, whose save from Mancini\u2019s volley that led to the corner was absolutely incredible. That was coming. Saelemaekers, who has been class since he came on, spots Angelino coming on the overlap behind him and plays a beautifully weighted pass to the byline. Angelino hammers a low cross-shot to the far post. And who is waiting to turn it in? None other than our old friend Mats Hummels, who had such a shocker in the first half. Football! Bloody hell. Wowee! 89 min: Saelemaekers and Angelino link down the Roma left. Suddenly they are playing with considerable swagger. They switch the angle of attack. A corner is won. And then another \u2026 and then a marvellous save by Forster from a volley! Wow! 87 min: Whoops! Horrible error by Porro as a good early cross comes in for Roma. He tries to cushion a header back to Forster, but Dovbyk is nearly on to it! Somehow Spurs scramble it clear. That was lunacy from Porro. 86 min: Now Werner is released in tonnes of space on the Spurs left. He flashes a low cross to the near post but Svilar gathers cleanly. Kulusevski then barges into the box seconds later and his shot is saved by Svilar. 84 min: Roma win a corner. Hummels tries an overhead kick. High and wide. Roma come again in attack, though \u2026 83 min: Roma\u2019s Paredes gets himself in a muddle near halfway. Bergvall is penalised for a foul. There is a very slight lull in this breathless second half. 80 min: Werner crosses for Solanke! Solanke hits the woodwork after nodding for the near corner! Porro soon hits a volley in the next phase of play. Svilar gets down to save. 78 min: Can Roma snatch a point? A win? To stand a chance of finishing in the top eight in this infernal group stage, they really need a win. 76 min: Roma\u2019s Mancini gives away a corner trying to shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. The crowd cheer enthusiastically. Now, Son is taken off for Werner, Bentancur off for Bergvall. 73 min: Saelemaekers is clattered by Bentancur out on the touchline. Ranieri, who is standing right there, wants a VAR check. But nothing doing. Bentancur is booked and is perhaps lucky that it isn\u2019t more. There was also a yellow card brandished in the direction of Roma\u2019s bench, I think. 70 min: Tottenham\u2019s Solanke smashes a shot from an angle. Svilar beats it out. The former Bournemouth and Liverpool man had Maddison inside him and that may have been the better option. 69 min: Bissouma and Maddison come on for Spurs. Sarr and Johnson off. For Roma, Saelemaekers and Zalewski are on, Celik and El Shaarawy off. 68 min: Kone flashes a low shot fractionally wide for Roma now! Ranieri applauds. Manchester United are now 3-2 up: 64 min: Solanke now pops up on the left and skins his marker. He sprints to the byline and crosses to the far post. Johnson is lurking, but Paredes does excellently to scoop the ball out for a corner while being careful not to turn it into his own net. I don\u2019t think anyone in the stadium tonight will say they haven\u2019t had value for money. It\u2019s been non-stop. 61 min: Porro hits the free-kick. It\u2019s a brilliant effort that shaves the top of the bar. \u201cTottenham have got to reset. They\u2019re playing it too easy-osey at the back,\u201d says Hoddle. 60 min: Ah. There is the 10%. Davies embarks on a brilliant run at the guts of the Roma defence. He is upended by Ndicka and it\u2019s a free-kick for Spurs in a dangerous central area. Porro will hit it, it seems. 59 min: Angelino hits the bar with a volley! Tottenham have gone AWOL again it seems because it\u2019s all Roma. Or certainly 90% Roma. 58 min: There are more goals in this. Don\u2019t you worry about that. It\u2019s end-to-end, more or less. Football is fun again. 55min: Dovbyk now tucks a finish in at the near post! But a check for offside is ongoing. It was tight. And is confirmed. 53min: Dovbyk gets in behind and squares for Kone, who taps in. But the Ukrainian was caught offside by a disciplined Spurs back line. 51 min: Dovbyk gets a rare bit of service in the penalty area. He tees up a teammate for a shot but it flies wide. 49 min: Paredes cracks a shot wide from distance for Roma. They could easily get right back into this and are building some quite tasty attacking moves. 48 min: Spurs had a four-on-two there. But Roma got away with it. It was a good tackle by Hummels on Kulusevski. 47 min: Spurs start the second half on the front foot. But Roma then build a concerted attack with Mancini crossing from the right. And now Tottenham break at pace! Mat\u00edas Soul\u00e9 on, Dybala off for Roma. He must be injured. Because he was flying. Rangers are beating Nice 3-0 away in France. Get all your live scores here. K\u00e1ri Tulinius emails: \u201cKulusevski and Son sounds like the name of a law firm in a minor Coen Brothers movie, where John Goodman and Jefferson Mays play a father and son legal team representing a nakedly crooked politician who gets whacked.\u201d The pun supremo Peter Oh adds: \u201cIn terms of crest juxtaposition, matchups don\u2019t get much better than this. Both feature animals doing things not often seen in nature. Spurs\u2019 cockerel impressively perched on a ball, and Roma\u2019s she-wolf suckling human twins.\u201d A bit of reading for you: Classic Manchester United too, it seems: What a first half that was, by the way. Classic Spurs so far. See you soon for more. 45 min + 2: On the sideline, Postecoglou is screaming at Son about not running forward, or something like that. We\u2019ve got a couple of minutes more stoppage time. 45 min: I\u2019ve just seen an online news story originating from Italy with the headline: \u201cVideo: continua il disastro di Hummels per la Roma\u201d He has, unfortunately, had a bit of a shocker on his first start for the club. 44 min: Kulusevski and Son are in the thick of it again. The South Korea international dances into the area and finds his teammate. Kulusevski curls a right-footed shot, trying to bend it in the far post, but it drifts wide. 40 min: Porro has a crack from distance now. What a topsy-turvy first half this has been \u2013 Spurs are firmly back in control having apparently checked out mentally for 20 minutes or so. 39 min: Spurs mount another concerted attack. The ball ends up with Son, who digs out an excellent curling effort that Svilar has to tip around the post. 37 min: \u201cThe difference between the top, top teams is the mental side,\u201d points out Hoddle on commentary. He is referring to Tottenham\u2019s famous inconsistency. 36 min: Now Kulusevski hits the post! Son blazes over from the rebound! This really is a sensational game. Cracking goal. Spurs counter after Dybala gives it away in an advanced area. Kulusevski is released by an excellent pass by Sarr down the left. He collects it and promptly has Hummels on toast as he sprints to the byline. The Sweden international picks out a brilliant low cross to the near post, where Johnson has timed his run perfectly, and tucks his finish inside the near post. Spurs are BACK! 30 min: Kulusevski and Porro link on the Spurs right. They\u2019ve woken up again, but the way they surrendered the initiative after going 1-0 up was very \u2026 no, I won\u2019t say it. 28 min: Now Sarr pounces on a Roma mistake. He strides into the penalty area and smacks a low shot that is gathered cleanly by Svilar. This is a helluva match. 27 min: Dybala is on the move again. Spurs are all over the shop in defence. The Argentinian moves into the penalty area, cuts inside and shoots: Forster makes an excellent low save. 26 min: Blimey! Spurs are denied a second in dramatic fashion! A Johnson effort is blocked on the line, desperately, by a Roma defender. There\u2019s another follow up effort but Roma manage to get it out for a corner. The crowd are wailing. This is a brilliant game and a tremendous atmosphere. Wowzers. What a goal. But is he offside? Yes he is. It is a delightful flick over the last defender by Dybala. El Shaarawy volleys it unerringly into the far corner, a goal reminiscent of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s cracker in the World Cup final in 2022. But the winger is adjudged offside by the VAR. Dybala strokes over a free-kick after a needless foul from Tottenham \u2013 Ndicka gets up and deflects the ball into the roof of the net off his shoulder! Super delivery, and a good header, even if it included a slice of luck. 17 min: A warning for Tottenham! Celik plays a low ball in from wide out on the Roma right. Dybala nearly nicks it away from Forster at the near post. But the goalie does well. Spurs cough up possession again though, almost immediately, as they try to play out from the back. A bit careless. 16 min: Johnson breaks down the right. He takes a good first touch and cuts inside. But then crosses without looking for a target and there is too much on it. 14 min: Spurs have quietened down from an attacking point of view since that high-octane start. Dybala fancies lobbing Forster from halfway. He tries it, but it\u2019s a poor effort, much to the displeasure of Dovbyk, who was making a pacy run down the middle for the visitors. 12 min: Roma win a corner. It\u2019s floated to Angelino on the edge of the box. He fluffs his attempted volley completely and the ball ends up back with Dybala, who took the corner. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some one-twos in my time but nothing like that,\u201d says Glenn Hoddle. The Son penalty. 8 min: All hands on deck for Roma\u2019s defenders and it looks like they are in for a long night. Kulusevski this time is bearing down on a back-tracking opponents. But they manage to clear their lines. Boom! A lovely penalty struck sweetly into the net with the goalie going the wrong way. There it is. 3 min: A lovely incisive move from Spurs. Hummels appears to catch Sarr in the penalty area after the ball is cut back from the hosts\u2019 right. It looks like a foul at first glance \u2026 but the referee isn\u2019t having it. However, after a long VAR check, the ref will take a look on the telly. I think this is a penalty. 2 min: Tottenham stroke the ball around a bit to start. Two banks of Roma defenders are camped in their penalty area. Here we go. The teams are out. Postecoglou and Ranieri exchange a few friendly words on the sideline. I couldn\u2019t think of a time Spurs had played Roma, and indeed, this is the first competitive meeting between the sides. On pundit duty, Peter Crouch predicts a \u201creasonably comfortable\u201d win for Spurs. \u201cYou need to move on quickly,\u201d Postecoglou tells TNT Sports of that win at City. \u201cIt was a good day for us. We played well, and you need to against the best in the business. It\u2019s a different challenge tonight. And it\u2019ll be a good challenge. Will Roma have a new manager bounce? \u201cIt will be a tough game. They\u2019ve had a difficult start to the season. Europe is a bit of an escape from that for all clubs, a chance to kickstart your season \u2026 Claudio\u2019s come in, they lost against Napoli: tonight will be a tough game.\u201d And finally on Fraser Forster: \u201cHe\u2019s been around a long time and he\u2019s a big part of the club. He\u2019s already played in the Europa League this season so he\u2019s not going in cold. He\u2019ll do well.\u201d Thank you to Mats Hummels for reminding me: this is a crucial game for Roma\u2019s European hopes: \u201cThis game is incredibly important for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s possibly our last chance if we want to finish in the top eight but we need points anyway to reach the next round and turn things around for our team and our club. It\u2019s a very difficult game but it\u2019s also a big chance. We\u2019re playing a very strong team but we can show we\u2019re able to play at a much higher level.\u201d Bryan Cristante, on the bench for Roma tonight, is the player who swung that England v Italy Euro 2020 final in the Azzurri\u2019s direction. In my opinion. Chelsea have beaten Heidenheim 2-0 in the Europa Conference League. As for the Europa League table, Spurs sit eighth as we go to press. Roma are 21st out of 36. Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s ban applies to domestic matches only, by the way: Guglielmo Vicario has had surgery to repair an ankle fracture that he sustained in Tottenham\u2019s 4-0 Premier League win at Manchester City on Saturday. The news has rocked the club so soon after such a morale-boosting result and it will deprive them of one of their key players and leaders at a busy time of the season. Isn\u2019t it lovely to reminisce about those pre-Brexit days when Ranieri led Leicester to the Premier League title? But that was then, and this is now, and all that. Will Unwin has Manchester United v Bod\u00f8/Glimt right here: Four changes for Tottenham then, with Forster in nets, while Gray, Bentancur and Johnson also come in. It\u2019s a first start for Mats Hummels among three changes for Roma: Paulo Dybala also comes back into the side. Tottenham (4-3-3): Forster; Porro, Dragusin, Davies, Gray; Sarr, Bentancur, Johnson; Kulusevski, Solanke, Son (capt.). Substitutes: Austin, Whiteman, Bissouma, Udogie, Maddison, Bergvall, Werner, Olusesi, Williams-Barnet, Hardy, King. Roma (3-4-2-1): Svilar, Mancini, Hummels, Ndicka; Celik, Kone, Paredes, Angelino; Dybala, El Shaarawy; Dovbyk. Substitutes: Marin, Ryan, Cristante, Pellegrini, Abdulhamid, Soule, Le Fee, Baldanzi, Saelemaekers, Zalewski, Pisilli, Sangare. Ange Postecoglou said this is \u201ca really pivotal part of the season\u201d. He was speaking before his Tottenham players opened an industrial-sized can of whup-ass for Manchester City at the Etihad last Saturday, so hats off to him, the pivot has initially been positive. But Spurs have eight more matches to squeeze in before Christmas, starting with Roma this evening, and such a congested spell will provide a stern test for Project Postecoglou and Ange-ball. For every 4-0 thrashing of the Premier League champions there seems to be a shock defeat by the likes of Crystal Palace or Ipswich, so the jury remains out on Tottenham\u2019s long-term prospects under the Greek-Australian. Whatever happens tonight should be fun, though, because Claudio Ranieri is back in charge of Roma for the third time in his career. The 73-year-old\u2019s first match in charge as caretaker manager was a 1-0 defeat by Napoli last Sunday. Can the wily old fox derail Ange\u2019s festive plans? We\u2019re about to find out.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for joining me. Here is Jamie Jackson\u2019s report from Old Trafford. Amorim: \u201cI see what everyone sees. Good moments, difficult moments, some confusion in the end trying to keep the result. They ran, they pressed, they showed us what we had worked on. We won. \u201cHalf of the stadium does not know me, I came from Portugal, I did nothing for this club yet, so the way they made me feel at home is so special. I will keep this to the end of my career. \u201cIt was like a ride. We started well and then suffered two goals in two transitions. I liked that our players tried to play in the way we wanted. The players are really trying, I think we deserved to win. \u201cBruno is the most experienced player and is the right man to start the tempo we want to play. \u201cI get anxious because I do not know what will happen. We control nothing at the moment but we are trying different things. We go to the game excited because we want to see different things but you are also nervous but you do not see how it will go. \u201cWe did four substitutions because of the fitness of the squad. We need all the players fit.\u201d Rasmus Hojlund: \u201cI think it was a bad start, we came back and showed character. We want to make sure these games don\u2019t get too difficult. \u201cHe [Amorim] told me today, not to think too much about the guys behind and try to work on what I can see in front. We saw that on the first goal. \u201cI\u2019ve been told by the others that it [first goal] was very good, so I will go home and see it again. \u201cIt will take time but we can already see some patterns and it will get better. It is for us to build on this. This system reminds me of how I played at Atalanta \u2013 it suits me very well.\u201d Amorim gets down the tunnel as quickly as possible. He will love the collection of TV interviews he has to do. A Bodo players has just swapped shirts with Antony. What a treat for him. United just about hold on for a vital first win under Amorim. It was not exactly convincing but they needed this. 90+2 mins: Berg steps up and it is heading for the top corner but Onana makes a fine save to keep United ahead. 90+1 mins: Bodo have a free-kick on the edge of the box after a Casemiro handball. 90 mins: Three minutes added on. 88 mins: United doing their best to keep the ball but they give it away, allowing Bodo to swing a cross into the box. Hoge produces a fine header and Onana has to make the save. The assistant puts his flag up, despite the striker clearly being onside. \u201cBodo/Glint was a 1995 B-side by The Fall,\u201d suggests Steven Hughes. 86 mins: Bodo reach the United box but Maata cross is ferociously cleared to the halfway line. United will not want to let this lead slip. 84 mins: Amad expertly plucks the ball out of the sky and initiates an attack. What a fine first touch. Admittedly, it comes to nothing. 82 mins: Rashford has the chance to end this as a contest but he fires his shot across goal and wide. Auklend is the final Bodo sub sent on. Evjen off. 80 mins: The game is quite open now. Bodo have opened up as the look for the equaliser. 78 mins: Mac Millings emails: \u201cJust catching up with the MBM, and was shocked to read the phrase \u2018Zinckernagel outpaces Malacia\u2019. Is Malacia okay? Is he, perhaps, wearing boots of molasses on a dare? Having watched young Philip for 18 months at Watford, I cannot picture a scenario in which he could outpace anybody. He\u2019s so slow, his shadow leaves him behind. Etc.\u201d It is worth pointing out that Malacia has not played in 550 days or something. 76 mins: Onana sprints 25 yards or so out of his goal and loses the ball to Hoge. The goalkeeper somehow recovers and United clear down the pitch. In the end, the ball reaches Garnacho but he fires over. A silly few seconds. 74 mins: Hojlund controls a ball over the top from Dalot and lays it off to Garnacho but the winger drags his shot wide. Malcolm Shuttleworth is back: \u201cThe good news is my German girlfriend has woken up. When I put it to her that she should read your blog, she quipped, quite wittily I thought, \u2018I\u2019d rather powder my nose with a garlicky sauerkraut dip!\u2019 \u201cI must admit, it loses a lot in translation...\u201d Can you send us evidence of her using said dip. 72 mins: Saltnes and Maata on for Bodo. Can they get back into this? Kevin emails: \u201cBut everyone knows Bodo/Glimt as the faded \u201870s prog rock band. A difficult time after their front man left saw albums such as \u2018Muddle\u2019 and the surprisingly successful \u2018Dark Side of the Mourinho\u2019. A lot now hangs on their latest offering: \u2018Shine on you crazy diamond formation\u2019...\u201d 70 mins: Hauge is the net one to threaten and he does get a proper shot away but Onana drops on it. Down the other end \u2026 Amad cuts in from the right and takes aim for the far corner but Haikin is equal to it. 68 mins: Bodo/Glimt have not threatened in this half thus far but Sjovold gets round the back of the United defence and puts in a cross that is dealt with. 66 mins: Fernandes looks like he is about to control a pass over the top and be one-on-one with the goalkeeper but the United skipper falls over at the vital moment. Final sub for United \u2026 Casemiro is on for De Ligt. One assumes the Brazilian is about to drop into the centre of the back three. This is a like a pre-season game. 64 mins: Hogh and Sjovold are on for Bodo. The former is now up top and latter at right-back. 62 mins: The triple change results in United playing 3-4-3 again. What larks. Elina Rye-Onsaker emails: \u201cGreetings from Norway! (Though much more south than Bod\u00f8). Listening to this match on radio, as I\u2019m a student without a TV, and the Norwegian commentator mentioned how there are 45.000 members in the Norwegian Manchester United supporters club. Bod\u00f8 has a population of 53.000.\u201d The power of Henning Berg. 60 mins: Antony, Mount and Martinez head off. Shaw looks like he will play at centre back. 58 mins: Rashford and Amad are readying themselves. Luke Shaw is about to remove his woolly hat and snood, too. 56 mins: \u201cDo people really think footballers are jigsaw pieces which cannot adapt to a different position?\u201d asks Ben Hennessy. \u201cSurely professional athletes can learn a different system given time to train. 135 minutes into Amorim\u2019s stint and people are already crucifying his preferred formation.\u201d It is quite a change from Ten Hag to this. One problem Amorim has is a lack of time on the training ground with United playing twice a week for the foreseeable. 54 mins: Clearly there are some problems with this system but I have not seen United look so threatening going forward for a while. Garnacho is the latest to have a chance, flying down the left and driving into the box but his curling shot is well saved by Haikin. A fine move and finish. Mount steps over a pass and Ugarte pings a cross which Hojlund turns home inside the six-yard box. There is a long VAR check but the striker is just on. 50 mins: \u201cGreetings from Leverkusen,\u201d says Malcolm Shuttleworth. \u201cMy German girlfriend fell asleep before United\u2019s first goal and hasn\u2019t woken up yet. Maybe she has better judgement than me.\u201d Wait! She isn\u2019t reading the blog?! 49 mins: OFF THE BAR! Mount does well to manipulate the ball after receiving a pass inside the box from Garnacho but the former Chelsea man sees his shot ping off the top of the bar. 47 mins: It looks like Amorim has changed tactics. Four at the back with Mazraoui at right back and Dalot on the left. It is something akin to a 4-2-3-1. Here we go again! Dalot replaces Malacia at half time. Krishnamoorthy says: \u201cPoor Amorim - must be looking for fresh offers already. I honestly can\u2019t understand why someone would inherit this mess.\u201d \u201cIs it just me who thinks Bodo/Glimt sound like a couple of characters from Lord of the Rings?\u201d Richard Hirst is asking the wrong man. I will put it to the floor instead. Rob Hisnay emails: \u201cSo, a team steeped in 4 at the back and attacking wingers suddenly has to adapt to 3-4-3? The current team can\u2019t play that system. Just fitting square pegs into round holes. Because of Ten Hag\u2019s horrible transfers there\u2019s little money to now go out and buy players who can play a 3-4-3. \u201cThe mess continues!\u201d Half-time reading: We are level after an intriguing first 45. United look confused with the new system and Bodo have taken advantage are key moments. GOAL! Mazraoui chips a cross into the box, Hojlund takes a wonderful first touches and volleys into the corner despite having little room to work with. A sublime finish! 43 mins: Garnacho wins a corner on the left. Mount goes over to take it. The cross beats everyone but Bjortuft gets confused and needless flicks it out for another. Malacia is the man to take it from the right \u2026 but it\u2019s cleared. 41 mins: United are having a decent spell of possession but are struggling to find a gap in the Bodo defence. The Norwegians have 11 men behind the ball. Antony shows a bit of skill on the right to beat a man and lay a pass off. Malacia sends a pass to Fernandes but his shot is weak. Haikin is eventually called into action when a defender turns a Garnacho cross towards his own goal. 39 mins: Malacia dinks a cross to the back post but is actually closer to sneaking in than find a teammate. Savage is just repeatedly pointing out he should have a job higher up \u2026 37 mins: Amorim is offering out a lot of instruction on the touchline. Savage says Amorim needs 18 months to sort this mess of a team out. Good luck, Ruben. 35 mins: Robbie Savage is spending his time on co-comms explaining how none of the United team are suited to playing in this formation. It is quite entertaining from Savage (for once). 33 mins: Antony has a chance to run at Gundersen but goes straight into the defender before falling over. He does get up and keeps the ball, only to see his shot blocked. 31 mins: Hojlund is certainly putting in the hard yards to put the Bodo centre-backs under plenty of pressure. He almost catches Bjortuft out but the defender gets the ball back to the goalkeeper just in time. Helmersen is booked for a foul on Fernandes. It seems a little harsh for a first offence. 29 mins: Bodo/Glimt certainly know their roles. Knutsen has them well-trained, although it helps that he has been coaching them for years. 27 mins: It could be 3-1! Evjen is found by Bjorkan in the box but he is leaning back slightly and his shot rises over the bar. 25 mins: Amorim is realising how difficult it is to dramatically change tactics at a mid-table Premier League club. GOAL! A long ball is played inside Malacia who does not react in time and Zinckernagel gets ahead of him in the race to reach the ball in the box, he takes a touch or two and phrases it beyond Onana. OH! Zinckernagel outpaces Malacia and provides a clinical finish. 22 mins: United will be even more frustrated by their failure to take their chances now. Amorim will also be wondering how Evjen had so much space on the edge of the box. Malacia chips a cross which Haikin claims and drops to the ground. I am not sure they need to slow things down just now. GOAL! The Norwegians get the ball into the box for a first time in the while. Fet holds it up and tees up the shot for Evjen sprinting towards the edge of the box, from where he pings a wonderstrike in to the top corner. What a cracking strike! 18 mins: Fernandes takes a punt from distance but his shot bounces well wide of the post. It is all United at the moment and Amorim is pacing up and down the touchline eager for a second. 16 mins: Garnacho darts into the box and pulls it back to Mount in space but Haikin is equal to the shot. The goalkeeper is called upon moments later to do similar to a Fernandes effort. United are looking lively in the final third which is pretty novel for them. There is a sea of yellow in the corner at Old Trafford and the Bodo fans are bouncing. 14 mins: Antony gets his first chance to do something useful but instead of playing a clever pass to Mount in space in the box, he sends it backwards. 12 mins: Zinckernagel receives a pass on the edge of the box and moves the ball quickly to beat a couple of defenders but he is off-balance as he shoots, ensuring the effort trickles towards goal. 10 mins: Knutsen is also pitchside making plenty of notes as he plots a route back into this game. His team are doing their bit to make this a game with their own brand of intensity and constant pressing. 8 mins: Bjorkan uses the space given to him on the left to get into the box but his cross is cleared for a corner. Some signs of promise for Bodo. The attack results in Amorim getting off the bench and into the technical area. 6 mins: Haikin has quite an eclectic and is actual a British national having spent a lot of his youth in the country. He can\u2019t have fancied making such a mistake on his return to his \u2018homeland\u2019. 4 mins: It does look like United are bit more energetic than in the Ten Hag epoch. They are putting in plenty of effort to press the opposition. GOAL! Haikin lets a backpasss roll across him, Hojlund puts him under pressure and blocks the clearance, which lands to Garnacho who taps into an empty net. WHAT A MISTAKE FROM THE GOALKEEPER. 1 min: Malacia\u2019s first involvement is to needless to give the ball away in his own half to give Bodo the chance to counter. They get to the edge of the box but are held up. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! Amorim comes out of the tunnel to chants oh \u2018Ruben! Ruben! Ruben!\u2019. Kevin Wilson emails: \u201cIf Amorim can get Mount anywhere near his Chelsea prime, then that will be a huge bonus. He\u2019s still young and despite a rough few years, he\u2019s still very talented. Whether he works better as one of the deeper midfielders or in the front three remains to be seen, but if he can stay fit, he\u2019ll give the manager options.\u201d Amorim: \u201cI am really calm, I expect a good game, a good environment, I am feeling that belonging with the fans. I am expecting the team to show different things, we need to improve.\u201d On Malacia: \u201cHe is an international player, he plays there for the national team, he is very aggressive, he played 45 minutes for the under-21s and he is ready.\u201d On Antony: \u201cHe needs to be ready, he will play the position he has for a long time, he has some things to do defensively but otherwise it\u2019s the same position.\u201d It is six changes from Amorim following his first game at Ipswich. I am fascinated to see how he uses Antony. The Brazilian really is Last Chance Saloon having been the worst signing in the club\u2019s history. I woke up in Monaco today but now find myself in Manchester. You should be impressed by my committed to MBMing. YOU HAVE OPTIONS! Join Luke McLaughlin for Spurs v Roma. Could Amorim be the man to get the best out of Rashford? Interesting from Amorim as Antony and Malacia are given their chance. Could Amorim be the man to get the best out of Antony? Get in the mood with Nick Ames.

      "bodyText": "Morning, everyone. We had to wait until about 11.15pm last night but the Senate passed the world\u2019s first attempt at legislation banning young people\u2019s use of social media. Along with migration and housing measures it was quite the night, and may go a long way to defining this government. We have news and analysis, plus how Nature Positive laws were stymied, echoes of Joh Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland\u2019s crime crackdown, and Vladimir Putin saying Donald Trump will \u201cfind a solution\u201d to the Ukraine war. Australia Exclusive | Tanya Plibersek struck a deal in writing with both the Greens and independent senator David Pocock on supporting her nature positive legislation before Anthony Albanese vetoed it hours later in a private meeting with Adam Bandt and Sarah Hanson-Young. Labor\u2019s bill bonanza | A late final sitting in the Senate for the year has seen more than 30 bills pass the upper house, including controversial migration laws that allow the government to pay third countries to take non-citizens and ban travellers from specified countries. The world\u2019s first attempt to ban under-16s from social media platforms went through as well, although much of the detail is yet to be worked through. Despite the trade-offs, the marathon effort in the upper house has done a lot to cement Labor\u2019s first-term agenda with wins on housing especially. Privacy breach | A property investment company breached privacy laws by sharing the names and addresses of people going through a divorce or financial distress with its clients, the information watchdog found. Safer Queensland? | The new state government has acknowledged that its signature youth crime legislation will \u201cdirectly discriminate\u201d against children, by limiting their protection from \u201ccruel treatment\u201d. A veteran human rights lawyer who took on Joh Bjelke-Petersen sees shades of those times in David Crisafulli\u2019s crackdown. Rubbish deal | Macquarie Bank has launched a near-$1.4bn offer to buy the London-listed waste management company Renewi in its latest tilt at UK assets. World Putin praise | Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike \u201cdecision-making centres\u201d in Kyiv with powerful missiles, and has praised \u201cintelligent\u201d Donald Trump as someone who will \u201cfind the solution\u201d to the Ukraine war. Trump caution | A political scientist who predicted Trump\u2019s election win says voters were disgruntled about a weak economy and have not necessarily given the president-elect a mandate to make radical changes. Trump\u2019s putative defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has placed anti-Muslim rhetoric at the centre of several of his published books, according analysis of his output. \u2018Hands on the trigger\u2019 | Hezbollah has vowed to continue resisting Israel and is monitoring the Israeli army\u2019s withdrawal from south Lebanon \u201cwith [our] hands on the trigger\u201d, the militia said as a fragile truce held. Spy trap | A former British soldier whose prison escape sparked a huge manhunt in 2023 has been convicted of spying for Iran but cleared of carrying out a bomb hoax. But was he an amateurish fantasist or a consequential spy? Survival story | A 20-year-old hiker given up for dead has been found alive by two oil workers after surviving 50 days in the Canadian wilderness. Full Story Newsroom edition: do voters still care about the climate during a cost-of-living crisis? Bridie Jabour talks to Mike Ticher and Patrick Keneally about the challenges the Labor government faces when selling its climate credentials at this time. In-depth The political classes may have been more focused on the passage or otherwise of legislation yesterday, but the huge dump of information about how the government is managing the climate crisis is arguably just as important. Our environment editor has been sifting through the data and comes up with six things you need to know about what is happening \u2013 from emissions on a downward trend (but not enough) to why the government needs to set even more ambitious targets. Not the news From the nitty gritty of politics and climate to the unabashed pleasures of an increasingly popular fiction genre: \u201cromantasy\u201d. Emily Mulligan explains that books such as the A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J Maas \u201cknow exactly what the girls want\u201d, including \u201cdetailed descriptions of outfits and interiors, hundreds of pages of crackling sexual tension, and the notion that in the right circumstances we too would be good at archery\u201d. Sport Football | Brazil crashed Clare Polkinghorne\u2019s farewell match for the Matildas with a 3-1 win in Brisbane but Australia have another crack at the visitors on Sunday night. Rugby union | Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii has won his battle to be fit for Australia\u2019s final Test of their British Isles tour and will hope to bow out against Ireland in the spectacular fashion that he began on his debut against England. AFLW | Brisbane Lions will back their strong collective identity as they head into a sixth grand final \u2013 even if they are considered underdogs against North Melbourne. Tennis | Five-time grand slam champion Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine but will be able to play in the Australian Open in January. Media roundup An emergency US funding plea for Virginia-class submarines is sparking fresh Aukus concerns, the ABC reports. NSW has removed targets on results and attendance for public schools, the Sydney Morning Herald claims. The Commonwealth Bank is using AI to resolve payment disputes and its boss, Matt Comyn, tells the Financial Review there is a lot more to come. And the Courier-Mail has called the Queensland government\u2019s axing of the path to treaty a \u201cheartless, destructive decision\u201d. What\u2019s happening today Sport | A parliamentary inquiry will examine decisions made about the 2026 Commonwealth Games. Shopping | Black Friday sales are under way.

But later on Tuesday Albanese spoke to the Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, and assured him the deal \u2013 news of which had reached an alarmed WA resources sector \u2013 would not proceed. Albanese then called Bandt and Hanson-Young to a meeting that evening \u2013 without Plibersek\u2019s knowledge \u2013 and told them the deal was off.

His mining minister, David Michael, had told a gathering on Tuesday night that Albanese had spoken to Cook and told him it was off. Ellen Maybery, a senior specialist lawyer with Environmental Justice Australia, condemned the about-face. \u201cThe Albanese government went to the last election promising to make our nature laws work better for environmental protection. They have broken their promise.\u201d Felicity Wade, the national co-convenor of Labor Environment Action Network, said environmental standards would \u201callow the establishment of decision making rules that provide the certainty business says it needs\u201d. \u201cThis was a chance to show strength and conviction,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe know these are things the electorate are looking for from us. And we faltered.\u201d She said the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which Plibersek\u2019s bill would have amended, would have helped repair \u201ca completely broken system\u201d. \u201cBut the barbarians flexed their muscles and that was that.\u201d",

A decision to approve the use of US-made Atacms missiles on targets inside Russia was met by Russia\u2019s use of a powerful intermediate range missile, Oreshnik, on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6365051916112\">Fox News, </a>Kellogg said Biden\u2019s decision to approve Ukrainian strikes inside Russia has given Trump \u201cmore leverage\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives president Trump more ability to pivot from that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Moscow responded to a New York Times report that unidentified western officials had suggested Biden could give Ukraine nuclear weapons before he steps down. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said discussions in the West about arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d.</p> <p>But the Kellogg-Fleitz plan, though lacking in details, appears to mirror the counsel of Gen Mark A Milley, Biden\u2019s former chief military adviser who argued that since neither Russia nor Ukraine could win the conflict, a negotiated settlement was the sole route to peace.</p> <p>Under the plan, Moscow would also be coaxed to the table with the promise of Nato membership for Ukraine being delayed or abandoned.</p> <p>\u201cWe tell the Ukrainians, \u2018You\u2019ve got to come to the table, and if you don\u2019t come to the table, support from the United States will dry up,\u2019\u201d Kellogg told Reuters in June. \u201cAnd you tell Putin, \u2018He\u2019s got to come to the table and if you don\u2019t come to the table, then we\u2019ll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In that interview, Fleitz said Ukraine would not need to formally cede territory to Russia, but would come to recognize that it would not be able to regain effective control of all its territory.</p> <p>\u201cOur concern is that this has become a war of attrition that\u2019s going to kill a whole generation of young men,\u201d Fleitz said, adding that a lasting peace in Ukraine would require additional security guarantees, including \u201carming Ukraine to the teeth\u201d.</p> <p>But in the policy paper the pair acknowledged that it would be hard for Ukraine to accept a peace deal \u201cthat does not give them back all of their territory or, at least for now, hold Russia responsible for the carnage it inflicted on Ukraine\u201d.</p> <p>Asking whether he endorses Kellogg\u2019s position paper, the president-elect told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can get the war stopped. It should have never started in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Trump said that European nations should contribute more aid, a position echoed by Vance at the Republican national convention in July. \u201cWe will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.\u201d</p> <p>Trump chose Kellogg, an 80-year-old retired army lieutenant general, to be his top adviser on defense issues. He served as national security adviser to Vice-president Mike Pence, was chief of staff of the national security council, and then stepped in as an acting security adviser for Trump after Michael Flynn resigned.</p> <p>During the Vietnam war he served in the 101st airborne division, also known as the Screaming Eagles, and after the first Iraq war he was named commander of special operations command Europe (SOCEUR). He retired in 2003 as a lieutenant general.</p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach\">January 6 Capitol riot</a>, Kellogg demanded that the Secret Service not evacuate Pence from the building, which would have prevented the vice-president from certifying Biden\u2019s electoral victory. \u201cLeave him where he\u2019s at. He\u2019s got a job to do. I know you guys too well. You\u2019ll fly him to Alaska if you have a chance. Don\u2019t do it,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/30/secret-service-tony-ornato-january-6-trump\">reportedly said</a>.</p> <p>After naming Kellogg as envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Trump said Kellogg \u201cwas with me right from the beginning\u201d!</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s plan to tap the retired US lieutenant general Keith Kellogg as US envoy to Ukraine and Russia has triggered renewed interest in a policy document he co-authored that proposes ending the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t enter peace talks \u2013 and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia doesn\u2019t do the same. Trump is said to have responded favorably to the plan \u2013 America First, Russia &amp; Ukraine \u2013 which was presented to him in April and was written by Kellogg and the former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, who both served as chiefs of staff in Trump\u2019s national security council from 2017 to 2021. The document proposes halting further US weapons deliveries to Kyiv if it does not enter peace talks with Moscow, while simultaneously warning Moscow that, should it refuse to negotiate, US support for Ukraine would increase. It blames \u201cunserious and incoherent\u201d US foreign policy under Joe Biden for the three-year conflict, including what it describes as a \u201cprecipitous\u201d US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the supposed antagonization of US allies including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a policy to China described as \u201cweak and confusing\u201d. The paper further accuses the Biden administration of putting \u201cthe idealistic agendas of the global elite ahead of a working relationship with Russia\u201d \u2013 a \u201chostile policy\u201d that it claims \u201cmade it an enemy of the US, drove Russia into the arms of China and led to the development of a new Russia-China-Iran-North Korea axis\u201d. Kellogg and Fleitz criticize what they said was a decision to scold Vladimir Putin and threaten \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions as it prepared to invade Ukraine, \u201cinstead of using negotiations to de-escalate tensions\u201d. \u201cAn America First approach could have prevented the invasion,\u201d they write. Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, the Ohio senator JD Vance, has aired comparable views, arguing in effect that US support for Ukraine is a drain on resources necessary to counter Washington\u2019s principal security threat with China. The selection of Kellogg comes as the Biden administration pushes to complete more weapons transfers to Ukraine before the president\u2019s term ends. A decision to approve the use of US-made Atacms missiles on targets inside Russia was met by Russia\u2019s use of a powerful intermediate range missile, Oreshnik, on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an interview with Fox News, Kellogg said Biden\u2019s decision to approve Ukrainian strikes inside Russia has given Trump \u201cmore leverage\u201d. \u201cIt gives president Trump more ability to pivot from that,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, Moscow responded to a New York Times report that unidentified western officials had suggested Biden could give Ukraine nuclear weapons before he steps down. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said discussions in the West about arming Ukraine with nuclear weapons was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d. But the Kellogg-Fleitz plan, though lacking in details, appears to mirror the counsel of Gen Mark A Milley, Biden\u2019s former chief military adviser who argued that since neither Russia nor Ukraine could win the conflict, a negotiated settlement was the sole route to peace. Under the plan, Moscow would also be coaxed to the table with the promise of Nato membership for Ukraine being delayed or abandoned. \u201cWe tell the Ukrainians, \u2018You\u2019ve got to come to the table, and if you don\u2019t come to the table, support from the United States will dry up,\u2019\u201d Kellogg told Reuters in June. \u201cAnd you tell Putin, \u2018He\u2019s got to come to the table and if you don\u2019t come to the table, then we\u2019ll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field.\u2019\u201d In that interview, Fleitz said Ukraine would not need to formally cede territory to Russia, but would come to recognize that it would not be able to regain effective control of all its territory. \u201cOur concern is that this has become a war of attrition that\u2019s going to kill a whole generation of young men,\u201d Fleitz said, adding that a lasting peace in Ukraine would require additional security guarantees, including \u201carming Ukraine to the teeth\u201d. But in the policy paper the pair acknowledged that it would be hard for Ukraine to accept a peace deal \u201cthat does not give them back all of their territory or, at least for now, hold Russia responsible for the carnage it inflicted on Ukraine\u201d. Asking whether he endorses Kellogg\u2019s position paper, the president-elect told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can get the war stopped. It should have never started in the first place.\u201d Trump said that European nations should contribute more aid, a position echoed by Vance at the Republican national convention in July. \u201cWe will make sure our allies share in the burden of securing world peace,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.\u201d Trump chose Kellogg, an 80-year-old retired army lieutenant general, to be his top adviser on defense issues. He served as national security adviser to Vice-president Mike Pence, was chief of staff of the national security council, and then stepped in as an acting security adviser for Trump after Michael Flynn resigned. During the Vietnam war he served in the 101st airborne division, also known as the Screaming Eagles, and after the first Iraq war he was named commander of special operations command Europe (SOCEUR). He retired in 2003 as a lieutenant general. During the January 6 Capitol riot, Kellogg demanded that the Secret Service not evacuate Pence from the building, which would have prevented the vice-president from certifying Biden\u2019s electoral victory. \u201cLeave him where he\u2019s at. He\u2019s got a job to do. I know you guys too well. You\u2019ll fly him to Alaska if you have a chance. Don\u2019t do it,\u201d he reportedly said. After naming Kellogg as envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Trump said Kellogg \u201cwas with me right from the beginning\u201d!",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has accused the Conservatives of running an \u201copen borders experiment\u201d after new figures showed that net migration to the UK hit a record high of nearly 1 million in a period covering Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak\u2019s administrations. The prime minister announced a deal with Iraq to tackle people-smugglers and a white paper to overhaul the visa system, before demanding \u201can explanation\u201d from Kemi Badenoch for her party\u2019s decision to \u201cdeliberately liberalise immigration\u201d after the Brexit vote. His accusation followed the release of official figures that showed the number of people entering the UK, minus those leaving, reached 906,000 in the year ending June 2023. The estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) were revised upwards from a previous estimate of 740,000. At a Downing Street press conference, Starmer said the failure of successive Conservative governments to control the numbers entering the UK was \u201cunforgivable\u201d, adding: \u201cFailure on this scale isn\u2019t just bad luck. This happened by design, not accident. \u201cPolicies were reformed deliberately to liberalise immigration. Brexit was used for that purpose, to turn Britain into a one-nation experiment in open borders.\u201d His comments came after Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, signed an agreement with Baghdad to ensure close cooperation to tackle organised crime networks, a faster return of refused asylum seekers and the formation of a new taskforce aimed at breaking up migration routes to the UK.. A total of \u00a3800,000 of UK money would be spent on training, support for the Kurdistan regional government and on disruption of organised crime, the government said. Smuggling networks operating out of Iraq and Kurdistan have been responsible for trafficking thousands of people, including across the Channel to the UK, according to the Home Office . The deal will be of concern to human rights organisations amid reports of torture of detainees by Iraqi state agencies and unlawful killings. Corruption has been described by the LSE\u2019s Middle East Centre as \u201cthe lifeblood of politics in Iraq\u201d. Cooper said the country had changed, telling reporters: \u201cWe have been very clear and explicit; in the statements that have been agreed is a commitment to international law, a commitment to international humanitarian law and commitments to international human rights standards.\u201d The Iraq deal follows Starmer\u2019s praise for the hard-right Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, for making \u201cremarkable progress\u201d in cutting irregular migration after striking deals with third-party countries. Under the agreement, Iraq has committed to ensuring people can be returned to Iraq more swiftly through closer cooperation between the two countries on speeding up the identity documents needed to prove they are from Iraq. The UK will also pay Iraq to boost its capacity for dealing with people returning to the country, as well as for programmes to help returnees reintegrate into society. This year Iraqis have made up the seventh-largest nationality crossing the Channel in small boats, with a total of 1,624 people arriving by September. The asylum grant rate for Iraqis in the UK was 38% in the year to March 2024. On Wednesday, Badenoch, the new Tory leader, admitted that her party had failed on migration. Starmer called for a fuller explanation. \u201c[The Conservative party] want to wave it away with a simple \u2018we got it wrong\u2019. Well, that\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d he said. The government would publish a white paper with a plan to reduce immigration, Starmer said, adding that he would target sectors seeking labour from abroad. \u201cWe will reform the points-based system and make sure that applications for the relevant visa routes, whether it\u2019s the skilled worker route or the shortage occupation list, will now come with new expectations on training people here in our country,\u201d he said. Responding to Starmer\u2019s comments, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cWe know the numbers are too high. That is why Kemi Badenoch has set out that under her leadership we will learn from past mistakes and adopt a new approach to lower immigration.\u201d The total for net migration in the year to June 2023 was revised upwards by 166,000. A similar change was made to the estimate for net migration in the year to December 2023, which was initially 685,000, and is now 866,000. The ONS said that while net migration remained high by historic standards, it was beginning to fall. Government spending on asylum in the UK was \u00a35.38bn in 2023-24, up 36% from \u00a33.95bn in 2022-23, Home Office figures show. The ONS said it reviewed its net migration figures as more complete data became available and it had improved how it estimated the migration behaviour of people arriving in the UK from outside the EU.",

Even more \u2013 almost half \u2013 do not always get help when they are in hospital after giving birth, a Care Quality Commission (CQC) survey of almost 19,000 women\u2019s experiences of maternity care found. A significant minority of women do not have confidence in the staff who look after them when they are receiving antenatal care (30%), during their labour and birth (23%) and after they have delivered their child (31%), the research also shows. In addition, one in seven do not get the pain relief they feel they need during labour and birth and a quarter are unable to ask staff questions after their baby\u2019s birth.

      "body": "<p>Ministers have said they will redirect cash from wealthy areas to England\u2019s most deprived town and cities, reversing a trend established during a decade of austerity in a shake-up of local government funding.</p> <p>The government also said it would consider \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d requests from cash-strapped councils who wanted to balance their books by raising council tax above the current threshold of 5% for upper-tier authorities and 3% for districts.</p> <p>Up to now, only councils that have formally declared themselves to be in effect bankrupt, such as Croydon and Thurrock, have been allowed to charge council tax above cap levels. Earlier this year a request by Medway and Somerset councils to charge 10% was refused.</p> <p>A new \u00a3600m recovery grant will be targeted at England\u2019s most deprived towns and cities, mainly in the north and Midlands, alongside longer-term \u201cfair funding\u201d plans intended to rebalance council funding away from the more affluent south-east.</p> <p>The changes, announced on Thursday, were billed by ministers as an attempt to \u201cfix the foundations\u201d of local government and make funding more effective by ensuring councils with high needs in adult social care and child protection get a fairer share of funds.</p> <p>Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and local government secretary, said: \u201cFor too long, councils have been let down by an outdated and inefficient funding system which has led to public services creaking and taxpayers\u2019 money not being spent efficiently.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst there\u2019s no magic wand to fix what we\u2019ve inherited, we\u2019re taking the necessary steps to fix the foundations of local government by creating a fairer system and ensuring every penny is spent on the services so many people rely on every day.\u201d</p> <p>The financial problems dogging councils have driven an unprecedented number of them into or close to insolvency in recent years as they struggle with soaring costs for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/06/adult-social-care-in-england-needs-urgent-help-from-ministers-say-bosses\">social care</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/jul/25/5bn-debt-crisis-of-special-educational-needs-could-bankrupt-english-councils\">special educational needs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/30/councils-in-england-facing-bankruptcy-as-lack-of-housing-pushes-up-costs\">homelessness</a>.</p> <p>The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-finance-policy-statement-2025-to-2026/local-government-finance-policy-statement-2025-to-2026\">said in a statement</a>: \u201cThe government is under no illusions about the scale of the issues facing local government, and this settlement will begin to address the pressures that councils are under. But this is a long-term project to deliver financial security for councils, and we recognise that we may see some continued instability as we adjust to the new system.\u201d</p> <p>The proposed new funding system from 2026-27 will be heavily weighted around deprivation and is likely to create winners and losers, triggering criticism from the Conservatives that it would result in funds being \u201creallocated to Labour strongholds\u2019 and alarm among councils in rural and more affluent areas their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/04/tory-run-hampshire-council-says-it-faces-financial-meltdown\">own dire financial problems</a> will be ignored.</p> <p>Tim Oliver, the chair of the County Councils Network, said: \u201cWhilst deprivation is a key indicator of a council\u2019s need, it is not the only indicator nor the most important measure of financial distress. The reality is that it is demand and market failure across adult and children\u2019s social care and special educational needs services that are pushing councils to the brink.\u201d</p> <p>An extra \u00a3250m for children\u2019s social care, aimed at new initiatives to support families and reduce the numbers of children being taken into care will be introduced in April and targeted at councils where child protection services are under most pressure.</p> <p>Plans to move to three-year funding agreements for councils, changes to business rates, and the removal of many of the grant funding pots introduced under last government will be brought forward to try to stabilise and simplify council finances.</p> <p>David Phillips, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \u201cThe changes made for the coming year suggest these longer-term changes will also have an emphasis on redistributing funding to more deprived areas, to offset cuts they bore the brunt of during the 2010s.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have said they will redirect cash from wealthy areas to England\u2019s most deprived town and cities, reversing a trend established during a decade of austerity in a shake-up of local government funding. The government also said it would consider \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d requests from cash-strapped councils who wanted to balance their books by raising council tax above the current threshold of 5% for upper-tier authorities and 3% for districts. Up to now, only councils that have formally declared themselves to be in effect bankrupt, such as Croydon and Thurrock, have been allowed to charge council tax above cap levels. Earlier this year a request by Medway and Somerset councils to charge 10% was refused. A new \u00a3600m recovery grant will be targeted at England\u2019s most deprived towns and cities, mainly in the north and Midlands, alongside longer-term \u201cfair funding\u201d plans intended to rebalance council funding away from the more affluent south-east. The changes, announced on Thursday, were billed by ministers as an attempt to \u201cfix the foundations\u201d of local government and make funding more effective by ensuring councils with high needs in adult social care and child protection get a fairer share of funds. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and local government secretary, said: \u201cFor too long, councils have been let down by an outdated and inefficient funding system which has led to public services creaking and taxpayers\u2019 money not being spent efficiently. \u201cWhilst there\u2019s no magic wand to fix what we\u2019ve inherited, we\u2019re taking the necessary steps to fix the foundations of local government by creating a fairer system and ensuring every penny is spent on the services so many people rely on every day.\u201d The financial problems dogging councils have driven an unprecedented number of them into or close to insolvency in recent years as they struggle with soaring costs for social care, special educational needs and homelessness. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said in a statement: \u201cThe government is under no illusions about the scale of the issues facing local government, and this settlement will begin to address the pressures that councils are under. But this is a long-term project to deliver financial security for councils, and we recognise that we may see some continued instability as we adjust to the new system.\u201d The proposed new funding system from 2026-27 will be heavily weighted around deprivation and is likely to create winners and losers, triggering criticism from the Conservatives that it would result in funds being \u201creallocated to Labour strongholds\u2019 and alarm among councils in rural and more affluent areas their own dire financial problems will be ignored. Tim Oliver, the chair of the County Councils Network, said: \u201cWhilst deprivation is a key indicator of a council\u2019s need, it is not the only indicator nor the most important measure of financial distress. The reality is that it is demand and market failure across adult and children\u2019s social care and special educational needs services that are pushing councils to the brink.\u201d An extra \u00a3250m for children\u2019s social care, aimed at new initiatives to support families and reduce the numbers of children being taken into care will be introduced in April and targeted at councils where child protection services are under most pressure. Plans to move to three-year funding agreements for councils, changes to business rates, and the removal of many of the grant funding pots introduced under last government will be brought forward to try to stabilise and simplify council finances. David Phillips, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \u201cThe changes made for the coming year suggest these longer-term changes will also have an emphasis on redistributing funding to more deprived areas, to offset cuts they bore the brunt of during the 2010s. Whether that is fair will be in the eye of the beholder.\u201d Sir Stephen Houghton, the chair of the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities, said: \u201cIt is very welcome that the government have targeted new funding on a deprivation basis, recognising the disproportionate nature of the cuts and demand increases that the most deprived areas have seen over the last decade.\u201d Kevin Hollinrake, the shadow local government secretary, said: \u201cThey are also sticking two fingers up to rural areas through the scrapping of the rural services delivery grant and almost certainly reallocating it to Labour strongholds.

This was an evening of historical indulgence, deserving as Polks may be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/matildas-vs-brazil-clare-polkinghorne-brisbane-farewell-match\">Matildas \u2018legend\u2019 Clare Polkinghorne to bid farewell amid end of an era against Brazil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the one exception was significant \u2013 23-year-old Winonah Heatley, who started for Australia for the first time, lined up in defensive midfield. Here was a young woman serving as a bridge not only between defensive and forward lines, but between ghosts of careers past and tournaments yet to come.</p> <p>\u201cI moved to Brisbane when I was 15, joined the Roar academy and Polks [Polkinghorne] was the one that I looked up to and idolised, and eventually I got to make my W-League debut next to her,\u201d she said after the match.</p> <p>The Cairns product had watched the France shootout in 2023 on the other side of the world, during pre-season for her club in Denmark, without any Australians by her side. Still, the moment\u2019s impact was not lost on her. \u201cMy heart was just on the line the entire time, and when Courtnee [Vine] scored that final one \u2013 I\u2019m getting goosebumps thinking about it \u2013 I was sobbing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As a relatively new arrival to the Matildas setup, she sees no signs the team is satisfied with yesterday\u2019s glories, however heavy. \u201cEverybody understands the impact that they\u2019ve had on Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of time that can get to people\u2019s heads, but you watch this team, and I think they just want to give more.\u201d</p> <p>Interim coach Tom Sermanni \u2013 another caught in a time warp, in his third stint in charge \u2013 praised Heatley after the match, saying \u201cshe did ever so well\u201d. About substitute Sharn Freier, another Queenslander starting to prove herself in international football, he was even more generous.</p> <p>\u201cShe came on tonight, showed real promise with her pace and her ability to dribble \u2013 now, we didn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. These next three friendly games against Brazil and Taiwan serve as a rare opportunity for fringe Matildas to solidify their place in the squad, and show Sermanni their worth. But he warned: \u201cIt\u2019s a time in this cycle where you have to look at other potential players, but you also then have to have players that you feel are good enough to be looked at.\u201d </p> <p>Despite this underlying tension, the relationship between the Australian public and the team appears healthy. Football Australia called this crowd of 47,501 a sell-out, even though tickets were still available during the anthems and large swathes of so-called \u201cstadium member\u201d seats remained vacant throughout the match.</p> <p>In the humid Brisbane evening, the supporters flickered from afar with the swaying of paper fans adorned with Polkinghorne\u2019s face, trying to stay cool. And they displayed their passion and loyalty throughout the evening from when that same face first appeared on the big screen, remaining loud and engaged despite the home side\u2019s uneven performance.</p> <p>No victory was forthcoming, but they left with memories aplenty. An unusually unfriendly friendly, highlighted by a red card to Brazil\u2019s Vit\u00f3ria Calhau. The goal of the night by a swivelling Caitlin Foord, made possible by a cunning leave from Emily Van Egmond and creative wing-play by Ellie Carpenter. There were the strong showings of up-and-comers Heatley, Freier and Daniela Galic. And of course there was the farewell for Polks, who was presented with a commemorative jersey by her childhood hero, rugby league player Darren Lockyer.</p> <p>At the venue so rich in Matildas lore, captain Catley was disappointed with the team\u2019s performance, and she is well aware the World Cup afterglow is fading: \u201cI think you have to move forward,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got an Asian Cup around the corner, which is going to be at home, and hopefully we can create some more wonderful memories there.\u201d</p>",

Indeed, the whole of Thursday night was themed as a send-off for the most-capped Matilda, Clare Polkinghorne. This was an evening of historical indulgence, deserving as Polks may be. Yet the one exception was significant \u2013 23-year-old Winonah Heatley, who started for Australia for the first time, lined up in defensive midfield. Here was a young woman serving as a bridge not only between defensive and forward lines, but between ghosts of careers past and tournaments yet to come. \u201cI moved to Brisbane when I was 15, joined the Roar academy and Polks [Polkinghorne] was the one that I looked up to and idolised, and eventually I got to make my W-League debut next to her,\u201d she said after the match. The Cairns product had watched the France shootout in 2023 on the other side of the world, during pre-season for her club in Denmark, without any Australians by her side. Still, the moment\u2019s impact was not lost on her. \u201cMy heart was just on the line the entire time, and when Courtnee [Vine] scored that final one \u2013 I\u2019m getting goosebumps thinking about it \u2013 I was sobbing,\u201d she said. As a relatively new arrival to the Matildas setup, she sees no signs the team is satisfied with yesterday\u2019s glories, however heavy. \u201cEverybody understands the impact that they\u2019ve had on Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of time that can get to people\u2019s heads, but you watch this team, and I think they just want to give more.\u201d Interim coach Tom Sermanni \u2013 another caught in a time warp, in his third stint in charge \u2013 praised Heatley after the match, saying \u201cshe did ever so well\u201d. About substitute Sharn Freier, another Queenslander starting to prove herself in international football, he was even more generous. \u201cShe came on tonight, showed real promise with her pace and her ability to dribble \u2013 now, we didn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. These next three friendly games against Brazil and Taiwan serve as a rare opportunity for fringe Matildas to solidify their place in the squad, and show Sermanni their worth. But he warned: \u201cIt\u2019s a time in this cycle where you have to look at other potential players, but you also then have to have players that you feel are good enough to be looked at.\u201d Despite this underlying tension, the relationship between the Australian public and the team appears healthy. Football Australia called this crowd of 47,501 a sell-out, even though tickets were still available during the anthems and large swathes of so-called \u201cstadium member\u201d seats remained vacant throughout the match. In the humid Brisbane evening, the supporters flickered from afar with the swaying of paper fans adorned with Polkinghorne\u2019s face, trying to stay cool. And they displayed their passion and loyalty throughout the evening from when that same face first appeared on the big screen, remaining loud and engaged despite the home side\u2019s uneven performance. No victory was forthcoming, but they left with memories aplenty. An unusually unfriendly friendly, highlighted by a red card to Brazil\u2019s Vit\u00f3ria Calhau. The goal of the night by a swivelling Caitlin Foord, made possible by a cunning leave from Emily Van Egmond and creative wing-play by Ellie Carpenter. There were the strong showings of up-and-comers Heatley, Freier and Daniela Galic. And of course there was the farewell for Polks, who was presented with a commemorative jersey by her childhood hero, rugby league player Darren Lockyer. At the venue so rich in Matildas lore, captain Catley was disappointed with the team\u2019s performance, and she is well aware the World Cup afterglow is fading: \u201cI think you have to move forward,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got an Asian Cup around the corner, which is going to be at home, and hopefully we can create some more wonderful memories there.\u201d",

She received notification of the anti-doping rule violation a month later on 12 September.</p> \n<h2>What is the substance and how serious an offence is this?</h2> \n<p>The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) does not consider this a serious offence. TMZ is a drug primarily used as heart medication and has been involved in several high-profile doping cases. However, the ITIA ruled Swiatek did not intentionally take the banned substance and that her level of fault in the positive test was the \u201clowest end of the range\u201d for no significant fault or negligence.</p> \n<p>The ITIA accepted that the positive test was caused by the contamination of the non-prescription medication Swiatek had been taking \u2013 melatonin \u2013 to address jet lag and sleep problems. Melatonin is a regulated medication in Poland.</p> \n<p>During the investigation, the ITIA sent a pack of melatonin provided by Swiatek and an unopened pack from the same batch for tests in an independent, Wada-accredited laboratory in Utah. Tests confirmed the substance was contaminated with TMZ and that was verified by an independent scientific expert from another Wada-accredited lab.</p> \n<h2>Why are we only finding out now?</h2> \n<p>As is standard in anti-doping cases, Swiatek received a mandatory provisional suspension on 22 September upon notification of the anti-doping rule violation and she was forced to withdraw from the Korea Open, China Open and Wuhan Open. After three weeks, however, Swiatek successfully appealed against her provisional suspension, which allowed her to return to competition before her case was resolved. Swiatek ended her season by competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh and the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in M\u00e1laga.</p> \n<p>This case has similarities and differences to the decisions in Jannik Sinner\u2019s anti-doping case. Sinner also received a mandatory provisional suspension for each of his two positive tests for the banned substance clostebol, but since he was able to quickly identify the alleged source of the positive tests, Sinner immediately lodged an appeal both times and both suspensions were lifted in days. Swiatek also appealed swiftly but the process, which included the laboratory tests, took longer. She was also successful when she did.</p> \n<p>It is rare for provisional suspensions to be lifted but an athlete can appeal against their provisional suspension at an urgent hearing if their argument rests on contamination or the case involves a substance of abuse, such as cocaine. If an athlete appeals against a mandatory provisional suspension within 10 days of receiving notice and the appeal is successful, the provisional suspension is not publicly disclosed according to the tennis anti-doping rules.</p> \n<p>In many other cases, however, the athlete either accepts their provisional suspension or their appeal is unsuccessful, meaning they are ineligible to compete until their case is resolved.</p> \n<h2>What does it mean for Swiatek and the way tennis is handling anti-doping cases?</h2> \n<p>Swiatek\u2019s one-month ban includes the three-week provisional suspension she has already served, meaning she has seven days to serve and she will be free to compete again from 4 December. The WTA season has finished and it restarts on 27 December so this will not significantly affect her schedule.</p> \n<p>Swiatek\u2019s and Sinner\u2019s anti-doping cases represent two of the most high-profile cases in the sport\u2019s history, with both players ranked No 1 at the time. Both times, the players were able to successfully overturn their provisional suspensions and compete without disclosing their positive tests.

      "bodyText": "What is the one-month ban for? Iga Swiatek tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition urine sample taken on 12 August, three days before her first match at the Cincinnati Open. She received notification of the anti-doping rule violation a month later on 12 September. What is the substance and how serious an offence is this? The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) does not consider this a serious offence. TMZ is a drug primarily used as heart medication and has been involved in several high-profile doping cases. However, the ITIA ruled Swiatek did not intentionally take the banned substance and that her level of fault in the positive test was the \u201clowest end of the range\u201d for no significant fault or negligence. The ITIA accepted that the positive test was caused by the contamination of the non-prescription medication Swiatek had been taking \u2013 melatonin \u2013 to address jet lag and sleep problems. Melatonin is a regulated medication in Poland. During the investigation, the ITIA sent a pack of melatonin provided by Swiatek and an unopened pack from the same batch for tests in an independent, Wada-accredited laboratory in Utah. Tests confirmed the substance was contaminated with TMZ and that was verified by an independent scientific expert from another Wada-accredited lab. Why are we only finding out now? As is standard in anti-doping cases, Swiatek received a mandatory provisional suspension on 22 September upon notification of the anti-doping rule violation and she was forced to withdraw from the Korea Open, China Open and Wuhan Open. After three weeks, however, Swiatek successfully appealed against her provisional suspension, which allowed her to return to competition before her case was resolved. Swiatek ended her season by competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh and the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in M\u00e1laga. This case has similarities and differences to the decisions in Jannik Sinner\u2019s anti-doping case. Sinner also received a mandatory provisional suspension for each of his two positive tests for the banned substance clostebol, but since he was able to quickly identify the alleged source of the positive tests, Sinner immediately lodged an appeal both times and both suspensions were lifted in days. Swiatek also appealed swiftly but the process, which included the laboratory tests, took longer. She was also successful when she did. It is rare for provisional suspensions to be lifted but an athlete can appeal against their provisional suspension at an urgent hearing if their argument rests on contamination or the case involves a substance of abuse, such as cocaine. If an athlete appeals against a mandatory provisional suspension within 10 days of receiving notice and the appeal is successful, the provisional suspension is not publicly disclosed according to the tennis anti-doping rules. In many other cases, however, the athlete either accepts their provisional suspension or their appeal is unsuccessful, meaning they are ineligible to compete until their case is resolved. What does it mean for Swiatek and the way tennis is handling anti-doping cases? Swiatek\u2019s one-month ban includes the three-week provisional suspension she has already served, meaning she has seven days to serve and she will be free to compete again from 4 December. The WTA season has finished and it restarts on 27 December so this will not significantly affect her schedule. Swiatek\u2019s and Sinner\u2019s anti-doping cases represent two of the most high-profile cases in the sport\u2019s history, with both players ranked No 1 at the time. Both times, the players were able to successfully overturn their provisional suspensions and compete without disclosing their positive tests. The ITIA may come under further pressure to review their rules surrounding provisional suspensions.",

Among those said to have been targeted were an award-winning Bulgarian journalist who worked with the late Russian opposition dissident Alexei Navalny. The journalist was allegedly the subject of discussions about killing or kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow. Other alleged discussions concerned the deployment of two female defendants in a \u201choney trap\u201d ploy to capture more information. Alison Morgan KC, opening the case for the prosecution on Thursday, said: \u201cOver a period of nearly three years they sought to gather information for the benefit of Russia, an enemy of the UK, information about various targets, both people and physical locations. Information of particular interest to the Russian state. Their activity caused obvious and inevitable prejudice to the safety and interests of the United Kingdom.\u201d She said of the defendant\u2019s alleged activities: \u201cIt was high risk and it was highly sophisticated. The defendants earned significant sums for what they were doing. None of them engaged in this activity blindly.\u201d The defendants allegedly worked with a number of other people who spied for Russia between 2020 and 2023 in London, Vienna, Valencia, Montenegro and Stuttgart. The spy ring included two more defendants, Orlin Roussev and Biser Dzhambazov, who have pleaded guilty to espionage charges, the Old Bailey heard. Morgan said the defendants plotted with a Russian agent, Jan Marsalek, who was known as \u201cRupert Ticz\u201d and was said to be an Austrian national, to obtain material useful to Russia. Jurors were told that Dzhambazov, 43, was in a relationship with both Ivanova and Gaberova, and the latter was formerly involved with Ivanchev. Morgan said the defendants may try to \u201crely on the relationships\u201d and suggest they were misled \u201cor were simply following people around Europe out of love or dedication\u201d. She said were tasked to spy on prominent individuals of obvious interest to Russia, often because they were dissidents who had fled their homeland for their own safety. Morgan told jurors: \u201cIt was high risk and it was highly sophisticated.\u201d A range of activities were alleged including surveillance operations, following people around and finding out where they were and then reporting back to the Russian state. It allegedly included surveillance in 2022 at the Patch barracks, a US military base in Stuttgart, which the defendants believed to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained, according to Morgan. The court was told that messages were exchanged between Marsalek and Roussev in which they discussed \u201coptions\u201d relating to Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian journalist who has been the lead Russia investigator with Bellingcat, the award-winning investigative journalism group. These options were said to have included carrying out surveillance of him, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, killing him and infiltrating Bellingcat. The defendants deny conspiring to collect information for a purpose prejudicial to the safety and interest of the state between 30 August 2020 and 8 February 2023. Ivanova also denies possessing 18 false identity documents, including British and other passports and documents. The trial is expected to go on until February next year.",

It also shattered Hezbollah\u2019s air of invincibility. If Hezbollah could not claim that it would protect Lebanon from Israel, why did it exist? Its domestic opponents called for the militia to disarm and to allow the state to reassert itself in south Lebanon. Hezbollah has warned its rivals not to overestimate its losses. In his latest speech the secretary general of the party, Naim Qassem, invoked the 1989 Taif agreement, which ended Lebanon\u2019s 15-year long sectarian civil war, which all parties are keen to avoid. \u201cHezbollah needs to frame this as a victory: just by surviving and not openly surrendering it considers it has somewhat overcome the invincible Israeli military,\u201d said Karim el-Mufti, a senior lecturer in global affairs at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s also looking after its political future inside Lebanon as difficult and burdening questions will be sure to be raised as to its role.\u201d In Bint Jbeil, Hezbollah was keen to reassert its presence. Members of its relief wings were clearing rubble-strewn roads and handed out flags to returning residents. The group\u2019s anthems boomed over cars\u2019 speaker systems. \u201cIt might be hard for Europeans and westerners to understand, but this is victory,\u201d said Mohammed, a resident of Bint Jbeil. \u201cAs long as the resistance is here \u2013 the Israelis will not be able to enter, then we have won.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Agents working for Qatar threatened witnesses and issued bribes to thwart an alleged terror funding case brought in London and to avoid derailing the Gulf state\u2019s hosting of the 2022 Fifa World Cup, a court has heard. Eight Syrian refugees were attempting to sue Doha Bank claiming that it knowingly facilitated the transfer of funds to al-Nusra Front, a jihadist group that controlled part of northern Syria, which forced them to flee for their lives overseas. Four of the claimants discontinued their case last year \u201cas a result of a conspiracy to pervert the course of the proceedings\u201d, Sir Max Hill KC, representing them, told the high court in London on Thursday. Hill, a former director of public prosecutions, said in written submissions that examples of interference with the case included the claimants\u2019 translator being bribed and asking them to sign untranslated documents they did not understand, in particular dis-instructing their legal representatives. It is also alleged that \u201cfake\u201d plaintiffs were put forward in order to access confidential information about the claimants, contrary to an anonymity order preventing their identification. Additionally, Hill said a witness who was a former agent of the Syrian ministry of defence \u2013 who could give a first-hand account of the bank\u2019s alleged involvement with terrorist financing \u2013 received death and kidnap threats, a tracking device was fitted to his car and his home was targeted by masked men and bugged. The witness eventually attempted to withdraw his evidence. Hill said: \u201cThe motivation of the state is abundantly clear \u2013 taking steps to make sure that this did not result in a trial or adverse finding in the run-up to the World Cup.\u201d He told the court the interference nevertheless continued after the tournament and said there were \u201cvery real connections\u201d between the bank and the Qatari state. Hill said the usual rule that claimants who discontinue a case should pay the defendant\u2019s costs should not apply in the current case because there was an \u201cenduring, grave and unrelenting\u201d criminal conspiracy to derail the case. He cited the UK counter-terrorism police unit SO15 who, after multiple complaints, said in February 2021 \u2013 and reaffirmed in July this year \u2013 that a scoping exercise \u201cconcluded that there is information and evidence to support [the allegation of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice]\u201d. Hill said Doha Bank should pay the claimants\u2019 costs. Hannah Brown KC, representing the bank, which wants its legal costs paid, said in written submissions: \u201cNothing in the evidence supposedly showing the alleged interference has anything whatsoever to do with the bank \u2026 There is no evidence that the bank has sought to interfere with the due progress of these proceedings or act improperly or unlawfully in relation to them in any way at all.\u201d She told the court that while the bank \u201chas a connection to the Qatari state and ruling family\u201d, the al-Thani family has more than 20,000 members and allegations that it was closely linked to the family were \u201cnonsense\u201d.

Hasse travelled widely, and in the 1730s he divided his time between Germany and Italy, where he was regularly commissioned by the opera houses in Naples and Venice.

Serpentes Ignei is less a devotional piece than a taut, dramatic \u201cchurch opera\u201d.

We did not know that the govenrment is going to publish a white paper with a plan to cut net migration soon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-67488b0e8f088c7046fdedb3#block-67488b0e8f088c7046fdedb3\">3.25pm</a>), but otherwise what Starmer in policy terms this afternoon was mostly familiar.</p> \n  <p>But that does not do justice to the sheer audacity of his messaging. By forcefully accusing the last government of intentionally turning Britain \u201cinto a one-nation experiment in open borders\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-674895ba8f08613772566a22#block-674895ba8f08613772566a22\">4.12pm</a>), he flipped an issue that has haunted Labour for years. And not just Labour; at the general election the Tories were still attacking Starmer personally for advocating \u201cfree movement\u201d when he was running for party leader. Now he has been able to capitalise on an ONS data revision to make a plausible case that it was Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak who were the real open borders fanatics.</p> \n  <p>Plausible, rather than slam-dunk. In all the many inside accounts of the last Conservative government, you won\u2019t find evidence of a deliberate plan to get net migration up to 900,000 a year. But this was the consequences of the decisions that were being taken, as people like Suella Braverman were happy to point out at the time. This charge certainly has enough merit in it to stick.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday, when Kemi Badenoch devoted her first policy-focused speech as Tory leader to immigration, she openly said this should be a winning issue for her party because Labour would never be able to deliver the reduction in net migration numbers that the public want to see. Perhaps that will turn out to be true. But today\u2019s figure show that the last Conservative government failed on its own terms on this issue, and Starmer did a better job today at rubbishing their record than Badenoch did defending it.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T16:43:13.741Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674895ba8f08613772566a22\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T16:12:06.377Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What Starmer said as he claimed Tories running 'open borders experiment' after Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the passage from <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>\u2019s opening statement where he accused the Conservatives of running an \u201copen borders experiment\u201d.

Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The visa changes announced by the Conservative government may not bring migration below pre-Brexit levels, it says.</strong> Commenting on the figures, <strong>Ben Brindle</strong>, a researcher at the Migration Observatory, said:</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are yet to see the full impact of the visa restrictions in the data, although this initial data from the summer suggest that migration levels will not necessarily fall below pre-Brexit levels once the policy changes have bedded in. Of all the policy restrictions introduced over the past year, the restrictions on sponsorship in the care sector are likely to have the largest impact on net migration levels in the medium term, because of the significant number of people involved and the fact that most were expected to remain in the UK permanently. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And this is what the briefing says about the impact of the visa changes in general.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Health and care visa grants to main applicants were down 85% from a Q3 2023 peak of just over 45,000, reaching around 6,600 in Q3 2024. This follows a Home Office crackdown on sponsorship in the care sector due to concerns about exploitation of migrant workers starting in late 2023. The ban on family members of care workers may also have played a role, although most of the decrease preceded that policy change. </p> \n   <p>Following significant increases in salary thresholds for private-sector jobs, skilled worker visa grants outside of health and care declined by 32% between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, from 17,800 to 12,100. The largest decrease was seen in visa grants to middle-skilled roles in the food and hospitality sector, such as butchers and chefs, which fell 64% in the same period. However, there were also decreases in professional jobs, such as engineers (down 37%) and IT (down 30%). </p> \n   <p>Student visas fell following the ban on most students\u2019 family members in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the same period a year earlier. This was primarily driven by fewer family members themselves (down 84% in Q1-3 inclusive). The number of student main applicants fell by 16% or 64,000 over the same periods. The declines are likely to be spread unevenly across the higher education sector. The 31% decline in combined student and dependant numbers was driven primarily by applicants from Nigeria and India, down 74% and 42% respectively. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The asylum backlog has been going up this year, the briefing says.</strong></p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite efforts introduced by the Labour government to increase the speed of asylum processing, the asylum backlog rose slightly, from 95,300 in June to 97,200 at the end of September 2024. However, any reduction in the asylum backlog must also be viewed alongside trends in the appeals backlog, which has risen substantially, reaching 58,000 in April-June 2024. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In its figures, the Home Office say the asylum backlog was lower in September than it was the year before.

      "bodyText": "Net migration to the UK hit a record high in 2023 of 906,000 in a period covering Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak\u2019s premierships, revised estimates show. Commenting on the figures at a press conference, Keir Starmer said: A failure on this scale isn\u2019t just bad luck, it isn\u2019t a global trend or taking your eye off the ball. No \u2013 this a different order of failure. This happened by design, not accident. Policies were reformed deliberately to liberalise immigration. Brexit was used for that purpose to turn Britain into a one-nation experiment in open borders. Global Britain \u2013 remember that slogan. That is what they meant. A policy with no support and which they then pretended wasn\u2019t happening. And now they want to wave it away with a simple \u201cwe got it wrong\u201d. Well that\u2019s unforgivable. And mark my words - this government will turn the page. Here\u2019s a comment on Starmer\u2019s language from Lewis Goodall from the News Agents podcast on Bluesky. Starmer\u2019s rhetoric on immigration in this presser is very striking. Casting the Conservative record in office as: \u201cA one nation experiment in open borders.\u201d McSweeney\u2019s fingerprints all over it. The direction of the govt will squarely be on more socially conservative, traditional Lab voters. Keir Starmer\u2019s government has signed a deal with Iraq to tackle people smugglers across Europe. The Scottish government will reintroduce universal winter fuel payments for pensioners, in a bid to outstrip Labour ahead of the Holyrood elections. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, has announced a review of local government funding. Civil servants and ministers will begin work on implementing the assisted dying bill if it passes its first stage in parliament on Friday, but the Guardian understands it will not be adopted as a government bill. Robert Jenrick, who resigned as a Conservative minister because he thought his government\u2019s immigration policies were too liberal and who was runner up to Kemi Badenoch in the Tory leadership contest, has described today\u2019s ONS figures as \u201ca day of shame\u201d for his party. He posted this on social media. Today is a day of shame for the Conservative Party. Our handling of immigration let the country down badly. The public are right to be furious. Repairing the damage won\u2019t be easy. We will only begin to rebuild trust once we own up to our failures and fundamentally change. The Conservatives have responded to Keir Starmer\u2019s press conference this afternoon by claiming that he has \u201cno credibility\u201d on immigration because he does not support a cap on numbers. In a statement issued by CCHQ, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: If Keir Starmer really cared about bringing down net migration, he would not have suspended our increase to the family visa salary threshold and scrapped the deterrent the National Crime Agency said we needed, which were part of our reforms to bring down the numbers down. Keir Starmer has no credibility on this issue. He has ruled out a legal migration cap and since he became prime minister channel boat crossings are up 23%. And we learnt today that 6,000 more asylum seekers are in hotels - despite Starmer\u2019s promise to end hotel use. Keir Starmer and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed tackling illegal migration during a call today, Downing Street said. In a readout of the call, a No 10 spokesperson said: The prime minister began by updating on the UK\u2019s latest immigration statistics published this morning and set out his determination to continue working together to reduce illegal migration. Both leaders agreed more could be done to smash the gangs in Europe and intercept smuggling gangs trading in human life. Germany was a vital partner in supporting that action, the prime minister added. Discussing progress on the joint action plan to tackle illegal migration, the leaders looked forward to signing the overarching treaty, which the action plan underpinned, in the coming months. The former Tory chancellor George Osborne has collected a share of a \u00a330m pay pot after the City advisory firm Robey Warshaw reported record profits, Kalyeena Makortoff reports. Keir Starmer has often said that he wants to reduce the level of net migration, he has always refused to say by how much, or to propose a target, and he has regularly spoken about the need to better train British workers so that employers are not so reliant on foreign labour. We did not know that the govenrment is going to publish a white paper with a plan to cut net migration soon (see 3.25pm), but otherwise what Starmer in policy terms this afternoon was mostly familiar. But that does not do justice to the sheer audacity of his messaging. By forcefully accusing the last government of intentionally turning Britain \u201cinto a one-nation experiment in open borders\u201d (see 4.12pm), he flipped an issue that has haunted Labour for years. And not just Labour; at the general election the Tories were still attacking Starmer personally for advocating \u201cfree movement\u201d when he was running for party leader. Now he has been able to capitalise on an ONS data revision to make a plausible case that it was Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak who were the real open borders fanatics. Plausible, rather than slam-dunk. In all the many inside accounts of the last Conservative government, you won\u2019t find evidence of a deliberate plan to get net migration up to 900,000 a year. But this was the consequences of the decisions that were being taken, as people like Suella Braverman were happy to point out at the time. This charge certainly has enough merit in it to stick. Yesterday, when Kemi Badenoch devoted her first policy-focused speech as Tory leader to immigration, she openly said this should be a winning issue for her party because Labour would never be able to deliver the reduction in net migration numbers that the public want to see. Perhaps that will turn out to be true. But today\u2019s figure show that the last Conservative government failed on its own terms on this issue, and Starmer did a better job today at rubbishing their record than Badenoch did defending it. Here is the passage from Keir Starmer\u2019s opening statement where he accused the Conservatives of running an \u201copen borders experiment\u201d. He said When we came into office \u2013 we immediately conducted an audit of public finances and we found a \u00a322bn black hole. Now \u2013 the independent Office of National Statistics has conducted vital work on the state of immigration and found the previous government were running an open borders experiment. As the ONS sets out, nearly one million people came to Britain in the year ending June 2023. That is four times the migration levels compared with 2019. Time and again \u2013 the Conservative party promised they would get those numbers down. Time and again \u2013 they failed. And now the chorus of excuses has begun. We heard that from the leader of the opposition, yesterday. But what we didn\u2019t hear what the British people are owed is an explanation. Because a failure on this scale isn\u2019t just bad luck, it isn\u2019t a global trend or taking your eye off the ball. No \u2013 this a different order of failure. This happened by design, not accident. Policies were reformed deliberately to liberalise immigration. Brexit was used for that purpose to turn Britain into a one-nation experiment in open borders. Global Britain \u2013 remember that slogan. That is what they meant. A policy with no support and which they then pretended wasn\u2019t happening. And now they want to wave it away with a simple \u201cwe got it wrong\u201d. Well that\u2019s unforgivable. And mark my words - this government will turn the page. Q: The ONS had to revise its past net migration figures. Do you think we need a rethink of how these figures are calculated if they are so wide of the mark? Starmer says the problem with these figures does not lie with the ONS. What is shocking is not the revisions, but the actualy figures. He goes on: You have to double take when you see an increase of 184,000, to 906,000 in four years. If we think about the previous decade or more, in terms of the sorts of numbers we were talking about, what\u2019s shocking is not the way the figures are arrived at. This is one of those occasions, a bit like the \u00a322bn [the black hole Labour claims to have discoverd in government accounts for this year], a bit like the prisons are over full, where the shock through the system is the sheer size of the number, and the loss of control under the last government. And that was the end. I will post a summary soon. Q: Nigel Farage says Donald Trump hates the deal transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Is he right? Starmer says the Chagos Islands deal is a good one. He says the government is taking it forward. UPDATE: Starmer said: The Chagos deal is a good deal. It secures the base that\u2019s in the vital interests of the US and the UK. And we are already engaging with the new administration in Mauritius as to how we take that forward. Q: [From the Sun] Are you sympathetic to the argument that immigration is bad not for economic reasons, but for cultural reasons? Starmer says he has talked about the economic impact. He says Britain should be training people to do the right jobs. The government should have a skills strategy. (That was not what the questioner was really getting at.) Q: Of the \u00a35.4bn spent on asylum, how much has been spent on hotels. And can you get the spending down to zero next year? Starmer says he wants to bring costs down, and hotel use down. He says one problem was that claims were not being processed. Now they are being. There has been \u201ca significant redeployment of staff\u201d, he says. And more flights have left taking people back. Starmer repeats his point about immigration being far too high. But he says he won\u2019t set a target for reductions. Q: Will you set a target for reducing immigration? Starmer says: I want to see immigration come down significantly. I said that before the election, I said that during the election, I say it again here today. That means bearing down on the influences that have driven it up this high with the measures that I set out a moment ago. We had a supposed cap in place for the best part of a decade, and it didn\u2019t have any meaningful impact on reducing immigration. So I don\u2019t think setting an arbitrary cap, which is what previous governments have done, is the way forward. But do I want it to significantly reduce? Yes, I do, and that\u2019s what our plan will achieve. Q: Have you changed your view on assisted dying? Starmer says it is a genuinely free vote. He does not want to put pressure on MPs. He has got a huge amount of experience on this. As DPP, he looked at every case for five years. He will vote tomorrow, he says. Starmer is now taking questions. Q: [From Beth Rigby from Sky News] People feel let down by their politicians. What does bringing net migration down. Are you talking about the low hundred thousands? And how does that square with your need for economic growth? Starmer says people were let down. This kind of increase was unprecedented. The rise in immigration was \u201coff the scale\u201d. He says it will take \u201chard graft\u201d to get it down. He wants immigration to come down \u201csignificantly\u201d, he says. But he repeats the point about the four-fold increase not being \u201cbad luck\u201d, but \u201ctheir policy\u201d. He says what they have discovered today is another \u201clegacy failure\u201d. UPDATE: Starmer said: When you say people have been let down, you are absolutely right because they were promised by the last government that we would get control of our borders and we had a government that completely lost control of our borders. This sort of increase is unprecedented. It is off the scale what has happened in four short years. The way to get it down is the hard graft, not the gimmicks but the hard graft of driving it own on the skills agenda, migration advisory committee, making sure we are cracking down on employers that are breaking the rules. Starmer mentions the deal with Iraq \u2013 briefed to journalists earlier, but embargoed until 3pm. (See 3.09pm.) He says he has a message for the public. Where the last government failed you, this one will not. They drove immigration numbers up. We will get them down. They left the NHS flat on its face. We will get it standing tall again. They [made you] poorer. We will put more money in your pockets. It won\u2019t be quick or easy, but we are going to turn things around, not with gimmicks, but with graft \u2013 a government that will not rest until the foundations are fixed, borders are secure, and Britain is rebuilt. Starmer says the government will soon publish a white paper on plans to reduce immigration. The Migration Advisory Committee is already conducting a review, he says. And, in areas where employers are over-reliant on foreign workers, the government will crack down. He says the UK will no longer be a soft touch. Employers who do not cooperate will be banned from hiring foreign labour. UPDATE: Starmer said: We will publish a white paper imminently, which sets out a plan to reduce immigration. The Migration Advisory Committee is already conducting a review and where we find clear evidence of sectors that are overreliant on immigration, we will reform the points-based system and make sure that applications for the relevant visa routes, whether it\u2019s the skilled worker route or the shortage occupation list, will now come with new expectations on training people here in our country. We will also crack down on any abuse of the visa routes. For far too long, we\u2019ve been casual about malpractice in our labour market, which sends a clear signal overseas that we\u2019re a soft touch. Well, no more \u2013 our rules will be enforced. Any employers who refuse to play ball, they\u2019ll be banned from hiring overseas labour. Keir Starmer says the figures from the ONS today show the last government were running \u201can open borders experiment\u201d. He makes the point, made by a Labour spokesperson earlier (see 11.25am), about how the figures show net migration going up four times under the Tories. This wasn\u2019t just bad luck, he says. He claims this happened by design. It was an experiment to turn Britain into a country with open borders. And now the Tories want to wave this away with a simple \u201cwe got it wrong\u201d. That is unforgiveable, he says. Every pensioner in Scotland will receive a winter heating payment next year, the Scottish government has announced. PA Media says: Ministers were forced to delay plans to bring in the devolved pension age winter heating payment this year when the universality of its UK-wide counterpart was cut. This afternoon social justice secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville announced the Scottish government will ensure every pensioner receives a payment next year. Under the plans, those in receipt of pension credit or other benefits and who have received a \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 payment this year will get the same next year through the devolved scheme. All other pensioners will receive a reduced payment of \u00a3100. As well as widening the eligibility of the payment, Somerville also announced a further \u00a320m for the Scottish Welfare Fund and the same amount for Warmer Homes Scotland in this financial year. The Scottish government, she said, has been forced to \u201cmitigate\u201d decisions made by the UK government, adding: \u201cThere has been change, but that change is that we are now mitigating against a Labour government and not a Tory one. \u201cWe have not taken this decision lightly, given the significant pressures on the Scottish government\u2019s budget, but this Scottish government is determined to stay true to our values. \u201cOn our watch, we will treat people in this country with fairness, dignity and respect. \u201cWe will not abandon older people this winter, or indeed any winter, and we will continue to protect our pensioners from the harsh reality of a UK Labour government.\u201d Keir Starmer\u2019s government has signed a deal with Iraq to tackle people smugglers across Europe, Rajeev Syal reports. Keir Starmer is about to hold a press conference. He will be talking about the immigration figures. Ministers routinely talk about the fact that claims for pension credit have soared since the government announced it was stopping most pensioners from getting winter fuel payments. Pensioners will still get the money if they receive pension credit, a benefit for poor pensioners with a notoriously low take-up, and the government has been actively encouraging people to apply if they think they might qualify. But figures out today show show there has also been a huge increase in the number of applications being refused. In a report the Department for Work and Pensions says: We have received around 150,000 pension credit claims in the 16 weeks since the [winter fuel payments] announcement on 29 July (which is up to and including end of week beginning 11 November 2024). This is compared to around 61,300 pension credit claims in the 16 weeks before the announcement. This represents a 145% increase in pension credit claims received by DWP in the past 16 weeks compared to the 16 weeks before \u2026 Comparing the 16-week periods before and after the announcement, the number of pension credit claims awarded has increased by 17% (from 36,400 to 42,500), alongside a 96% increase in the number of pension credit claims not awarded (from 27,100 to 53,100). As PA Media reports, since the winter fuel payment 42,500 applications for pension credit have been approved, and 53,100 have been turned down. Age UK said these figures were a \u201cmassive disappointment\u201d. The Unite union has launched legal action against the government over the chancellor\u2019s decision to means test winter fuel payments, PA Media reports. PA says: Unite claimed the government did not follow the correct procedure in making the decision, which will see around 10 million pensioners miss out on the benefit. The union had threatened legal action earlier in November and it announced that it has applied to the high court for leave to proceed with a full judicial review after receiving an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d response to its demand that the government reverse its decision. Sharon Graham, Unite\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cLabour\u2019s decision to pick the pocket of pensioners was wrong on every level. The government has been given every opportunity to reverse its decision and it has failed to do so. This is a rushed, ill-thought-out policy and the government clearly failed to follow the proper legal measures before executing it. With winter approaching the courts must now hold the government to account and reverse this cruel cut as quickly as possible.\u201d The union said it hoped the court would grant an urgent hearing on its case in the context of \u201cworsening weather conditions and dropping temperatures\u201d. In its pre-action letter, the union said it believed the government had breached its legal duties by not referring the cut to the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) and by failing to consider the impact on disabled people, among other grounds. Ministers are not required to refer regulations on benefits to the SSAC if they are a matter of \u201curgency\u201d, something the government relied on when implementing the winter fuel cut. The Government also conducted an \u201cequalities analysis\u201d, which was released under the Freedom of Information Act, but has been criticised for not carrying out a full impact assessment of the policy. The bid for a judicial review will further strain relations between the government and Unite, which has been one of Labour\u2019s main donors but grown increasingly distant from the party since Keir Starmer became leader. The government said it coulld not comment on ongoing legal cases, but a spokesperson said it was \u201ccommitted to supporting pensioners\u201d and urged people to check if they were eligible for pension credit. Keir Starmer has spoken to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as his country\u2019s power grid faces bombardment by Russian forces, PA Media reports. PA says: Zelenskyy characterised the latest attack by Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces as \u201cyet another act of Russian air terror targeting Ukraine\u2019s civilian infrastructure, involving over 90 missiles and nearly 100 drones\u201d. Russia\u2019s renewed attack on Ukraine\u2019s power grid, the second in less than two weeks, has added to fears the Kremlin is hoping to cripple its foe\u2019s power generation ahead of winter. One million homes have lost power in the war-torn nation, according to Ukrainian officials. Downing Street described the Russian strikes as \u201cegregious\u201d, adding that the prime minister characterised them as \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201cdepraved\u201d when speaking to Zelenskyy. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has put out her own statement about the immigration figures. She said: In the space of four years net migration rose by almost five times to a record high \u2013 that shows the serious damage that was done to the immigration system, the lack of proper controls in place, and the over-reliance on a big increase in overseas recruitment. Net migration is still four times higher than it was at the beginning of the last parliament and we are clear that it needs to come down. That is why we are continuing with visa controls and setting out new plans to link them to the system for training and skills here in the UK to tackle the big increase in overseas recruitment over the last few years. Migration has always been an important part of UK history and our economy, but the system needs to be properly managed and controlled. Transport across towns and cities could become integrated using dedicated apps, with investment focused on poorer areas and healthier methods, as part of what ministers are calling a \u201cpeople-first\u201d revolution in local travel. Louise Haigh, the transport secretary, described the plans in a speech in Leeds as \u201ca revolution to wrestle back power over transport\u201d. Peter Walker has the story here. The Migration Observatory, the leading migration thinktank, based at Oxford University, has published a good briefing on today\u2019s migration figures. Here are the key points. The visa changes announced by the Conservative government may not bring migration below pre-Brexit levels, it says. Commenting on the figures, Ben Brindle, a researcher at the Migration Observatory, said: We are yet to see the full impact of the visa restrictions in the data, although this initial data from the summer suggest that migration levels will not necessarily fall below pre-Brexit levels once the policy changes have bedded in. Of all the policy restrictions introduced over the past year, the restrictions on sponsorship in the care sector are likely to have the largest impact on net migration levels in the medium term, because of the significant number of people involved and the fact that most were expected to remain in the UK permanently. And this is what the briefing says about the impact of the visa changes in general. Health and care visa grants to main applicants were down 85% from a Q3 2023 peak of just over 45,000, reaching around 6,600 in Q3 2024. This follows a Home Office crackdown on sponsorship in the care sector due to concerns about exploitation of migrant workers starting in late 2023. The ban on family members of care workers may also have played a role, although most of the decrease preceded that policy change. Following significant increases in salary thresholds for private-sector jobs, skilled worker visa grants outside of health and care declined by 32% between Q3 2023 and Q3 2024, from 17,800 to 12,100. The largest decrease was seen in visa grants to middle-skilled roles in the food and hospitality sector, such as butchers and chefs, which fell 64% in the same period. However, there were also decreases in professional jobs, such as engineers (down 37%) and IT (down 30%). Student visas fell following the ban on most students\u2019 family members in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the same period a year earlier. This was primarily driven by fewer family members themselves (down 84% in Q1-3 inclusive). The number of student main applicants fell by 16% or 64,000 over the same periods. The declines are likely to be spread unevenly across the higher education sector. The 31% decline in combined student and dependant numbers was driven primarily by applicants from Nigeria and India, down 74% and 42% respectively. The asylum backlog has been going up this year, the briefing says. Despite efforts introduced by the Labour government to increase the speed of asylum processing, the asylum backlog rose slightly, from 95,300 in June to 97,200 at the end of September 2024. However, any reduction in the asylum backlog must also be viewed alongside trends in the appeals backlog, which has risen substantially, reaching 58,000 in April-June 2024. In its figures, the Home Office say the asylum backlog was lower in September than it was the year before. (See 10.11am.) Asylum acceptances are going down, the briefing says. The grant rate for asylum seekers has fallen over the past two years. In the year ending September 2024, 52% of asylum seekers were granted asylum or another legal status, down from 75% in the year ending September 2023. This decline follows an increase in the standard of proof for asylum seekers following the Nationality and Borders Act (NABA) of 2022. The impact has taken some time to materialize because of the asylum backlog. Reform UK announced a prominent new recruit today, the former Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns. But Nigel Farage\u2019s party has also lost someone who used to be senior in the party. Ben Habib, who was co-leader of the party for nine months from October 2023, has announced that he is cutting his links with his former colleagues. He has posted a video on social media explaining why. He says he cannot resign, because he is not a member, but he says he wants to announce that he is not afffiliated with the party any more. He says he has long had concerns about the way Farage has been running the party. And he says he does not agree with Farage\u2019s view that Brexit is now \u201cdone\u201d. He also says he cannot understand Farage\u2019s \u201cobsession with recruiting Tories\u201d. Habib has been estranged from Farage for some time. According to James Heale from the Spectator, Farage is happy to see Habib go. Asked about Ben Habib\u2019s resignation from Reform, Nigel Farage bursts into a rendition of \u201cThe Sun has got his hat on, hip hip hip hooray\u201d Back to the migration figures, and here is the response from Seema Malhotra, the Home Office minister. We absolutely believe that net migration has to dome down, but in order to do that we need to go further. That\u2019s why we believe that we need to tackle the causes of net migration, including linking skills and visa policies, addressing those gaps in skills and reducing the reliance on overseas recruitment. But it is also why today I set out new measures, tough measures, to tackle employers who abuse our visa system and flout the rules. Malhotra was referring to a series of relatively technical changes that will toughen the sanctions that apply to firms that break visa rules relating to foreign workers. Q: Will your relationship with Donald Trump help you professionalise Reform UK? Farage says Trump\u2019s campaign this year was much more professional than it was in 2016. He says he has got people like Zia Yusuf working for Reform UK because he wants to do something similar. He also claims that Trump benefitted from having people like Robert F Kennedy Jr supporting him. Trump was not just a one-man band. Farage says he is trying to adopt the same approach. There are other voices speaking for Reform UK, he says. And he says Trump also won partly because he attracted more black and Hispanic support. Reform UK could do the same, he suggests. He claims there were more Bame voters backing Reform UK than the Lib Dems at the general election. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: Are you going to reach out for centre-ground voters? Or you are relying on people how never normally vote for you deciding go vote? Farage says the centre ground in the country is not what MPs think of as the centre ground. He says there was an example of this in the Commons yesterday when Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, said the closure of the Vauxhall van factory in Luton showed by net zero car policies were unwise. He says MPs treated that as \u201cheresy\u201d, but people in the country view that as common sense. Q: What is your plan to cut immigration? Farage says the UK has to leave the ECHR to be able to tackle illegal migration. And, on legal migration, he says he wants to \u201cdrastically reduce\u201d numbers. If skilled workers are needed, time-dependent work permits should be issued. He says this might require wages for people like care workers to go up. He accepts that. Nigel Farage says, if the Tories had voted for Robert Jenrick at leader, that would have meant they were voting to definitely leave the European convention on human rights. But they rejected that option, he says. Andrea Jenkyns claims Tory supporters want to see the UK leave the ECHR. At the press conference they are now taking questions. Q: How long have you been thinking of joining Reform UK. You had a picture of Nigel Farage on your election leaflet at the election? Andrea Jenkyns says she has been thinking about it for a while. She is loyal to parties \u2013 if not to PMs, she says. She says the Conservative party is \u201ctired\u201d. But she says she has some good friends in the Tory party, like Priti Patel, Boris Johnson and Robert Jenrick. Nigel Farage says half the Tory party should join the Lib Dems, and half should join Reform UK. He claims Reform UK can replace the Conservatives. Q: How many council seats do you need to win? Farage says he is following the Paddy Ashdown model. Ashdown knew that, unless you won a significant number of council seats, you would not win seats in parliament. He says the party has a good chance at the Senedd elections. And he claims it is recruiting high-profile people to be candidates there. And he says Reform UK is even doing well in Scotland. Ukip barely \u201ctroubled the scorers\u201d in Scotland, he says. But he says at recent council byelections in Glasgow, the second weakest areas for Reform UK in Scotland, it was getting figures like 13%, 12.5%, and 18%. He says, to be credible, the number of seats Reform UK must gain at the council elections has to be \u201cin the hundreds\u201d. But the party can do it, he suggests. James Heale from the Spectator has posted this on social media. Senior Tory source on Jenkyns\u2019 defection: \u201cTo be honest, I thought she already had\u201d Andrea Jenkyns is speaking now. She says leaving the Tories was not an easy decision. But she says she thinks Reform UK has the potential to save the country. She is proud to be the candidate for mayor for Greater Lincolnshire She is known to be a Yorkshire woman. But she has strong links to Lincolnshire, she says. If elected, she will root out the \u201cwoke leftish agenda\u201d that you find in all levels of government, she claims. She says she will stand up for farmers, who are facing a threat from Labour. Farage says Reform UK is now focused on the local elections next year. And he claims that the party\u2019s vetting process for candidates is more rigorous than other parties\u2019. There is one other number he wants to talk about, he says. He says his TikTok account now has more than 1m followers. He says two-thirds of them are under 35, and half are under 25. He says he is very excited about how much support there is for Reform UK in generation Z. And he announces that Andrea Jenkyns, the former Tory MP, has joined the party. He claims she was the 100,000th person to join \u2013 making her eligible for the prize the party offered for the 100,000th joiner \u2013 a pint with Lee Anderson. And he says Jenkyns will be Reform UK\u2019s candidate in the election for a mayor for Lincolnshire. The Conservatives says today\u2019s figures show migration is too high. This is from Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary. Today\u2019s figures confirm what we\u2019ve been warning about: immigration remains far too high, and Labour was wrong to suspend further restrictions on family visas. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader is speaking now at the press conference. He claims today\u2019s migration figures are \u201chorrendous\u201d for people who wants a GP appointment, or who want to use the motorways, or who want their children or grandchildren to be able to get a house, or who care about our \u201cdisjointed\u201d society. He says he does not accept that there has been a reduction. He says the ONS has revised up its figures for past years. Immigration is making people poorer, he claims. And he dismisses Kemi Badenoch\u2019s admission yesterday that her party made mistakes. He says Tory immigration policies made people poorer. UPDATE: Farage said: Horrendous if you want to get a GP appointment, horrendous if you want to travel around Britain\u2019s motorways, horrendous if you want your kids or grandkids to ever get a foot onto the housing ladder. Horrendous in terms of producing very disjointed societies and communities.\u201d And you might have noticed, the quicker the population rises, the poorer the average family in Britain becomes. Zia Yusuf, the Reform UK chair, has the party now has 400 branches across the country. The party is copying the Lib Dems, he says \u2013 not in terms of policy, but in terms of organisation. He says the Lib Dems have shown the importance of having a political presence in local areas. At the Reform UK press conference Zia Yusuf, the party chair, is speaking. He says a year ago the party had 15,000 members, and was polling at 8%. Now it has more than 100,00 members, he says, and is polling at 20%. The Conservative party has 131,680 members, according to the figures it released at the time of the leadership contest. Reform UK is about to hold a press conference. There is a live feed here. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, picking up the blog again from colleagues. The Labour party has put out this statement about today\u2019s immigration figures. It\u2019s from a party spokesperson. In their own words, the Tories broke the immigration system. On their watch, net migration quadrupled in four years to a record high of nearly one million, despite saying they\u2019d lower it to 100,000. They are an open borders party who lied time and again to the public. This is the chaos Labour inherited and any crowing from the Tories should be seen in that light. Over the summer, the government started the hard graft. We hired more caseworkers to tackle the asylum backlog and we\u2019re now interviewing 10,000 people per month, compared to 2,000 under the Tories, so we can get people out of asylum hotels and save the taxpayers billions. We\u2019ve also ramped up the removal of those with no right to be in the UK by a fifth. Without this action, thousands more would remain in the UK illegally. Labour is getting on with cleaning up the Conservatives\u2019 mess. Our new Border Security Command is working with our European partners to smash the criminal gang networks driving small boat crossings. The UK\u2019s asylum system now costs \u00a35bn \u2013 the highest level of spending on record and up by more than a third in a year. Home Office spending on asylum rose by \u00a31.43bn, up 36% from \u00a33.95bn in 2022/23 to \u00a35.38bn in 2023/24, PA news agency analysis of figures published on Thursday showed. The latest figure is now the highest total since comparable data began in 2010/11. It is more than four times the equivalent figure for 2020/21 (\u00a31.34bn) and nearly 12 times the total a decade ago in 2013/14 (\u00a30.45bn). The total covers all Home Office asylum costs, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other related migration and border activity. The figure does not include the cost of operations responding to Channel crossings, intercepting people as they make the journey to the UK. Although the majority of people entering the UK in this manner do then end up in the asylum system, data suggests. The Conservative former home secretaries Suella Braverman and James Cleverly are claiming credit for net migration starting to fall. Braverman posted this on social media. A 20% drop in immigration since June 2023 is a result of the changes I fought for and introduced in May 2023 as Home Secretary. That\u2019s when we started to turn the tide. But 1.2 million arrivals a year is still too high. This is unsustainable and why we need radical change. And Cleverly posted this. Today\u2019s migration figures are the first to show the impact of the changes that I brought in as Home Secretary. Numbers are still too high, but we see the first significant downward trend in years. Changes that Labour opposed and haven\u2019t fully implemented. I am handing over the blog to colleagues now. I will be back later this morning. Today\u2019s Home Office figures show that the cost of government spending on asylum was \u00a35.38bn in 2023-24, up 36% from \u00a33.95bn in 2022-23, PA Media says. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a thinktank focusing on migration, race and identity issues, says today\u2019s figures should remind Keir Starmer of the danger of making promises he can\u2019t keep. Katwala says: These are the final scores of the last government, after more than a decade of making promises they could not keep on immigration. The collapse in public trust was one reason for their defeat in July. If Keir Starmer learns one lesson on immigration from his predecessors, it should be not to make promises you can\u2019t keep. Starmer will oversee a continuing fall from the record levels of net migration but his challenge now is to manage the trade-offs on migration for the economy, NHS, universities and social care. It remains to be seen how much the public will notice a fall in visa numbers if there is no progress on controlling the much more visible Channel crossings. The Home Office has also published a raft of immigration and asylum figures this morning. There is a summary of the figures here, but you can find all the sets of data here. The Home Office says the number of cases in the asylum backlog (applications waiting to be processed) is down by 22%. It says: At the end of September 2024, there were 22% fewer asylum cases awaiting an initial decision (97,170 cases, relating to 133,408 people) than at the end of September 2023 While the number of cases awaiting an initial decision is lower than the peak at the end of June 2023 (134,046 cases), it is higher than before 2022. This chart from the ONS report shows the impact of the changes to the visa rules announced at the end of last year on net migration numbers. Most foreign students were stopped from bringing dependants with them. And the rules for work visas were tightened too, with social care workers no longer allowed to bring dependants with them. This is from Mary Gregory, director of population statistics at the Office for National Statistics, on today\u2019s figures. Since 2021, long-term international migration to the UK has been at unprecedented levels. This has been driven by a variety of factors, including the war in Ukraine and the effects of the post-Brexit immigration system. Pent-up demand for study-related immigration because of travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic also had an impact. While remaining high by historic standards, net migration is now beginning to fall and is provisionally down 20% in the 12 months to June 2024. Over that period we have seen a fall in immigration, driven by declining numbers of dependants on study visas coming from outside the EU. Over the first six months of 2024, we are also seeing decreases in the number of people arriving for work-related reasons. This is partly related to policy changes earlier this year and is consistent with visa data published by Home Office. We are also starting to see increases in emigration, most notably for those who came to the UK on study-related visas. This is likely to be a consequence of the higher numbers of students coming to the UK post-pandemic who are now reaching the end of their courses. Here is a chart from the ONS report illustrating the latest figures. Here is the PA Media story on the figures. Net migration to the UK hit a higher than previously thought record of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, revised official estimates show. The measure for the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the country then dropped by 20% in the latest period, the 12 months to June 2024, and now stands at 728,000. The total for the year to June 2023 has been revised upwards by 166,000 from the initial estimate of 740,000, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures published on Thursday. A similar change has been made to the estimate for net migration in the year to December 2023, which was initially estimated to be 685,000, and is now thought to be 866,000 \u2013 an increase of 181,000. The ONS said that while remaining high by \u201chistoric standards\u201d, net migration is now \u201cbeginning to fall\u201d. The revisions come as the ONS has continued to review its net migration figures as more complete data becomes available and has improved how it estimates the migration behaviour of people arriving in the UK from outside the European Union. Better analysis of the number of people coming to the UK amid the conflict in Ukraine has also been taken into account. Although the headline ONS numbers show net migration falling, the benchmark has shifted. The ONS is today saying that net migration in the year ending June 2023 was 906,000. But that is 166,000 higher than the ONS\u2019s original estimate for net migration in the year ending June 2023. This is how the ONS explains the discrepancy in its report. Estimates in this release have been updated back to YE June 2021. For example, net migration has been revised upwards by 166,000 for YE June 2023 and by 181,000 for YE December 2023. Reasons for these revisions include: more available data, more information on Ukraine visas and improvements to how we estimate migration of non-EU+ nationals. The Office for National Statistics has published its net migration figures, and it says there was a 20% fall in long-term net migration between the year ending June 2023 and the year ending June 2024. But the figures are still very high \u2013 728,000 in the year ending in June this year. The ONS says: Our latest estimates indicate a fall in long-term net migration (the difference between people coming to live in the UK and those leaving to live elsewhere). Our provisional estimates show a 20% reduction between our updated estimate for year ending (YE) June 2023 (906,000) and our latest estimate for YE June 2024 (728,000). This fall is driven by a decline in long-term immigration mainly because of declining numbers of dependants arriving on study visas. Our most recent data points also show decreases in the number of people arriving for work-related reasons. This is consistent with visa data published by the Home Office, and in part reflects policy changes from earlier this year. It is also driven by a rise in long-term emigration, most notably for those who came to the UK on study-related visas. This is likely a consequence of the large number of students who came to the UK post-pandemic now reaching the end of their courses. Businesses should be using more robots instead of hiring low-paid migrants, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary has said. Eleni Courea has the story. During her interview round this morning, Seema Malhotra, the Home Office minister, said she would vote against the assisted dying bill tomorrow because she is \u201cconcerned about the challenges, the pressures that could be put on vulnerable people\u201d if the law changes. David Cameron has said he has changed his mind on assisted dying and supports the bill to legalise it ahead of its first Commons vote this week, Eleni Courea reports. This is from Tim Bale, the politics professor and expert on the modern Conservative party. He believes the \u201cparty in the media\u201d, as he calls it (aka the Tory press) is an integral part of the Conservative political operation, and he says they like Kemi Badenoch\u2019s immigration speech yesterday. For a more critical take on the speech, it\u2019s worth reading the FT commentator Stephen Bush on Bluesky. Here are some of his comments. On Badenoch saying there has not been enough research into the costs and benefits of immigration Putting to one side the non-trivial objection of \u2018this is not true\u2019. Yes, some of Sunak\u2019s issues were \u2018being an incumbent when inflation has spiked and the public services are on their knees\u2019. But some were just being in this particular auction with Nigel Farage. Why will it work better for Kemi? On the speech generally Just as a matter of \u2018actually being able to keep and make credible promises on immigration\u2019, it is bonkers to start your leadership\u2019s Big Political Rethinking with immigration, because you need to have a sense of how many people you actually think you *need* to keep public services running first. Reducing immigration is a spending commitment, ultimately. On Badenoch promising to cap net migration numbers. A bold approach to return to the promise that destroyed a century-long advantage over Labour on immigration. Government figures reckon the latest annual net migration figure will be around 500,000, Sam Blewett says in his London Playbook briefing for Politico. Government officials and the Tories both reckon the ballpark provisional figure will be somewhere around 500,000, well down from that record high of 745,000 in 2022. There will be those who argue the latest figure is massive pretty much whatever it is \u2014 but if Starmer is serious about bringing down the numbers, he can thank a suite of measures that would have been much more unpalatable for a left-leaning party to have introduced. The last big set of migration figures came out in May, and they showed long-term net migration at 685,000 in the year ending December 2023. Figures out this time last year showed net migration at 745,000 in the year to December 2022 Good morning. The latest immigration figures are out this morning, but the political debate about them has already started. They are expected to show net migration figures falling, and the Conservatives say that is because of decisions they took before the general election. They are referring to the sweeping changes to visa rules announced by James Cleverly in December last year. Kemi Badenoch deployed this line at the start of her speech on immigration yesterday, saying: Tomorrow, immigration figures will be released that should show a drop in net migration. This is because of the changes we made in the last year of the Conservative government. But she said she did not expect the numbers to fall by enough. The figures we saw for 2023 were astonishing. They highlighted a big problem we must be honest about. Even if we see a decline in tomorrow\u2019s data, the fact is immigration, both legal and illegal, is too high. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has been giving interviews this morning saying much the same thing. Seema Malhotra, the Home Office minister, has been putting the counter case on behalf of the government. She told BBC Breakfast this morning that the government wants to see net migration fall, but she would not say by how much. She also said it was important to tackle the causes of high migration. We want to see net migration coming down, but we have to do so in a way that is tackling the causes of net migration, because if much of net migration has been driven by recruiting workers from overseas, you also have to look at what the impact on the economy would be. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Immigration figures publishing the period up to June 2024 are published by the Office for National Statistics. The Home Office is also publishing its latest figures relating to asylum applications. 9.30am: Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is holding a press conference with the four other Reform UK MPs and the party chair, Zia Yusuf.

The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X but individual Guardian journalists are there, I have still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

A few weeks later she developed a limp and within 24 hours she could no longer support her own weight. Flop was taken to the vets where blood tests revealed she was having a reaction to an infection, and she was given medication. Over time, the penguin\u2019s appetite decreased, she became withdrawn, and staff at the Black Country zoo feared for her survival and that her quality of life looked bleak. In a desperate attempt to save her, staff came up with the idea of using the penguin equivalent of a baby bouncer, which they handmade for her, during feeding times. They found that as Flop couldn\u2019t stand, all her weight was on her front, which made consuming and digesting fish uncomfortable and was putting pressure on her internal organs. They constructed a unique treadmill and adapted a baby walker for the penguin, leaving her in an upright position for supervised periods of time to get her used to standing again. Gradually over time, Flop started using her feet to try to push herself up, lifting her head and stumbling forward, and eventually she began standing upright by herself. The keepers received advice from Toronto zoo, where workers had come across a similar case, and brought in an animal physiotherapist who taught staff a series of exercises they could do with Flop to build her strength.

I\u2019ve tested every type of machine from capsule, filter and fully automated bean-to-cup models all the way through to fully manual espresso machines.</p> <p>Sadly, though, I have had to accept defeat in my pursuit of latte art mastery \u2013 despite the occasional happy accident, most of my attempts resemble indecent cave drawings. I apologise in advance for any incriminating photo evidence. </p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>I tested (or retested) 10 machines, several of which I\u2019ve reviewed previously and three of which have a permanent place on my kitchen worktop. I\u2019ve also pored over user reviews and forums, and consulted the recommendations of trusted coffee experts online and on YouTube, in the search for other models to test.</p> <p>Every machine has been run alongside either my own go-to machines or a curated selection of rivals for side-by-side taste and usability testing. Several kilos of fresh coffee beans and a pile of Nespresso-compatible pods have been sourced direct from my go-to roaster, <a href=\"https://www.crafthousecoffee.co.uk/\">Craft House Coffee</a>. I\u2019ve used the manufacturers\u2019 official pods where applicable, too.</p> <p>For the filter and espresso machines that don\u2019t have an integrated coffee grinder, I\u2019ve used my own: a <a href=\"https://bellabarista.co.uk/products/baratza-vario-grinder\">Baratza Vario W+</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/KINGrinder-Straight-Handle-Adjustable-Aeropress/dp/B0CVSDNQ9H\">Kingrinder K6 hand grinder</a>. I consumed so much coffee during the testing process that my blood type is now skinny macchiato.</p> <p>After testing, any coffee machines sourced for this article are either being returned to their sources or being donated to <a href=\"https://www.walsallhealthcare.nhs.uk/charity/\">Well Wishers</a>, the official charity of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best coffee machines in 2024</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best manual machine for beginners</em>: <br>Sage Bambino Plus</h2>    <p>The Bambino Plus\u2019s balance of coffee-brewing talent and beginner-friendly features can\u2019t be beaten for the money. It welcomes even complete newcomers with its friendly, informative user manual and helpful YouTube tutorials, and it\u2019s capable of brewing brilliant coffee.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>It\u2019s a neat little machine, and the modest dimensions mean it\u2019ll slot unobtrusively on to most kitchen worktops. Sage supplies almost everything you need in the box, too. I say almost everything: you\u2019ll also need some good fresh coffee beans and something to grind them with.</p> <p>The quality of the coffee seals the deal here, however. In something of a rarity at this price, the Bambino Plus has a temperature controller, ensuring the brewing water hits the coffee grounds at a consistent temperature. Combine that with a decent-quality coffee bean and a capable grinder, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for routinely good espresso with a bare minimum of faff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/17/best-food-processors-mixers-blenders-chef-chosen\">The best food processors, mixers and blenders \u2013 chosen by chefs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Factor in the automatic milk texturing, which serves up wonderfully hot, silky, frothed milk at the press of a button, and it\u2019s invigoratingly easy to whip up superb flat whites and cappuccinos.

It serves up tasty espresso, americanos and lattes with minimum fuss.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The machine is fairly compact by bean-to-cup standards, although you\u2019ll need to leave a little room around and above the machine. </p> <p>Bright, illuminated icons along the top edge evoke the glow of touchscreens on pricier models, but these are simple press buttons. You can choose from seven different drinks, and the built-in milk carafe allows it to serve up cappuccinos and creamy lattes with zero hassle. </p> <p>The quality of the drinks isn\u2019t as immaculate as the pricier Jura C8, but it\u2019s not far off. Espresso is rich and flavourful, hitting about 68C, and cappuccinos and latte macchiatos are topped with a pleasingly dense layer of creamy foam. The MyLatte drink option will prove popular: fill the carafe with the right amount of milk for your preferred coffee cup, and the machine will drain the carafe and add a shot of coffee.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>it\u2019s not quiet. The grinder\u2019s whines peak at 75dB, and the average noise level of 60dB is markedly louder than the Jura. The lack of a dedicated hot milk function feels like an oversight, too. </p> <p><strong>Machine type: </strong>bean to cup <br><strong>Dimensions: </strong>24 x 44 x 36cm (WDH) <br><strong>Time to heat up: </strong>35 seconds <br><strong>Makes milk-based drinks?</strong> yes <br><strong>Peak noise level: </strong>75dB (average 60dB)<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>2 years repair or replace at De\u2019Longhi\u2019s discretion</p> <p><strong>The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/delonghi-ecam290-83-tb-magnifica-evo-automatic-bean-to-cup-coffee-machine-titanium-black/p110302481\"><sub>\u00a3375 at John Lewis</sub></a><sub> </sub><strong><sub><br></sub></strong><a href=\"https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/ecam292-81-b-ex-2-magnifica-evo-automatic-coffee-maker/p/ECAM292.81.B%20EX%3A2\"><sub>\u00a3379 at De\u2019Longhi</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best for simple filter coffee</em>: <br>Moccamaster KBG Select</h2>    <p>Spending more than \u00a3200 on a filter coffee machine might seem extravagant, but the KBG Select is anything but ordinary. Built to last a lifetime, it\u2019s one of a few select machines to earn an accreditation from both the Specialty Coffee Association and the European Coffee Brewing Centre for its brewing prowess.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>That the machine is designed and handbuilt in the Netherlands goes some way towards explaining the high price. As does the five-year warranty and the promise of lifelong repairability. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that you can pick from more than 20 kitchen-matching colours.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be simpler to use: pop in a paper filter, add the ground coffee to the filter and wait patiently. You can brew anything between four and 10 125ml cups of coffee \u2013 admittedly closer to five normal-sized mugs \u2013 and a full jug takes a consistent six minutes to brew.</p> <p>If you\u2019re making fewer cups, you can flick the half-jug switch to slow the brewing process and eke every last drop of flavour from smaller doses of coffee. However much you brew, the hotplate then stays on for 40 minutes, keeping coffee warm without stewing it.</p> <p>The quality of the coffee it makes, and the consistency with which it does so, is what sets the KBG Select apart. I\u2019ve had surprisingly pleasant results from pre-ground supermarket coffee but routinely enjoy wonderful cups from freshly ground beans. Feed the KBG Select with great coffee and it quietly does the rest.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>the machine feels lightweight, and the glass carafe doesn\u2019t feel especially solid. That said, my unit has been used daily for almost two years now, and nothing has broken. Yet.</p> <p>One final word of caution for any coffee perfectionists: you may prefer a machine with more adjustability, such as Sage\u2019s well-regarded Precision Brewer.</p> <p><strong>Machine type: </strong>filter<strong> <br>Dimensions: </strong>32 x 17 x 36cm (WDH)<br><strong>Time to heat up:</strong> 25 seconds<br><strong>Makes milk-based drinks?</strong> no <br><strong>Peak noise level: </strong>59dB (average 44dB)<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> 5 years (excluding carafe)</p> <p><a href=\"https://ao.com/product/53811-moccamaster-kbg-741-select-filter-coffee-machine-grey-96974-67.aspx\"><sub>\u00a3218 at AO</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Moccamaster-53818-Select-Machine-Aluminium/dp/B084XS11D8\"><sub>\u00a3212.99 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best for capsules</em>: <br>L\u2019or Barista Sublime</h2>    <p>Built by Philips, this L\u2019or-branded machine makes a huge range of coffees thanks to its compatibility with official Nespresso, Nespresso-compatible and L\u2019or\u2019s own range of pods. It doesn\u2019t support the latest Vertuo pods, but this machine looks great and works well.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The compact dimensions are a big plus, and the design is (mostly) sensible. There\u2019s a removable 0.8l water tank at the rear, and the drip tray and pod bin slide out together.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to use, too. Simply lift the large curved handle on top, pop in a capsule and close the lid. You can also pour two normal-sized cups simultaneously.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t a fan of some of the more potent XXL L\u2019or espresso pods \u2013 although the high-street chain flavour may be to some tastes \u2013 but there are more than 100 other options from which to choose.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>the drip tray, lid and pod bin separate with minimal encouragement, so it\u2019s easy to send their contents scattering across your kitchen floor if you\u2019re not paying attention.</p> <p>Nor is it the quietest machine, although it\u2019s unlikely to wake up the household.</p> <p>Some users have reported that the machine doesn\u2019t play nicely with all Nespresso-compatible capsules. I had no such problems during my testing, but it\u2019s worth buying a handful of capsules to test before buying in bulk.</p> <p>Opinions are mixed on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/10/single-use-coffee-pod-environment-impact-better\">sustainability of capsule coffee</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.lorespresso.com/en_gb/cp/our-story/recycling\">L\u2019or </a>and <a href=\"https://www.nespresso.com/uk/en/sustainability/recycling\">Nespresso\u2019s</a> standard aluminium capsules can be sent back for recycling \u2013 both companies provide free postage options for returning capsules in bulk.

The C8 is, however, an example of trickle-down technology done right. It makes only four types of coffee but makes them very well indeed. The design is well thought out, and it\u2019s easy to use. A class act through and through.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>There\u2019s only so lovely you can make a large black cuboid, but Jura\u2019s done well here. It\u2019s all plastic, but it doesn\u2019t feel unsubstantial, and unlike rival machines, there\u2019s precious little in the way of lumps and protrusions.</p> <p>One of my favourite features is the milk system: the milk carafe itself is rather elegant, or you can choose to drop the rubber tube into a milk bottle or jug straight from the fridge.</p> <p>Espresso is among the best from any bean-to-cup machine I\u2019ve tested in this price range, and the Jura produces a smoother, more balanced shot than cheaper machines. The black coffee is good, and although the cappuccino is similarly tasty, the latte macchiato was my favourite \u2013 the combination of a nice dense milk foam and well-extracted coffee is dangerously moreish.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>it\u2019s mostly quiet \u2013 noise levels hover around 45dB while brewing and grinding \u2013 but the milk system can make a loud 70dB slurp when it first starts to pull milk through. <br><br><strong>Machine type: </strong>bean to cup<strong> <br>Dimensions: </strong>26 x 44 x 33cm (WDH) <br><strong>Time to heat up:</strong> 30 seconds <br><strong>Makes milk-based drinks?</strong> yes <br><strong>Peak noise level: </strong>70dB (average 45dB) <br><strong>Warranty:</strong> 25 months repair or replace at Jura\u2019s discretion</p> <p><strong>The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers</strong><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.hartsofstur.com/jura-c8-piano-black-coffee-machine-15690.html\"><sub>\u00a3795 at Harts of Stur</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://markselectrical.co.uk/15690_jura-coffee-machine\"><sub>\u00a3795 at Marks Electrical</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best Nespresso</em><em> </em><em>machine</em>: <br>Nespresso Vertuo Plus</h2>    <p>The Vertuo Plus uses Nespresso\u2019s larger, pricier Vertuo capsules, allowing it to make everything from surprisingly refined espresso to half-litre carafes. </p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>If you\u2019re looking for the most compact machine possible, then the Vertuo Plus isn\u2019t it. Standing almost 33cm tall, the Plus\u2019s curved body and offset water tank are quite an imposing sight next to the smaller capsule machines on my kitchen counter. </p> <p>Crucially, though, the Vertuo Plus makes a mean coffee. You can use any of the Vertuo capsules, and the machine did a great job with all those I tested. It\u2019s much quieter than the Vertuo Lattissima, too, and while the noise levels reach 54dB when the capsules spin up, it\u2019s a much less annoying thrum than its stablemate.</p> <p>One word of warning: lungos come out at a steaming hot 78C, perfect for adding milk, but tongue-searingly hot without. Espresso shots tend to pour into the cup at about 70C, so are drinkable right away.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>the retail price is high. However, it\u2019s regularly discounted. The same machine is made by several different manufacturers, though, so you\u2019ll see versions with slightly different styling.</p> <p><strong>Machine type: </strong>capsule<strong> <br>Dimensions: </strong>22 x 35 x 33cm (WDH) <br><strong>Time to heat up:</strong> 27 seconds <br><strong>Makes milk-based drinks?</strong> no <br><strong>Peak noise level:</strong> 54.5dB (average 50.5dB) <br><strong>Warranty: </strong>2 years repair or replace at Nespresso\u2019s discretion <br><br><strong>The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.nespresso.com/uk/en/order/machines/vertuo/vertuo-plus-deluxe-black-c\"><sub>\u00a3199 at Nespresso</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.fenwick.co.uk/home-and-tech/electricals/kitchen-electricals/coffee-machines/vertuo-plus-by-magimix/2530003591772.html\"><sub>\u00a389.10 at Fenwick</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>Lavazza Jolie Evo</h2>    <p><strong>Best for: </strong>hassle-free Italian espresso and tasty black coffees</p> <p>There are cheaper capsule machines and there are far fancier ones, but the \u00a399 Jolie Evo earns a recommendation by making consistently enjoyable coffee. Lavazza\u2019s A Modo Mio capsule range is small, but each gives a pleasingly brash, nutty Italian espresso flavour with minimal hassle, and the machine itself is compact and uncomplicated.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The Jolie Evo is tiny, so fits into tiny gaps on a kitchen worktop. The removable 0.6l water tank saves you from carrying jugs of water across the kitchen, and the little bin holds five caps.</p> <p>The machine heats up in 30 to 35 seconds, then you drop a capsule in the slot, pull down the lever (which has a rather satisfying action, it must be said) and press the button. The Jolie Evo will keep pouring until you press the button a second time, so you can have any amount of coffee from the shortest ristretto to a longer 160ml brew. It\u2019s reasonably quiet, too, and I measured a peak sound level of 45dB from a metre away.</p> <p><strong>It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 </strong>the water tank can be a little fiddly to slot back into place.

The combination of automatic grinding, dosing and brewing assistance and the excellent automatic milk texturing is a life-saver when I need to be juggling kids rather than coffee paraphernalia.</p> <p>The Barista Touch Impress is truly lovely to use. The bright touchscreen guides you gently through the process of dialling in your espresso and steaming your milk, so even beginners don\u2019t feel too overwhelmed. What\u2019s more, it optimises the grind size and amount of coffee to ensure that every shot extracts the optimal amount of flavour.</p> <p>All the little details make for a great experience, such as the Baratza-manufactured burrs in the grinder, the adjustable brew temperature and the overall ease of use. And, although it\u2019s assisted, the physical process of handling the portafilter and popping the milk jug under the wand makes you feel like you\u2019re doing it all yourself.</p> <p>This is barista cosplay for lazy and busy espresso fans \u2013 and I count myself as being in both camps simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 </strong>for the same kind of money, you could buy a very capable fully manual machine, a quality grinder and still have enough cash for a few kilos of high-end coffee beans. </p> <p><strong>Machine type: </strong>assisted manual espresso;<strong> </strong><strong>dimensions: </strong>36 x 34 x 42cm (WDH); <strong>time to heat up:</strong> 6 seconds; <strong>makes milk-based drinks?</strong> yes; <strong>peak noise level: </strong>76dB (average 60dB); <strong>warranty: </strong>2 years repair, replace or refund at Sage\u2019s discretion<br><br><a href=\"https://www.sageappliances.com/en-gb/product/bes881\"><sub>\u00a31,199.95 from Sage</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sage-Barista-Impress-Brushed-Stainless/dp/B0CFLM9YD2?th=1\"><sub>\u00a31,199 from Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima</h2>    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> sumptuous milk-based coffees with minimal effort and no mess</p> <p>Built by De\u2019Longhi, the Vertuo Lattissima is what you\u2019d get if you crossed an automatic bean-to-cup with a Nespresso Vertuo machine. You get all the usual black coffee options, and the clip-on milk carafe means it also serves moreish cappuccinos, latte macchiatos and hot milk on demand.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible to make some gorgeously long milk-based drinks with the Vertuo Lattissima \u2013 so much so that you\u2019ll need to unclip the small drip tray completely.

Despite a handful of redesigns since its release in the 1990s, this manual espresso machine has become a regular sight in the kitchens of coffee enthusiasts worldwide. It\u2019s capable of making superb espresso, but its retro-facing looks go hand in hand with old-school engineering, and this means that getting consistently great coffee requires a fair bit of trial and error.</p> <p>The decidedly unmodern construction is all part of the appeal here.

Generally speaking, the cheaper the machine, the less likely it is that repairs will be economical. Some machines \u2013 such as capsule, filter and low-end espresso machines \u2013 are just not designed to be easily serviceable. Screws and bolts are often replaced by plastic clips, which generally aren\u2019t designed to be unclipped once fastened. Spare parts are hard to come by, too, if they exist at all.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to something as earth-shatteringly important as coffee, everyone has an opinion. Some crave a single perfect shot of espresso, while others seek the milkiest latte; some love Starbucks and others, well, don\u2019t. This is why the idea of there being a single best coffee machine is fanciful \u2013 everyone\u2019s idea of the perfect coffee couldn\u2019t be more different. As a selfless service to coffee drinkers everywhere, I\u2019ve spent months researching and testing coffee machines to produce a shortlist of tried-and-tested recommendations. The list spans all the main types of coffee maker: manual espresso, filter, bean-to-cup and capsule (not sure what all of this means? Read our dedicated guide to the different types of coffee machine. I\u2019ve aimed this guide at everyday coffee lovers who want to up their game without spending a fortune or losing hours to perfecting their craft. Ease of use, simplicity and relative affordability play just as important a role as the quality of the coffee. If you love coffee and need a little help choosing, then read on \u2013 you\u2019ll brew better coffee with one of these machines on your worktop. At a glance Best manual machine for beginners: Sage Bambino Plus \u00a3300 at Argos Best low-effort coffee at an affordable price: De\u2019Longhi Magnifica Evo One Touch \u00a3375 at John Lewis Best for simple filter coffee: Moccamaster KBG Select \u00a3218 at AO Best for capsules: L\u2019or Barista Sublime \u00a345 at Amazon Best low-effort premium coffee: Jura C8 \u00a3795 at Harts of Stur Best capsule machine for long coffees: Nespresso Vertuo Plus \u00a389.10 at Fenwick Why you should trust me Having spent more than seven years as the resident coffee bore at an expert product testing publication, I\u2019ve wiled away countless hours in the search for better-tasting coffee. I\u2019ve tested every type of machine from capsule, filter and fully automated bean-to-cup models all the way through to fully manual espresso machines. Sadly, though, I have had to accept defeat in my pursuit of latte art mastery \u2013 despite the occasional happy accident, most of my attempts resemble indecent cave drawings. I apologise in advance for any incriminating photo evidence. How I tested I tested (or retested) 10 machines, several of which I\u2019ve reviewed previously and three of which have a permanent place on my kitchen worktop. I\u2019ve also pored over user reviews and forums, and consulted the recommendations of trusted coffee experts online and on YouTube, in the search for other models to test. Every machine has been run alongside either my own go-to machines or a curated selection of rivals for side-by-side taste and usability testing. Several kilos of fresh coffee beans and a pile of Nespresso-compatible pods have been sourced direct from my go-to roaster, Craft House Coffee. I\u2019ve used the manufacturers\u2019 official pods where applicable, too. For the filter and espresso machines that don\u2019t have an integrated coffee grinder, I\u2019ve used my own: a Baratza Vario W+ and a Kingrinder K6 hand grinder. I consumed so much coffee during the testing process that my blood type is now skinny macchiato. After testing, any coffee machines sourced for this article are either being returned to their sources or being donated to Well Wishers, the official charity of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust. *** The best coffee machines in 2024 *** Best manual machine for beginners: Sage Bambino Plus The Bambino Plus\u2019s balance of coffee-brewing talent and beginner-friendly features can\u2019t be beaten for the money. It welcomes even complete newcomers with its friendly, informative user manual and helpful YouTube tutorials, and it\u2019s capable of brewing brilliant coffee. Why we love it It\u2019s a neat little machine, and the modest dimensions mean it\u2019ll slot unobtrusively on to most kitchen worktops. Sage supplies almost everything you need in the box, too. I say almost everything: you\u2019ll also need some good fresh coffee beans and something to grind them with. The quality of the coffee seals the deal here, however. In something of a rarity at this price, the Bambino Plus has a temperature controller, ensuring the brewing water hits the coffee grounds at a consistent temperature. Combine that with a decent-quality coffee bean and a capable grinder, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for routinely good espresso with a bare minimum of faff. Factor in the automatic milk texturing, which serves up wonderfully hot, silky, frothed milk at the press of a button, and it\u2019s invigoratingly easy to whip up superb flat whites and cappuccinos. It\u2019s a beginner\u2019s dream. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the manual mode doesn\u2019t feel quite right without a proper physical dial, so budding baristas may hanker for a fully manual espresso machine. As you can\u2019t adjust the brew temperature, you\u2019re better off sticking with medium- to dark-roast coffee beans (lighter roasts require higher brew temperatures, so they may taste a little sour). Machine type: assisted manual espresso Dimensions: 19 x 36 x 30cm (WDH) Time to heat up: 6 seconds Makes milk-based drinks? yes Peak noise level: 63dB (50dB average) Warranty: 2 years repair, replace or refund at Sage\u2019s discretion The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a3300 at Argos \u00a3349 at John Lewis *** Best low-effort coffee machine: De\u2019Longhi Magnifica Evo One Touch I\u2019ve tested several De\u2019Longhi bean-to-cup machines over the years, all the way up to its range-topping \u00a31,999 Maestosa, but the Magnifica Evo One Touch is the best-value pick by a margin. It serves up tasty espresso, americanos and lattes with minimum fuss. Why we love it The machine is fairly compact by bean-to-cup standards, although you\u2019ll need to leave a little room around and above the machine. Bright, illuminated icons along the top edge evoke the glow of touchscreens on pricier models, but these are simple press buttons. You can choose from seven different drinks, and the built-in milk carafe allows it to serve up cappuccinos and creamy lattes with zero hassle. The quality of the drinks isn\u2019t as immaculate as the pricier Jura C8, but it\u2019s not far off. Espresso is rich and flavourful, hitting about 68C, and cappuccinos and latte macchiatos are topped with a pleasingly dense layer of creamy foam. The MyLatte drink option will prove popular: fill the carafe with the right amount of milk for your preferred coffee cup, and the machine will drain the carafe and add a shot of coffee. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 it\u2019s not quiet. The grinder\u2019s whines peak at 75dB, and the average noise level of 60dB is markedly louder than the Jura. The lack of a dedicated hot milk function feels like an oversight, too. Machine type: bean to cup Dimensions: 24 x 44 x 36cm (WDH) Time to heat up: 35 seconds Makes milk-based drinks? yes Peak noise level: 75dB (average 60dB) Warranty: 2 years repair or replace at De\u2019Longhi\u2019s discretion The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a3375 at John Lewis \u00a3379 at De\u2019Longhi *** Best for simple filter coffee: Moccamaster KBG Select Spending more than \u00a3200 on a filter coffee machine might seem extravagant, but the KBG Select is anything but ordinary. Built to last a lifetime, it\u2019s one of a few select machines to earn an accreditation from both the Specialty Coffee Association and the European Coffee Brewing Centre for its brewing prowess. Why we love it That the machine is designed and handbuilt in the Netherlands goes some way towards explaining the high price. As does the five-year warranty and the promise of lifelong repairability. It certainly doesn\u2019t hurt that you can pick from more than 20 kitchen-matching colours. It couldn\u2019t be simpler to use: pop in a paper filter, add the ground coffee to the filter and wait patiently. You can brew anything between four and 10 125ml cups of coffee \u2013 admittedly closer to five normal-sized mugs \u2013 and a full jug takes a consistent six minutes to brew. If you\u2019re making fewer cups, you can flick the half-jug switch to slow the brewing process and eke every last drop of flavour from smaller doses of coffee. However much you brew, the hotplate then stays on for 40 minutes, keeping coffee warm without stewing it. The quality of the coffee it makes, and the consistency with which it does so, is what sets the KBG Select apart. I\u2019ve had surprisingly pleasant results from pre-ground supermarket coffee but routinely enjoy wonderful cups from freshly ground beans. Feed the KBG Select with great coffee and it quietly does the rest. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the machine feels lightweight, and the glass carafe doesn\u2019t feel especially solid. That said, my unit has been used daily for almost two years now, and nothing has broken. Yet. One final word of caution for any coffee perfectionists: you may prefer a machine with more adjustability, such as Sage\u2019s well-regarded Precision Brewer. Machine type: filter Dimensions: 32 x 17 x 36cm (WDH) Time to heat up: 25 seconds Makes milk-based drinks? no Peak noise level: 59dB (average 44dB) Warranty: 5 years (excluding carafe) \u00a3218 at AO \u00a3212.99 at Amazon *** Best for capsules: L\u2019or Barista Sublime Built by Philips, this L\u2019or-branded machine makes a huge range of coffees thanks to its compatibility with official Nespresso, Nespresso-compatible and L\u2019or\u2019s own range of pods. It doesn\u2019t support the latest Vertuo pods, but this machine looks great and works well. Why we love it The compact dimensions are a big plus, and the design is (mostly) sensible. There\u2019s a removable 0.8l water tank at the rear, and the drip tray and pod bin slide out together. It\u2019s easy to use, too. Simply lift the large curved handle on top, pop in a capsule and close the lid. You can also pour two normal-sized cups simultaneously. I wasn\u2019t a fan of some of the more potent XXL L\u2019or espresso pods \u2013 although the high-street chain flavour may be to some tastes \u2013 but there are more than 100 other options from which to choose. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the drip tray, lid and pod bin separate with minimal encouragement, so it\u2019s easy to send their contents scattering across your kitchen floor if you\u2019re not paying attention. Nor is it the quietest machine, although it\u2019s unlikely to wake up the household. Some users have reported that the machine doesn\u2019t play nicely with all Nespresso-compatible capsules. I had no such problems during my testing, but it\u2019s worth buying a handful of capsules to test before buying in bulk. Opinions are mixed on the sustainability of capsule coffee, but L\u2019or and Nespresso\u2019s standard aluminium capsules can be sent back for recycling \u2013 both companies provide free postage options for returning capsules in bulk. L\u2019or doesn\u2019t yet offer compostable options, but Nespresso and Nespresso-compatible compostable capsules are available. Machine type: capsule Dimensions: 16 x 40 x 28cm (WDH); Time to heat up: 4 seconds Makes milk-based drinks? no Peak noise level: 60dB (average 45dB) Warranty: 2 years The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a345 at Amazon \u00a345 at John Lewis *** Best premium low-effort coffee: Jura C8 Jura describes its C8 as its first entry into the \u201cpremium economy segment\u201d, which gives you a good idea of how expensive the rest of its machines are. The C8 is, however, an example of trickle-down technology done right. It makes only four types of coffee but makes them very well indeed. The design is well thought out, and it\u2019s easy to use. A class act through and through. Why we love it There\u2019s only so lovely you can make a large black cuboid, but Jura\u2019s done well here. It\u2019s all plastic, but it doesn\u2019t feel unsubstantial, and unlike rival machines, there\u2019s precious little in the way of lumps and protrusions. One of my favourite features is the milk system: the milk carafe itself is rather elegant, or you can choose to drop the rubber tube into a milk bottle or jug straight from the fridge. Espresso is among the best from any bean-to-cup machine I\u2019ve tested in this price range, and the Jura produces a smoother, more balanced shot than cheaper machines. The black coffee is good, and although the cappuccino is similarly tasty, the latte macchiato was my favourite \u2013 the combination of a nice dense milk foam and well-extracted coffee is dangerously moreish. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 it\u2019s mostly quiet \u2013 noise levels hover around 45dB while brewing and grinding \u2013 but the milk system can make a loud 70dB slurp when it first starts to pull milk through. Machine type: bean to cup Dimensions: 26 x 44 x 33cm (WDH) Time to heat up: 30 seconds Makes milk-based drinks? yes Peak noise level: 70dB (average 45dB) Warranty: 25 months repair or replace at Jura\u2019s discretion The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a3795 at Harts of Stur \u00a3795 at Marks Electrical *** Best Nespresso machine: Nespresso Vertuo Plus The Vertuo Plus uses Nespresso\u2019s larger, pricier Vertuo capsules, allowing it to make everything from surprisingly refined espresso to half-litre carafes. Why we love it If you\u2019re looking for the most compact machine possible, then the Vertuo Plus isn\u2019t it. Standing almost 33cm tall, the Plus\u2019s curved body and offset water tank are quite an imposing sight next to the smaller capsule machines on my kitchen counter. Crucially, though, the Vertuo Plus makes a mean coffee. You can use any of the Vertuo capsules, and the machine did a great job with all those I tested. It\u2019s much quieter than the Vertuo Lattissima, too, and while the noise levels reach 54dB when the capsules spin up, it\u2019s a much less annoying thrum than its stablemate. One word of warning: lungos come out at a steaming hot 78C, perfect for adding milk, but tongue-searingly hot without. Espresso shots tend to pour into the cup at about 70C, so are drinkable right away. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the retail price is high. However, it\u2019s regularly discounted. The same machine is made by several different manufacturers, though, so you\u2019ll see versions with slightly different styling. Machine type: capsule Dimensions: 22 x 35 x 33cm (WDH) Time to heat up: 27 seconds Makes milk-based drinks? no Peak noise level: 54.5dB (average 50.5dB) Warranty: 2 years repair or replace at Nespresso\u2019s discretion The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a3199 at Nespresso \u00a389.10 at Fenwick *** Best of the rest *** Lavazza Jolie Evo Best for: hassle-free Italian espresso and tasty black coffees There are cheaper capsule machines and there are far fancier ones, but the \u00a399 Jolie Evo earns a recommendation by making consistently enjoyable coffee. Lavazza\u2019s A Modo Mio capsule range is small, but each gives a pleasingly brash, nutty Italian espresso flavour with minimal hassle, and the machine itself is compact and uncomplicated. Why we love it The Jolie Evo is tiny, so fits into tiny gaps on a kitchen worktop. The removable 0.6l water tank saves you from carrying jugs of water across the kitchen, and the little bin holds five caps. The machine heats up in 30 to 35 seconds, then you drop a capsule in the slot, pull down the lever (which has a rather satisfying action, it must be said) and press the button. The Jolie Evo will keep pouring until you press the button a second time, so you can have any amount of coffee from the shortest ristretto to a longer 160ml brew. It\u2019s reasonably quiet, too, and I measured a peak sound level of 45dB from a metre away. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 the water tank can be a little fiddly to slot back into place. Also, the capsule drawer doesn\u2019t always push back flush with the surround. Machine type: capsule; dimensions: 12 x 33 x 21cm (WDH); time to heat up: 35 seconds; makes milk-based drinks? no; peak noise level: 45dB (average 35dB); warranty: 2 years repair or replace at Lavazza\u2019s discretion The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a349.50 at Lavazza \u00a344.99 at Amazon *** Sage Barista Touch Impress Best for: manual espresso excellence without the effort If it weren\u2019t for the price, this would be in one of the top slots: it\u2019s become my go-to for espresso, cappuccino and beyond. The combination of automatic grinding, dosing and brewing assistance and the excellent automatic milk texturing is a life-saver when I need to be juggling kids rather than coffee paraphernalia. The Barista Touch Impress is truly lovely to use. The bright touchscreen guides you gently through the process of dialling in your espresso and steaming your milk, so even beginners don\u2019t feel too overwhelmed. What\u2019s more, it optimises the grind size and amount of coffee to ensure that every shot extracts the optimal amount of flavour. All the little details make for a great experience, such as the Baratza-manufactured burrs in the grinder, the adjustable brew temperature and the overall ease of use. And, although it\u2019s assisted, the physical process of handling the portafilter and popping the milk jug under the wand makes you feel like you\u2019re doing it all yourself. This is barista cosplay for lazy and busy espresso fans \u2013 and I count myself as being in both camps simultaneously. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 for the same kind of money, you could buy a very capable fully manual machine, a quality grinder and still have enough cash for a few kilos of high-end coffee beans. Machine type: assisted manual espresso; dimensions: 36 x 34 x 42cm (WDH); time to heat up: 6 seconds; makes milk-based drinks? yes; peak noise level: 76dB (average 60dB); warranty: 2 years repair, replace or refund at Sage\u2019s discretion \u00a31,199.95 from Sage \u00a31,199 from Amazon *** Nespresso Vertuo Lattissima Best for: sumptuous milk-based coffees with minimal effort and no mess Built by De\u2019Longhi, the Vertuo Lattissima is what you\u2019d get if you crossed an automatic bean-to-cup with a Nespresso Vertuo machine. You get all the usual black coffee options, and the clip-on milk carafe means it also serves moreish cappuccinos, latte macchiatos and hot milk on demand. It\u2019s possible to make some gorgeously long milk-based drinks with the Vertuo Lattissima \u2013 so much so that you\u2019ll need to unclip the small drip tray completely. Pop in an 80ml espresso capsule, for instance, and the latte macchiato button will fill a super-sized 590ml cup. The drinks are more than worthy substitutes for any high-street coffee \u2013 I could see this machine costing people a small fortune in capsules. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 as tasty as the coffees are, \u00a3379 is a lot of money. It\u2019s rather noisy, too. Machine type: capsule; dimensions: 19 x 41 x 31cm (WDH); time to heat up: 35 seconds; makes milk-based drinks? yes; peak noise level: 60dB (average 53dB); warranty: 2 years repair or replace at Nespresso\u2019s discretion The prices below reflect current Black Friday offers \u00a3199.99 from De\u2019Longhi \u00a3199.95 from John Lewis *** Gaggia Classic Evo Pro Best for: manual espresso tinkerers and secondhand bargain hunters The Gaggia Classic lives up to its name. Despite a handful of redesigns since its release in the 1990s, this manual espresso machine has become a regular sight in the kitchens of coffee enthusiasts worldwide. It\u2019s capable of making superb espresso, but its retro-facing looks go hand in hand with old-school engineering, and this means that getting consistently great coffee requires a fair bit of trial and error. The decidedly unmodern construction is all part of the appeal here. The stainless steel body and chunky switches are reassuringly utilitarian, and while the drip tray just loosely slots home and the water tank is fiddly to remove, there\u2019s a ramshackle charm to the whole thing. It feels built to last, and it will \u2013 replacement parts are readily available. What\u2019s more, this DIY repairability opens the door to aftermarket upgrades that can radically improve its shot-pulling capabilities, and makes it a good buy on the secondhand market, as long as you budget for potential repair costs. It didn\u2019t make the final cut because \u2026 it\u2019s perfectly possible to pull a great espresso, but it takes a little trial and error to get there. If you\u2019re willing to learn its quirks, you\u2019ll find the Classic a rewarding companion. Machine type: fully manual espresso; dimensions: 23 x 24 x 38cm (WDH); time to heat up: 1 minute; makes milk-based drinks? yes; peak noise level: 76dB (average 60dB); warranty: 3 years repair or replace \u00a3425 from Gaggia \u00a3474.05 from Inhabito *** What you need to know Warranty When things go wrong with your coffee machine, the first port of call is the manufacturer\u2019s warranty. Most have a two-year repair or replace warranty as standard, but pricier models may up that to three years or \u2013 in the rare case of Moccamaster \u2013 five years. For the most part, these will be a repair or replace warranty, which means the machine will have to be shipped back to the manufacturer, sometimes at its expense but not always (as ever, it pays read the small print). It will then be at the company\u2019s discretion as to whether a repair or a replacement is the best course of action. Before you buy, it\u2019s advisable to shop around and check whether different retailers provide extended cover for free or offer sensibly priced upgrades to the standard warranty \u2013 or alternatively you can consider third-party appliance insurance. This unlikely to be cost-effective for cheaper machines, though: even a small monthly outlay will quickly add up to more than the price of a new machine. Repairability When you\u2019re out of warranty, things can get tricky. Generally speaking, the cheaper the machine, the less likely it is that repairs will be economical. Some machines \u2013 such as capsule, filter and low-end espresso machines \u2013 are just not designed to be easily serviceable. Screws and bolts are often replaced by plastic clips, which generally aren\u2019t designed to be unclipped once fastened. Spare parts are hard to come by, too, if they exist at all.

First, he fails to mention the UK\u2019s responsibility for historic carbon emissions, which \u2013 given the time CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the atmosphere \u2013 means that simply taking responsibility for its current share (1%) is not enough. Second, he seems to claim that the tripling of the north-to-south financing is a major success.

A glance at the figures shows clearly that these new energy forms are in addition to others, especially fossil fuels \u2013 all of which continue to rise. While a transition in the future is not ruled out, using the term for past or current trends is wrong. The overall picture therefore remains bleak, and the main chance of improvement would be a significant reduction in energy production and use in the global north, and in China. Unfortunately, the economic dogma of GDP growth makes this impossible.<br><strong>Steve Brown</strong><br><em>Fontenay-sous-Bois, France</em></p> <p>\u2022 Patrick Greenfield\u2019s article highlights how states in Cop29 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/cop29s-new-carbon-market-rules-offer-hope-after-scandal-and-deadlock\">agreed to establish new common rules for the development of carbon credit markets</a> (24 November). Yet several persistent challenges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/10/cop29-what-are-carbon-credits-and-why-are-they-so-controversial\">undermine the credibility</a> of these reformed markets. We believe two major areas of improvement must be addressed to restore this credibility.</p> <p>The first is greater <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01310-0\">transparency</a>, which is is one of the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/documents/641251\">methodological requirements of Article 6.4 accepted at COP 29</a>. It encourages transparency in data sources, calculations and monitoring methods used to establish estimates, including those related to the reference scenario, the project\u2019s additionality compared to its effectiveness in reducing emissions, and potential carbon leakages. The <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-body\">supervisory body for Article 6.4</a> is responsible for ensuring transparency in certification methodologies. But efforts must go further. </p> <p>It is essential to disclose corporate transactions of carbon credits, as well as the distribution of revenues throughout the value chain. Such transparency would allow better evaluation of the real impact of offset projects and address accusations of \u201c<a href=\"https://earth.org/is-carbon-offset-a-form-of-greenwashing/\">greenwashing</a>\u201d. Solutions such as digital platforms, regulations facilitating carbon credit tracking, publication of exchange prices, and standardised information could fulfil this critical need for transparency.</p> <p>The second area to be addressed is that the reliability of reference scenarios used to calculate credits must be supported by robust statistical methods. These would allow for more precise reference scenarios, thereby strengthening the robustness and legitimacy of carbon credits. However, these methods increase risks for project developers and may reduce the supply of credits. At the same time, companies appear to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51151-w\">lack incentives to prioritise high-quality credits</a>. It is therefore crucial to implement better evaluation and clearer labelling of high-quality credits.</p> <p>The lack of credibility in carbon credits is not inevitable. Cop29 is a step in the right direction, but it is imperative to intensify transparency requirements and deeply reform evaluation methods to restore full legitimacy to these mechanisms.<br><strong>Philippe Delacote</strong><br><em>Research director, INRAE, and climate economics chair</em><br><strong>Tara L\u2019Horty</strong><br><em>PhD candidate at INRAE, and climate economics chair</em><br><strong>Anna Creti</strong><br><em>Professor, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Dauphine PSL, and climate economics chair</em><br><strong>Andreas Kontoleon</strong><br><em>Professor of environmental economics and public policy, University of Cambridge</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

The overall picture therefore remains bleak, and the main chance of improvement would be a significant reduction in energy production and use in the global north, and in China. Unfortunately, the economic dogma of GDP growth makes this impossible. Steve Brown Fontenay-sous-Bois, France \u2022 Patrick Greenfield\u2019s article highlights how states in Cop29 agreed to establish new common rules for the development of carbon credit markets (24 November). Yet several persistent challenges undermine the credibility of these reformed markets. We believe two major areas of improvement must be addressed to restore this credibility. The first is greater transparency, which is is one of the methodological requirements of Article 6.4 accepted at COP 29. It encourages transparency in data sources, calculations and monitoring methods used to establish estimates, including those related to the reference scenario, the project\u2019s additionality compared to its effectiveness in reducing emissions, and potential carbon leakages. The supervisory body for Article 6.4 is responsible for ensuring transparency in certification methodologies. But efforts must go further. It is essential to disclose corporate transactions of carbon credits, as well as the distribution of revenues throughout the value chain. Such transparency would allow better evaluation of the real impact of offset projects and address accusations of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d. Solutions such as digital platforms, regulations facilitating carbon credit tracking, publication of exchange prices, and standardised information could fulfil this critical need for transparency. The second area to be addressed is that the reliability of reference scenarios used to calculate credits must be supported by robust statistical methods. These would allow for more precise reference scenarios, thereby strengthening the robustness and legitimacy of carbon credits. However, these methods increase risks for project developers and may reduce the supply of credits. At the same time, companies appear to lack incentives to prioritise high-quality credits. It is therefore crucial to implement better evaluation and clearer labelling of high-quality credits. The lack of credibility in carbon credits is not inevitable. Cop29 is a step in the right direction, but it is imperative to intensify transparency requirements and deeply reform evaluation methods to restore full legitimacy to these mechanisms.

Ian Harvey, a former medical director at the Countess of Chester hospital, told the Thirlwall inquiry he wished he had contacted the police nearly a year before they were informed. Beginning his evidence at Liverpool town hall on Thursday, Harvey said: \u201cI am sorry for the hurt that has been caused to the parents and the families of the babies. I extend that to the parents of the babies who were subject of the reviews but didn\u2019t feature in the trial and aren\u2019t part of this inquiry.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was only ever my desire to have a safe hospital and to be able to tell the parents what happened on the neonatal unit and if I failed in those aims I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d The inquiry, chaired by Lady Justice Thirlwall, is examining events surrounding the murder of seven babies and attempted murder of seven others by Letby between June 2015 and June 2016. Speaking for the first time about the case, Harvey said he should have contacted the police after the death of two newborn triplets \u2013 the nurse\u2019s final two victims \u2013 at the end of June 2016, 10 months before detectives were informed. \u201cI am aware from all the documentation that in June, July 2016 I had expressed an opinion that we should approach the police and I sincerely regret that we didn\u2019t at that time,\u201d he told the inquiry. Harvey, who took early retirement weeks before Letby was arrested in 2018, said he was \u201cnot comfortable\u201d with the 10-month delay although he could \u201cunderstand why we did what we did\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced, based on the communications and conversations we had with police nearly a year later, that they would necessarily have acted at that point. But I have to accept that there would have been potential for oversight or advice with regard to the reviews we undertook, and the possibility that they could have stepped in sooner should something have been found.\u201d The parents of babies murdered by Letby have accused Harvey and other bosses of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in her crimes by failing to inform them there were concerns that their children had been harmed. The former medical director and fellow executives have also been accused of a lack of transparency with regulators for failing to inform the Care Quality Commission about the rise in neonatal mortality during its inspection in February 2016. Asked by Rachel Langdale KC, the counsel to the inquiry, whether he believed he had failed in his aims of being open with parents and overseeing a safe hospital, Harvey said: \u201cI think the simple fact that there was an increase in mortality is an indication that we got things wrong. I think I\u2019ve made clear in my statement that I failed in my communication to the families in the nature and the quality of the information that they were given.\u201d Letby was removed from the neonatal unit in July 2016 after the deaths of the triplet brothers, known in court as Child O and Child P. Executives were told at this time that consultant paediatricians suspected Letby had murdered babies and referred during meetings to other medical killers, Harold Shipman and Beverley Allitt. Harvey accepted that three reviews he commissioned in the weeks after Letby\u2019s removal were not sufficient as they were unable to detect whether any crime had been committed. \u201cI accept they didn\u2019t go to the level of a forensic investigation and in hindsight that was incorrect,\u201d he said. The inquiry heard that Tony Chambers, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, went on to tell the hospital\u2019s board of directors that the allegations against Letby were unsubstantiated based on these reviews. The board of directors agreed on this basis that she could return to the neonatal unit, although she never did. Peter Skelton KC, representing the families of several of Letby\u2019s victims, said it was an \u201cextraordinary failure\u201d that Harvey had allowed the board to sign off the nurse\u2019s return to the unit even though the reviews had not excluded deliberate harm. \u201cI believe I was making these statements in good faith based on the evidence I had at that time,\u201d Harvey said. Skelton said it was \u201cirresponsible and dangerous\u201d to return Letby to the unit because he could not be confident that she would not harm children again. \u201cI would have to accept that with retrospect that it would have been a risk \u2013 well, more of a risk \u2013 for her to go back on to the unit,\u201d Harvey said. Harvey will continue his evidence on Friday.",

Firs, spruces and pines are the most common types, and the thick, bushy branches and slow-dropping needles of the Nordmann fir make it among the most popular. </p> <p>The British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA) advises finding one grown nearby. Its website has a useful <a href=\"https://www.bctga.co.uk/onlinedirectory\">search tool</a> where you can find local suppliers by postcode and the types of trees on offer. The Soil Association also has a handy <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/take-action/organic-living/christmas/eco-friendly-christmas-trees-real-vs-fake/\">guide</a> to how to source a local, sustainable and organic Christmas tree, with an explainer on what all the different certifications and labels mean.</p> <p>\u201cLook for one that is fresh \u2013 check the needles, they should be flexible, and the tree should have a vibrant colour \u2013 with good overall symmetry,\u201d says Mairi Devlin, head of Christmas at B&amp;Q. And don\u2019t forget to take care of the tree once it\u2019s home. \u201cHelp it rehydrate \u2013 don\u2019t forget to cut an inch off the base of the tree and stand in a bucket of fresh water overnight. When thinking about where to place it indoors, keep the tree away from fireplaces, radiators and direct sunlight to help it last longer.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Cost<br></strong>Expect to pay between \u00a325 and \u00a365 for a 6ft (1.8m) fir tree, the BCTGA advises. Supermarket trees tend to be much cheaper, often available only in stores or for click-and-collect.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability</strong><strong><br></strong>Growing real trees provides many environmental benefits, from the absorption and storage of CO2 to habitat provision, explains <a href=\"https://grantham.sheffield.ac.uk/team/stuart-walker/\">Dr Stuart Walker</a>, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield. But when it comes to assessing their environmental impact, he says, \u201cit\u2019s never quite that simple\u201d.</p> <p>If excessive fertilisers are used, or real trees are transported particularly long distances, environmental impacts significantly increase, Walker says. Studying the comparative impact of a 6.6ft (2m) real Christmas tree against an artificial one, he found that opting for a living tree was the best option, but failing that, using the same tree as many times as possible was crucial.</p> <p>Make sure it\u2019s grown sustainably by looking for either the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Soil Association logo, advises <a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/about/21-ecofriendly-christmas-tips\">Friends of the Earth</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/christmas\">FSC-certified trees</a> are grown in a responsibly managed way and often minimise pesticide use. The Soil Association recommends sourcing Christmas trees from an organic, independent retailer or farm shop, as it says these providers are more likely to opt for growers who avoid pesticides. It has a helpful <a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/take-action/organic-living/buy-organic/find-your-local-independent-retailer/\">list of independent retailers and farm shops</a>, broken down by region.</p> <p>Once the festivities are over, you\u2019ll need to dispose of your tree. Depending on where you live, this could involve lugging it to a collection point, leaving it out on the street for the council to pick up, or breaking it down for a garden waste bin.</p> <p>Trees that are sent to landfill will produce methane gas, which is <a href=\"https://www.carbontrust.com/news-and-insights/news/the-carbon-trusts-tips-for-a-more-sustainable-christmas-0#:~:text=If%20a%20tree%20is%20sent,dioxide%2C%20creating%20a%20larger%20footprint.\">25 times more potent</a> than carbon dioxide, as it decomposes, says the Carbon Trust. Instead, it advises having your Christmas tree chipped. It\u2019s worth looking into how your local council disposes of Christmas trees because it can differ by area.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Best real Christmas trees</strong></h2> <p><strong>Suitable for: </strong>a house with plenty of space</p>    <p><strong>120cm-150cm small </strong><strong>Nordmann</strong><strong> fir</strong><strong>, \u00a320</strong><strong><br></strong><em><strong>(B&amp;Q gives \u00a31 to Shelter for each tree sold)<br></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.diy.com/departments/120-150cm-nordmann-fir-small-full-cut-christmas-tree/5059340130620_BQ.prd\"><sub>diy.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>5ft-6ft </strong><strong>Nordmann</strong><strong> fir, \u00a349.99</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.dobbies.com/5-6ft-fresh-cut-nordmann-fir-real-christmas-tree-150-180cm/5637327658.p\"><sub>dobbies.com</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Potted Christmas trees</strong></h2>    <p>***</p> <p><strong>What you need to know<br></strong>Potted trees are generally smaller than cut ones because this makes them easier to move. There\u2019s also a limit to how long a tree is happy in a pot \u2013 Patch Plants, which sells them, suggests keeping your tree potted until it gets to about 6ft. You\u2019ll need some outside space, however small, if you want to keep your spruce for the following year.</p> <p>Potted Christmas trees need more watering and attention than fresh-cut trees, says Devlin of B&amp;Q. And it\u2019s worth considering whether you have the time, space and inclination to care for one year-round.</p> <p>Look for trees labelled as \u201cpot grown\u201d rather than \u201cpotted\u201d: the latter tend to have been dug up from a field, which can result in root damage and a short lifespan.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t hold on to the tree, disposal through garden waste or composting is more sustainable than sending it to landfill.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability</strong><strong><br></strong>Potted trees don\u2019t need to be thrown away at the end of the festive season, but the environmental impact depends on whether they are produced locally or imported, and how they are produced.</p> <p>Michael Dariane, operations director at London-based florist <a href=\"https://bloominghaus.com/\">Blooming Haus</a>, says another benefit of potted Christmas trees is their contribution to carbon absorption during their lifecycle. Repotting them after the festive season preserves the tree\u2019s life and reduces waste, he adds.</p> <p><strong>Cost<br></strong>Prices for a potted Christmas tree can range from about \u00a310 to \u00a315 for a tabletop version to between \u00a350 and \u00a390 for more substantial options. </p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Best potted Christmas trees</strong></h2> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> a flat or small house with outdoor space</p>    <p><strong>Pot grown Norway spruce, \u00a355 for 80-100cm tree<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.patchplants.com/gb/en/plants/pot-grown-norway-spruce-1209/\"><sub>patchplants.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>Pot grown </strong><strong>Serbian spruce</strong><strong>, \u00a320 for </strong><strong>100-125cm</strong><strong> tree</strong><strong><br></strong><em><strong>(B&amp;Q gives \u00a31 to Shelter for each tree sold)</strong></em><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.diy.com/departments/100-125cm-serbian-spruce-pyramid-pot-grown-christmas-tree/5063022058294_BQ.prd\"><sub>diy.com</sub></a><br><strong>Pot grown Korean fir, from \u00a347.99</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.jacksonsnurseries.co.uk/korean-fir-pot-grown-christmas-tree.html\"><sub>jacksonsnurseries.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Rented Christmas trees</strong></h2>    <p>***</p> <p><strong>What you need to know<br></strong>Rented, real trees are also usually pot grown, and perfect for those who prefer a real Christmas tree but don\u2019t want to buy a cut tree that needs disposing of come the new year.</p> <p>As well as specific Christmas tree rental companies, such as <a href=\"https://www.greenelftrees.co.uk/\">Green Elf Trees</a>, <a href=\"https://ecochristmastrees.co.uk/\">Lake District Eco Christmas Trees</a><strong> </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.londonchristmastreerental.com/\">London Christmas Tree Rental</a>, some garden centres and nurseries offer Christmas tree hire services over the festive period. <a href=\"https://lanjeth.co.uk/rent-a-tree/\">Lanjeth Nursery</a> in Cornwall, the <a href=\"https://www.thewalledgardenherts.com/\">Walled Garden</a> in Hertfordshire and <a href=\"https://www.rudiesroots.co.uk/xmas-tree-hire\">Rudies Roots Nurseries</a> in Lincolnshire are worth checking out.</p> <p>A rental tree is a good option for those without storage space or a large garden. Suppliers often provide a rollover service, so you can get the same tree back next year, and see how it\u2019s grown. </p> <p>A living tree requires care, so factor this in if you plan to travel during the Christmas holidays. London Christmas Tree Rental advises giving trees a pint of water daily, and against placing them in front of a radiator. You should also raise the pot off the floor if you have underfloor heating.</p> <p>While the availability of Christmas tree rentals has increased, they\u2019re not as readily available as cut or artificial Christmas trees. Many rental services will ask you to reserve a specific type and height of tree, with the most popular options being snapped up quickly.</p> <p><strong>Cost<br></strong>Rental Christmas trees are not cheap. That can be somewhat explained by the costs brands face in growing and maintaining them \u2013 from the labour involved in caring for them year-round to transporting them from the farm and back again.</p> <p>The price can vary depending on the height of the tree, the rental company and whether you need it delivered. You also have to factor in a refundable deposit, which is taken as a guarantee that the tree will be returned in a healthy state. Although the cost of renting a tree for the festive season can differ a fair bit, expect to pay between \u00a330 and \u00a360.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability</strong><strong><br></strong>Renting a Christmas tree preserves its life because it is returned and continues to grow after the festive season. In Dariane\u2019s opinion, it is a \u201cmore sustainable option than single-use trees\u201d.</p> <p>Try to shop with local suppliers with eco-friendly practices to minimise transport emissions, says Dariane. And look for the FSC or Soil Association logo.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2><strong>Best rental Christmas trees</strong></h2> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> city dwellers with no car</p>    <p><strong>Dancer 150-160cm pot grown tree, \u00a3119.99 (price includes collection and replanting)<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.greenelftrees.co.uk/collections/main-shop/products/pot-grown-christmas-tree-rental\"><sub>greenelftrees.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>Windermere 150cm tree, \u00a350<br></strong><a href=\"https://ecochristmastrees.co.uk/online-store/ols/products/5ft-tree\"><sub>ecochristmastrees.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>Mr Kensington 90cm tree, \u00a345<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.londonchristmastreerental.com/collections/all-rental-christmas-trees/products/mr-kensington-3ft\"><sub>londonchristmastreerental.com</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Tips for buying an artificial Christmas tree</strong></h2>    <p>***</p> <p><strong>What you need to know<br></strong>Artificial Christmas trees have come a long way from sad, pale imitations of the real thing. You can now choose anything from realistic-looking natural models all the way through to trend-led pastel topiaries, trees covered in fake snow or decorations and those with in-built fairy lights.</p> <p>Be warned, though: the all-singing, all-dancing trees may not stand the test of time. If the lights go or your taste in decorations changes, will you still want to roll it out each year?</p> <p>Artificial trees can work out cheaper than buying a real one each year, and many people don\u2019t miss the fuss of cleaning up dropped needles.</p> <p>\u201cWhen buying an artificial Christmas tree, consider trees with a strong base and hinged branches for stability and an easy setup,\u201d says B&amp;Q\u2019s Devlin. \u201cAnd for longevity, store the tree properly back in its box in a cool, dry location.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Sustainability factor<br></strong>The <a href=\"https://www.carbontrust.com/news-and-insights/news/the-carbon-trusts-tips-for-a-more-sustainable-christmas-0\">Carbon Trust</a> says an artificial tree used over seven to 20 years (depending on the weight and materials used) results in fewer emissions than buying a new, commercially grown tree every year.</p> <p>The manufacture of the plastic from oil creates most \u2013 about two-thirds \u2013 of artificial trees\u2019 carbon emissions, according to the Carbon Trust. But if other environmental impacts, such as ecotoxicity <strong>\u2013 </strong>biological, chemical or physical stressors that affect ecosystems \u2013 are considered, says the University of Sheffield\u2019s Walker, they fall behind real trees. Dariane of Blooming Haus puts it succinctly: \u201cIf opting for a fake tree, everyone should consider the longevity of use and weigh it against the inability to recycle at the end of its life.\u201d</p> <p>The Carbon Trust says the carbon footprint of a 6.5ft artificial tree is equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is incinerated. Reusing an artificial Christmas tree year after year can avoid the annual environmental impacts of transport and disposal associated with real trees, says Dariane.</p> <p>The wear and tear of artificial Christmas trees over the years is a source of microplastics that can pollute indoor air quality and end up in sewage water and from there to rivers and seas, says Feliciano.</p> <p><strong>Cost<br></strong>Artificial Christmas trees vary hugely in price, from about \u00a310 for a basic style to upwards of \u00a3800 for a plush option. The larger and more realistic looking the artificial Christmas tree, the higher up the price scale it is generally. </p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Best artificial Christmas trees</strong></h2> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> those on a budget, and with storage space</p> <p>Try <a href=\"https://www.ilovefreegle.org/\">Freegle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.freecycle.org/\">Freecycle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.XChristmas+tree.TRS0&amp;_nkw=Christmas+tree&amp;_sacat=0\">eBay</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gumtree.com/\">Gumtree</a> for pre-loved artificial trees.

And don\u2019t forget to take care of the tree once it\u2019s home. \u201cHelp it rehydrate \u2013 don\u2019t forget to cut an inch off the base of the tree and stand in a bucket of fresh water overnight. When thinking about where to place it indoors, keep the tree away from fireplaces, radiators and direct sunlight to help it last longer.\u201d Cost Expect to pay between \u00a325 and \u00a365 for a 6ft (1.8m) fir tree, the BCTGA advises. Supermarket trees tend to be much cheaper, often available only in stores or for click-and-collect. Sustainability Growing real trees provides many environmental benefits, from the absorption and storage of CO2 to habitat provision, explains Dr Stuart Walker, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures at the University of Sheffield. But when it comes to assessing their environmental impact, he says, \u201cit\u2019s never quite that simple\u201d. If excessive fertilisers are used, or real trees are transported particularly long distances, environmental impacts significantly increase, Walker says. Studying the comparative impact of a 6.6ft (2m) real Christmas tree against an artificial one, he found that opting for a living tree was the best option, but failing that, using the same tree as many times as possible was crucial. Make sure it\u2019s grown sustainably by looking for either the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or Soil Association logo, advises Friends of the Earth. FSC-certified trees are grown in a responsibly managed way and often minimise pesticide use. The Soil Association recommends sourcing Christmas trees from an organic, independent retailer or farm shop, as it says these providers are more likely to opt for growers who avoid pesticides. It has a helpful list of independent retailers and farm shops, broken down by region. Once the festivities are over, you\u2019ll need to dispose of your tree. Depending on where you live, this could involve lugging it to a collection point, leaving it out on the street for the council to pick up, or breaking it down for a garden waste bin. Trees that are sent to landfill will produce methane gas, which is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide, as it decomposes, says the Carbon Trust. Instead, it advises having your Christmas tree chipped. It\u2019s worth looking into how your local council disposes of Christmas trees because it can differ by area. *** Best real Christmas trees Suitable for: a house with plenty of space 120cm-150cm small Nordmann fir, \u00a320 (B&amp;Q gives \u00a31 to Shelter for each tree sold) diy.com 5ft-6ft Nordmann fir, \u00a349.99 dobbies.com *** Potted Christmas trees *** What you need to know Potted trees are generally smaller than cut ones because this makes them easier to move. There\u2019s also a limit to how long a tree is happy in a pot \u2013 Patch Plants, which sells them, suggests keeping your tree potted until it gets to about 6ft. You\u2019ll need some outside space, however small, if you want to keep your spruce for the following year. Potted Christmas trees need more watering and attention than fresh-cut trees, says Devlin of B&amp;Q. And it\u2019s worth considering whether you have the time, space and inclination to care for one year-round. Look for trees labelled as \u201cpot grown\u201d rather than \u201cpotted\u201d: the latter tend to have been dug up from a field, which can result in root damage and a short lifespan. If you can\u2019t hold on to the tree, disposal through garden waste or composting is more sustainable than sending it to landfill. Sustainability Potted trees don\u2019t need to be thrown away at the end of the festive season, but the environmental impact depends on whether they are produced locally or imported, and how they are produced. Michael Dariane, operations director at London-based florist Blooming Haus, says another benefit of potted Christmas trees is their contribution to carbon absorption during their lifecycle. Repotting them after the festive season preserves the tree\u2019s life and reduces waste, he adds. Cost Prices for a potted Christmas tree can range from about \u00a310 to \u00a315 for a tabletop version to between \u00a350 and \u00a390 for more substantial options. *** Best potted Christmas trees Suitable for: a flat or small house with outdoor space Pot grown Norway spruce, \u00a355 for 80-100cm tree patchplants.com Pot grown Serbian spruce, \u00a320 for 100-125cm tree (B&amp;Q gives \u00a31 to Shelter for each tree sold) diy.com Pot grown Korean fir, from \u00a347.99 jacksonsnurseries.co.uk *** Rented Christmas trees *** What you need to know Rented, real trees are also usually pot grown, and perfect for those who prefer a real Christmas tree but don\u2019t want to buy a cut tree that needs disposing of come the new year. As well as specific Christmas tree rental companies, such as Green Elf Trees, Lake District Eco Christmas Trees and London Christmas Tree Rental, some garden centres and nurseries offer Christmas tree hire services over the festive period. Lanjeth Nursery in Cornwall, the Walled Garden in Hertfordshire and Rudies Roots Nurseries in Lincolnshire are worth checking out. A rental tree is a good option for those without storage space or a large garden. Suppliers often provide a rollover service, so you can get the same tree back next year, and see how it\u2019s grown. A living tree requires care, so factor this in if you plan to travel during the Christmas holidays. London Christmas Tree Rental advises giving trees a pint of water daily, and against placing them in front of a radiator. You should also raise the pot off the floor if you have underfloor heating. While the availability of Christmas tree rentals has increased, they\u2019re not as readily available as cut or artificial Christmas trees. Many rental services will ask you to reserve a specific type and height of tree, with the most popular options being snapped up quickly. Cost Rental Christmas trees are not cheap. That can be somewhat explained by the costs brands face in growing and maintaining them \u2013 from the labour involved in caring for them year-round to transporting them from the farm and back again. The price can vary depending on the height of the tree, the rental company and whether you need it delivered. You also have to factor in a refundable deposit, which is taken as a guarantee that the tree will be returned in a healthy state. Although the cost of renting a tree for the festive season can differ a fair bit, expect to pay between \u00a330 and \u00a360. Sustainability Renting a Christmas tree preserves its life because it is returned and continues to grow after the festive season. In Dariane\u2019s opinion, it is a \u201cmore sustainable option than single-use trees\u201d. Try to shop with local suppliers with eco-friendly practices to minimise transport emissions, says Dariane. And look for the FSC or Soil Association logo. *** Best rental Christmas trees Suitable for: city dwellers with no car Dancer 150-160cm pot grown tree, \u00a3119.99 (price includes collection and replanting) greenelftrees.co.uk Windermere 150cm tree, \u00a350 ecochristmastrees.co.uk Mr Kensington 90cm tree, \u00a345 londonchristmastreerental.com *** Tips for buying an artificial Christmas tree *** What you need to know Artificial Christmas trees have come a long way from sad, pale imitations of the real thing. You can now choose anything from realistic-looking natural models all the way through to trend-led pastel topiaries, trees covered in fake snow or decorations and those with in-built fairy lights. Be warned, though: the all-singing, all-dancing trees may not stand the test of time. If the lights go or your taste in decorations changes, will you still want to roll it out each year? Artificial trees can work out cheaper than buying a real one each year, and many people don\u2019t miss the fuss of cleaning up dropped needles. \u201cWhen buying an artificial Christmas tree, consider trees with a strong base and hinged branches for stability and an easy setup,\u201d says B&amp;Q\u2019s Devlin. \u201cAnd for longevity, store the tree properly back in its box in a cool, dry location.\u201d Sustainability factor The Carbon Trust says an artificial tree used over seven to 20 years (depending on the weight and materials used) results in fewer emissions than buying a new, commercially grown tree every year. The manufacture of the plastic from oil creates most \u2013 about two-thirds \u2013 of artificial trees\u2019 carbon emissions, according to the Carbon Trust. But if other environmental impacts, such as ecotoxicity \u2013 biological, chemical or physical stressors that affect ecosystems \u2013 are considered, says the University of Sheffield\u2019s Walker, they fall behind real trees. Dariane of Blooming Haus puts it succinctly: \u201cIf opting for a fake tree, everyone should consider the longevity of use and weigh it against the inability to recycle at the end of its life.\u201d The Carbon Trust says the carbon footprint of a 6.5ft artificial tree is equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is incinerated. Reusing an artificial Christmas tree year after year can avoid the annual environmental impacts of transport and disposal associated with real trees, says Dariane. The wear and tear of artificial Christmas trees over the years is a source of microplastics that can pollute indoor air quality and end up in sewage water and from there to rivers and seas, says Feliciano. Cost Artificial Christmas trees vary hugely in price, from about \u00a310 for a basic style to upwards of \u00a3800 for a plush option. The larger and more realistic looking the artificial Christmas tree, the higher up the price scale it is generally. *** Best artificial Christmas trees Suitable for: those on a budget, and with storage space Try Freegle, Freecycle, eBay or Gumtree for pre-loved artificial trees.

      "bodyText": "Romania\u2019s top court has ordered a recount of votes in the first round of the country\u2019s presidential election to rule out fraud. The presidential office said separately that officials had detected online efforts to influence the vote, which was won by a little-known far-right candidate. The court said on Thursday it had decided unanimously to order Romania\u2019s central electoral bureau to \u201crecheck and recount all valid and invalid ballots\u201d cast in Sunday\u2019s election, won by the Moscow-friendly ultranationalist C\u0103lin Georgescu. The presidency said officials had reported \u201ccyberattacks aimed at influencing the correctness of the electoral process\u201d in Sunday\u2019s vote and noted \u201ca growing interest\u201d on the part of Russia \u201cto influence the public agenda in Romanian society\u201d. In a statement issued after a meeting of the Supreme Council of National Defence, the presidency also alleged that the social media platform TikTok had not respected legal rules regulating the electoral process. Without naming Georgescu, the statement suggested he \u201cbenefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment\u201d granted by the platform, which \u201cdid not mark him as a political candidate\u201d. It added that \u201cnecessary steps\u201d should be taken. TikTok has previously dismissed such allegations, saying it enforces guidelines against election misinformation and most candidates campaigned on its platform and on others. A spokesperson on Thursday said in reference to Georgescu\u2019s account: \u201cIt is categorically false to claim that his account was treated differently from those of other candidates.\u201d The news website Digi24 reported that the constitutional court\u2019s recount order related to an allegation of fraud over votes awarded to the centre-right candidate Elena Lasconi, who finished second and is due to face Georgescu in the runoff on 8 December. That complaint called for the court to annul the first-round result, something it will decide on at a meeting on Friday. A separate allegation of electoral fraud made against Georgescu was rejected on the grounds that it was submitted too late. The central election bureau was to meet later on Thursday to discuss the court\u2019s ruling, but its president, Toni Grebl\u0103, told Romanian media that once the official request had been received it could take days to recount the roughly 9.5m votes. Observers have said the ruling risks diminishing the credibility of Romania\u2019s state institutions in the run up to the parliamentary ballot and presidential runoff, viewed as critical to the future direction of a hitherto reliable EU and Nato ally. It will also add to the turmoil surrounding the first round of voting, which Georgescu, who was polling at about 5% days before the vote, won comfortably after a campaign heavily based on viral TikTok videos reportedly boosted by bot-like activity. On Wednesday, the deputy head of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator, Ancom, said it was calling for the suspension of TikTok, a Chinese-owned platform, from Thursday, pending an investigation into possible election manipulation. Pavel Popescu said the call was based on evidence of \u201cmanipulation of the electoral process\u201d. Romania\u2019s national defence council is also analysing potential national security risks from \u201ccyber state and non-state entities\u201d in the electoral process. In addition, the national audiovisual council, CNA, has called on the European Commission to investigate TikTok\u2019s role, saying it suspected \u201cmanipulation of public opinion\u201d and \u201calgorithmic amplification\u201d of posts favouring a particular candidate. In October, the constitutional court banned another far-right politician from running in the presidential election in a decision that many analysts, civil rights groups and some political parties said had overstepped its powers. Lasconi on Thursday condemned the court\u2019s decision, saying it was \u201cinterfering in the democratic process for the second time\u201d. She added: \u201cOne combats extremism through votes, not backstage games.\u201d Georgescu has called for an end to the war in Ukraine, denied the existence of Covid-19, described two second world war-era Romanian fascists as \u201cnational heroes\u201d and claimed that in foreign affairs Romania would benefit from \u201cRussian wisdom\u201d.",

Gidon Kremer, now in his late 70s, has long championed Weinberg\u2019s music; others might bring more muscle to the solo part, but his sweet tone made the quieter lines sing and the performance had its own mournful integrity.

      "bodyText": "Sweden has announced that it has sent a formal request to China for cooperation over the suspected sabotage of two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea. The prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said on Thursday that Swedish authorities were seeking \u201cclarity\u201d from China about what happened to the two fibre-optic cables between Finland and Germany and Sweden and Lithuania last week. \u201cToday I can tell you that we have additionally sent a formal request to work together with Swedish authorities to get clarity about what has happened,\u201d he said in a press conference. \u201cWe expect China will choose to work together as we have requested.\u201d It comes amid speculation about the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3, which sailed over the cables at about the time they were severed and has remained anchored since 19 November in the Kattegat strait between Sweden and Denmark, where it is being monitored by multiple vessels, including the Danish navy. Sweden, which is leading the investigation, has declined to comment on the claims and China\u2019s foreign ministry has denied any responsibility. The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators suspect the crew of the Chinese vessel deliberately severed the cables last week by dragging an anchor along the seabed for more than 100 miles. The Swedish police and prosecutor declined to comment on the claim, saying they had nothing to add to Wednesday\u2019s statements when they announced that the crime scene investigations of the two cables had been completed and that analysis was continuing. The Swedish navy and coastguard also declined to comment. The absence of any seismic signals to indicate explosions, as there were with the Nord Stream and Balticconnector pipelines, could support the theory that the damage was caused by an anchor, Norsar, the Norwegian national datacentre for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, said. Kj\u00f8lv Egeland, a senior researcher at Norsar, said: \u201cThere was no explosion or seismic signal at all, so that could be consistent with this anchor theory.\u201d The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which carried natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, were damaged in explosions in September 2022. In August this year it was claimed that the explosions were the work of a small Ukrainian sabotage team but this was denied by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In a subsequent incident in the Baltic, in October 2023, the Balticconnector gas pipeline was extensively damaged. Finnish investigators recovered a large ship\u2019s anchor near the spot which was linked to a Chinese container vessel, NewNew Polar Bear. The Swedish prosecutor said: \u201cThe cable between Sweden and Lithuania, which is owned by a Swedish company, was damaged on 17 November. The cable between Finland and Germany, located south of the Sweden-Lithuania cable, was damaged a number of hours later. Both damage sites are located within the Swedish economic zone.\u201d Finnish police said investigators at the crime scene investigation into the cable rupture site between Finland and Germany had collected cable samples for further analysis. They said the damage was being investigated as aggravated criminal damage and aggravated interference with communications. Kristersson said on Wednesday that the Baltic Sea was now a \u201chigh-risk\u201d zone as he met Nordic and Baltic leaders at a summit in Harpsund, Sweden. \u201cWe are aware that there is a high risk for different types of activities on the Baltic Sea that are dangerous,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cNow we are careful about not accusing anybody right now of anything. We don\u2019t know that this is sabotage. But we are investigating the matter very carefully.\u201d",

warnings from the Israeli military that they should stay away while its forces remained in the area. The Lebanese army asked displaced people to avoid frontline villages and towns near the <strong>UN</strong>-drawn blue line that separates the two countries.</p> \n  <p>The 60-day ceasefire agreement brokered by the <strong>US</strong> between Israel and Hezbollah came into force at 4am local time on Wednesday, and represents a major milestone in the 14-month-old conflict.</p> \n  <p>Here are some of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the \u201cfirst ray of hope\u201d in the regional conflict after the \u201cdarkness of the past months\u201d. </strong>\u201cIt is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,\u201d Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. </strong>Supporters of<strong> </strong>Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group\u2019s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah\u2019s ally, welcomed the end of Israel\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel\u2019s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army\u2019s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The French government has claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/france-says-netanyahu-is-immune-from-icc-warrant-as-israel-is-not-member-of-court\"> immunity from arrest warrants</a> issued by the international criminal court</strong> <strong>(ICC)</strong> for war crimes on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member.

The Israeli military announced a night-time curfew in south Lebanon on Thursday, a day after a ceasefire with Hezbollah began, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cIt is strictly forbidden to move or travel south of the Litani River starting from 5:00 pm (1500 GMT) until 7:00 am tomorrow (Friday). Those south of the Litani River must remain where they are,\u201d military spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said in a post on X. Israeli military says air force struck Hezbollah facility in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said on Thursday that the air force struck a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon, the first such attack since a ceasefire took effect on Wednesday morning. At least 21 Palestinians killed by Israeli strikes on Thursday, say medics. Israeli military strikes killed at least 21 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, medics said, as forces stepped up their bombardment of central areas and tanks pushed deeper into the north and south of the territory. Reuters reports that the escalation came a day after Israel and Hezbollah began a ceasefire in Lebanon, halting more than a year of hostilities and raising hopes among many Palestinians in Gaza for a similar deal with Hamas. Israeli foreign minister says \u2018no justification\u2019 for ICC to take steps against Israeli leaders. Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Thursday that the ICC had \u201cno justification\u201d for issuing arrests warrants for Israeli leaders, in a joint press conference with Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavsky. Saar told Reuters Israel has appealed against the decision and that it sets a dangerous precedent. Hezbollah MP says Israeli attacks on civilians violated ceasefire deal. Hezbollah member of parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, said on Thursday that Israel had violated a ceasefire deal by firing on civilians returning home to their villages along Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel, reports Reuters. \u201cThe Israeli enemy is attacking those returning to the border villages,\u201d Fadlallah told reporters after a parliament session, adding, \u201cthere are violations today by Israel, even in this form\u201d. Israeli tanks fire on southern Lebanon as officials says ceasefire with Hezbollah violated. Israeli tank fire hit six areas in southern Lebanon on Thursday and the Israeli military said its ceasefire with Hezbollah was breached after what it called suspects, some in vehicles, arrived at several areas in the southern zone, reports Reuters. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday under a deal brokered by the US and France, intended to allow people in both countries to start returning to homes in border areas. Palestinian president names interim successor if he has to leave post. Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has named a temporary successor who would take over from him should he die or leave his post, addressing concerns of a possible power vacuum after his departure. According to Reuters, in a statement released late on Wednesday, Abbas said the chair of the Palestinian National Council should serve as interim president for no more than 90 days, during which presidential elections should be held. A World Health Organization official voiced optimism on Thursday that some of the health facilities in Lebanon shuttered during more than a year of conflict would soon be operational again, if the ceasefire holds. \u201cProbably some of our hospitals will take some time, but some hospitals probably will be able to restart very quickly,\u201d Abdinasir Abubakar, WHO representative in Lebanon, told an online press conference after a damage assessment this week. \u201cSo we are very hopeful,\u201d he added, saying four hospitals in and around Beirut were among those that could restart quickly. Speaking at a joint news conference in Ankara with Oman\u2019s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said US president Joe Biden\u2019s announcement to launch a new initiative for a ceasefire in Gaza is a belated but important step. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said on Thursday that 3,961 people had been killed and 16,520 injured in more than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, including two months of all-out war. \u201cThe total number of dead and wounded since the start of the aggression until Tuesday reached 3,961 dead and 16,520 wounded,\u201d a ministry statement said, adding that the increased numbers were also due to \u201cdead being removed from under the rubble\u201d. At least 44,330 Palestinians have been killed and 104,933 injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The toll includes 48 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. Hezbollah has vowed to continue resisting Israel and is monitoring its army\u2019s withdrawal from south Lebanon \u201cwith their hands on the trigger\u201d, said the militia in its first comments since a ceasefire went into effect on Wednesday. The Iran-allied Shia group did not directly mention the truce, but said its fighters \u201cremain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy\u201d. Hezbollah also remained committed to the Palestinian cause, said the statement from its operations centre late on Wednesday. A 60-day staged withdrawal, in which Israel will pull out of Lebanon and Hezbollah will move its fighters and heavy weaponry out of a 16-mile (25km) deep boundary buffer zone, went into effect at 4am local time on Wednesday. Thousands of displaced people in Lebanon have packed up their belongings and attempted to return to their abandoned homes in the south amid contradictory statements from officials. Lebanon\u2019s speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, the top interlocutor for Lebanon in negotiating the deal, said that residents could return home, while Israel has warned them not to. The truce is designed to broker a permanent end to 14 months of fighting and violations will be monitored by a US-led supervisory mechanism, but the situation on the ground remains tense. Israeli tank fire hit three towns along the boundary on Thursday morning, Lebanese security sources and state media said, wounding two people. There was no immediate comment on the tank rounds from Hezbollah or Israel, who began fighting when the Lebanese militia started firing on its neighbour in solidarity with the Palestinian group Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Crucially, Hezbollah dropped its demand that a ceasefire was contingent on an end to fighting in Gaza. The Israeli military announced a night-time curfew in south Lebanon on Thursday, a day after a ceasefire with Hezbollah began, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cIt is strictly forbidden to move or travel south of the Litani River starting from 5:00 pm (1500 GMT) until 7:00 am tomorrow (Friday). Those south of the Litani River must remain where they are,\u201d military spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said in a post on X. The Israeli military said on Thursday that the air force struck a facility used by Hezbollah to store mid-range rockets in southern Lebanon, the first such attack since a ceasefire took effect on Wednesday morning. Reuters has a breaking news line on an Israeli military spokesperson saying that Israel had renewed a curfew for southern Lebanon residents, restricting movement south of Litani River. We will update with more informations as it comes in. The nuclear debate inside Iran is likely to shift towards the possession of its own weapons if the west goes ahead with a threat to reimpose all UN sanctions, the country\u2019s foreign minister has said. Seyed Abbas Araghchi said in an interview that Iran already had the capability and knowledge to create nuclear weapons, but said they did not form part of its security strategy. He also said Tehran was prepared to keep supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Western officials will be concerned by Araghchi\u2019s warning over the reimposition of sanctions, which were lifted when Iran signed the 2015 deal intended to limit its nuclear activities. Araghchi was appointed foreign minister by Iran\u2019s reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who was elected this year on a promise to improve Iran\u2019s economy by pursuing improved relations with the west. He was speaking in Lisbon before a meeting between Iranian and European negotiators in Geneva on Friday, which he described as a brainstorming session to see if there was a way out of their impasse. He admitted he was pessimistic about the meeting, saying he was not sure Iran was speaking to the right party. He said he believed European nations \u2013 chiefly the UK, Germany and France \u2013 were set on confrontation after a board meeting last week of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in which a European-tabled censure motion was passed saying Iran had failed to cooperate with inspectors and was building a uranium stockpile that had no peaceful civilian purpose. Araghchi claimed the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, had promised to forestall the censure motion after Iran offered to cap its uranium enrichment at 60% purity, as well as permit four nuclear inspectors to visit its nuclear sites. \u201cHe failed because the Europeans had decided on the course of confrontation,\u201d he said. Iranian Revolutionary Guards Brig General Kioumars Pourhashemi was killed in the Syrian province of Aleppo by \u201cterrorists\u201d linked to Israel, Iran\u2019s SNN news agency reported on Thursday without giving further details. Reuters reports that rebels led by militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on Wednesday launched an incursion into a dozen towns and villages in north-west Aleppo province controlled by Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Israeli military strikes killed at least 21 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, medics said, as forces stepped up their bombardment of central areas and tanks pushed deeper into the north and south of the territory. Reuters reports that the escalation came a day after Israel and Hezbollah began a ceasefire in Lebanon, halting more than a year of hostilities and raising hopes among many Palestinians in Gaza for a similar deal with Hamas. \u201cI hope a ceasefire will happen like it did in Lebanon \u2026 I just want to take my children to see my land, my house, to see what they did to us, I want to live in safety,\u201d Amal Abu Hmeid, a displaced woman in Gaza, told Reuters. \u201cGod willing we will have a truce,\u201d she said, sitting in the courtyard of a school sheltering displaced families in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. \u201c(Life) was beautiful (before the war) \u2026 Now there is nothing beautiful, it\u2019s all gone. Our houses are gone, our brothers are gone, and no one is left. Now we hardly get \u2026 one meal a day. We can\u2019t even get bread,\u201d Abu Hmeid told Reuters. Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, US president Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, urging Israel and Hamas to seize the moment. Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. Germany, France and the UK called on Israel to extend the indemnifications for essential services between Israeli and Palestinian banks for at least a year in a joint statement released by Berlin on Thursday. According to Reuters, in the statement, the foreign ministers of the three countries called on Israel to immediately extend the indemnifications as the deadline of 30 November approaches. \u201cThe issue of cross-border payments must not be leveraged to undermine the Palestinian Authorities,\u201d said the statement. Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Thursday that the ICC had \u201cno justification\u201d for issuing arrests warrants for Israeli leaders, in a joint press conference with Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavsky. Saar told Reuters Israel has appealed against the decision and that it sets a dangerous precedent. The foreign minister also said Israel would finish the war in Gaza when it \u201cachieves its objectives\u201d of returning hostages being held by Hamas and ensuring the group no longer controls the strip. According to Reuters, Saar said Israel does not intend to control civilian life in Gaza and that he believes peace is \u201cinevitable\u201d but cannot be based on \u201cillusions\u201d. Hezbollah member of parliament, Hassan Fadlallah, said on Thursday that Israel had violated a ceasefire deal by firing on civilians returning home to their villages along Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel, reports Reuters. \u201cThe Israeli enemy is attacking those returning to the border villages,\u201d Fadlallah told reporters after a parliament session, adding, \u201cthere are violations today by Israel, even in this form\u201d. The chair of the UK\u2019s international development committee has asked the foreign secretary, David Lammy, how the British government will respond to Israel\u2019s planned ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) which comes into effect on 28 January 2025. In a letter to Lammy, Sarah Champion wrote: Israel\u2019s effective legislative ban on Unrwa must not be allowed to be implemented. A ban would not only risk contravening numerous laws and obligations but would lead to an immediate, potentially irreparable, degradation in the living conditions of Palestinians.\u201d Last month, Israel\u2019s parliament passed bills banning Unrwa from operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories, designating it a terror organisation, and cutting all ties between the agency and the Israeli government. In her letter, Champion said that the new laws likely present a breach of several international obligations, including the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva conventions. It may also violate provisional rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on preventing genocide in Gaza, she said. Champion also asked Lammy what contingencies are in place if the legislation is implemented and what representations the foreign secretary had made to his Israeli counterparts on the impact of the laws. My colleagues, Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem, and Oliver Holmes have produced this explainer on what the terms of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire are. You can read more at the link below: Here is a video report on families returning to homes in Lebanon and northern Israel after the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire took effect: Israeli tank fire hit six areas in southern Lebanon on Thursday and the Israeli military said its ceasefire with Hezbollah was breached after what it called suspects, some in vehicles, arrived at several areas in the southern zone, reports Reuters. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday under a deal brokered by the US and France, intended to allow people in both countries to start returning to homes in border areas. The Israeli military had urged residents of towns along the border strip not to return yet for their own safety. On Thursday morning, Israeli tank fire hit six areas within that border strip, state media and Lebanese security sources said. The rounds struck Markaba, Wazzani and Kfarchouba, Khiyam, Taybe and the agricultural plains around Marjayoun, all of which lie within two kilometres of the blue line demarcating the border between Lebanon and Israel. One of the security sources said two people were injured in Markaba. Reuters reports that Lebanese families displaced from their homes near the southern border have tried to return to check on their properties. But Israeli troops remain stationed within Lebanese territory in towns along the border and Reuters reporters heard surveillance drones flying over parts of southern Lebanon. There was no immediate comment on the tank rounds from Hezbollah or Israel, said Reuters. Hezbollah has said its fighters \u201cremain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy.\u201d Its forces will monitor Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon \u201cwith their hands on the trigger\u201d, Reuters reports. Reuters is reporting that Israel\u2019s military have said that an arrival of suspects was detected in several areas in southern Lebanon, and called it a violation of a ceasefire with Hezbollah. More details soon \u2026 Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has named a temporary successor who would take over from him should he die or leave his post, addressing concerns of a possible power vacuum after his departure. According to Reuters, in a statement released late on Wednesday, Abbas said the chair of the Palestinian National Council should serve as interim president for no more than 90 days, during which presidential elections should be held. The current chair of the Palestinians\u2019 top decision-making body is Rawhi Fattouh, 75, who also served briefly as a stopgap leader after the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004. Abbas, 89, has been Palestinian president since 2005 and has had regular health problems in recent years, prompting repeated speculation on who would replace him when he finally stands aside. He does not have a deputy and a source told Reuters earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had pressed him to appoint one. Reuters reports that Wednesday\u2019s announcement clears up uncertainty over what should happen when he dies, but Fattouh was not named as his deputy, meaning there was still no visibility on who could replace Abbas in the long term. Israel\u2019s agriculture minister, Avi Dichter, a member of the inner security cabinet, told a group of foreign reporters this week that the Israeli army would take over the West Bank if someone from the militant group Hamas tried to become president. Abbas was elected to a four-year term in 2005, but no presidential ballot has been held since and he is now deeply unpopular, with a September opinion poll showing 89% of Palestinians in the West Bank wanted him to resign, reports Reuters. Israeli tank fire hit three towns along Lebanon\u2019s south-east border with Israel on Thursday, Lebanese security sources and state media said, a day after a ceasefire barring \u201coffensive military operations\u201d came into force. Reuters reports that tank fire struck Markaba, Wazzani and Kfarchouba, all of which lie within two kilometres of the blue line demarcating the border between Lebanon and Israel. According to the news agency, one of the security sources said two people were injured in Markaba. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday under a deal brokered by the US and France, intended to allow people in both countries to start returning to homes in border areas shattered by 14 months of fighting. But managing the returns have been complicated, reports Reuters. Israeli troops remain stationed within Lebanese territory in towns along the border, and on Thursday morning the Israeli military urged residents of towns along the border strip not to return yet for their own safety. The three towns hit on Thursday morning lie within that strip. Reuters said there was no immediate comment on the tank rounds from Hezbollah or Israel. Under the ceasefire terms, Israeli forces can take up to 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had instructed the military not to allow residents back to villages near the border. Lebanon\u2019s speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri, the top interlocutor for Lebanon in negotiating the deal, had said on Wednesday that residents could return home. Lebanon\u2019s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, set a 9 January date for the house to elect the country\u2019s president, the state news agency (NNA) reported on Thursday. For today\u2019s First Edition newsletter, Archie Bland spoke to the Guardian\u2019s William Christou, as he returned from a reporting trip to the southern border of Lebanon, about what he saw and what comes next after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. You can read the interview here: An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to arrive in Israel in an effort to reach a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal, writes the Times of Israel today. Citing the Hezbollah-linked al-Akhbar news outlet, the Times of Israel reports that officials from Cairo visting Tel Aviv are expected to present a \u201ccomprehensive vision\u201d for an agreement. It adds that al-Akhbar\u2019s report of the plans detail calls for a truce that will initially last a month or two and will see the gradual release of hostages, with first priority given to older captives or those who are sick, the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza to be quickly returned to operation (under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority, with Egyptian oversight), and an increase in humanitarian aid and medications for Gaza. The Times of Israel write: The report also says that Israel will initially be permitted to maintain its military positions within Gaza, but without carrying out operations. While not mentioned in the report, the potential deal is also assumed to include the release of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d In its first statement since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday, the Lebanese militia proclaimed \u201cvictory\u201d without making any direct mention of the ceasefire. The militia said its fighters \u201cremain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy\u201d and that its forces would monitor Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon \u201cwith their hands on the trigger\u201d. The statement came as thousands of people displaced from southern Lebanon began returning home despite warnings from the Israeli military that they should stay away while its forces remained in the area. The Lebanese army asked displaced people to avoid frontline villages and towns near the UN-drawn blue line that separates the two countries. The 60-day ceasefire agreement brokered by the US between Israel and Hezbollah came into force at 4am local time on Wednesday, and represents a major milestone in the 14-month-old conflict. Here are some of the latest developments: The UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the \u201cfirst ray of hope\u201d in the regional conflict after the \u201cdarkness of the past months\u201d. \u201cIt is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,\u201d Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. Supporters of Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group\u2019s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah\u2019s ally, welcomed the end of Israel\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel\u2019s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army\u2019s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire. The French government has claimed that Benjamin Netanyahu has immunity from arrest warrants issued by the international criminal court (ICC) for war crimes on the grounds that Israel is not an ICC member. The claim came soon after Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet agreed to a French-backed ceasefire in Lebanon and is in contrast to Paris\u2019s attitude towards last year\u2019s ICC war crimes warrant issued against Vladimir Putin, another leader of a non-member country. Netanyahu said Israel had submitted to the ICC its intention to appeal against the arrest warrants, and demand a delay in their implementation. In a statement from his office, he said: \u201cShould the ICC reject the appeal, this will underscore to Israel\u2019s friends in the US and around the world how biased the ICC is against the state of Israel.\u201d The ceasefire in Lebanon came after Israel launched the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city\u2019s centre. At least 42 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut and the south of Lebanon before the ceasefire began. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. In Gaza, the death toll passed 44,282 on Wednesday. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said an additional 104,880 Palestinians have been injured since October 2023. An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal. The US will renew a push for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, president Joe Biden said. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Two journalists were injured when Israeli forces \u201copened fire\u201d on a group of journalists covering a border town of Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Wednesday, Lebanon\u2019s National news agency said. A video journalist told AFP that he was shot at while reporting in Khiam and that it was clear that the group were journalists. The Biden administration is reportedly pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel. The package includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAMs) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs, Reuters reported.",

But \u00adscientists are concerned the metric \u00adunderestimates the stress athletes experience on the pitch because it considers only external heat and&nbsp;humidity.</p> <p>\u201cDuring intense physical activity, huge amounts of heat is produced by the work of the player\u2019s muscles,\u201d said Katarzyna Lindner-Cendrowska, a climate scientist at the Polish Academy of Sciences and lead author of the study. \u201c[This] will increase the overall heat load on the athlete\u2019s body.\u201d</p> <p>To overcome this, the researchers simulated temperatures that account for the players\u2019 speed and activity levels, as well as their clothing. They were only partly able to include the effects of exercise in the heat index.</p> <p>The highest \u201cwork rate\u201d that can be integrated into the heat index is roughly half that sustained by professional players during a competitive football match, said Julien P\u00e9riard, the deputy director of the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, who was not involved in the study. \u201cAlthough the approach used in the study is a step forward, the results likely underestimate the risk of experiencing extreme heat stress conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists found the greatest stress would strike between 2pm and 5pm at all but one of the stadiums. In Arlington and Houston, temperatures would rise above 50C during the mid to late afternoon and place a \u201cheavy burden on the body\u201d that could lead to heat exhaustion and even heatstroke, they found.</p> <p>Heatwaves have grown hotter, longer and more common as \u00adfossil fuel pollution has warmed the Earth\u2019s climate.

In April, the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to welcome Aramco to Fifa\u2019s family of global partners.</p> <p>To keep people safe from heat scientists recommend cutting fossil fuel pollution and adapting to a hotter planet. The research did not model the effects of air-conditioning, which was used outdoors in the 2022 men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar to keep players cool.</p> <p>P\u00e9riard, who has published research funded by Fifa on preventing heat stress, said the new study could help tournament organisers optimise the scheduling of matches but added that Fifa needed to \u201ctake action\u201d on their current policy of using the wet bulb index to decide on cooling and hydration breaks.</p> <p>He called for a football-specific heat stress policy that accounted for factors such as sweat and included actions such as extending half-time breaks and postponing matches.</p> <p>Thessa Beck, a climate and health researcher at ISGlobal, who was not involved in the study, said it was essential to keep fans safe. \u201cEven though fans may not be as physically active as players, many are older adults, young children or individuals with pre-existing conditions.\u201d</p>",

The co-author Marek Konefal, from Wroclaw University of Health and Sport Sciences in Poland, said World Cups would increasingly be played in conditions of strong heat stress as the climate got hotter. \u201cIt is worth rethinking the calendar of sporting events now.\u201d Football\u2019s governing body, Fifa, recommends matches include cooling breaks if the \u201cwet bulb\u201d temperature exceeds 32C. But scientists are concerned the metric underestimates the stress athletes experience on the pitch because it considers only external heat and humidity. \u201cDuring intense physical activity, huge amounts of heat is produced by the work of the player\u2019s muscles,\u201d said Katarzyna Lindner-Cendrowska, a climate scientist at the Polish Academy of Sciences and lead author of the study. \u201c[This] will increase the overall heat load on the athlete\u2019s body.\u201d To overcome this, the researchers simulated temperatures that account for the players\u2019 speed and activity levels, as well as their clothing. They were only partly able to include the effects of exercise in the heat index. The highest \u201cwork rate\u201d that can be integrated into the heat index is roughly half that sustained by professional players during a competitive football match, said Julien P\u00e9riard, the deputy director of the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise, who was not involved in the study. \u201cAlthough the approach used in the study is a step forward, the results likely underestimate the risk of experiencing extreme heat stress conditions.\u201d The scientists found the greatest stress would strike between 2pm and 5pm at all but one of the stadiums. In Arlington and Houston, temperatures would rise above 50C during the mid to late afternoon and place a \u201cheavy burden on the body\u201d that could lead to heat exhaustion and even heatstroke, they found. Heatwaves have grown hotter, longer and more common as fossil fuel pollution has warmed the Earth\u2019s climate. The 2026 Fifa Men\u2019s World Cup is sponsored by Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, and the 2034 World Cup may be hosted by its owner, Saudi Arabia. Last year, a report by the Climate Social Science Network found Saudi Arabia had played an outsized role in undermining progress at climate negotiations. \u201cThe fossil fuel giant has a 30-year record of obstruction and delay, protecting its national oil and gas sector and seeking to ensure UN climate talks achieve as little as possible, as slowly as possible,\u201d the authors wrote. Saudi Aramco and Fifa did not respond to requests for comment. In April, the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d to welcome Aramco to Fifa\u2019s family of global partners. To keep people safe from heat scientists recommend cutting fossil fuel pollution and adapting to a hotter planet. The research did not model the effects of air-conditioning, which was used outdoors in the 2022 men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar to keep players cool. P\u00e9riard, who has published research funded by Fifa on preventing heat stress, said the new study could help tournament organisers optimise the scheduling of matches but added that Fifa needed to \u201ctake action\u201d on their current policy of using the wet bulb index to decide on cooling and hydration breaks. He called for a football-specific heat stress policy that accounted for factors such as sweat and included actions such as extending half-time breaks and postponing matches. Thessa Beck, a climate and health researcher at ISGlobal, who was not involved in the study, said it was essential to keep fans safe. \u201cEven though fans may not be as physically active as players, many are older adults, young children or individuals with pre-existing conditions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Scottish government will reintroduce universal winter fuel payments for pensioners, in a bid to outstrip Labour ahead of the Holyrood elections. Nearly a million pensioners will benefit from the SNP government\u2019s mitigation after the Labour UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced her controversial policy to means-test winter fuel payments for older people, which is believed to be partly responsible for Scottish Labour\u2019s poll slump since the general election. Scotland\u2019s social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, told the Holyrood chamber on Thursday that the newly devolved pension age winter heating payment would go to \u201cevery single Scottish pensioner\u201d from next winter, pledging to \u201cprotect our pensioners from the harsh reality of a Labour government\u201d. Those in receipt of a qualifying benefit such as pension credit will continue to receive a payment of \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 depending on their age, while those who do not will get a lower flat rate of \u00a3100. The announcement comes a week after the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, sought to distance himself from Reeves\u2019s policy, which she insists was necessary to fill the \u201cblack hole\u201d in government finances left by the Conservatives. Sarwar pledged to reinstate universal winter fuel payments should his party win the 2026 Scottish parliament election. Sarwar said his plan would mean \u201ca fairer system\u201d for Scotland and show the public that \u201cwe have listened\u201d, adding he had been \u201cclear from the outset\u201d that he thought Reeves\u2019s pension credit threshold was too low and that he planned to reintroduce a universal payment for all pensioners, but tapered as child benefit is, so that wealthier people receive less. Winter fuel payment was set to be devolved to Scotland this year but, after Reeves\u2019s announcement in July, the Scottish government said it had no option but to delay until 2025 as it created a shortfall of \u00a3147m. In October, the UK budget saw a substantial increase in block grant funding of just under \u00a31.5bn, rising to \u00a33.4bn next year. Somerville also told MSPs that \u201cwe will not abandon older people this winter\u201d, announcing an additional \u00a320m for the Scottish welfare fund to be distributed to councils this year, which she said was \u201cthe quickest way\u201d. The new benefit, which is estimated to cost \u00a390m, was announced ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s Scottish budget and anticipated heavy cuts. Responding to the announcement, Liz Smith of the Scottish Conservatives suggested Somerville was \u201choodwinking\u201d pensioners when budget constraints were of the Scottish government\u2019s own making.",

The Reform UK leader was speaking as he unveiled the former Conservative minister Andrea Jenkyns as the latest recruit to Reform UK, announcing she would be the party\u2019s candidate for mayor of Lincolnshire. Responding to questions about the assisted dying bill, which he will vote against, Farage said parliament should be allowed more time \u201cto debate things that people at home talk about\u201d. \u201cIs 24 weeks right for abortion given that we now save babies at 22?\u201d he said. \u201cThat to me would be worthy of a debate in parliament but should that be along party lines? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advistory Service, said: \u201cDespite what anti-abortion campaigns would have MPs think, rolling back women\u2019s hard-won rights is not what people at home are interested in.\u201d Louise McCudden, the head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, a sexual and reproductive health services provider,, said: \u201cCalls to reduce the time limits are based on ideology and are not supported by clinical evidence. If MPs are going to debate anything on this issue, it should be reforming our Victorian abortion laws which leave women threatened with prison for making decisions about our own bodies.\u201d McCudden said the most common circumstances that MSI saw leading to an abortion at 22 weeks or later involved unexpected health risks during a wanted pregnancy and foetal anomalies, which are often not detected until 20 weeks or later. The Labour MP Stella Creasy said: \u201cNinety per cent of abortions happen in this country before 10 weeks \u2013 those rare ones that do happen later are the most heartbreaking as they often involve fatal conditions that mean much longed-for children do not survive birth.\u201d Farage, who was bullish about his party being able to grow from its five MPs to become the official opposition in future, also told the press conference that he believed he could count on \u201cmy new friend Elon\u201d, referring to the owner of X, Elon Musk. Farage said he was looking forward to cuts being made to the US administrative state, which he described as a blueprint for Reform UK to follow \u201cif things go well\u201d at the next general election. Jenkyns \u2013 who Farage said happened to be the 100,000th Reform member \u2013 joined the party leader on stage at a central London hotel where she said her old party was a sinking ship that was beyond salvaging. Her decision to join Reform comes as a surprise, however, after she engaged in a bitter public row with the party earlier this year, after claiming a pro-Brexit businessman had offered her jobs to defect. She was bitterly critical of Reform in July after an attack by the party\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Tice, who had accused her of bribing her Reform general election rival in the constituency of Leeds South West and Morley. On that occasion, Jenkyns insisted she never came close to defecting to Reform and described Tice\u2019s \u201cwild accusations\u201d as \u201clibellous\u201d and an attempt to \u201cdeflect from his own embarrassing behaviour\u201d. Asked on Thursday how long she had been thinking about defecting, she said she had \u201calways respected\u201d Farage and noted her work with Tice during the Brexit campaign. \u201cWe are politically aligned. And how long have I been thinking about it? Well, I mean, I was tempted before the general election, but I am a loyal person to a party,\u201d she said. Jenkyns has long been a controversial figure in Tory ranks and campaigned with a picture of Farage on leaflets even while in the party. In 2022, as a newly appointed education minister, she responded to complaints after making a rude gesture outside Downing Street by saying she had been provoked by a \u201cbaying mob\u201d. The arrival of Jenkyns coincided with an announcement by Reform\u2019s former deputy leader, Ben Habib, that he was quitting the party in protest at what he said was the failure to \u201cdemocratise,\u201d claiming a new constitution was a \u201creheated\u201d document that left Farage ultimately in full control. He also alleged that Reform UK branches had been instructed by party headquarters not to work with him or invite him to speak.",

Such notices advise officers that their conduct is under investigation but do not necessarily lead to disciplinary proceedings, which depends on the outcome of the investigation, it added. The IOPC\u2019s regional director, David Ford, said: \u201cMy thoughts and sympathies remain with Tamzin\u2019s family and friends, and everyone affected by the tragic events of that evening. We have met with Tamzin\u2019s family to offer our condolences and to outline how our investigation will progress. We will provide them with regular updates as our inquiries continue. \u201cOur investigation is in the early stages and we are working hard to establish the exact circumstances of what took place, from the time of Tamzin\u2019s arrest to how events unfolded a short time later on the M5.\u201d On Wednesday, Tamzin\u2019s mother, Amy Hall, paid tribute to \u201cthe most kindest, caring, loving, loyal girl ever\u201d. She revealed that her daughter, a student from Wellington, Somerset, had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which she said meant she was \u201cunique and saw the world in such a different way\u201d. Describing Tamzin as her \u201cbest friend\u201d, Hall said: \u201cShe was the most honest person I\u2019ve ever known; she was very special to me. She had a great sense of humour and we had many laughs together. She was such an intelligent young girl and had such interesting perceptions on things in life.\u201d A jury will hear Tamzin\u2019s inquest because she died in police custody.",

      "body": "<h2>Going up</h2> <p><strong>Inter: </strong>The 2023 finalists are second in the table and yet to concede a goal. They are yet to score many either, notching only seven goals in their five games. The latest victims of Simone Inzaghi\u2019s smooth, efficient machine were RB Leipzig, whose own calamitous pointless campaign continued with a 1-0 defeat. An own goal from Castello Lukeba decided it after a wicked free-kick from Federico Dimarco, the wing-back playing an unfamiliar midfield role but was just as dangerous. As Leipzig desperately chased something from the match to rescue their campaign, it fell to the Inter defence to show off their usual control, the experience of Benjamin Pavard, Stefan de Vrij and Alessandro Bastoni as the defensive trio seeing out the job in some comfort.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal: </strong>What a difference Martin \u00d8degaard makes to Arsenal. With their Norwegian playmaker, they are a wholly different proposition to the team that were struggling for their identity without him. His return has brought an instant \u2013 and stark \u2013 change. Sporting beat Manchester City 4-1 last time out, and despite the change of manager after Ruben Amorim\u2019s departure, Jo\u00e3o Pereira is working with the same squad that have been so impressive in this season\u2019s competition. In Lisbon on Tuesday, they were taken apart, with Bukayo Saka looking far more dangerous with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/sporting-arsenal-champions-league-match-report\">\u00d8degaard prompting him</a>. \u201cWe can see since he\u2019s back we are better,\u201d said William Saliba. \u201cHe\u2019s top three [in the world].\u201d</p> <p><strong>Atalanta: </strong>Last season\u2019s Europa League winners are thriving, despite a small squad and the demands to sell their best players. Teun Koopmeiners now lines up for Juventus, having been sold for \u20ac54.7m, but Gian Piero Gasperini will always find a way, as one of the most resourceful and innovative coaches around. Sure, Young Boys, beaten 6-1, have been this season\u2019s, yes, whipping boys but as the 36-team table coalesces into some kind of shape, goals scored are becoming important. The striker Mateo Retegui was reportedly being watched in Berne by Arsenal scouts and duly scored two goals during a rampant four-goal first half. Meanwhile Charles De Ketelaere, a member of the new Belgian generation of talent, scored twice too and also supplied a hat-trick of assists.</p>    <h2>Slipping down</h2> <p><strong>Manchester City: </strong>City\u2019s current \u2013 unforeseen \u2013 downfall continues to break all moulds, on Tuesday proving that drawing a match can actually be worse than losing. The manner of Feyenoord\u2019s comeback from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-fragile-liverpool-feyenoord\">three goals down in 15 minutes</a> was surgical, to which much credit must be offered to the Dutch team. That Pep Guardiola had seen it coming from the moment Josko Gvardiol made the error that handed over the first was made clear by City\u2019s manager placing himself in the brace position. Tortured by his team\u2019s malfunctions, Guardiola ended up scratching his own face in frustration. To continue the precedents \u2013 the sheer lack of reality \u2013 he ended up having to say he had not meant to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/ilkay-gundogan-describes-manchester-citys-miserable-form-as-inexplicable\">\u201cmake light of self-harm\u201d</a>. City are fragile, easy to get at, with too many players unfit or untrusted by a manager not used to such losses in form. Why is Kevin De Bruyne still on the bench? What\u2019s happened to Phil Foden? Just what is happening?</p>    <p><strong>Real Madrid: </strong>Are the defending champions \u2013 the serial champions \u2013 in danger? At Anfield there were more signs the latest Galactico project has achieved little more than Madrid\u2019s megastars becoming distant satellites of each other. Jude Bellingham\u2019s pre-match press call had featured him laying into the English press pack for scapegoating him for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/scapegoat-jude-bellingham-reveals-post-euros-pain-england-real-madrid\">England\u2019s Euro 2024 failings</a> only to deliver an anonymous performance. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\">Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 missed a penalty</a>, and even without Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior to get in the way, looked rather less than the main man. Madrid lacked width and wit, Carlo Ancelotti fully out-coached by Arne Slot. This feels like the end of this cycle. At 24th in the table, Madrid are within a whisker of missing out on the playoffs, and will need to win their last three matches to have a squeak of avoiding them by making the top eight.</p> <p><strong>Paris Saint-Germain: </strong>Another team who look to be caught between cycles. If Mbapp\u00e9 is struggling away from his Parisian home, then his former club are struggling without him as a focal point. At Bayern Munich, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/champions-league-bayern-munich-psg-inter-leipzig-barcelona-brest\">PSG were let down</a> by Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s lack of discipline, booked for dissent and then a mistimed challenge on Alphonso Davies. Worse still was the goalkeeping from Matvey Safonov, an absolute flap that dropped the ball into the path of Kim Min-jae to nod in. PSG are two points and a place behind Madrid in the table, wallowing among the minnows and no-hopers. This season\u2019s gamble on youth might offer plenty for the future in the likes of Nuno Mendes, Willian Pacho, Jo\u00e3o Neves, Bradley Barcola and Warren Za\u00efre-Emery but the dial is tipped too far one way for immediate success.</p> <h2>A good week for</h2> <p><strong>Conor Bradley</strong><strong>, Liverpool</strong><strong>: </strong>The tackle is a forgotten art in the 21st-century game but at Anfield the Kop has always appreciated a sturdy challenge. Standing in for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and showing off the capabilities that won him plaudits last season, Bradley\u2019s perfectly aimed first-half slide into and away from Mbapp\u00e9, taking the ball, had Liverpool fans out of their seats in applause. Bradley, against one of the world\u2019s finest players, in the biggest game yet of his fledgling career had provided a moment to show he would not be bowed by the defending champions. Neither were his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/28/slot-praises-liverpool-academy-players-for-central-role-in-real-madrid-win\">Liverpool teammates</a>. Anfield responded, too, delivering one of those nights where sheer noise ends up rocking opponents back on their heels.</p> <p><strong>Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Aston Villa</strong><strong>: </strong>There is definitely such a thing as a match-winning save. Had Jes\u00fas Gil Manzano, the Spanish referee, not fallen for Michele Di Gregorio\u2019s theatrics when deciding Villa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/aston-villa-juventus-champions-league-match-report\">Diego Carlos had fouled</a> the Juventus keeper before Morgan Rogers found the net, then Mart\u00ednez would have taken more plaudits. When the ball rolled across to Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, it seemed the Portuguese winger was destined to score. Mart\u00ednez, who had begun his evening celebrating a second Lev Yashin award as the world\u2019s best keeper, showed his mettle by somehow clawing it away, millimetres before it crossed the line. He is yet to concede a goal from open play in this year\u2019s competition, a leading reason why his club are in touching distance of the top eight.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Gittens</strong><strong>, Borussia Dortmund</strong><strong>: </strong>In reaching last year\u2019s final, Dortmund looked to be shedding their status as European football\u2019s leading kindergarten, full of youth but without the experience to compete. This season has seen them revert at home and abroad, and part of the Dortmund trademark is having a talented Englishman in their midst. To follow Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham comes Gittens, 20, once of Manchester City\u2019s academy and repeating Sancho\u2019s move to Westphalia. Dortmund\u2019s Bundesliga season has been disappointing but Gittens is winning rave reviews. His solo goal against Dinamo Zagreb was a fourth in five Champions League matches. Only one Englishman under 21 has netted more in a single campaign in the competition \u2013 Alan Smith in Leeds\u2019 run to the semis, way back in 2000-01.</p>  <figure class=\"element

Just what is happening? Real Madrid: Are the defending champions \u2013 the serial champions \u2013 in danger? At Anfield there were more signs the latest Galactico project has achieved little more than Madrid\u2019s megastars becoming distant satellites of each other. Jude Bellingham\u2019s pre-match press call had featured him laying into the English press pack for scapegoating him for England\u2019s Euro 2024 failings only to deliver an anonymous performance. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 missed a penalty, and even without Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior to get in the way, looked rather less than the main man. Madrid lacked width and wit, Carlo Ancelotti fully out-coached by Arne Slot. This feels like the end of this cycle. At 24th in the table, Madrid are within a whisker of missing out on the playoffs, and will need to win their last three matches to have a squeak of avoiding them by making the top eight. Paris Saint-Germain: Another team who look to be caught between cycles. If Mbapp\u00e9 is struggling away from his Parisian home, then his former club are struggling without him as a focal point. At Bayern Munich, PSG were let down by Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s lack of discipline, booked for dissent and then a mistimed challenge on Alphonso Davies. Worse still was the goalkeeping from Matvey Safonov, an absolute flap that dropped the ball into the path of Kim Min-jae to nod in. PSG are two points and a place behind Madrid in the table, wallowing among the minnows and no-hopers. This season\u2019s gamble on youth might offer plenty for the future in the likes of Nuno Mendes, Willian Pacho, Jo\u00e3o Neves, Bradley Barcola and Warren Za\u00efre-Emery but the dial is tipped too far one way for immediate success. A good week for Conor Bradley, Liverpool: The tackle is a forgotten art in the 21st-century game but at Anfield the Kop has always appreciated a sturdy challenge. Standing in for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and showing off the capabilities that won him plaudits last season, Bradley\u2019s perfectly aimed first-half slide into and away from Mbapp\u00e9, taking the ball, had Liverpool fans out of their seats in applause. Bradley, against one of the world\u2019s finest players, in the biggest game yet of his fledgling career had provided a moment to show he would not be bowed by the defending champions. Neither were his Liverpool teammates. Anfield responded, too, delivering one of those nights where sheer noise ends up rocking opponents back on their heels. Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Aston Villa: There is definitely such a thing as a match-winning save. Had Jes\u00fas Gil Manzano, the Spanish referee, not fallen for Michele Di Gregorio\u2019s theatrics when deciding Villa\u2019s Diego Carlos had fouled the Juventus keeper before Morgan Rogers found the net, then Mart\u00ednez would have taken more plaudits. When the ball rolled across to Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, it seemed the Portuguese winger was destined to score. Mart\u00ednez, who had begun his evening celebrating a second Lev Yashin award as the world\u2019s best keeper, showed his mettle by somehow clawing it away, millimetres before it crossed the line. He is yet to concede a goal from open play in this year\u2019s competition, a leading reason why his club are in touching distance of the top eight. Jamie Gittens, Borussia Dortmund: In reaching last year\u2019s final, Dortmund looked to be shedding their status as European football\u2019s leading kindergarten, full of youth but without the experience to compete. This season has seen them revert at home and abroad, and part of the Dortmund trademark is having a talented Englishman in their midst. To follow Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham comes Gittens, 20, once of Manchester City\u2019s academy and repeating Sancho\u2019s move to Westphalia. Dortmund\u2019s Bundesliga season has been disappointing but Gittens is winning rave reviews. His solo goal against Dinamo Zagreb was a fourth in five Champions League matches. Only one Englishman under 21 has netted more in a single campaign in the competition \u2013 Alan Smith in Leeds\u2019 run to the semis, way back in 2000-01. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2024 to correct the first name of Bradley Barcola.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a cold November evening, and MPs are no doubt snuggled up wondering what to watch on TV and how to vote on Kim Leadbeater\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/assisted-suicide\">assisted dying</a> bill. What a perfect opportunity to watch my documentary on that very theme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/14/better-off-dead-review-liz-carr-disabled-people-assisted-dying\">Better Off Dead?</a>.</p> <p>You may know me or you may not. I\u2019m the wheelchair-using disabled woman who spent eight years playing the forensic boffin Clarissa in the BBC drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2015/mar/01/silent-witness-clarissa-disabled-portrayal\">Silent Witness</a>. I\u2019m also a disability rights activist, and when it comes to assisted suicide (as I prefer to call it) I\u2019m a bit of a nerd. Oh yes, and I\u2019m opposed to a change in the law: I don\u2019t think we should allow medical professionals to assist some people to end their lives.</p> <p>Because those in favour of it like to discredit any opposition as anachronistic and arising from faith, I feel obliged at this point to tell you that I am not religious. Instead, I oppose the bill from a secular social-justice perspective. I should also state for the record that opposing assisted suicide does not make me cruel, evil or lacking in compassion \u2013 although I\u2019m regularly called these things by proponents.</p> <p>As someone who relies on the health service and the state for my survival, I simply have a healthy distrust of giving either of them any more power over my life \u2013 and death \u2013 than they already have. Though some people want the right to die, many of us are still fighting for the right to exist. That\u2019s why I\u2019m part of <a href=\"https://notdeadyetuk.co.uk/\">Not Dead Yet</a>, an international network of disabled people who oppose a law that would give the state and the medical profession potentially even more involvement in many ill and disabled people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>While I was making the documentary, a disabled friend had a serious but completely treatable condition yet was placed in a frailty ward \u2013 a place for older people (and my friend) where the support provided was more about cups of teas than CAT scans, and where, on one night, none of the staff were qualified to provide her with a cannula for pain relief as she screamed in agony. It was \u201clucky\u201d that she had a life-threatening seizure that put her in intensive care, because that\u2019s when the medical staff began to provide active care. But still she woke to find \u201cDo not resuscitate\u201d (DNR) written on her notes without her consent. It was a tough time.</p> <p>A month later, another of my closest friends, who is also a disabled person, had a similar adventure. The district nurses who visited him day after day failed to notice the delirium that sepsis had caused until he was rushed into hospital with near-total organ failure. And there, despite his fervent opposition to a DNR, there was one on his notes, too. His partner and brother, my partner and I and a palliative care consultant I know from this campaign worked through the night to have this removed. The next day in a \u201cthe end is nigh\u201d conference with his doctors, they were shocked to hear that this 58-year-old disabled man in a wheelchair had any kind of life \u2013 any kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jun/21/quality-of-life\">quality of life</a>.</p> <p>Both of these friends will be joining the rest of us who are passionately protesting against assisted suicide outside the Houses of Parliament tomorrow. We\u2019ll be there because we fear that this law will further enshrine these misconceptions, underestimations and stereotypes \u2013 and the inherent inequality that exists for ill, older and disabled people. There are too many anecdotes about disabled people having to fight the insidious, unconscious bias that says people who have certain conditions, look a certain way or need care or support might just be better off dead. And we remember the early days of Covid when the death tolls rose, with the reassurance from behind the podium that those dying were only people with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/underlying-conditions-coronavirus-health\">underlying health conditions</a>\u201d. As someone who fitted that definition, I was so frightened at seeing myself as a statistic every single day that I resorted to my survival mode of humour and tweetedthat I might as well change my name to Underlying Health Condition, just to cut out the middle man. In case you\u2019re wondering, I never did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/14/liz-carr-acting-friendship-campaign-against-assisted-dying\">\u2018I\u2019m fighting for the right to live\u2019: Liz Carr on acting, friendship and her campaign against assisted dying</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During that time, many of us feared that if we ended up in hospital we wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of ever leaving. They were dark times for everyone and difficult choices were being made in impossible circumstances. Decisions over who should get the bed or the ventilator or the resources, however, felt very personal: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/29/frail-people-like-me-should-not-be-denied-lifesaving-covid-care\">frailty scores</a>\u201d meant those of us who needed help with basic daily tasks were, even briefly, placed lower down the list of priorities. Infected people were moved into residential care homes with older, frailer residents. Letters went out to similar homes including those for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/13/new-do-not-resuscitate-orders-imposed-on-covid-19-patients-with-learning-difficulties\">people with learning difficulties</a> to suggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/18/blanket-do-not-resuscitate-orders-imposed-on-english-care-homes-finds-cqc\">\u201cblanket\u201d DNR orders</a>. If we learned anything from the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 so far \u2013 it is perhaps that some people\u2019s lives aren\u2019t valued as much as others.</p> <p>Leadbeater has repeatedly suggested that we need to put our faith in medical professionals, lawyers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/12/under-1000-patients-a-year-may-opt-for-assisted-dying-if-bill-passes-mp-says\">and judges</a>. But many doctors and judges admit they are fallible. My experiences and those of many other disabled people, also show this is true. And faith in our current broken systems and the people trying their best within them doesn\u2019t feel like a gold-standard safeguard to me.</p> <p>As long as the lives of marginalised people are seen as more disposable than others, how can any safeguards truly protect us from the potential abuses, coercion and mistakes that will come if assisted suicide is legalised?</p> <p>That\u2019s why I made the documentary. And that\u2019s why I urge MPs to watch <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001z8wc\">Better Off Dead?</a> before this life-and-death vote.</p> <ul> <li><p>Liz Carr is an actor and disability rights activist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a cold November evening, and MPs are no doubt snuggled up wondering what to watch on TV and how to vote on Kim Leadbeater\u2019s assisted dying bill. What a perfect opportunity to watch my documentary on that very theme, Better Off Dead?. You may know me or you may not. I\u2019m the wheelchair-using disabled woman who spent eight years playing the forensic boffin Clarissa in the BBC drama Silent Witness. I\u2019m also a disability rights activist, and when it comes to assisted suicide (as I prefer to call it) I\u2019m a bit of a nerd. Oh yes, and I\u2019m opposed to a change in the law: I don\u2019t think we should allow medical professionals to assist some people to end their lives. Because those in favour of it like to discredit any opposition as anachronistic and arising from faith, I feel obliged at this point to tell you that I am not religious. Instead, I oppose the bill from a secular social-justice perspective. I should also state for the record that opposing assisted suicide does not make me cruel, evil or lacking in compassion \u2013 although I\u2019m regularly called these things by proponents. As someone who relies on the health service and the state for my survival, I simply have a healthy distrust of giving either of them any more power over my life \u2013 and death \u2013 than they already have. Though some people want the right to die, many of us are still fighting for the right to exist. That\u2019s why I\u2019m part of Not Dead Yet, an international network of disabled people who oppose a law that would give the state and the medical profession potentially even more involvement in many ill and disabled people\u2019s lives. While I was making the documentary, a disabled friend had a serious but completely treatable condition yet was placed in a frailty ward \u2013 a place for older people (and my friend) where the support provided was more about cups of teas than CAT scans, and where, on one night, none of the staff were qualified to provide her with a cannula for pain relief as she screamed in agony. It was \u201clucky\u201d that she had a life-threatening seizure that put her in intensive care, because that\u2019s when the medical staff began to provide active care. But still she woke to find \u201cDo not resuscitate\u201d (DNR) written on her notes without her consent. It was a tough time. A month later, another of my closest friends, who is also a disabled person, had a similar adventure. The district nurses who visited him day after day failed to notice the delirium that sepsis had caused until he was rushed into hospital with near-total organ failure. And there, despite his fervent opposition to a DNR, there was one on his notes, too. His partner and brother, my partner and I and a palliative care consultant I know from this campaign worked through the night to have this removed. The next day in a \u201cthe end is nigh\u201d conference with his doctors, they were shocked to hear that this 58-year-old disabled man in a wheelchair had any kind of life \u2013 any kind of quality of life. Both of these friends will be joining the rest of us who are passionately protesting against assisted suicide outside the Houses of Parliament tomorrow. We\u2019ll be there because we fear that this law will further enshrine these misconceptions, underestimations and stereotypes \u2013 and the inherent inequality that exists for ill, older and disabled people. There are too many anecdotes about disabled people having to fight the insidious, unconscious bias that says people who have certain conditions, look a certain way or need care or support might just be better off dead. And we remember the early days of Covid when the death tolls rose, with the reassurance from behind the podium that those dying were only people with \u201cunderlying health conditions\u201d. As someone who fitted that definition, I was so frightened at seeing myself as a statistic every single day that I resorted to my survival mode of humour and tweetedthat I might as well change my name to Underlying Health Condition, just to cut out the middle man. In case you\u2019re wondering, I never did. During that time, many of us feared that if we ended up in hospital we wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of ever leaving. They were dark times for everyone and difficult choices were being made in impossible circumstances. Decisions over who should get the bed or the ventilator or the resources, however, felt very personal: \u201cfrailty scores\u201d meant those of us who needed help with basic daily tasks were, even briefly, placed lower down the list of priorities. Infected people were moved into residential care homes with older, frailer residents. Letters went out to similar homes including those for people with learning difficulties to suggest \u201cblanket\u201d DNR orders. If we learned anything from the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 so far \u2013 it is perhaps that some people\u2019s lives aren\u2019t valued as much as others. Leadbeater has repeatedly suggested that we need to put our faith in medical professionals, lawyers and judges. But many doctors and judges admit they are fallible. My experiences and those of many other disabled people, also show this is true. And faith in our current broken systems and the people trying their best within them doesn\u2019t feel like a gold-standard safeguard to me. As long as the lives of marginalised people are seen as more disposable than others, how can any safeguards truly protect us from the potential abuses, coercion and mistakes that will come if assisted suicide is legalised? That\u2019s why I made the documentary. And that\u2019s why I urge MPs to watch Better Off Dead? before this life-and-death vote. Liz Carr is an actor and disability rights activist",

MPs will have a free vote on the bill to legalise assisted dying in the case of terminal illness. It is a private member\u2019s bill, brought by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, which means the government is technically neutral on the issue. But departments are poised to begin assessments into the impact and workability of the bill, which is likely to mean new amendments when it reaches the next parliamentary stage. The bill will not get additional \u201cgovernment time\u201d if it passes, the Guardian understands. It will not return to parliament until next April if it passes the House of Commons on Friday, which is expected to be a very tight vote. A bill committee of MPs will be chosen by Leadbeater to scrutinise all the provisions in the bill and she has promised to include its opponents in the committee. A government source said that a Ministry of Justice minister would then be assigned to the committee, who could recommend amendments for Leadbeater to adopt. \u201cWe do not want to end up in a similar situation as we did with Brexit where no work was allowed to be done at all which led to complete chaos,\u201d one senior government source said. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has told colleagues he will go into \u201cmake-it-work mode\u201d if the bill passes, despite having been publicly opposed to it. Many of the bill\u2019s opponents have raised significant concerns over the bill\u2019s process, saying that the time for debate in the Commons on a Friday was curtailed because of the nature of a private member\u2019s bill. Supporters of the bill reject that idea, saying the bill has a longer period of scrutiny in bill committee than most other government bills. MPs could vote twice more on the bill, including on any new amendments and again at third reading, after which it will go to the House of Lords. On Thursday, the House of Commons leader, Lucy Powell, urged MPs not to get \u201cbogged down\u201d in the process of the assisted dying bill. The government will work to make the bill \u201coperable\u201d if it is supported at its second reading, Powell told the Commons. \u201cShould the bill pass its second reading, the government will work with the sponsoring members to make sure this bill is operable and is implementable,\u201d Powell said. Powell added that, in the event of it passing the vote on Friday, \u201cwork will begin in earnest following the second reading debate. Should it not pass at second reading, that work would not happen at all. So that\u2019s what I think Members should consider when considering the principles of this bill, and not get too bogged down in some of the process.\u201d MPs concerned about the process have submitted a reasoned amendment to the bill that calls for an independent review and a public consultation before it should return to the House for further debate. The Conservative MP Jesse Norman accused the government of proceeding with the bill the \u201cwrong way round\u201d. He told MPs: \u201cPersonally I feel very strongly pulled in both directions, by both sides, on the issue of assisted dying. But on one thing, no one can be in any doubt at all: that the government has no business trying to rush this legislation through this house by proxy. \u201cThe text of the bill was published barely two weeks before we vote tomorrow. No impact assessment and no legal issues analysis has been published. \u201cFar from public debate preceding legislation, legislation has preceded debate. This is completely the wrong way round.\u201d Campaigners on both sides of the debate have been making final pleas to MPs before the knife-edge vote. The former health secretary Matt Hancock, a supporter of the change, released a video of him speaking to a constituent about his terminal illness and desperation for the right to choose his own death. But on Thursday, Labour\u2019s disabled activist wing wrote to all MPs urging them to reject the legislation. \u201cA significant portion of our members express serious concerns about the potential risks and implications of such legislation,\u201d Disability Labour said in their statement. \u201cWe are worried that the current proposals may not include sufficient safeguards to protect vulnerable individuals from coercion or undue pressure. Furthermore, there is apprehension that the criteria for eligibility could expand over time, as has been observed in other countries, potentially leading to unintended and harmful consequences for people with disabilities.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2024. An earlier version said that Matt Hancock was a former home secretary instead of health secretary.",

      "bodyText": "Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike at \u201cdecision-making centres in Kyiv\u201d with his country\u2019s new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) missile. Putin said officials were drawing up a list of targets, and Russia would continue combat tests of the missile Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin also boasted that Russia was producing ten times as many advanced missile system as Nato countries collectively were able to manage. He said that overnight Russia had used 90 missiles of and 100 drones to strike 17 targets in Ukraine, which he described as \u201cmilitary facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia had used cluster munitions, overnight, which he described as \u201ca very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics\u201d Ukrainian authorities said the attacks had been aimed at energy infrastructure, and earlier today at least one million people had been left without power. Ukraine\u2019s energy company Ukrenergo said the emergency blackouts had ended, but warned of \u201cfour rounds of blackouts\u201d occurring before the end of the day Kyiv said on Thursday that Russian forces had shot dead five Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered in the eastern Zaporizhzhia region, marking the latest war crimes allegations levied against Moscow. Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other\u2019s armies of committing atrocities Putin told reporters in Kazakhstan was outraged by the assassination attempts on incoming US president Donald Trump, and he believes that the Biden administration is trying to create difficulties for Trump in US-Russian relations Ukrenergo, Ukraine\u2019s energy company, has now warned of four rounds of power blackouts during the day. Here are some of the latest images from the conflict in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrinform, citing Khmelnytskyi regional governor Serhiy Tyurin, reports that an energy supply facility was damaged by fragments from a downed missile this morning in the region. No casualties were reported, and all power supplies were expected to be restored to normal by the evening. Vladimir Putin has been giving a press conference in Astana, which Tass has been covering on a live video stream. The Russian president has said, among other things, that: The new Oreshnik missile reaches a temperature of 4,000 degrees, and \u201cthe kinetic impact is powerful, like a meteorite falling. We know from history what meteorites fell where, and what the consequences were. Sometimes it was enough for entire lakes to form\u201d It is unrealistic to expect Russia\u2019s CSTO allies (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) to assist Russia \u201cin any way in connection with the American weapons strikes on the Russian Federation\u201d but Russia was prepared to protect them and the mutual defence clauses in the treaty were clear The Russian Federation is considering making drone operations a separate branch of the military He has not set conditions for peace talks with Ukraine, but has set out Russia\u2019s position clearly. In June he said any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine giving up its aim to join Nato, and giving up full control of the four Ukrainian regions that Russia has claimed to annex on top of the 2014 annexation of Crimea He was outraged by the assassination attempts on incoming US president Donald Trump, and he believes that the Biden administration is trying to create difficulties for Trump in US-Russian relations He rejected accusations in Angela Merkel\u2019s memoir that he had tried to scare her with his dog, and said if she came to visit Russia again he would keep dogs away from her Russia, he claimed, unlike the west, does not interfere in internal political processes in Georgia Vladimir Putin has accused Germany of using \u201cunlawful measures\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d methods in its treatment of assets belonging to Russia\u2019s largest oil producer Rosneft, the Interfax news agency reported. The future of Rosneft\u2019s German assets, which include a 54.17% stake in the PCK Schwedt refinery, is unclear after Berlin effectively took control of them. Ukrainian prosecutors have alleged that a former lawmaker embezzled more than $10million (\u00a37.9m) in an army uniform corruption scheme, the AFP news agency reports. AFP says: The government in Kyiv, which has been plagued by corruption since the fall of the Soviet Union, is facing a new raft of graft scandals amid a surge of spending on its military as it fights Russia\u2019s invasion. The Prosecutor General\u2019s office said it had uncovered \u201ca scheme to embezzle more than $10 million for the purchase of military uniforms for the Armed Forces of Ukraine\u201d. It accused a former MP and advisor to the country\u2019s deputy defence ministry of orchestrating the scheme in 2022, along with his son and a foreign citizen. It said the group brokered a contract to produce $25.6 million worth of army uniforms at an inflated price of more than $35 million, agreeing to divide the extra $10 million between them. The ex-MP and his son were served a notice of suspicion of \u201cmisappropriation of property by deception on a large scale\u201d. Prosecutors did not identify the accused by name, nor say if any had been taken into custody. Kyiv said on Thursday that Russian forces had shot dead five Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered in the eastern Zaporizhzhia region, marking the latest war crimes allegations levied against Moscow. Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other\u2019s armies of committing atrocities since Russian forces launched their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Prosecutors said the incident had taken place on 24 November near the village of Novodarivka in the Pologiv district of the Zaporizhzhia region, reports AFP. \u201cServicemen of the Russian armed forces shot dead five Ukrainian defenders out of six who had been taken prisoner,\u201d a statement read. There was no immediate response to the accusations from Moscow, which claimed to have annexed Zaporizhzhia along with three other partially occupied Ukrainian territories in late 2022. Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had contacted the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) over the allegations. The German defence ministry has said Patriot missile units could be deployed in Poland from early 2025 for up to six months, says Reuters. \u201cWith this we will protect a logistical hub in Poland which is of central importance for the delivery of materials to Ukraine,\u201d German defence minister Boris Pistorius said. Tass, citing the local regional governor, reports that two civilians were injured in Belgorod region after a Ukrainian drone attack. It also reports that Russia\u2019s air defences have destroyed a Ukrainian drone over Bryansk region. Ukraine\u2019s air force said on Thursday that Russia made 12 strikes on Ukrainian targets in an overnight aerial attack which mostly targeted fuel and energy infrastructure, Reuters reports. Earlier Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin, speaking in Astana, said Russia had struck 17 targets which were \u201cmilitary facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems.\u201d It is 2pm in Kyiv and 3pm in Moscow. Here are the headlines \u2026 Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike at \u201cdecision-making centres in Kyiv\u201d with his country\u2019s new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) missile. Putin said officials were drawing up a list of targets, and Russia would continue combat tests of the missile Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin also boasted that Russia was producing ten times as many advanced missile system as Nato countries collectively were able to manage. He said that overnight Russia had used 90 missiles of and 100 drones to strike 17 targets in Ukraine, which he described as \u201cmilitary facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia had used cluster munitions, overnight, which he described as \u201ca very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics\u201d Ukrainian authorities said the attacks had been aimed at energy infrastructure, and earlier today at least one million people had been left without power. Ukraine\u2019s energy company Ukrenergo said the emergency blackouts had ended, but warned of \u201cthree rounds of blackouts\u201d occurring before the end of the day Russia\u2019s air defence systems destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones overnight over four regions, the defence ministry said on Thursday. It also claimed to have intercepted a Neptune guided missile Russian authorities in Kursk have opened a criminal case against Ukrainian service personnel after two civilians were injured in a drone attack on vehicles on Wednesday Here are some images from Ukraine of the aftermath of the overnight Russian attack. Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reports that, while the earlier emergency blackouts have ended, Ukraine\u2019s energy company Ukrenergo has said it still expects there to be \u201cthree rounds of blackouts\u201d until the end of the day, warning that \u201cthe time of application and the amount of restrictions may change during the day\u201d. Reuters is carrying fuller quotes now from Vladimir Putin\u2019s speech in Kazakhstan, where he threatened the use of the new Oreshnik missile on Kyiv. It quotes the Russian president saying: Of course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on 21 November. At present, the ministry of defence and the general staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory. These could be military facilities, defence and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centres in Kyiv. Putin is attending the Collective Security Treaty Organization summit in Astana, a grouping which includes Armenia, Belarus, hosts Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan alongside Russia. During his appearance at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin said that overnight 17 targets within Ukraine were struck. Tass quotes Putin saying: Tonight we carried out a comprehensive strike using 90 missiles of similar classes and 100 drones. We hit 17 targets: military facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems. Ukrainian authorities said the attacks had been aimed at energy infrastructure, and that earlier on Thursday at least one million people had been left without power after the attack caused emergency blackouts. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia had used cluster munitions, which he described as \u201ca very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics.\u201d Russia and Ukraine have agreed to return to each other a total of nine children to be reunited with family members, according to a senior Russian official. Reuters reports that Russia\u2019s commissioner for children, Maria Lvova-Belova, said on Thursday that six boys and one girl, aged six to 16, were being returned to relatives in Ukraine. She added that Qatari mediation had also enabled the repatriation of two young Russian boys, aged seven and nine, from Ukraine. In March 2023 the international criminal court issued a warrant for the arrest of Lvova-Belova, alongside president Vladimir Putin, after a panel of judges agreed that there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe they bore responsibility for the \u201cunlawful deportation\u201d of Ukrainian children. The UK\u2019s ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has accused Russia of creating \u201ca humanitarian crisis in Ukraine\u201d and called recent attacks on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d In a speech delivered in Vienna on Thursday, Neil Holland said: Over the past month, Russia has intensified its airstrikes, primarily targeting energy infrastructure causing rolling blackouts in several regions. Last night\u2019s attacks were the latest in a series. As winter approaches and temperatures plummet, this additional strain on the energy grid is deeply concerning and will disproportionately affect the vulnerable, including the elderly and frail. Repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure and restrictions on aid delivery have exacerbated the suffering of vulnerable populations. The suffering in Ukraine cannot be ignored. It is our collective responsibility to act decisively to alleviate this humanitarian crisis. Reuters reports a Russian court sentenced a defence lawyer, Dmitry Talantov, who is 63 and has represented critics of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine, to seven years in prison. Talantov was accused of writing Facebook posts which condemned the actions of Russian soldiers in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has boasted that Russia produces ten times more missiles than all of the Nato countries combined, and threatened an attack on decision-making centres in Kyiv with its new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) missile. Appearing at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin spoke about the capabilities of the Oreshnik missile. He said that Russia had been forced to deploy the new missile \u201cin response to the enemy\u2019s actions\u201d \u2013 a reference to the use of US and UK manufactured missiles inside Russian territory \u2013 and that there were \u201cno analogues to the Russian Oreshnik in the world\u201d. He said western equivalents would not appear any time soon. In the event of a massive use of the Oreshnik, the force of the strike will be comparable to a nuclear weapon, he said. He said decision-making centres in Kyiv could become a target for the Oreshnik missile, and pointed out that Ukraine has launched multiple attacks against Moscow and St Petersburg. Ukraine carried out its biggest drone strike on Moscow earlier this month. US and UK sources indicated to the Guardian last week that they believed the Oreshnik missile fired on Dnipro was an experimental nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a theoretical range of below 3,420 miles (5,500km). That is enough to reach Europe from where it was fired in south-western Russia, but not the US. Tass reports that in Kazakhstan, Putin also said that other new missile systems could appear and that Russia will continue combat tests of the Oreshnik. Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, reports that emergency power blackouts in the country have ended. This does not mean that everybody will remain with power for the rest of the day. Ukrenergo announced that \u201call customers return to hourly outage schedules\u201d. Tass reports that Russia claims it shot down one of Ukraine\u2019s Neptune guided missiles overnight. Ukraine\u2019s air force has claimed it shot down 79 out of 91 missiles fired by Russian, and downed 35 out of 97 drones, Reuters reports. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that Russia used cluster munitions in a massive strike at Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure overnight, describing it as \u201ca very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, in a message posted to Telegram, said that about 100 drones and 90 missiles were involved in the attack, adding: In several regions, Kalibr strikes with cluster munitions were recorded, specifically on civilian infrastructure. These cluster parts make it much more difficult for our rescuers and energy workers to eliminate the consequences of the impact, and this is a very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics. Earlier authorities in Ukraine reported that at least one million people were without power. Missile debris was reported at two locations in Kyiv, but local authorities claimed that air defences intercepted all of the missiles fired at the capital. Many other regions reported strikes. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine\u2019s appeal for better air defences in his message, saying: Each such attack proves that air defence systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not in storage bases. This is especially important in the winter, when we have to protect our infrastructure from targeted Russian strikes. We are constantly working with partners to have more power to defend and timely delivery now and full implementation of agreements particularly on air defense is what is most needed. Ukraine disconnected several nuclear power units from the network amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure on Thursday, a Ukrainian energy industry source told Reuters. This map from our interactive team shows the location of Ukraine\u2019s three operational nuclear power plants, along with the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since nearly the very beginning of the invasion, and the location of Chernobyl, site of the accident in 1986. Reuters reports that a source in Ukraine\u2019s energy industry told it that overnight Russia struck infrastructure with \u201ca hard blow\u201d, and claimed cluster munitions were deployed. The claims have not been independently verified. In Russia, Tass reports that authorities in Kursk have opened a criminal case against Ukrainian service personnel after two civilians were injured in a drone attack on vehicles on Wednesday. \u201cDuring the preliminary investigation, all representatives of the armed formations of Ukraine involved in this crime will be identified and brought to justice as provided by law,\u201d the main military investigation department said. Ukraine launched in incursion into Kursk in August. At least one million people are without power across Ukraine after a large Russian overnight missile attack on energy infrastructure in the country. Reuters reports that three regions in the west are affected by the power outages. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Ukraine\u2019s western region, reported energy infrastructure attacks there, and said more than half a million people in the region were without power. Missiles were detected overnight headed for Kharkiv, Odesa and eight other regions Missile debris was reported at two locations in Kyiv, but local authorities claimed that air defences intercepted all of the missiles fired at the capital. Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported damage to property but no casualties. The national power grid operator Ukrenergo had \u201curgently introduced emergency power cuts\u201d, said the energy minister, German Galushchenko. The temperature in Kyiv was not expected to rise above 2C (35.6F) today. Russia\u2019s ministry of defence claimed to have destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones overnight in four regions, including the Moscow-annexed Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Reuters has a quick snap that there are power cuts in Ukraine\u2019s southern region of Mykolaiv as a result of Russia\u2019s missile attack. It cited regional governor Vitaliy Kim. Zhitomir and Chernihiv region have ended their air alarms in Ukraine. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Ukraine\u2019s western Lviv region, reports on the Telegram app that energy infrastructure in the region has been attacked by Russia Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has posted to Telegram to report that debris from a rocket has hit a private business in Darnytskyi district in south-east of the city. He reported there were no casualties, but that damage was caused. Russia\u2019s air defence systems destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones overnight over four regions, the defence ministry said on Thursday, Reuters reports. Fourteen of the drones were destroyed over the Krasnodar region, six over the Bryansk region, three over Moscow-annexed Crimea and two over the Rostov region, it said. Krasnodar\u2019s regional governor, Veniamin Kondratyev, wrote on Telegram that two districts in the southern Russian region were subjected to a \u201cmassive drone attack\u201d overnight. One civilian was injured, he said. A senior UN official, Rosemary DiCarlo, this month denounced the rise in civilian casualties in the nearly three-year conflict between Ukraine and Russia, noting Moscow\u2019s targeting of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure may make this winter the \u201charshest since the start of the war\u201d. The latest missile salvo from Russia comes a day after US president-elect Donald Trump named staunch loyalist and retired general Keith Kellogg as his Ukraine envoy, charged with ending the Russian invasion. Ukraine\u2019s energy grid has been heavily targeted since Russia invaded in February 2022, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of \u201cterror\u201d tactics by trying to plunge Ukrainian cities into darkness and cut off heating to civilians throughout the winter, writes AFP. The overnight strikes come after two weeks of dramatic escalation that has seen both sides launch new weapons to gain an upper hand ahead of Donald Trump being inaugurated as US president in January. Russia earlier this week said it was preparing its own retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on its territory using US-supplied Atacms missiles. Ukraine has launched at least three attacks on Russian border regions with the missiles since the White House gave it permission to fire them on Russian territory. Moscow responded to the first strike by firing a never-before-seen hypersonic ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an angry address to the nation, Russian president Vladimir Putin warned the nuclear-capable missile could be used against western countries if they let their arms be used by Ukraine to hit Russia. Ukraine\u2019s military said earlier Thursday that an air raid alert had been declared across the country \u201cdue to a missile threat\u201d in a message on Telegram. Missiles were detected headed for Kharkiv, Odesa and eight other regions, according to other messages from the air force. \u201cKharkiv, go to the shelters!\u201d it warned. Oleg Synegubov, head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said on Telegram that three strikes had hit Kharkiv\u2019s Kyivskyi district, with no casualties reported so far. The mayor of Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, Igor Polishchuk, said that \u201cexplosions were heard again\u201d in the city. Explosions were heard in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi, Kharkiv, Rivne and Lutsk on Thursday morning amid reports of a Russian cruise missile attack, Ukrainian news outlets Zerkalo Tyzhnya and Suspilne said. \u201cEnergy infrastructure is once again targeted by the enemy\u2019s massive strike,\u201d said the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko. The Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said: \u201cThe enemy continues to attack Kharkiv with missiles. The Odesa regional governor, Oleh Kiper, urged residents to stay in shelter. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said air defence was at work. The national power grid operator Ukrenergo had \u201curgently introduced emergency power cuts\u201d, said the energy minister, German Galushchenko, as temperatures across the country dropped to around freezing. One energy supplier, DTEK, said Ukrenergo was introducing emergency power outages in the regions of Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro and Donetsk. Hello, this is the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. This Thursday morning, Ukraine has come under widespread air raids, with a national alert issued and officials saying the country\u2019s energy infrastructure is once again the Kremlin\u2019s target. More of that to come, but for now, here\u2019s a summary from our Ukraine war briefing of other major developments: A senior official in Joe Biden\u2019s administration has told the Associated Press that the US is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and lowering the conscription age to as young as 18 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available. The Biden administration is preparing another urgent weapons package for Ukraine, this time worth $725m, two US officials said on Wednesday. It is predicted to include landmines, drones, Stinger anti-air missiles, and Himars ammunition, including GMLRS rockets with cluster warheads. The formal notification to Congress of the weapons package could come as soon as Monday, one official said. Ukrainian forces made a \u201ccomplex drone and missile strike\u201d against Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Wednesday, targeting the Belbek military airfield and a naval school, according to Russian and Crimean sources cited by the Institute for the Study of War. The attack reportedly used Ukraine\u2019s homegrown Neptune cruise missiles, Soviet-style S200 missiles, western-provided Storm Shadow missiles, 40 strike drones and unspecified ballistic missiles. The US-based thinktank suggested it bolstered the case for the \u201cprovision of long-range strike weapons to Ukrainian forces\u201d. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due on Thursday to sign Ukraine\u2019s 2025 budget, which calls for the country\u2019s first wartime tax increases. The finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said Ukraine hoped tax increases would generate additional budget revenues of 141bn hryvnia (US$3.39bn). The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said record sums would be directed to weapons production and purchases including modernising Ukraine\u2019s defence industry and buying drones. There was no word on whether South Korea will supply arms to Ukraine after Kyiv\u2019s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, met with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, in Seoul on Wednesday. Yoon\u2019s office said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers, while closely coordinating with the US. Umerov briefed other South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul would strengthen cooperation, the statement said. Umerov predicted a \u201ctangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions\u201d. Russia\u2019s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions, Pjotr Sauer writes. Donald Trump has picked Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia \u2013 a newly conceived role given the ongoing war, Gloria Oladipo writes. Kellogg served as a national security adviser to the former vice-president Mike Pence, then acting security adviser to Trump himself after Michael Flynn had to resign. Kellogg has said he would emphasise getting the two countries to the negotiating table. Russia\u2019s sabotage of western targets may prompt Nato to consider invoking its article 5 mutual defence clause, Bruno Kahl, head of Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, has warned. The BND chief, speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, said he expected Moscow to further step up its hybrid warfare. Nordic and Baltic states and Poland said on Wednesday that they would in the coming months step up support for Ukraine, including to its defence industry, and invest in making more ammunition available. \u201cWe are committed to strengthening our deterrence, and defence, including resilience, against conventional as well as hybrid attacks, and to expanding sanctions against Russia as well as against those who enable Russia\u2019s aggression,\u201d the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden said in a statement. The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, called for more defence spending in Europe over the next five years, as her top team was voted in by a wafer-thin majority in the European parliament. The EU faces acute challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump and the climate crisis, all against a backdrop of deepening fears of economic decline as von der Leyen starts her second term. Poland said on Wednesday that it had detained a German citizen and charged the suspect with brokering and exporting dual-use goods to Russia. The German citizen traded in specialist machines used in the technological industry, which \u2013 through his company \u2013 were illegally sent to Russian military plants involved in the production of weapons, said the Internal Security Agency (Isa). \u201cThe suspect pleaded guilty and filed a motion for voluntary submission to punishment.\u201d Vladimir Putin arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Kazakhstan is a member of the Moscow-led CSTO security alliance but has expressed concern about the Ukraine war, which the Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has refused to condone. Kazakhstan is also working to detour away from Russia as a route for its oil export, using Turkey instead.",

But it was Starmer who instructed Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, to write to cabinet ministers telling them to keep out of the debate.</p> \n<p>However, Starmer\u2019s silence has left the forum open for Streeting and the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to make all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/shabana-mahmood-should-not-impose-her-religious-beliefs-on-others-says-peer\">headlines with their opposition</a>.</p> \n<p>Streeting said he feared for the state of the NHS and palliative care, saying it was not fit to provide the safeguards.

Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, will lead the work in the Department of Health and Social Care.</p> \n<p>Leadbeater has promised that there will be spaces on the bill committee in parliament for opponents who are willing to work constructively.</p> \n<p>But there are also very likely to be a number of government amendments at the next stage \u2013 including lengthening the amount of time until the bill must be implemented after royal assent, defined in the current bill as two years.</p> \n<p>There is already tentative talk about how to gain a broader consensus on the issue whether the bill passes or not \u2013 perhaps with a royal or parliamentary commission.</p> \n<p>More than 160 MPs have put their names down to speak at the five-hour debate. Dozens of those who will be listening have said they may wait until then to make a decision.</p> \n<p>MPs who had no prior firm view on the topic have distressing case studies from constituents \u2013 on both sides \u2013 landing in their inboxes. One described having been lobbied by a local bishop. There have been tearful community meetings in village halls and libraries. It has been, for many, overwhelming and dozens are still undecided.</p> \n<p>The pro-assisted dying campaign had a solid parliamentary operation from early in the parliament. Labour MPs divided up their parliamentary intakes and appointed \u201cwhips\u201d for each different generation of MPs to go through the numbers. The group meets three times a week in Leadbeater\u2019s office and are now quietly confident that if all the pledges of support carry through, the bill will pass.</p> \n<p>\u201cKim has been saying to MPs, this might be the most important decision you ever make in your parliamentary careers,\u201d one MP said.</p> \n<p>Among those working on the campaign are two Conservative ex-cabinet ministers, Kit Malthouse and Andrew Mitchell. Working their intake are some of the most talked-up talents in the new cohort of Labour MPs, including Josh Simons, Jeevun Sandher and Lloyd Hatton.</p> \n<p>A doctor in parliament who is in favour, Peter Prinsley, said he found it easier to convince older colleagues. \u201cThey are more likely to have encountered those who have had a difficult death,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this new cohort of Labour MPs is very young, it can feel more distant for them, so that has been a challenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>For those opposed, the organisation remains more splintered. Labour MPs who are against the change know many of their colleagues will not be convinced by religious Christian arguments such as those from the Conservative MP Danny Kruger or Labour\u2019s Rachael Maskell. The involvement of groups such as Right to Life, who also oppose abortion, has made the association very tricky for atheist MPs.</p> \n<p>Despite a less centralised operation, it is this group who have had the most high-profile interventions, including Streeting and Mahmood, the former prime minister Gordon Brown and the mother and father of the House, Diane Abbott and Edward Leigh.</p> \n<p>The most visible campaigners against the change in politics have been disabled parliamentarians such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson or the MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy. The debate has taken its toll on many of them, saying they believe disabled people\u2019s voices are being crowded out.</p> \n<p>Many have experiences with intolerable waits for assistance and funding for care \u2013 the idea the state will make it quicker to request an assisted death than to get a ramp at home is one example that gives MPs pause.</p> \n<p>The MP Antonia Bance, who was previously a senior official in the TUC, and James Frith, the Bury North MP who regained his seat from the Tories in July, have been making the equality case to colleagues.</p> \n<p>\u201cI oppose this bill precisely because my values are Labour, trade unionist and collectivist,\u201d Bance said. \u201cI know that sometimes the collective good \u2013 in particular protecting vulnerable people and those with protected characteristics, such as disabled people and women \u2013 means that we must impose limits on individuals\u2019 freedoms.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the final hours before the vote, its advocates will make the case to MPs who have doubts that they should take the bill to the next stage and make the case for changes. But it will also mean that, even if the bill passes, its opponents will hope there is still time to change parliament\u2019s mind.</p>",

At the next stage, if the bill passes to committee, a government minister will be assigned to it, likely to be the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Heidi Alexander. Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, will lead the work in the Department of Health and Social Care. Leadbeater has promised that there will be spaces on the bill committee in parliament for opponents who are willing to work constructively. But there are also very likely to be a number of government amendments at the next stage \u2013 including lengthening the amount of time until the bill must be implemented after royal assent, defined in the current bill as two years. There is already tentative talk about how to gain a broader consensus on the issue whether the bill passes or not \u2013 perhaps with a royal or parliamentary commission. More than 160 MPs have put their names down to speak at the five-hour debate. Dozens of those who will be listening have said they may wait until then to make a decision. MPs who had no prior firm view on the topic have distressing case studies from constituents \u2013 on both sides \u2013 landing in their inboxes. One described having been lobbied by a local bishop. There have been tearful community meetings in village halls and libraries. It has been, for many, overwhelming and dozens are still undecided. The pro-assisted dying campaign had a solid parliamentary operation from early in the parliament. Labour MPs divided up their parliamentary intakes and appointed \u201cwhips\u201d for each different generation of MPs to go through the numbers. The group meets three times a week in Leadbeater\u2019s office and are now quietly confident that if all the pledges of support carry through, the bill will pass. \u201cKim has been saying to MPs, this might be the most important decision you ever make in your parliamentary careers,\u201d one MP said. Among those working on the campaign are two Conservative ex-cabinet ministers, Kit Malthouse and Andrew Mitchell. Working their intake are some of the most talked-up talents in the new cohort of Labour MPs, including Josh Simons, Jeevun Sandher and Lloyd Hatton. A doctor in parliament who is in favour, Peter Prinsley, said he found it easier to convince older colleagues. \u201cThey are more likely to have encountered those who have had a difficult death,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this new cohort of Labour MPs is very young, it can feel more distant for them, so that has been a challenge.\u201d For those opposed, the organisation remains more splintered. Labour MPs who are against the change know many of their colleagues will not be convinced by religious Christian arguments such as those from the Conservative MP Danny Kruger or Labour\u2019s Rachael Maskell. The involvement of groups such as Right to Life, who also oppose abortion, has made the association very tricky for atheist MPs. Despite a less centralised operation, it is this group who have had the most high-profile interventions, including Streeting and Mahmood, the former prime minister Gordon Brown and the mother and father of the House, Diane Abbott and Edward Leigh. The most visible campaigners against the change in politics have been disabled parliamentarians such as Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson or the MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy. The debate has taken its toll on many of them, saying they believe disabled people\u2019s voices are being crowded out. Many have experiences with intolerable waits for assistance and funding for care \u2013 the idea the state will make it quicker to request an assisted death than to get a ramp at home is one example that gives MPs pause. The MP Antonia Bance, who was previously a senior official in the TUC, and James Frith, the Bury North MP who regained his seat from the Tories in July, have been making the equality case to colleagues. \u201cI oppose this bill precisely because my values are Labour, trade unionist and collectivist,\u201d Bance said. \u201cI know that sometimes the collective good \u2013 in particular protecting vulnerable people and those with protected characteristics, such as disabled people and women \u2013 means that we must impose limits on individuals\u2019 freedoms.\u201d In the final hours before the vote, its advocates will make the case to MPs who have doubts that they should take the bill to the next stage and make the case for changes. But it will also mean that, even if the bill passes, its opponents will hope there is still time to change parliament\u2019s mind.",

      "body": "<p>When Marco de Kat starts planning his meals, he doesn\u2019t need to travel far for fresh food. Right outside his house is an 800 square metre plot with all sorts of produce \u2013 apples, pears, peppers, basil, beets and cauliflower, to name a few. During the winter months, he and his wife can pretty much survive off the vegetables stored in their freezer. Even after living in Oosterwold for a number of years, it\u2019s something that still excites him.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday, I forgot to think about what to eat,\u201d he says. \u201cYou walk through your garden and you find something and that\u2019s what you eat.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ajlajournal.org/articles/almere-oosterwold-netherlands-a-dutch-utopia-in-the-making\">Oosterwold</a>, where de Kat has lived since 2017, is a 4,300 hectare (10,625 acre) urban experiment located east of Amsterdam, in a suburb of the city of Almere, where de Kat works as a municipal councillor. First visualised about a decade ago by a local network, it was established by local government and Oosterwold planners as a way to challenge the rigidity of Dutch city planning, giving people more freedom \u2013 and responsibility \u2013 over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/15/almere-dutch-city-alternative-housing-custom-build\">urban design</a> process.</p> <p>The area, which has about 5,000 residents and a growing waiting list, is completely self-sufficient. Residents can build houses however they like, and must collaborate with others to figure out things such as street names, waste management, roads, and even schools. But the local government has included one extremely unusual requirement: about half of each plot must be devoted to urban agriculture.</p>    <p>\u201cThis rule \u2013 if you want to live in Oosterwold, you have to produce food on at least 50% of your property \u2013 is very unique thinking in the world, and makes it also an outstanding area in many ways,\u201d says Jan Eelco Jansma, a researcher at Wageningen University &amp; Research, who <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837722001314#bbib24\">has studied</a> Almere for years and inspired the city to include urban agriculture in the planning of Oosterwold.</p> <p>Rositsa T Ilieva, the director of policy at the City University of New York\u2019s Urban Food Policy Institute, also highlighted its novelty. \u201cWhile other cities have integrated urban agriculture into planning, few have implemented it as a non-negotiable land-use requirement or handed so much responsibility for development to residents,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Residents can be quite creative with the brief. Oosterwold, which has about 1,000 residential units, is a sprawl of all sorts of gardens, from greenhouses to pastures surrounded by moats. \u201cNobody is doing it in the same way,\u201d de Kat says. \u201cYou have to find your own recipe.\u201d</p> <p>Some, like de Kat, have turned their gardens into an Eden of sorts to provide for their own household unit. Other residents just plant a few apple trees or outsource by owning plots of land on site that are tended to by professional farmers. </p> <p>Others, such as Jalil Bekkour, have been able to capitalise on it. \u201cI never had experience gardening my own food or anything like that,\u201d he said. But he taught himself how to garden, and three years ago he <a href=\"https://atelierfeddan.com/\">opened his own restaurant</a>, Atelier Feddan, where 80% of the food is directly from Oosterwold. His newfound excitement for gardening and agriculture is palpable: he regards his garden as a \u201cfield lab\u201d of sorts to help develop products for the restaurant.</p> <p>While the climate crisis threatens the area, it can also provide ample opportunity. As Bekkour explains, Oosterwold now has the same climate France had 40 years ago. Because of this, food crops such as avocados and citrus trees can easily be grown outside rather than in a greenhouse.</p> <p>Time is a constraint, as perfecting a plot takes extra care. \u201cYou fail and you try again,\u201d Bekkour says.</p> <p>Residents also worry about the fact there is no real guidance about how to make your plot successful. \u201cIn the planning, it was kind of a bit laissez-faire,\u201d says Jansma. \u201cBut if you want to develop such a new area in such an innovative way and at such a scale, you have to share responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>A new centre called the Food Hub has now opened, devoted to collecting and processing food as well as knowledge sharing. The centre is run by the Almere local authority as well as the Oosterwold food cooperative. Yolanda Sikking, the participation manager for Oosterwold, hopes it will help inspire residents to take more initiative.</p> <p>\u201cSome people do it very well but others don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cWe decided we have to stimulate more.\u201d</p>    <p>The eventual goal is to provide 10% of Almere\u2019s food, which many see as ambitious but hopefully doable in time.</p> <p>Residents and experts alike also emphasise the potential for replicability. \u201cSome of the things that we do could be implemented in other places in the Netherlands and beyond,\u201d says Jan-Albert Blaauw, a resident of Oosterwold and founder of the city\u2019s food cooperative.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of examples around the world where planners think about urban agriculture, but in fact still separate agriculture and urbanisation by developing agroparks or sites where agriculture can do what it does normally and prevent an encroachment in these areas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it still is excluding agriculture.\u201d</p> <p>Ilieva believes that the participatory principles behind the Oosterwold plan and its implementation and local food production are widely applicable. \u201cBy prioritising agriculture as a land use, planners and residents together can work to reconfigure peri-urban spaces marked for residential development into vibrant, multifunctional areas that advance ecological, social, and economic goals,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lessons can be learned from other projects as well. Jason Hawes co-authored a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-023-00023-3\">2024 study</a> that found carbon emissions from urban agriculture can be higher than from conventional agriculture. While the study did not evaluate a community like Oosterwold, there were some relevant ideas to be gleaned from it.</p> <p>Hawes says: \u201cFor example, we found that infrastructure installed early in the farm-garden setup was a particularly important contributor to the carbon footprint of fruits and vegetables grown there, so it can be useful to prioritise long-term use of infrastructure as well as finding reclaimed or reused materials to support the initial construction.\u201d</p>    <p>And it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to start on as large a scale as Oosterwold did. \u201cThe first thing I tell people is to start small,\u201d Bekkour says. \u201cStart with the things you love to eat and the easy stuff.\u201d</p> <p>De Kat says: \u201cYou can do this with a strong vision and strong person.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2024 to clarify that Oosterwold is east of Amsterdam, not \u201cin the north-east of the Netherlands\u201d, as a previous version said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Marco de Kat starts planning his meals, he doesn\u2019t need to travel far for fresh food. Right outside his house is an 800 square metre plot with all sorts of produce \u2013 apples, pears, peppers, basil, beets and cauliflower, to name a few. During the winter months, he and his wife can pretty much survive off the vegetables stored in their freezer. Even after living in Oosterwold for a number of years, it\u2019s something that still excites him. \u201cYesterday, I forgot to think about what to eat,\u201d he says. \u201cYou walk through your garden and you find something and that\u2019s what you eat.\u201d Oosterwold, where de Kat has lived since 2017, is a 4,300 hectare (10,625 acre) urban experiment located east of Amsterdam, in a suburb of the city of Almere, where de Kat works as a municipal councillor. First visualised about a decade ago by a local network, it was established by local government and Oosterwold planners as a way to challenge the rigidity of Dutch city planning, giving people more freedom \u2013 and responsibility \u2013 over the urban design process. The area, which has about 5,000 residents and a growing waiting list, is completely self-sufficient. Residents can build houses however they like, and must collaborate with others to figure out things such as street names, waste management, roads, and even schools. But the local government has included one extremely unusual requirement: about half of each plot must be devoted to urban agriculture. \u201cThis rule \u2013 if you want to live in Oosterwold, you have to produce food on at least 50% of your property \u2013 is very unique thinking in the world, and makes it also an outstanding area in many ways,\u201d says Jan Eelco Jansma, a researcher at Wageningen University &amp; Research, who has studied Almere for years and inspired the city to include urban agriculture in the planning of Oosterwold. Rositsa T Ilieva, the director of policy at the City University of New York\u2019s Urban Food Policy Institute, also highlighted its novelty. \u201cWhile other cities have integrated urban agriculture into planning, few have implemented it as a non-negotiable land-use requirement or handed so much responsibility for development to residents,\u201d she said. Residents can be quite creative with the brief. Oosterwold, which has about 1,000 residential units, is a sprawl of all sorts of gardens, from greenhouses to pastures surrounded by moats. \u201cNobody is doing it in the same way,\u201d de Kat says. \u201cYou have to find your own recipe.\u201d Some, like de Kat, have turned their gardens into an Eden of sorts to provide for their own household unit. Other residents just plant a few apple trees or outsource by owning plots of land on site that are tended to by professional farmers. Others, such as Jalil Bekkour, have been able to capitalise on it. \u201cI never had experience gardening my own food or anything like that,\u201d he said. But he taught himself how to garden, and three years ago he opened his own restaurant, Atelier Feddan, where 80% of the food is directly from Oosterwold. His newfound excitement for gardening and agriculture is palpable: he regards his garden as a \u201cfield lab\u201d of sorts to help develop products for the restaurant. While the climate crisis threatens the area, it can also provide ample opportunity. As Bekkour explains, Oosterwold now has the same climate France had 40 years ago. Because of this, food crops such as avocados and citrus trees can easily be grown outside rather than in a greenhouse. Time is a constraint, as perfecting a plot takes extra care. \u201cYou fail and you try again,\u201d Bekkour says. Residents also worry about the fact there is no real guidance about how to make your plot successful. \u201cIn the planning, it was kind of a bit laissez-faire,\u201d says Jansma. \u201cBut if you want to develop such a new area in such an innovative way and at such a scale, you have to share responsibilities.\u201d A new centre called the Food Hub has now opened, devoted to collecting and processing food as well as knowledge sharing. The centre is run by the Almere local authority as well as the Oosterwold food cooperative. Yolanda Sikking, the participation manager for Oosterwold, hopes it will help inspire residents to take more initiative. \u201cSome people do it very well but others don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cWe decided we have to stimulate more.\u201d The eventual goal is to provide 10% of Almere\u2019s food, which many see as ambitious but hopefully doable in time. Residents and experts alike also emphasise the potential for replicability. \u201cSome of the things that we do could be implemented in other places in the Netherlands and beyond,\u201d says Jan-Albert Blaauw, a resident of Oosterwold and founder of the city\u2019s food cooperative. \u201cThere are a lot of examples around the world where planners think about urban agriculture, but in fact still separate agriculture and urbanisation by developing agroparks or sites where agriculture can do what it does normally and prevent an encroachment in these areas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it still is excluding agriculture.\u201d Ilieva believes that the participatory principles behind the Oosterwold plan and its implementation and local food production are widely applicable. \u201cBy prioritising agriculture as a land use, planners and residents together can work to reconfigure peri-urban spaces marked for residential development into vibrant, multifunctional areas that advance ecological, social, and economic goals,\u201d she says. Lessons can be learned from other projects as well. Jason Hawes co-authored a 2024 study that found carbon emissions from urban agriculture can be higher than from conventional agriculture. While the study did not evaluate a community like Oosterwold, there were some relevant ideas to be gleaned from it. Hawes says: \u201cFor example, we found that infrastructure installed early in the farm-garden setup was a particularly important contributor to the carbon footprint of fruits and vegetables grown there, so it can be useful to prioritise long-term use of infrastructure as well as finding reclaimed or reused materials to support the initial construction.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to start on as large a scale as Oosterwold did. \u201cThe first thing I tell people is to start small,\u201d Bekkour says. \u201cStart with the things you love to eat and the easy stuff.\u201d De Kat says: \u201cYou can do this with a strong vision and strong person.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2024 to clarify that Oosterwold is east of Amsterdam, not \u201cin the north-east of the Netherlands\u201d, as a previous version said.",

When I was a child I used to get the Beano, the Dandy, Whizzer and Chips, Cor!!, Mandy, Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, the Hulk \u2026 I love all comics. I was actually in the Beano. I was on the Tom, Dick and Sally page, saying to Sally, \u201cCome and have a slap-up meal with me\u201d, and we have a meal while the others are peering through the window, looking jealous. I was on the letters page once too, and one time I was invited up to the DC Thomson offices, which was just brilliant. I still get the Beano, the Dandy and a couple of others every Christmas. \u2022 How Did This Happen and What Does It Now Mean is out now",

Cry Freedom (1987)</h2> <p>Already radiating charisma, and sporting a credible South African accent, Denzel Washington earned the first of his 10 Oscar nominations for this portrayal of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. Alas, Richard Attenborough\u2019s well-meaning film seems more preoccupied with the fate of the white journalist (Kevin Kline as Donald Woods) on whose book this was based.</p> <h2>19. Antwone Fisher (2002)</h2> <p>Washington\u2019s directing debut is a heartfelt biopic adapted by Fisher from his own autobiography. Derek Luke plays a troubled US Navy seaman; Denzel plays the psychiatrist trying to get him to talk about the abuse he suffered as a child. It\u2019s by the numbers, but generous and effective.</p> <h2>18. The Magnificent Seven (2016)</h2>    <p>Antoine Fuqua\u2019s gloriously woke remake of the 1960 western, itself a remake of Seven Samurai, is no classic, but it is a blast. Washington, in his only western, is a no-brainer for the Yul Brynner role, but, unlike Brynner, knows how not to be upstaged by his fancy co-stars. The film loses points for too much Chris Pratt, though.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/feb/15/denzel-washington-were-not-here-because-of-oscarssowhite-video-interview\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"Denzel Washington: \u2018We\u2019re not here because of #OscarsSoWhite\u2019 \u2013\u00a0video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58a2e3d1e4b012eeb30c9be8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/14/170214FencesJunket_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/02/14/170214FencesJunket.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/02/14/170214FencesJunket_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2017/feb/15/denzel-washington-were-not-here-because-of-oscarssowhite-video-interview\">Denzel Washington: \u2018We\u2019re not here because of #OscarsSoWhite\u2019 \u2013&nbsp;video interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>17. Fences (2016)</h2> <p>Washington and Viola Davis both won Tonys for their performances in the Broadway revival of August Wilson\u2019s play about the travails of a garbage collector in 1950s Pittsburgh. They recreate their roles for Washington\u2019s screen version, and the acting is impeccable (Davis won an Oscar), though the results are, inevitably, dialogue-heavy.</p> <h2>16. American Gangster (2007)</h2> <p>Washington, dapper as 1970s Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, shares top billing with Russell Crowe as his rumpled detective nemesis in Ridley Scott\u2019s game stab at a Godfather-style epic. It doesn\u2019t reach those heights, but there are some brilliant moments. Oh hello, Idris Elba!</p> <h2>15. The Equalizer (2014)</h2>    <p>Down with vigilante violence and all, but it\u2019s hard to resist Washington equalising bad guys in his three outings as ex-marine Robert McCall in Fuqua\u2019s reimagining of the 1980s TV series. The first, in which he equalises the Russian mob, is the least preposterous and stages its finale in a Homebase store.</p> <h2>14. Unstoppable (2010)</h2> <p>In an action thriller inspired by real events, Washington plays a veteran engineer trying to stop a runaway locomotive from blowing up half of Pennsylvania. Tony Scott, teaming up with the star for a fifth and final time, serves up the hurtling hardware in white-knuckle style, with the blue-collar milieu providing welcome down-to-earth detail.</p> <h2>13. Gladiator II (2024)</h2>    <p>\u201cThat, my friend, is politicsssssssss.\u201d As a devious ex-slave dripping with bling, Washington has such a ball channelling Macbeth and Lady Kaede (from Akira Kurosawa\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/28/akira-kurosawa-king-lear-story-ran-4k-restoration#:~:text=By%20turns%20achingly%20delicate,the%20themes%20of%20King%20Lear.\">Ran</a>) into a scene-stealing masterclass, you only wish the film could have been his story rather than miscast Paul Mescal\u2019s.</p> <h2>12. Man on Fire (2004)</h2> <p>The second of Washington\u2019s collaborations with Tony Scott showcases one of his best performances, though the film itself, set in Mexico City, is an ugly encomium to vigilantism. The star plays Creasy, an alcoholic ex-CIA bodyguard who bonds with the cute kid (Dakota Fanning) he is protecting. So when she gets kidnapped (some protection!), he goes medieval on everyone\u2019s ass.</p> <h2>11. Out of Time (2003)</h2> <p>Washington plays a local police chief in Florida whose attempts to help his mistress go horribly wrong, plunging him up to his neck in arson and murder. Meanwhile, the investigating cop (Eva Mendes) turns out to be the wife who is divorcing him. Perhaps it\u2019s too upbeat to be truly noir, but our man, as always, gives it just the right amount of gravitas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/16/gladiator-ii-battles-baboons-mescal-and-denzel-discuss-with-spoilers\">Gladiator II: battles, baboons, Mescal and Denzel \u2013 discuss with spoilers</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>10. Philadelphia (1993)</h2>    <p>Tom Hanks gets the showy Oscar-winning role as an HIV-positive attorney fired by his firm, but it\u2019s Washington who gets the character arc, doing subtle work as the homophobic lawyer who takes him on as a client. The first big Hollywood film about Aids, deftly directed by Jonathan Demme, is a blockbuster public service announcement (you don\u2019t catch it from shaking hands), but it works.</p> <h2>9. Fallen (1998)</h2> <p>As an upright Philadelphia cop, Washington grapples with an evil entity that hops from host to host (including a nice ginger cat) and makes people sing like Mick Jagger. Messages in 2,000-year-old Aramaic, contorted yellowish demon-o-vision and lines like \u201cApocalypse \u2026 does that mean anything to you?\u201d add up to a bundle of demonic fun.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rgYUipGJNo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4rgYUipGJNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rgYUipGJNo\">Watch a trailer for Gladiator II.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>8. Glory (1989)</h2> <p>After six seasons on TV\u2019s St Elsewhere and leading roles in several low-budget films, Washington first staked his claim to greatness with his Oscar-winning performance as Silas Trip, a runaway slave who enlists in the 54th Massachusetts Regiment in Edward Zwick\u2019s stirring American civil war epic. If you can watch the assault on Fort Wagner without blubbing, you\u2019re not human.</p> <h2>7. Crimson Tide (1995)</h2> <p>Washington goes head to head against Gene Hackman in Tony Scott\u2019s submarine thriller, with electrifying results. Denzel plays the voice of reason in the most serious standoff since the Cuban missile crisis, with Hackman so persuasive as the hawkish captain you can almost see his point as he prepares to trigger world war three.</p> <h2>6. Deja Vu (2006)</h2> <p>The hunt for a New Orleans ferry bomber veers into time-travelling, but Washington, playing an ATF agent, keeps the wacky shenanigans grounded. Thanks to Val Kilmer\u2019s tech team, he ends up toggling between past and present while trying to save the life of a dead bombing victim. Confused? You will be, but there\u2019s never a dull moment in Tony Scott\u2019s sci-fi action-adventure.</p> <h2>5. The Hurricane (1999)</h2>    <p>Norman Jewison, social justice specialist, directs this expertly crafted biopic of Rubin \u201cHurricane\u201d Carter, the New Jersey boxer (and subject of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpZvg_FjL3Q\">Bob Dylan song</a>) who spent almost 20 years behind bars for murders he didn\u2019t commit. And who better to play Carter than Denzel, super-fit in the black-and-white boxing scenes, ageing three decades and earning an Oscar nomination for another performance so effortless it makes you forget he\u2019s acting.</p> <h2>4. The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021)</h2> <p>Washington is no stranger to Shakespeare on stage, but \u2013 after an earlier supporting role in Much Ado About Nothing \u2013 one of the finest actors of his generation finally gets to play one of the great tragic villains on screen in an unexpectedly low-key performance in Joel Coen\u2019s stark monochrome adaptation. Denzel is playing <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/legit/news/denzel-washington-jake-gyllenhaal-broadway-othello-1235932087/\">Othello on Broadway</a> next year; let\u2019s hope someone is planning a film version.</p> <h2>3. Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)</h2> <p>Washington convinces you he was born to play Ezekiel \u201cEasy\u201d Rawlins in this \u201cnoir noir\u201d directed and adapted from Walter Mosley\u2019s novel by Carl Franklin. With its private eye scouring 1940s Los Angeles for a missing femme fatale, this has all the ingredients for a classic Chandleresque mystery, with its hero\u2019s skin colour adding pep to the cliches. In a just world it would have spawned a franchise.</p> <h2>2. Training Day (2001)</h2> <p>In the first of five collaborations with Fuqua, Washington sinks his teeth into a juicy villainous role, and won an Oscar for it. Alonzo Harris is a swaggering streetwise cop showing a rookie (Ethan Hawke) the ropes as they cruise around Los Angeles, but he has a hidden agenda. The story hinges too much on coincidence, but Harris is such deliciously wicked company we\u2019ll allow it.</p> <h2>1. Malcolm X (1992)</h2>    <p>Spike Lee\u2019s epic biopic and most exhilarating joint, entertaining as well as educational, traces the career of the human rights activist from flashily dressed hoodlum via a Pauline conversion in jail to inspirational spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Washington bestrides the film like a colossus, nailing every nuance of the role \u2013 only to be robbed of an Oscar by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_of_a_Woman_(1992_film)\">one of Al Pacino\u2019s lesser performances</a>.</p>",

With headline inflation accelerating and economic sentiment stabilising, opposition against a 50 basis point rate cut at the December meeting will grow stronger.</p> <p>German headline inflation came in at an annual rate of 2.2%, up from 2% in October. Back in September, headline inflation was still at 1.6%. Another inflation measure, harmonised to compare with other EU countries, stayed at 2.4%, unchanged from October.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s rebound in German inflation was mainly the result of less favourable energy base effects, while at the same the timing of school vacation during the fall season inserted downward pressure on headline inflation. </p> <p>Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level still looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects will continue petering out while wages are increasing. However, with the current turning of the labour market, wage growth should come down more significantly than previously thought, leading to more disinflationary pressures next year. As a result, we continue to expect inflation to remain within the broad range of between 2% and 2.5% in 2025.</p> <p>With today\u2019s surprise (meagre) improvement in eurozone sentiment and now German inflation, some ECB members might start doubting both the October rate cut decision and the opening to even larger rate cuts at the December meeting. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Folowing last week\u2019s declining PMIs, the European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator brought a small positive surprise.</strong></p> <p>The indicator ticked up to 95.8, from 95.7 in October. Industry showed a small improvement, while sentiment in services and among consumers dropped. Price expectations in industry increased to their highest level this year, while price expectations in services came down. </p> <p>Brzeski added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What remains is the genuine idea of almost all ECB officials that the rate-cutting cycle will continue. The only question is for how long and how far. Yesterday\u2019s remarks by <strong>Isabel Schnabel</strong> clearly stressed the hawkish case, which is one of a very gradual process of cutting rates. However, even more important than the debate about 50bp or 25bp at the December meeting is the question of how far the ECB will eventually go with rate cuts. Here, Schnabel tried to mark her preferred terminal rate of between 2% and 3%, while <strong>Philip Lane</strong>\u2019s comments earlier on suggested that the ECB could clearly go below any neutral interest rate level next year. </p> <p>In any case, having been slow to address rising inflation and arguably late in stopping rate hikes last year, the ECB now appears determined to get ahead of the curve and return interest rates to neutral as quickly as possible. For the doves, this is a no-brainer, and for the hawks, the argument might be that getting rates back to neutral quickly could be enough to avoid another episode of unconventional monetary policy with quantitative easing and negative interest rates further down the line. Today\u2019s macro data releases in the eurozone, however, should encourage the ECB hawks to object to a 50bp rate cut in December and the case for a 25bp rate cut is growing.</p> <p>In fact, a 50bp rate cut decision would be a security move to preempt any potential risks for the eurozone economy coming from the next US administration\u2019s potential economic policy choices. A 25bp rate cut decision would rather follow the cautious meeting-by-meeting approach, though running the risk of not yet getting ahead of the curve. We will wait for tomorrow\u2019s eurozone inflation numbers to finally make up our minds.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-674861eb8f088c7046fdeb26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T12:29:17.248Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our full story on <strong>Direct Line</strong> shares surging by 43% following news of <strong>Aviva</strong>\u2019s \u00a33.3bn offer for the company to create an insurance giant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/28/shares-in-direct-line-surge-after-insurer-rejects-33bn-bid-from-aviva\">Shares in Direct Line soar after insurer rejects \u00a33.3bn bid from Aviva</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67485af38f0816561c49dcce\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T11:59:40.621Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK hospitality group Loungers to be bought by US firm Fortress</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The cafe bar business <strong>Loungers</strong> has agreed to be bought by a US investment group in a deal that values it at about \u00a3338m.</p> <p><strong>Fortress Investment Group</strong> said it had made an offer for the UK hospitality group through a newly formed investment vehicle.</p> <p>Loungers is the latest London-listed company to strike a deal with an international private equity group.

A measure of consumer expectations for the next three months worsened slightly to -19 in November, from -17 in October.</p> <p>At the same time, people\u2019s expectations for their own personal financial situation improved slightly to -3 this month from -4 in October.</p> <p>Personal retail spending expectations improved slightly ahead of Christmas, to +3 from +2, while personal spending overall remained at +17, and personal saving stayed at -9.</p> <p><strong>Helen Dickinson</strong>, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was little shift in consumer confidence since the chancellor\u2019s budget, with many worried about the economy in the lead up to Christmas. While there was a very slight improvement in people\u2019s expectations of their personal financial situation, this was offset by declining expectations of the wider economy.</p> <p>Personal retail spending remained positive, edging up slightly, though this was to be expected as consumers prepare for the festive season. Within this, non-food spending expectations remained low, though expectations of spending on eating out improved the most out of all categories, as people prepare for Christmas catchups with friends and relatives.</p> <p>The last month clearly did little to shift the dial for households either positively or negatively, however, the same cannot be said for the retail industry. With over \u00a37bn in additional costs in 2025 resulting from the budget, retailers will have little choice but to raise prices or reduce investment in jobs and shops. To mitigate this, government must ensure that changes to the business rates system, planned for 2026, bring about a meaningful reduction in bills for all retailers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Last night, Aviva, the UK\u2019s biggest insurer, revealed that it had made a \u00a33.3bn approach to buy its smaller UK rival Direct Line \u2013 but was rejected.</strong></p> <p>Let\u2019s see how the shares respond when markets open at 8am.

Renewi is leading gains on the FTSE 250, rocketing by 45% to 803p after Australian fund management and banking group Macquarie said it had reached a preliminary agreement to buy the firm for \u00a3700m in the latest takeover of a London-listed firm. Direct Line is in second place, up by 41.6% to 224.8p, while its suitor Aviva is the third-biggest loser on the FTSE 100, down 2.8%. Aviva revealed last night that it had made an indicative offer of \u00a33.3bn for its smaller insurance rival but was rebuffed. Analysts say that while the offer (at 250p a share) looks reasonable, Aviva may have to raise it to clinch a deal \u2013 to 265p or potentially as high as 300p a share. Aviva wants the board of Direct Line to engage with it \u2013 and is hoping that the firm\u2019s shareholders will put pressure on the board to do so. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK Glass cases house beautifully displayed arm-candy at the latest new entry on a reviving Oxford Street in central London. This is not a designer handbag purveyor but a store dedicated to Ikea\u2019s signature bright blue Frakta carrier bag \u2013 a pop-up shop paving the way for the home furnishing retailer\u2019s delayed move into a larger store on-site, which is due to open next year. Filled with quirky social-media-friendly gimmicks including a service button to call up blue candy floss from a curtained window and a blue mirrored room intended to mimic entering a Frakta bag, the small shop has opened after construction issues prompted delays to the main store. Ikea had originally hoped to open the larger store last autumn, but building work was delayed by problems including water leaking into the basement. Peter Jelkeby, the boss of Ikea\u2019s UK arm, says he is confident the larger store will open in the spring. \u201cIf you went in now, you would see walkways and walls are up \u2013 the foundations are there,\u201d he says of the 5,000 sq ft store, which will take up the ground floor and basement of the former Topshop site by Oxford Circus. The upper floors will become offices. \u201cIt is a massive project to put this store together and we are where we are with time lines but it is quite clear we will open in the spring,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a step towards the bigger store.\u201d On the stock markets, the two UK takeover targets \u2013 car insurer Direct Line and the waste management firm Renewi \u2013 are both still trading more than 40% higher. Renewi is leading gains on the FTSE 250, rocketing by 45% to 803.6p after Australian fund management and banking group Macquarie said it had reached a preliminary agreement to buy the firm for \u00a3700m in the latest takeover of a London-listed firm. Direct Line is in second place, up by 41.6% to 224.8p, while its suitor Aviva is the second-biggest loser on the FTSE 100, down 2.7%. Aviva revealed last night that it had made an indicative offer of \u00a33.3bn for is smaller insurance rival but was rebuffed. Analysts say that while the offer (at 250p a share) seems pretty reasonable, Aviva may have to raise it \u2013 potentially as high as 300p a share. The FTSE 100 index as a whole has ticked up by 0.2% to 8,288, while the FTSE 250 is 0.9% ahead. Wall Street is closed today for Thanksgiving. The just-released flash estimate of German inflation in November wraps up a good day for hawks at the European Central Bank, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. With headline inflation accelerating and economic sentiment stabilising, opposition against a 50 basis point rate cut at the December meeting will grow stronger. German headline inflation came in at an annual rate of 2.2%, up from 2% in October. Back in September, headline inflation was still at 1.6%. Another inflation measure, harmonised to compare with other EU countries, stayed at 2.4%, unchanged from October. Today\u2019s rebound in German inflation was mainly the result of less favourable energy base effects, while at the same the timing of school vacation during the fall season inserted downward pressure on headline inflation. Looking ahead, the stickiness of inflation at slightly too high a level still looks set to continue as favourable energy base effects will continue petering out while wages are increasing. However, with the current turning of the labour market, wage growth should come down more significantly than previously thought, leading to more disinflationary pressures next year. As a result, we continue to expect inflation to remain within the broad range of between 2% and 2.5% in 2025. With today\u2019s surprise (meagre) improvement in eurozone sentiment and now German inflation, some ECB members might start doubting both the October rate cut decision and the opening to even larger rate cuts at the December meeting. Folowing last week\u2019s declining PMIs, the European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator brought a small positive surprise. The indicator ticked up to 95.8, from 95.7 in October. Industry showed a small improvement, while sentiment in services and among consumers dropped. Price expectations in industry increased to their highest level this year, while price expectations in services came down. Brzeski added: What remains is the genuine idea of almost all ECB officials that the rate-cutting cycle will continue. The only question is for how long and how far. Yesterday\u2019s remarks by Isabel Schnabel clearly stressed the hawkish case, which is one of a very gradual process of cutting rates. However, even more important than the debate about 50bp or 25bp at the December meeting is the question of how far the ECB will eventually go with rate cuts. Here, Schnabel tried to mark her preferred terminal rate of between 2% and 3%, while Philip Lane\u2019s comments earlier on suggested that the ECB could clearly go below any neutral interest rate level next year. In any case, having been slow to address rising inflation and arguably late in stopping rate hikes last year, the ECB now appears determined to get ahead of the curve and return interest rates to neutral as quickly as possible. For the doves, this is a no-brainer, and for the hawks, the argument might be that getting rates back to neutral quickly could be enough to avoid another episode of unconventional monetary policy with quantitative easing and negative interest rates further down the line. Today\u2019s macro data releases in the eurozone, however, should encourage the ECB hawks to object to a 50bp rate cut in December and the case for a 25bp rate cut is growing. In fact, a 50bp rate cut decision would be a security move to preempt any potential risks for the eurozone economy coming from the next US administration\u2019s potential economic policy choices. A 25bp rate cut decision would rather follow the cautious meeting-by-meeting approach, though running the risk of not yet getting ahead of the curve. We will wait for tomorrow\u2019s eurozone inflation numbers to finally make up our minds. Here\u2019s our full story on Direct Line shares surging by 43% following news of Aviva\u2019s \u00a33.3bn offer for the company to create an insurance giant. The cafe bar business Loungers has agreed to be bought by a US investment group in a deal that values it at about \u00a3338m. Fortress Investment Group said it had made an offer for the UK hospitality group through a newly formed investment vehicle. Loungers is the latest London-listed company to strike a deal with an international private equity group. Operating the Lounge, Cosy Club and Brightside brands, it has 280 venues across the country. Fortress has offered 310p for each Loungers share, which represents a premium of about 30% to its closing price on Wednesday. The deal values the entire share capital of Loungers at about \u00a3338.3m, the companies said. Forget designer fashion and jewellery, trendy versions of pantry staples such as extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar and tinned fish have become middle-class lust objects for home cooks, according to a new report. A food cupboard stocked with chic glass bottles, jars and decorative tins (in the front row at least) has become a status symbol, according to Waitrose\u2019s annual food and drink report. For example, demand for premium extra virgin olive oil has grown by 15% this year, while for apple cider vinegar the figure is 6%. Meanwhile, sales of Cornish salt flakes are up by 79% year on year. Elinor Griffin, the supermarket\u2019s oils &amp; vinegar buyer, said people were \u201cproudly showcasing\u201d their pantry staples in their kitchens. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a gorgeous bottle of olive oil or raw apple cider vinegar, or artisanal flavoured salts, it\u2019s a great way to spark conversation and show off your chef credentials,\u201d she said. In other news\u2026 The City regulator has bowed to pressure over plans to \u201cname and shame\u201d some companies it investigates, offering watered-down proposals that would give firms 10 days\u2019 notice and consider the \u201cpotential negative impact\u201d of revealing the identities of companies under inspection. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) put forward new proposals on Thursday after months of intense criticism from businesses, which have tried to thwart the watchdog\u2019s plans to be more transparent with the public and whistleblowers when it is investigating potential wrongdoing across the City. The government had also threatened to intervene, with the City minister, Tulip Siddiq, having told the watchdog to rethink its plans, and suggested she could overrule the FCA. Here\u2019s our full story: The asset manager Macquarie has launched a \u00a3700m offer to buy the waste management company Renewi in the latest takeover of a London-listed firm. The two companies have reached a preliminary agreement on the financial terms of a deal that values Renewi at 870p a share, a 57% premium to its closing price of 554p on Wednesday night. In a joint statement, they said the terms of the deal were final, and Renewi has agreed to provide Macquarie with access to its books so confirmatory due diligence can be conducted. The agreement comes a year after Macquarie was thwarted in a previous attempt to take over Renewi, when an offer worth 810p a share was rejected. Renewi, formerly known as Shanks Group until a 2017 rebrand, sold its UK municipal bin-collecting business to the rival Biffa earlier this year. Macquarie said it had talked to three of Renewi\u2019s largest shareholders in September \u2013 Coast Capital Management, Avenue Europe International Management and Paradice Investment Management \u2013 who between them own or control 19% of the company\u2019s shares. As a result, the bank has received irrevocable undertakings from 15% of the shares in support of the offer. Renewi said: The board remains confident in Renewi\u2019s prospects as a pure-play market leader in Europe\u2019s most advanced recycling markets. The board is also confident in Renewi\u2019s strategy and execution plan to deliver a step change in margins and cash flow. That said, the board has also carefully balanced the likely value creation from the continued delivery of Renewi\u2019s strategic plan against the various risks faced by Renewi, the strong value crystallisation in cash at a meaningful premium to the current Renewi share price and the views of Renewi shareholders. Accordingly, the board of Renewi has concluded that the proposal outlined above is at a value that the board would be minded to recommend to Renewi shareholders, should a firm intention to make an offer \u2026 be announced on such financial terms, subject to the agreement of all other terms and conditions of an offer. As such, the board has agreed to provide Macquarie with access to confirmatory due diligence. In other takeover news, the Australian investment bank Macquarie has just agreed to buy the UK-listed waste management company Renewi for \u00a3700m. Macquarie is paying 870p a share in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. It is billed as a \u201cfinal possible offer\u201d. Macquarie had walked away more than a year ago after its 810p a share offer was rejected, but has returned. Renewi shares jumped by nearly 43% to 795p on the news. Renewi has sold its UK operations, and mainly operates in the Benelux countries. It is listed on the London stock exchange\u2019s FTSE 250 and Euronext Amsterdam. Direct Line shares are still rocketing, now up by nearly 41% to 223.6p. Insurance analysts William Hawkins, Darius Satkauskas and Michele Ballatore at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods said: We are always cautious about the bidder\u2019s curse, but we believe Aviva\u2019s approach to Direct Line is strategically coherent, could offer considerable synergies, and is currently highly financially attractive. The main risk for Aviva is that it seems to be stretching an already below-average solvency ratio, so any further generosity would need to come from shares. We can see an offer rising from the current 250p to around 300p. Jefferies analysts Philip Kett and James Pearse said they believe that \u201ca higher offer might be forthcoming if the board considered engaging with Aviva\u201d. Direct Line has rejected its third bid this year, this time from a new suitor, Aviva, who in offering 112.5p in cash and 0.282 new Aviva shares values Direct Line at 250p per share. Given that this is a relatively small uplift from the previous two offers, and the consideration is similarly split between cash and shares, we are unsurprised that the bid was rejected. Previously, we suggested that the capital and expense synergies available to an acquirer mean that an offer of at least 270p would be more realistic. With this in mind, while we agree with Direct Line\u2019s rejection of the offer, we do believe that a higher offer might be forthcoming if the board considered engaging with Aviva. Peel Hunt analyst Andreas van Embden described Aviva\u2019s offer as reasonable, but could be sweetened to up to 265p a share. The offer is reasonable, in our view, discounts Direct Line Group (DLG\u2019s) full recovery potential, and includes a bid premium in our view. The rejection of Aviva\u2019s proposal reflects the board\u2019s confidence in DLG\u2019s standalone outlook but we still believe engaging with Aviva makes sense. Aviva could be persuaded to sweeten the deal to 260p-265p, which may help satisfy the DLG board. There is downside risk to DLG\u2019s standalone strategy and retaining some upside in an Aviva-DLG combination could be an attractive proposition, which is worth exploring in our view. Direct Line shares have rocketed on the news, rising by 39% to above 220p. Van Embden added: He said despite Direct Line\u2019s healthy capital position, the recovery could be \u201cbumpier than anticipated earlier this summer\u201d. Engaging with Aviva to fully explore their offer in more detail would make sense in our view. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Direct Line is playing hard to get, again, as the board rejects a tentative takeover offer from Aviva on the grounds that the 250p per share on the table significantly undervalues the company. It\u2019s not a clean offer; the 250p would be split half as cash and half as Aviva shares, which always makes things a little more complicated. Direct Line is no stranger to takeover offers, having rejected multiple attempts from Belgian insurer Ageas earlier in the year. There\u2019s a case to be made that Aviva is a better suiter, given it already shares markets with Direct Line in the UK, but it\u2019ll need to up its game - and its offer - if it wants Direct Line to take the proposal seriously. Direct Line shares jumped as much as 38%, after news last night that Aviva has swooped on it with a takeover approach \u2013 which Direct Line has rejected. Meanwhile, Aviva shares have fallen by 2.7% at the open, making the UK\u2019s largest insurer one of the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 index this morning. Rival insurer Admiral is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up by 3%. Direct Line shares are the top riser on the FTSE 250 index, rising above 218p, still some way below the indicative bid price of 250p. Aviva has offered to pay 112.5p in cash plus 0.282 new Aviva shares for every Direct Line share, making the offer worth 250p a share, based on Aviva\u2019s share price at 488p a share on 18 November, the day before it made the takeover approach. Direct Line has rejected the indicative offer as \u201copportunistic,\u201d but some analysts disagree. Panmure Gordon analyst Abid Hussain said: We believe that an offer at around 250p per share or slightly above is good for Direct Line shareholders. The offer represents a 60% premium to Direct Line\u2019s shares on 18 Nov. Or 57.5% premium to close yesterday. Direct Line is in the middle of a turnaround after a string of profit warnings and a new management team \u2013 largely ex Aviva including the CEO Andy Winslow and CFO Jane Poole), some of whom have not even started yet. Hussain said: The Competition and Markets Authority will have a view on the combined group BUT we assume that Aviva have considered this and have discounted it as being an issue. We understand that the combined motor market share would be less than Admiral\u2019s but in home, where Aviva has a market share of 12%, the combined group would be No.1. No cost savings/ synergies have been disclosed but we assume at least 10% as being a likely figure. Aviva have stated that cost synergies will be in excess of the \u00a3100m cost savings that Direct Line have previously identified itself. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Confidence among British consumers has remained weak as Christmas approaches. More people worry about the state of the economy than before the autumn budget, according to the British Retail Consortium\u2019s latest survey. A measure of consumer expectations for the next three months worsened slightly to -19 in November, from -17 in October. At the same time, people\u2019s expectations for their own personal financial situation improved slightly to -3 this month from -4 in October. Personal retail spending expectations improved slightly ahead of Christmas, to +3 from +2, while personal spending overall remained at +17, and personal saving stayed at -9. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said: There was little shift in consumer confidence since the chancellor\u2019s budget, with many worried about the economy in the lead up to Christmas. While there was a very slight improvement in people\u2019s expectations of their personal financial situation, this was offset by declining expectations of the wider economy. Personal retail spending remained positive, edging up slightly, though this was to be expected as consumers prepare for the festive season. Within this, non-food spending expectations remained low, though expectations of spending on eating out improved the most out of all categories, as people prepare for Christmas catchups with friends and relatives. The last month clearly did little to shift the dial for households either positively or negatively, however, the same cannot be said for the retail industry. With over \u00a37bn in additional costs in 2025 resulting from the budget, retailers will have little choice but to raise prices or reduce investment in jobs and shops. To mitigate this, government must ensure that changes to the business rates system, planned for 2026, bring about a meaningful reduction in bills for all retailers. Last night, Aviva, the UK\u2019s biggest insurer, revealed that it had made a \u00a33.3bn approach to buy its smaller UK rival Direct Line \u2013 but was rejected. Let\u2019s see how the shares respond when markets open at 8am. We\u2019ll monitor any developments.

      "bodyText": "The writer and director Richard Curtis has revealed that he had been planning a follow-up to romcom hit Notting Hill in which the lead characters split up. Speaking to IndieWire to promote forthcoming animation That Christmas, Curtis \u2013 who has previously overseen short spin-offs of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually in aid of Comic Relief \u2013 said he had envisioned a similar \u201cmini sequel\u201d to Notting Hill. The 1999 romcom starred Julia Roberts as a superstar actor and Hugh Grant as the bumbling bookshop owner with whom she falls in love. The ending shows that the pair have got married and are expecting a child. \u201cI tried doing one with Notting Hill,\u201d said Curtis, \u201cwhere they were going to get divorced.\u201d The project was halted by Roberts, he added, who \u201cthought that was a very poor idea\u201d. In 2020, during a Q&amp;A for HBO show The Undoing, Grant suggested a similar idea, saying: \u201cI would like to do a sequel to one of my own romantic comedies that shows what happened after those films ended. Really, to prove the terrible lie that they all were, that it was a happy ending.\u201d The actor specifically cited Notting Hill in his proposal, adding: \u201cI\u2019d like to do me and Julia and the hideous divorce that\u2019s ensued with really expensive lawyers, children involved in [a] tug of love, floods of tears. Psychologically scarred for ever. I\u2019d love to do that film.\u201d Grant, who is currently promoting horror film Heretic and will be return as the dastardly Daniel Cleaver in next year\u2019s Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, recently told Vanity Fair that he thinks his character in Notting Hill is \u201cdespicable\u201d. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m flicking the channels at home after a few drinks and this comes up, I just think, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t my character have any balls?\u2019\u201d Grant said. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene in this film where she\u2019s in my house and the paps come to the front door and ring the bell and I think I just let her go past me and open the door.

When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and the Montgomery bus boycott began in earnest that December, Gilmore was ready.

It\u2019s a way to keep Black people on [activists\u2019] minds, even if they\u2019re not thinking about the food that deeply. It\u2019s doing the work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a mnemonic device that reminds you where you\u2019re from</p> <footer> <cite>Michael W Twitty</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though sweet potato pie resonates with Black people, they didn\u2019t invent it, says Michael W Twitty, a James Beard award-winning food historian. Perhaps because they were a reputed aphrodisiac, King Henry VIII was fond of sweet potatoes. \u201cHenry ate his sweet potatoes in heavily spiced and sugared pies,\u201d writes Larry Zuckerman in his book, The Potato: How the Humble Spud Rescued the Western World. A citation on foodtimeline.org says pies of this time might have had a crust on top made from flour mixed with suet, lard or butter; Henry\u2019s sweet potato pie might also have contained meat, Twitty says.</p> <p>However, Black cooks in the south perfected the pie, leading to the dessert we know today, with its distinctive single crust and caramelized flavors. Abby Fisher, an Alabama chef who cooked for San Francisco society women, published the first sweet potato pie recipe in her 1881 book <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/08023680/\">What Mrs Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking</a>. Her compact proto-recipe tells the reader to boil 2lbs of sweet potatoes until soft, peel and mash them, then add a tablespoon of butter, five beaten eggs, a half-cup milk, sugar to taste, the juice of an orange plus half of its zest and a little salt. Then pour it into a single pie crust and bake quickly.</p>    <p>In their homeland, Africans ate yams (<em>Dioscorea rotundata</em>), another starchy tuber, and thought the sweet potato (<em>Ipomoea batata</em>) was inferior, calling it \u201cthe white man\u2019s yam\u201d, Twitty says. But finding themselves in a strange land, enslaved Africans in the Caribbean, Latin America and US embraced the nutritious sweet potato, whether it was orange Beauregard or Porto Ricos or rare white Haymans. \u201cThe most important starch tuber vegetable was the sweet potato,\u201d Twitty says.</p> <p>In the south and beyond, roasted sweet potato could evoke the same type of visceral reaction as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/19/proust-madeleine-cakes-started-as-toast-in-search-of-lost-time-manuscripts-reveal\">Proust\u2019s madeleine</a>. Free time was rare for enslaved people, so a pie was a treasured delicacy. \u201cWhen marginalized people adopt a food \u2026 [it\u2019s because it] makes you feel a certain way,\u201d says Twitty, whose sweet potato pie recipe in The Cooking Gene is flavored with spiced rum, sorghum and nutmeg. \u201cThat feeling during enslavement of: \u2018We don\u2019t have a lot of joy in our lives, but this gives us joy.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Subversive sweet potatoes</h2> <p>Every time there\u2019s a special event at Bethune-Cookman University, a historically Black college in Daytona Beach, Florida, sweet potato pie is on the menu. That\u2019s because the university\u2019s founder, Dr Mary McLeod Bethune, sold sweet potato pies to raise money for her first school, the Daytona Literary and Industrial Training Institute for Negro Girls.</p> <p>Bethune would dress up and bicycle over to Beach Street, an affluent commercial area where Black folks were not all that welcome in 1904. Selling sweet potato pies spiced with nutmeg and vanilla, she met the oil tycoon John D Rockefeller, who made a $62,000 donation (worth $2.2m today) to her school. Pie also led to a donation from James Gamble, co-founder of Procter &amp; Gamble, says Dr Clarissa West-White, archivist at Bethune-Cookman University.</p> <p>\u201cWe know she baked pies as a way to not only raise money for the school but also have a conversation. It was a clever marketing piece,\u201d says West-White. \u201cShe was able to get invited to meet other people who may not have been that thrilled about creating a school for Negroes. It was subversive.\u201d</p> <p>Bethune also targeted her message for her audience. She told them that she would be teaching domestic skills like baking, sewing and weaving; she omitted the part about English and Latin and other facets of liberal arts education she envisioned.</p> <p>Later in life, Bethune rarely cooked, but the pie story remains as an example of her ingenuity. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of how you can use something that seems pretty basic to really change history,\u201d West-White says.</p>    <p>That\u2019s not to say pumpkin pie doesn\u2019t have its own cultural meaning. The pie was linked to northern ways thanks to <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/sarah-hale\">Sarah Josepha Hale</a>, an influential 19th century New Hampshire poet and magazine editor. Her columns advocated for the abolition of slavery and for Thanksgiving to become a national holiday. She deemed pumpkin pies \u201can indispensable part of a good and true Yankee Thanksgiving\u201d in her 1827 novel, Northwood. When Abraham Lincoln made the holiday official in 1863, some southerners eschewed both Thanksgiving and pumpkin pie, clinging to their beloved sweet potato confection.</p> <h2>Comfort through pie</h2> <p>Sometimes the taste of a sweet potato pie is what you need to get through a rough time. As Dr Martin Luther King Jr signed copies of his book <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/stride-toward-freedom-montgomery-story\">Stride Toward Freedom: the Montgomery Story</a> at a Harlem department store in 1958, a Black woman with a psychiatric illness stabbed him with a letter opener. The blade stopped just shy of his aorta, and doctors performed a four-hour surgery to save his life. In a phone call after the surgery, ML, as his family called him, asked his sister-in-law <a href=\"https://www.times-herald.com/the-butterfly-queen-visits-east-coweta-high/article_c80bca56-158f-51e2-bfbb-96ae3edc411e.html\">Naomi Ruth Barber King</a> for one of her pies. His wife, Coretta, had the pie flown to the Harlem hospital. When she checked in on him, he told her: \u201cI\u2019m doing great because I\u2019m sitting here eating your sweet potato pie.\u201d</p> <p>In suburban Minneapolis, Rose McGee says she too learned how pie can brighten the darkest moments. Feeling distraught after Ferguson, Missouri, police killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown</a>, an unarmed 18-year-old Black man \u2013 and seeing a community in crisis \u2013 she started baking, joining in a family tradition. \u201cI was doing it usually just to uplift people,\u201d she says. \u201cI made a calling of it in 2014.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/22/holiday-tradition\">Tell us your unusual holiday traditions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McGee baked 30 pies made with her signature seasonings that include ginger, lemon extract and cinnamon, and then she and her son made the eight-hour drive from Minnesota to Missouri to share them. In a post for <a href=\"https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2021/02/15/fighting-for-justice-sweet-potato-pie-black-history-month\">King Arthur Baking</a>, McGee tells the story of meeting a young girl who was mourning alone at a makeshift memorial. McGee talked to her for a while, and asked if she would like a pie. \u201cWhat happened next rendered me speechless. She held the pie, rocked it, and began to cry. We both did,\u201d McGee writes.</p> <p>She knew she had found her calling. Her nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://www.sweetpotatocomfortpie.org\">Sweet Potato Comfort Pie</a> promotes healing, builds community and elevates Black people. She and fellow volunteers have shared thousands of pies with people who have suffered violence, from the family of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a> to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after the 2018 shooting.</p> <p>They\u2019re gearing up to bake 96 pies for their signature event, the MLK Holiday Weekend of Service, in January 2025. Volunteers come together and bake a number of sweet potato pies to match Dr King\u2019s age. The reaction they see when they gift their pies proves sweet potato pie isn\u2019t just pie.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mnemonic device that reminds you where you\u2019re from, who put love into this dish, who brought this dish to church supper,\u201d says Twitty. \u201cIt reminds you of the people who made it, their names and stories. And it\u2019s reminding you of the power of the Black contribution in American civilization.\u201d</p>",

When she checked in on him, he told her: \u201cI\u2019m doing great because I\u2019m sitting here eating your sweet potato pie.\u201d In suburban Minneapolis, Rose McGee says she too learned how pie can brighten the darkest moments. Feeling distraught after Ferguson, Missouri, police killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old Black man \u2013 and seeing a community in crisis \u2013 she started baking, joining in a family tradition. \u201cI was doing it usually just to uplift people,\u201d she says. \u201cI made a calling of it in 2014.\u201d McGee baked 30 pies made with her signature seasonings that include ginger, lemon extract and cinnamon, and then she and her son made the eight-hour drive from Minnesota to Missouri to share them. In a post for King Arthur Baking, McGee tells the story of meeting a young girl who was mourning alone at a makeshift memorial. McGee talked to her for a while, and asked if she would like a pie. \u201cWhat happened next rendered me speechless. She held the pie, rocked it, and began to cry. We both did,\u201d McGee writes. She knew she had found her calling. Her nonprofit organization Sweet Potato Comfort Pie promotes healing, builds community and elevates Black people. She and fellow volunteers have shared thousands of pies with people who have suffered violence, from the family of Philando Castile to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after the 2018 shooting. They\u2019re gearing up to bake 96 pies for their signature event, the MLK Holiday Weekend of Service, in January 2025. Volunteers come together and bake a number of sweet potato pies to match Dr King\u2019s age. The reaction they see when they gift their pies proves sweet potato pie isn\u2019t just pie. \u201cIt\u2019s a mnemonic device that reminds you where you\u2019re from, who put love into this dish, who brought this dish to church supper,\u201d says Twitty. \u201cIt reminds you of the people who made it, their names and stories. And it\u2019s reminding you of the power of the Black contribution in American civilization.\u201d",

Turning to the crossbench, the prime minister spoke about the importance of respect in politics but couldn\u2019t help himself when it came to an obligatory reference to the \u201cGreens political party\u201d. Respectful but fiercely competitive, Albanese is a Labor man who has shown himself to be as adept \u2013 or perhaps more so \u2013 at fighting Greenies as he is at fighting Tories. But after a year of quarrelling, the parties of the left have made up, and the Greens granted most of Albanese\u2019s Christmas wishes. Of the 31 government bills passed in the frenetic final day, 27 were passed through the Greens and Senate crossbench, and just four with the Coalition. \u201cThe outcomes that have been achieved today in the Senate are a direct result of having respectful dialogue and making a difference,\u201d Albanese said. The Greens have adopted a much more conciliatory posture this fortnight, agreeing to pass both Labor housing bills and making substantial concessions on nature laws as well. On housing, the minor party was humiliated. But Future Made in Australia and Labor\u2019s search for support for the rest of its legislative shopping list helped the Greens gain a little leverage and save face with a deal on Thursday.

Farrell will have the whole summer to finish the job. The other bills not progressing were more the victim of Labor internals than failures of negotiations. Albanese nixed a deal between Tanya Plibersek and Sarah Hanson-Young on environment laws to avoid upsetting Western Australian interests.

      "body": "<p>The girls (inclusive) are fed up with reality. We are done with trying to improve ourselves or using our leisure time to learn something new. Instead we are reading smutty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/02/romantasy-literary-genre-booktok\">romance fantasy books in droves</a>.</p> <p>Recently I was succumbing to a stress spiral and my friend recommended and then insisted I read a book that she enjoyed, and just like that my path into the cult was secured.</p> <p>I devoured five enormous books of one of the most popular romantasy series in an embarrassingly short time, reading morning, noon and night whether it was polite to do so or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/02/romantasy-literary-genre-booktok\">A genre of swords and soulmates: the rise and rise of \u2018romantasy\u2019 novels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thinking I\u2019d stumbled on something precious and unique, I remember sheepishly telling my sister-in-law when she was unwell that there was some easy reading that would be good for her recovery. She laughed when I mentioned A Court of Thorns and Roses. Obviously she had already read the whole series and many of the spin-offs.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just her. Since my awakening, many people I never would have suspected are in the thrall of the horny fairy books. I hadn\u2019t \u201cdiscovered\u201d anything, I had joined a thriving worldwide phenomenon.</p> <p>What\u2019s so addictive about these books? Why do I see people dragging around novels the size of carry-on luggage to read in cafes and on the train?</p> <p>There are the essential ingredients of course: fairies, swords, magical palaces and rose gardens. But the real answer is: explicit sex scenes.</p> <p>The author of several bestselling series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/maas-sarah-j\">Sarah J Maas</a>, whose five-star reviews on Goodreads reach well into the millions, knows exactly what the girls want. We want detailed descriptions of outfits and interiors, hundreds of pages of crackling sexual tension, and the notion that in the right circumstances we too would be good at archery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Things are simpler. Hotter. There are no spreadsheets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She also does the smutty bits with precision and flair. And most significantly, in a way that women can get behind. In so much of popular culture the straight male perspective is prioritised and they just don\u2019t get it. In this fantastical universe the men take birth control and, in a huge stretch of the imagination, the fairy world has bothered to invent it. The ACOTAR series goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the heroine is safe and comfortable, even spelling out how she isn\u2019t being financially coerced. Only then can the characters start breaking furniture and rolling around in paint.</p> <p>The romantasy books I\u2019ve read, now that I\u2019ve gone down this garden path, all feature strong women with big personalities and other skills and pursuits. They are absolutely getting laid, don\u2019t get me wrong, but their relationships with men never define them. This point is so basic it is ridiculous to even have to make it but most movies still do not clear this bar.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sensation beyond one series and romance novels are nothing new. But there is something about our current times that makes escapism so appealing.</p> <p>At a time when people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/23/perth-man-treated-for-scurvy-as-cost-of-living-crisis-brings-back-disease-of-the-past\">turning up to hospital with scurvy</a> and when a cursory glance at the news shows the impacts of climate change are here, staying home on the couch reading about dragons is about as good as a holiday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/02/soft-life-why-millennials-are-quitting-the-rat-race\">The soft life: why millennials are quitting the rat race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Girl meets boy/fairy/winged creature and falls in love or tries to break a curse. It\u2019s classic stuff. But it\u2019s engrossing, it\u2019s rollicking, it\u2019s absorbing and at least you\u2019re not scrolling. It\u2019s in fact virtuous if you think about your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/18/improve-focus-concentration-span-expert-tips\">attention span</a> and the thousands of pages that lie ahead when you start a series.</p> <p>In fact, of all the people I know who have read dozens of these smutty fantasy books and share the obsession, they mostly have senior jobs, stressful workloads and significant responsibilities. Maybe that\u2019s why they need to immerse themselves in worlds of demons, swords, leather outfits and cauldrons. Things are simpler. Hotter. There are no spreadsheets.</p> <p>As Shannon, my friend who provided me with the gateway drug, said: \u201cAt 30 I never thought horny fairies would have such a positive impact on my life.\u201d It\u2019s cheaper than travel, it\u2019s more fun than therapy and you can read anywhere you\u2019re able to drag a book the weight of a brick.

      "bodyText": "The girls (inclusive) are fed up with reality. We are done with trying to improve ourselves or using our leisure time to learn something new. Instead we are reading smutty romance fantasy books in droves. Recently I was succumbing to a stress spiral and my friend recommended and then insisted I read a book that she enjoyed, and just like that my path into the cult was secured. I devoured five enormous books of one of the most popular romantasy series in an embarrassingly short time, reading morning, noon and night whether it was polite to do so or not. Thinking I\u2019d stumbled on something precious and unique, I remember sheepishly telling my sister-in-law when she was unwell that there was some easy reading that would be good for her recovery. She laughed when I mentioned A Court of Thorns and Roses. Obviously she had already read the whole series and many of the spin-offs. It\u2019s not just her. Since my awakening, many people I never would have suspected are in the thrall of the horny fairy books. I hadn\u2019t \u201cdiscovered\u201d anything, I had joined a thriving worldwide phenomenon. What\u2019s so addictive about these books? Why do I see people dragging around novels the size of carry-on luggage to read in cafes and on the train? There are the essential ingredients of course: fairies, swords, magical palaces and rose gardens. But the real answer is: explicit sex scenes. The author of several bestselling series Sarah J Maas, whose five-star reviews on Goodreads reach well into the millions, knows exactly what the girls want. We want detailed descriptions of outfits and interiors, hundreds of pages of crackling sexual tension, and the notion that in the right circumstances we too would be good at archery. She also does the smutty bits with precision and flair. And most significantly, in a way that women can get behind. In so much of popular culture the straight male perspective is prioritised and they just don\u2019t get it. In this fantastical universe the men take birth control and, in a huge stretch of the imagination, the fairy world has bothered to invent it. The ACOTAR series goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the heroine is safe and comfortable, even spelling out how she isn\u2019t being financially coerced. Only then can the characters start breaking furniture and rolling around in paint. The romantasy books I\u2019ve read, now that I\u2019ve gone down this garden path, all feature strong women with big personalities and other skills and pursuits. They are absolutely getting laid, don\u2019t get me wrong, but their relationships with men never define them. This point is so basic it is ridiculous to even have to make it but most movies still do not clear this bar. It\u2019s a sensation beyond one series and romance novels are nothing new. But there is something about our current times that makes escapism so appealing. At a time when people are turning up to hospital with scurvy and when a cursory glance at the news shows the impacts of climate change are here, staying home on the couch reading about dragons is about as good as a holiday. Girl meets boy/fairy/winged creature and falls in love or tries to break a curse. It\u2019s classic stuff. But it\u2019s engrossing, it\u2019s rollicking, it\u2019s absorbing and at least you\u2019re not scrolling. It\u2019s in fact virtuous if you think about your attention span and the thousands of pages that lie ahead when you start a series. In fact, of all the people I know who have read dozens of these smutty fantasy books and share the obsession, they mostly have senior jobs, stressful workloads and significant responsibilities. Maybe that\u2019s why they need to immerse themselves in worlds of demons, swords, leather outfits and cauldrons. Things are simpler. Hotter. There are no spreadsheets. As Shannon, my friend who provided me with the gateway drug, said: \u201cAt 30 I never thought horny fairies would have such a positive impact on my life.\u201d It\u2019s cheaper than travel, it\u2019s more fun than therapy and you can read anywhere you\u2019re able to drag a book the weight of a brick. Of course we are reading smut. Emily Mulligan is a mum, aunty and occasional writer from Sydney",

Master Wealth Control Pty Ltd (DG Institute), whose director was the prominent Sydney property investor Dominique Grubisa until July, offers courses and mentoring programs on property and business investment. The privacy watchdog said state court lists and subscription services, such as Core Logic, were used to find properties belonging to people in distressed situations for a \u201cWeekly On and Off Market Leads List\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The leads list included personal details such as the full names, addresses and Google Maps links to the addresses, as well as a description of the personal situation leading to the sale and the agents and solicitors involved, the court decision read. The list was a part of the 12-month Elite Mentoring Program, which costs participants between $25,000 and $30,000. Grubisa said she could not provide any comment \u201cdue to on-going legal matters\u201d. In a separate judgment in July, the federal court fined DG Institute $6m and ordered a payment totalling $14.7m to more than 1,200 participants after findings of faulty or misleading representations. The redress orders made by the court require DG Institute to refund consumers an amount equivalent to the course fees paid by more than 2100 students who enrolled in the MWC program between April 2017 and November 2022. \u201cThe substantial consumer redress orders, the penalties imposed and the five-year disqualification order against Ms Grubisa reflect the serious nature of the conduct, and clearly demonstrate the consequences of making false claims when promoting goods or services to consumers,\u201d the ACCC commissioner, Liza Carver, said at the time. Grubisa was disqualified from managing corporations for five years but has still appeared in promotional material for the company. She is not prevented from doing so. After the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner started investigating the use of the leads list in July 2022, they were taken out of the course, the privacy commissioner, Carly Kind, wrote in her judgment. \u201cAlthough from the middle of 2022 the respondent removed the names of individuals from the leads list, the respondent provided participants of the Program with the tools and directions on how to re-identify individuals,\u201d Kind wrote. The company continued to distribute leads lists which said they could not give the property owners names, but instructed participants on how to find them, the court decision said. \u201cYou can search for the owner\u2019s name by following the steps in the \u2018Searching for Leads\u2019 manual and the \u2018Sourcing Distressed Properties\u2019 resource,\u201d the materials said. \u201cYou can find these great resources by going to your member portal &gt; click on your Property Elite Mentoring &gt; click on Help Documents &gt; and find the resources there.\u201d Kind found the information was not collected in a fair and lawful way because the individuals involved \u201cdid not have any knowledge or hold a reasonable expectation\u201d they would appear on lead lists. \u201cIn those circumstances, individuals would not have reasonably expected that their personal information would be collected by the respondent from the daily court listings,\u201d she wrote. Kind said the company had also failed to take steps to notify the people whose information was going on the lists and ensure the information was accurate and up to date. \u201cJust because a direct marketing database identifies someone by a certain name as having occupied a certain address at some point in time, does not necessarily mean that they are the same person mentioned in a Court List or indeed that they own any given property,\u201d she wrote. Kind found it had interfered with the privacy of individuals on the list and ordered the company to stop distributing the lead lists, and destroy all the information about them that it held.",

O\u2019Gorman admits to a feeling of personal satisfaction \u2013 had the result been otherwise he believes it would have been a serious miscarriage of justice. Is he sure he\u2019s ready to retire, really? \u201cThere\u2019s more than one of me,\u201d O\u2019Gorman says. On one hand, this statement is backed by the number of critics of Crisafulli\u2019s youth crime crackdown and a testament to how much has changed in Queensland since the 1970s when the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties was \u201calmost a voice in the wilderness\u201d, speaking out against the lawless methods employed by those imposing order. But on the other, surely, there is only one Terry O\u2019Gorman.",

It is also looking at allowing \u201cpermitted disclosures\u201d to certain groups, including health workers, police and prospective employers. Some of the proposals mirror those introduced in Ireland, where a bill to restrict the use of NDAs in relation to workplace sexual harassment and discrimination passed parliament in 2023. The legislation restricts the use of NDAs unless the complainant requests to enter into one and has been offered independent legal advice at the employer\u2019s expense, along with other safeguards, including 14-day cooling off period, and permitted disclosures. Some US states, including Hawaii, New Jersey and Washington, have also banned NDAs for sexual harassment cases. Change could come in 2025 The Victorian government is expected to release a policy position soon, with legislation to be introduced to parliament in 2025. \u201cWe know that NDAs have become the default in sexual harassment cases and victim-survivors often feel they have no choice but to sign up \u2013 that\u2019s flat-out wrong,\u201d said Jacinta Allan, the Victorian premier. \u201cThis reform is about putting the voices of victim-survivors first \u2013 misuse of NDAs not only silences victim-survivors but protects perpetrators.\u201d A campaign to bring about a national ban will also launch next year by the newly formed Working Women\u2019s Centre Australia.

Pink lettering on the cover reads \u201cFinals\u201d, and inside are scrawled the lessons learned by the AFLW\u2019s best club. \u201cWe have a little black book of finals: rinse and repeat,\u201d she says in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s decider. \u201cI just take notes about what worked, what didn\u2019t work, what you have to do, \u2018don\u2019t forget to do this\u2019.\u201d The club\u2019s other Bre \u2013 captain Breanna Koenen \u2013 has been alongside Brock since the competition\u2019s inception in 2017.

Their study of North Melbourne has shown how Darren Crocker\u2019s team has adapted in 2024.

But as the book settles into itself, this chaos comes together to highlight two of the novel\u2019s key themes: the messy and unpredictable ways that childhood trauma expresses itself in adults; and the serious failures of the justice system, which too often (as Bublitz describes in the novel) ignores coincidences and downplays the lived experiences of women, or writes them off entirely.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email With an influx of renewables expected, the regulator expects a \u201cmaterial step up\u201d in the share of electricity coming from zero emissions sources next year. Renewable energy is forecast to deliver 45% of the total, up from less than 39% over the past 12 months. In a separate report, the Australian Energy Market Commission says this should be good for power bills. Household costs are projected to fall over the next decade as long as the rollout of renewables, energy storage and transmission lines continues. The commission estimates that an average household that \u201cfully electrifies\u201d (has solar panels and replaces cars and gas appliances with electric alternatives) could cut their annual energy spending by 70%, or $3,500 \u2013 once they have dealt with the upfront costs. Is the safeguard mechanism working? We shouldn\u2019t put too much weight on it but the Climate Change Authority report gives the first snapshot at what is happening with the safeguard mechanism, a Coalition-era policy that Labor tightened to limit emissions at major industrial sites. The performance of the mechanism matters \u2013 the 215 or so sites it covers are responsible for 31% of pollution. According to preliminary data, emissions across these sites fell slightly, by 2.9m tonnes of Co2, last financial year in absolute terms. Some caveats: it is not clear the extent to which this dip was driven by the safeguard or by other factors \u2013 for example, if higher energy prices reduced output at some companies. According to the environment department\u2019s emissions projections report, the absolute cut in emissions from polluters covered by the safeguard is expected to be only 13% by 2030 and 46% by 2040. Both are less than the nation-wide reductions expected over that period. The industrial cuts are forecast to be greater once use of the carbon offset market \u2013 a contentious system that allows companies to buy credits said to represent emissions cuts elsewhere while continuing to pollute \u2013 is counted. Who knew? Fossil fuels add pollution Speaking of fossil fuels, the Climate Change Authority gives a picture of the impact of new and expanded coal and gas developments that have been approved, calculating they will add 21m tonnes of CO2 within Australia between now and 2030. These emissions are dwarfed by what will be emitted once the coal and gas is shipped overseas and burned for energy. But the offshore pollution is not counted against Australia under international greenhouse accounting rules. Labor\u2019s climate policies are yet to kick in This is a key point. The Climate Change Authority says Labor\u2019s climate policies \u2013 including the capacity investment scheme, the reformed safeguard mechanism, the vehicle efficiency standard to encourage cleaner car uptake, and the $22.7bn Future Made in Australia program \u2013 have largely not been around long enough to have had an impact. But it says they \u201chave improved Australia\u2019s prospects of cutting emissions in line with the national 2030 target\u201d as long as they are delivered on time. A final word of warning The authority points out there have been a series of revisions to Australia\u2019s emissions accounts \u2013 particularly, changes in estimates of how much CO2 has been released or absorbed by the land and forests. These changes have made it easier to reach the 43% target.

Matt Gould, the 26-year-old manager of the Oxford Street store and Ikea\u2019s other London high street store in Hammersmith, said the idea of the pop-up Frakta store \u2013 which is open until March \u2013 was to \u201ccreate an experience, not financial benefit\u201d. He said the brand wanted to create excitement ahead of the opening of the larger store, which will have a cafe alongside room sets displaying larger items that can be ordered for home delivery and a \u201cmarket hall\u201d area with a range of more than 3,000 items that shoppers could immediately take home. He said there would also be a new \u201cexperiential space\u201d with \u201cpockets of surprises with digital and community-based interaction\u201d. \u201cIt has to be fun. On the high street at the moment, it is ever more important to create a space that is exciting and people do want to come back again.\u201d",

The former MP, who lost her seat at the last general election, was at an event on Thursday where Nigel Farage said that she just happened to be the 100,000th new Reform member. Her decision to join the party comes as a surprise after she engaged in a bitter public row with Reform UK earlier this year, after claiming she was wooed by a pro-Brexit businessman who she said had offered her jobs to defect. She was bitterly critical of Reform in July after an attack by the party\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Tice, who had accused her of bribing her Reform general election rival in the constituency of Leeds South West and Morley. On that occasion, Jenkyns insisted she never came close to defecting to Reform and described Tice\u2019s \u201cwild accusations\u201d as \u201clibellous\u201d and an attempt to \u201cdeflect from his own embarrassing behaviour\u201d. Tice was not to be seen on Thursday as Jenkyns joined Farage on stage at a central London hotel where she said that her old party was a sinking ship that was beyond salvaging.

In 2022, as a newly appointed education minister, she responded to complaints after making a rude gesture outside Downing Street, saying she had been provoked by a \u201cbaying mob\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Thinking about time can make you despair. In art, it often turns up as a reminder of death. Yet walking into the Wallace Collection\u2019s ravishing display of early 18th-century clocks by Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle, you find out that it can be joyous after all. There are no brooding images of mortality and Judgment day here, just dazzling timepieces that tell you to make love, be happy and face down that ticking destiny.</p> <p>This small but scintillating show is a time capsule of the Enlightenment and its art style, the Rococo. That may sound like a lot to load on to the clockmaker Boulle, a brilliant craftsman who also made tables, candle stands and whatever else French royalty and nobles desired at his workshop in the Louvre. Yet Boulle and the other ingenious artisans who collaborated with him were interested in philosophy and science \u2013 and it shows. At first sight, the glistening decor on a pedestal clock, complete with a golden face, looks fantastic: then you see three decorative cylinders hanging down. Beneath the mythical finery, shows Boulle, rational machinery is concealed. And it\u2019s machinery that still works after 300 years: all the clocks in the show are wound up, ticking and periodically chiming.</p>    <p>In the 17th century, Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum and many clocks were built tall (\u201cgrandfather clocks\u201d) so that they could hold the heavy weights on catgut cords. The three tubes on the front of Boulle\u2019s pedestal clock depict that inner mechanism, yet otherwise his creations do everything possible to disguise their functionality in an extravagant world of sensuality and dreams. One is fitted into a vast wardrobe, its doors larded with glittering gold leaves, curlicues, faces, cherubim. Immense in its splendour, its face is flanked by images of Night and Day.</p> <p>Aristocratic pig? It may seem hard not to see such luxury through the lens of the political revolution that started in France in 1789. Surely these clocks typify the decadent lifestyle of the aristocracy before Robespierre sent them to the guillotine. But the truth is more complex. The beauty of Boulle\u2019s clocks lies in their celebration of reason, optimism and human potential \u2013 the ideals of the Enlightenment, which both inspired and succumbed to the French Revolution.</p> <p>You feel more than awe at their sumptuousness. These decorations have meaning. Boulle repeatedly portrays Father Time, the scythe-toting classically inspired figure symbolising time\u2019s inevitable passing. The Wallace Collection owns one of the most famous paintings of this old man: Nicolas Poussin\u2019s A Dance to the Music of Time, hung in a complementary themed gallery next to a barometer by Boulle.</p> <p>Painted nearly a century before Boulle\u2019s clocks, Poussin\u2019s masterpiece shows four figures dancing in a circle, hand in hand, under a storm-threatening sky lit up by the sun\u2019s chariot, while Father Time plays the lyre, his wings grey and hard as a gravestone. Time calls the tune and will literally call time on life\u2019s dance: our bubbles will vanish, the sands will run out.</p>    <p>Boulle\u2019s clocks imagine time very differently. Their figures of Father Time slump down beneath the clock faces, defeated. On top of two clocks, triumphing over Time, is Cupid, god of love \u2013 the opposite of a memento mori. Instead of reminding you to prepare for death, the imagery of Boulle\u2019s clocks urges you to enjoy life. The most outrageous clock of all is supported by a nude figure of Cupid\u2019s mother Venus, the love goddess herself, resting her feet on the shell that carried her to the island of Kythera. Time is nothing. It stops for desire.</p> <p>We are witnessing the birth of the Rococo. Boulle\u2019s over-the-top designs grow out of the 17th-century baroque but without the brooding religiosity of that age. Instead these French fancies promote love, lust and living for the day.</p> <p>The artist with whom Boulle has most in common is his contemporary Antoine Watteau. Luckily, the Wallace Collection has plenty of Watteau paintings for comparison. A couple of his canvases have been hung in the themed gallery. In one, F\u00eate Galante in a Wooded Landscape, people relax in a woodland, their cares forgotten. Children play, men and women chat in the grass, a statue seems to come to life. Watteau imagines a perfect holiday of rest and love, a paradise picnic, a moment of time suspended.</p> <p>Boulle\u2019s clocks don\u2019t deny the existence of time as Watteau seems to \u2013 how could they? For all their luscious decor their faces are simple, clear, modern, telling time with a claim to real precision. But their symbols tell you not to be afraid. Love and live, they say, and forget the clock. Looking at them, admiring their subtle craft and liberated by their flights of fantasy, you lose track of time entirely.</p> <p>\u2022 At the <a href=\"https://www.wallacecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions-displays/keeping-time-clocks-by-boulle/\">Wallace Collection, London</a>, until 2 March</p>",

Their figures of Father Time slump down beneath the clock faces, defeated. On top of two clocks, triumphing over Time, is Cupid, god of love \u2013 the opposite of a memento mori. Instead of reminding you to prepare for death, the imagery of Boulle\u2019s clocks urges you to enjoy life. The most outrageous clock of all is supported by a nude figure of Cupid\u2019s mother Venus, the love goddess herself, resting her feet on the shell that carried her to the island of Kythera. Time is nothing. It stops for desire. We are witnessing the birth of the Rococo. Boulle\u2019s over-the-top designs grow out of the 17th-century baroque but without the brooding religiosity of that age. Instead these French fancies promote love, lust and living for the day. The artist with whom Boulle has most in common is his contemporary Antoine Watteau. Luckily, the Wallace Collection has plenty of Watteau paintings for comparison. A couple of his canvases have been hung in the themed gallery. In one, F\u00eate Galante in a Wooded Landscape, people relax in a woodland, their cares forgotten. Children play, men and women chat in the grass, a statue seems to come to life. Watteau imagines a perfect holiday of rest and love, a paradise picnic, a moment of time suspended. Boulle\u2019s clocks don\u2019t deny the existence of time as Watteau seems to \u2013 how could they? For all their luscious decor their faces are simple, clear, modern, telling time with a claim to real precision. But their symbols tell you not to be afraid. Love and live, they say, and forget the clock. Looking at them, admiring their subtle craft and liberated by their flights of fantasy, you lose track of time entirely. \u2022 At the Wallace Collection, London, until 2 March",

As Tom Sermanni just suggested, it was instead the start of a farewell tour. The defender hopes to be part of the action when the Matildas and their old foes Brazil do it all again on Sunday night, then again when Australia face Taiwan in a pair of matches. A good reason to give the tribute tshirts a few extra wears too.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67486b1e8f086137725667c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T13:09:07.865Z\">1.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Matildas interim coach Tom Sermanni isn\u2019t pulling any punches in his review in the immediate aftermath of a heated encounter.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very physical game.

This is the beginning of a two-match series between the highly-ranked teams, with the second clash to come on Sunday, as Australia return to Brisbane for the first time since the Women\u2019s World Cup last year.</p> <p>The Matildas and Brazil took different paths through the global showcase as the hosts reached the semi-finals and the visitors were knocked out at the group stage, though they have been heading in opposite directions since then. Brazil have risen to No 8 in the Fifa rankings after their silver medal at the Paris Games, while Australia have slumped to No 15 \u2013 their lowest ranking since 2007 \u2013 in part due to a disappointing Olympic campaign.</p> <p>Australia are taking tentative steps towards regeneration since the departure of coach Tony Gustavsson and are likely to field a dash of the old mixed with the new tonight, especially with several stars sitting out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/mary-fowler-pulls-out-matildas-austraila-squad-mental-physical-fatigue\">Mary Fowler has joined Cortnee Vine in taking a break</a> from the Matilda\u2019s four-match home series, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/15/sam-kerr-injury-return-matildas-tom-sermanni\">captain Sam Kerr is of course still recovering from an ACL injury</a>.</p> <p>Football Australia revealed about two hours ago that only 1,000 tickets remain for the friendly at Suncorp Stadium, so if you\u2019re still intending to try your luck at the gate I suggest you <em>run, don\u2019t walk</em>. The likely sell-out will make it the 15th home match in a row where the doors are shut behind the Matildas. A competitive showing, perhaps even a victory, feels increasingly critical to ensuring the sheen remains on the women\u2019s team.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off time in Brisbane is 8pm local / 9pm AEDT.</strong> I\u2019ll be back shortly with the line-ups and team news.</p> <p>In the meantime, get in touch with any comments, questions, thoughts and predictions.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me. I hope you enjoyed following along as much as I enjoyed that heated clash. Looking forward to the Matildas and Brazil doing it all again on Sunday when I\u2019ll be a punter and reader, while Joey will guide us through the live action. Joey Lynch has already wrapped up the game at Suncorp Stadium, where a clinical Brazil beat a belatedly inspired Australia 3-1. Here is his match report: Clare Polkinghorne was keen to clear up some misconceptions that this was her farewell match. As Tom Sermanni just suggested, it was instead the start of a farewell tour. The defender hopes to be part of the action when the Matildas and their old foes Brazil do it all again on Sunday night, then again when Australia face Taiwan in a pair of matches. A good reason to give the tribute tshirts a few extra wears too. The Matildas interim coach Tom Sermanni isn\u2019t pulling any punches in his review in the immediate aftermath of a heated encounter. A very physical game. I think the referee allowed herself to be bullied a bit tonight and a few early yellow cards might have changed some of the dynamics of the game. Overall I can\u2019t have any complaints about the result. I think it was fair. Ironically, just when we were beginning to get a foothold in the game, we made a mistake for the third goal and it set us back again. It was a good competitive game. And we go away with things to work at. A red-faced Caitlin Foord found Australia\u2019s only goal of the evening and was part a series of running battles with the Brazilian defenders. The Matildas attacker was also dealing with acclimatising to the heat and humidity in Brisbane. Tough conditions. Most of us play in Europe. My last game was about one degree. Coming here and playing in almost 30 it is tough. But I\u2019m glad it [cramp] was towards the end. I got through most of it. Just about recovery now and preparing for the next game. We know they are physical and it was meant to be a bit of a battle and they brought that tonight. Clare Polkinghorne is on the mic after her farewell match didn\u2019t quite go to plan on the scoreboard but did justice to her career as a hard-fought contest. I wouldn\u2019t say they took us by surprise, but they had a better start. They are always a physical team and they play streetsmart football which we saw again tonight. The first 15-20 minutes, we got outclassed in every area but we fought our way back into it with a goal, but we couldn\u2019t push on. We will look at some video and looking forward to the next one. The Matildas have pushed hard to hand Clare Polkinghorne a fairytale finish since giving up a two-goal advantage in the opening 13 minutes. But despite their best efforts the hosts have not been able to create enough chances and have now run out of time. Young Brazilian forward Amanda Gutierres, on the other hand, made the most of her opportunities with a pair of clinical strikes as the Matildas left the door open for counter attacks. Caitlin Foord finished smartly to reduce the visitors\u2019 lead just before half-time, but Gio capped off an electric display off the bench with Brazil\u2019s third after the break. In a heated clash, Vitoria Calhau was sent off late on for a second yellow, while Gio might have also earned a second yellow for a blatant foul on Kyra Cooney-Cross. While the result isn\u2019t what the Matildas would have wanted in Polkinghorne\u2019s farewell, the scene is set for another brutal encounter between the heated rivals on the Gold Coast on Sunday. 103 mins: Sharn Freier almost has her first Matildas goal as the Brazilian keeper incredibly blocks a shot from close range. That largely sums up Australia\u2019s night. Just seconds later, the midfielder has another shot on goal but this time it is blocked by the Brazilian defence. Freier has added a spark since her introduction. 100 mins: Amanda Gutierres is rightly player of the match after lighting up the opening period with a pair of sharply taken goals and an impressive all-round showing in just her third game for Brazil. The young attacker had just the cutting edge that the Matildas have lacked. 97 mins: Gio gives one last reminder of how electric she can be as she charges through the middle channel with three Australians in front of her. The defenders track back with Brazilians on either side joining the attack until Gio launches a shot that flies wide while Arnold likely had it covered. 94 mins: Catley wins the ball deep in the Matildas forward half with a robust challenge and sends a searing cross across the box. Freier only had to get a boot on the ball to guide it into the back of the net but it sails past and ends up with Carpenter at the far post. The winger cuts it back for Kennedy to take a slamming shot but while the defender keeps the ball down it slices wide. 92 mins: Very nearly a second double-caution for Brazil as Gio dives to grab the back of Cooney-Cross\u2019s shift and brings the Matildas midfielder to ground. It\u2019s a clear foul but the referee has bottled that when a second yellow was called for. 90 mins: Confirmation that we have at least 11 minutes of action to come as the Matildas push for a second goal against 10 Brazilians. 88 mins: The scrap continues as Brazil get under the skin of the host side while the Matildas dream of an unlikely comeback from two goals down. Word is there will be 11 minutes of added time, so maybe there is a glimmer of hope after all. Vitoria Calhau has been living on the edge all evening but has earned herself a soft second yellow. After a clear foul on Carpenter in the middle of the pitch, the Australian was looking to restart quickly as Calhau wrapped arms around here. Clever from Carpenter and the referee had little choice but to wave a second caution. 81 mins: Yallop has been looking to create through the midfield in her brief time on the pitch and releases early with Raso in a one-on-one ahead of her. But Brazil clear and soak up more time with a player on turf. A clearly frustrated Raso tries to lift the Brazilian to her feet but it just delays the restart. 79 mins: A free kick deep on the left side for Australia turns into another Brazilian counter attack as Gio\u2019s has pace to burn. Cooney-Cross does just enough to stay with the young attacker but it is left to Foord to clear away. Gio stays down grabbing at her hamstring, it seems to be calf this time. 77 mins: Brazil continue to swing the changes. La\u00eds Estevam and Gabi Portilho have earned their rest, and it\u2019s confirmed that Yasmim is done for the night. Camilinha, Bruninha and Vic Albuquerque enter the action. 75 mins: Sharn Freier turns on the fresh legs and chases down a long ball heading for the left corner flag. A sharp cross into the six-yard box narrowly escapes Foord and desperate defence from Brazil clears it out for a corner. 73 mins: Brazil might struggle to field a team with Yasmim the latest to go down and need a stretcher. If it isn\u2019t cramp, it\u2019s a hamstring injury. And the distress on her face suggests it\u2019s the latter. Winonah Heatley makes way for Daniela Galic. 70 mins: Gio brings Carpenter down again, this time with a heavy bump, but avoids a second yellow despite the Australian protests. The Brazilians clear the free kick from the box and, like they have done throughout, look dangerous on the counter. The Matildas get back just in time to close down the danger, but it has been a recurring problem. 68 mins: Nice build up from the hosts as Freier has lifted the tempo since coming on. Catley over hits the cross. The Matildas have had enough time in their forward half without having the polish to create enough chances. 66 mins: Another substitution for the Matildas with Tameka Yallop replacing Van Egmond. Moments later, Winonah Heatley is in a spot of bother and needs some attention. Don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to see out the 90 mins. 65 mins: The tireless Carpenter powers across the halfway mark but is brought down with a classic professional foul. The goalscorer Gio picks up a booking. 62 mins: Clare Polkinghorne\u2019s celebration match comes to a close as the Matildas veteran waves to all sides of Suncorp Stadium with Sharn Freier coming on. 61 mins: Raso gets on the end of a couple of chances but gives the first away with a heavy touch in the box. The attacker\u2019s blushes are spared with an offside flag. But a second opportunity is almost gifted to her as Adriana gives the ball away with her first touch. Raso tries to take the shot quickly but is too far out and scuffs the shot wide for a goal kick. 59 mins: Natascha is unable to continue, I\u2019m not sure why, and has been replaced. Amanda Gutierres also makes way after scoring her first two goals for Brazil in just her third match, with Adriana coming on. The zippy Gio pounces on Alanna Kennedy trying to make her way out of defence and creates a turnover out of nothing. There is little cover with the Matildas already making their way up the pitch, but even after Kennedy races back to closes down the likely shot, Gio has the composure to round the defender and fire into the back of the net. Not for the first time, the Matildas have been their own worst enemy. 55 mins: Caitlin Foord and Vitoria Calhau go into the book for their persistent tangles. It has been entertaining to watch, but the cards had been coming for a while. 53 mins: Carpenter is finding plenty of space down the right but rather than taking more ground this time quickly releases to Foord to carry the ball into the box. Raso almost gets on the end of the cut back but the ball goes behind her and Brazil clear. 51 mins: Polkinghorne clears a chip kick and the rebound off Gio goes out for a goalkick. But the referee has missed it and awards a corner. Brazil work the ball around rather than sending in a cross and a shot from Gutierres sails over the crossbar. That would\u2019ve hurt if it went any lower. 49 mins: Carpenter steams down the right flank and cuts a cross back to Foord standing in front of goal. With fast feet the Matildas striker almost gets around the swarming Brazilian defenders, but unlike in the first half, this time they keep their feet and block the avenue to goal. 47 mins: Hayley Raso picks up where she left off, the combative competitor bringing down Duda Sampaio with a firm challenge. Peeeeeeeeeep! Here we go again. More of the same please. Jack Snape is at Suncorp Stadium and has learned that Clare Polkinghorne isn\u2019t alone in being recognised for a lofty contribution to Australian football, sending us the following: Former Socceroo Craig Foster was one of four people inducted into the Football Australia Hall of Fame in a ceremony before the match. The broadcaster and human rights advocate took the opportunity to call on the football community to support refugees and minority or persecuted groups. \u201cIf there\u2019s any game in this country that\u2019s going to fight for them, surely it\u2019s us,\u201d Foster said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any game that\u2019s going to fight for First Nations rights, surely it\u2019s us. If there\u2019s any game that\u2019s going to stand with the African communities when demonised, or anything that happens around the world, guys, it has to be us.\u201d Others inducted were women\u2019s refereeing pioneer Jenny Bray, football administrator Ian Holmes, and the late Alex Pongrass, a key figure in the creation of the National Soccer League. A rollicking first half comes to an end with the visitors leading by the narrowest of margins in Clare Polkinghorne\u2019s farewell match. Brazilian striker Amanda Gutierres proved the difference early with a pair of lethal strikes as Australia were unable to deal with her pace and well-timed runs on the counter. The Matildas pushed hard to stay in the game, even while leaving themselves too often exposed at the back, and were well worth their goal as the break approached. Ellie Carpenter created the opportunity out of very little after competing hard, twice, against a pair of Brazilian defenders, as Caitlin Foord was sublime in making room for herself to finish from the edge of the six-yard box. There was plenty of heat in the match from the early exchanges but as battles simmered away all over the pitch, especially where Hayley Raso and Vitoria Calhau were nearby, this looms as a fiery a second half. The Matildas will want to tight up at the back, but otherwise this is still very much game on! 52 mins: Carpenter is the first to pounce on a loose ball after Raso is caught up in a battle near the corner flag with two Brazilian defenders. The Matildas wing-back streams into the penalty box but the referee closes down the advantage with a foul back near the sideline. Tom Sermanni is raging, a rare sight, but a sure sign that this clash won\u2019t be cooling down after the break. 50 mins: Chance for Brazil but this time Gutierres fires wide. The striker has impressed with her touch and involvement in the better Brazilian build up play, as well as being the difference across the first half with two lethal strikes. 48 mins: Vitoria Calhau is one of several Brazilians happy to play a physical game and she has somehow avoided a caution there even after wrapping her arms around Hayley Raso as Australia are looking to break. The pair get to their feet and stare each other down with little being said, but there is plenty of heat in this contest. 45 mins: There will be seven minutes added time after Marilia had to be helped from the field and to account for several long periods as players have taken a breather on the grass. The Matildas look displeased as Raso is knocked to ground away from the play, but the referee isn\u2019t interested in investigating their case further. The Matildas have worked hard for that and none moreso than Ellie Carpenter. The wing-back beats two Brazilians near the corner flag, not once but twice, and sends a low dart across the box. Van Egmond might have take the shot from a narrow angle but leaves the ball, perhaps in hope, perhaps after hearing a call, and Foord collects near the spot. With a shimmy and swivel, she sends two defenders the wrong way and scores in the bottom right corner. A classy, composed goal from the Australian. 40 mins: Brazil are able to use the full length of the pitch, as well as the width, with Natascha presenting as an option at the back. The scoreline doesn\u2019t tell the full story of what has been a frenetic first half, and it\u2019s understandable that the visitors might want to slow things down, even as the crowd collectively call for them to get a hurry on. 38 mins: The Matildas haven\u2019t had much trouble getting into the Brazilian penalty box but can\u2019t quite put the finishing touches on their best moves. Foord shows her frustration at the close checking from Isa Hass but the referee waves away her appeals and points to the corner flag. Brazil clear the cross. 35 mins: Cooney-Cross cuts out a pass in the middle of the pitch and quickly releases to find Raso in space in front of her. The forward draws two defenders and looks to send Van Egmond into space next but the midfielder isn\u2019t on the same wave length and the opportunity goes begging. 33 mins: Brazil are happy to play out from the back even under intense pressure from the Matildas. Goalkeeper Natascha looks as comfortable with the ball at her feet as anyone, and is spending as much time outside the penalty box to be part of the build as near her goalline. 31 mins: Hayley Raso cuts through the Brazilian defence but their goalkeeper Natascha comes screaming off her line. The pair meet 20m from the edge of the penalty box as the glovewoman is fortunate to go to ground and get a clearing kick away. Natascha has come off second best and for the second time in as many minutes is calling for treatment. 28 mins: Foord looks the main danger drifting into the left channel almost has a sight on goal before being called offside. Catley is working well with her club teammate and finds space in the penalty box with a speedy underlap but the Brazilian defence are quick to close down the threat. It hardly feels like a 0-2 scoreline, but the visitors have simply been more clinical. 26 mins: Portilho is back on the pitch as soon as she went off and racing along the right win gives Clare Hunt a good test for pace. The resulting corner turns into chaos in the six-yard box as the Matildas take time to clear. 24 mins: Gabi Portilho is the next Brazilian to hit the turf after a coming together with Caitlin Foord. This one looks like a knock to the quad and the Matildas return the ball to the Brazilian defence after another delay. 21 mins: Australia are on the attack again and Winonah Heatley\u2019s eyes light up as she carries the ball into the penalty box. Marilia makes a last-ditch tackle to block the shot and stays on the deck as a stretcher is called. Another Brazilian youngster in Gio is called into the action as her replacement. Brazil cleaner the corner kick. 18 mins: Mackenzie Arnold is called on again after the Matildas give the ball away too easily in their own half but the goalkeeper tidies up. She takes a seat and will need some treatment while both sides take an opportunity to rehydrate in the hot and humid conditions. 15 mins: The Matildas have had little difficulty getting the ball into the Brazilian penalty box but so far have lacked anything like the cutting edge of the visitors. Catley is the main outlet on the left but has been unable to find Foord in front of goal with a pair of crosses. Australia can\u2019t make anything of the corner. Once again Brazil turn defence into attack as Foord as time inside the box to pick out Catley but the right-back\u2019s shot is blocked. In next to no time, Gutierres picks up the ball inside the box and, despite Arnold getting a hand to the ball, rockets a second into the far corner. 9 mins: Another counterattack for Brazil and Gutierres is through the defensive line again. This time Arnold beats the forward to the ball and there is added respite when a flag is waved for offside. But there are enough early warnings of what\u2019s to come for the Matildas. Foul against Caitlin Foord at the other end might have gone Australia\u2019s way but Brazil are awake to the quick restart to slice open the Matildas defence. Amanda Gutierres times her run perfectly to burst through the line and leaving Arnold trying to beat the Brazilian to the ball. Gutierres gets their first, rounds the keeper and slots home with her left boot from the same side. 4 mins: Amanda Gutierres gets the first shot of the night away from the edge of the penalty box. There isn\u2019t enough power though and Mackenzie Arnold barely has to move before collecting with ease. 2 mins: The Matildas lock the ball forward without creating anything resembling a threat. Once Brazil get the ball at their feet they\u2019re happy to pass it around and give everyone a touch. Works at all levels. Peeeeeeeeep! We\u2019re underway at Suncorp Stadium. The Matildas start in a 3-4-3 formation with wing-backs Carpenter and Catley pushing straight into the midfield. Brazil line up with a familiar 4-3-3. The national anthems are done, the Polkinghorne has won the toss, the captains are delivering their last-minute instructions. The no-frills defender Clare Polkinghorne keeps it short n sweet as she says her thank yous and demands that it\u2019s time to get down to business. Just a few quick words from me because we\u2019ve got a game to get on with. It\u2019s so special for me to be here and to celebrate in front of my home fans, in a city I grew up and in and stadium that I absolutely love. This team has been everything to me. It\u2019s been a hell of a journey and I\u2019m very thankful for everything that everyone has done along the way. So thank you very much and let\u2019s get on with it. The Matildas have swapped out of their Clare Polkinghorne tribute tshirts and into their more familiar gold-with-a-dash-of-green jerseys. Brazil are dressed in their blue kit with white shorts as both sides line up to acknowledge the Australian defender ahead of her 168th and final football match. From one great to another, former Brisbane Broncos rugby league star Darren Lockyer and swimmer Susie O\u2019Neill hand Polkinghorne memorabilia to mark the occasion of her farewell match, and set a high benchmark for surprises we might see this evening (it turns out they were Polkinghorne\u2019s childhood heroes). The Matildas are building up to another international tournament on home soil with the Asian Cup just 15 months away, while Brazil are taking steps towards hosting the next Women\u2019s World Cup in 2027. But the early signs are that this will be a celebration of the career of a hometown hero at Suncorp Stadium. There is, after all, only one Clare Polkinghorne! Samantha Lewis has been following the Matildas since well before they were cool and has dug deep into her notebooks to pull out a close look at their history of clashes with Brazil. The blue touch paper was lit on the rivalry during the Women\u2019s World Cup 2007 when Australia reached the quarter-finals for the first time (spoiler alert: Brazil were runners-up). Their first opponents in the knockout stage were Brazil: a team who have since become one of the Matildas\u2019 longest-standing rivals, and who were led, back then, by the great Marta, who would go on to win the tournament\u2019s Golden Boot and MVP awards. Australia lost that game 3-2 \u2013 not a boilover, by any stretch \u2013 with the core of that team going on to become the country\u2019s first Asian Champions just three years later. Brazil: Natascha (gk); Fe Palermo, Isa Hass, Vitoria Calhau, Yasmim (capt); La\u00eds Estevam, Duda Sampaio, Marilia; Gabi Portilho, Aline Gomes, Amanda Gutierres Clare Polkinghorne starts and wears the captain\u2019s armband in her 168th and last appearance for Australia. The defender scored in the Matildas\u2019 back-to-back friendlies against Brazil three years ago and no doubt would love another tonight to sign off in style. Emily Van Egmond becomes the fourth player to make 150 appearances for the Matildas, drawing equal with Lisa De Vanna and now one cap behind Cheryl Salisbury. Winonah Heatley is very much at the other end of her career and will start after a debut against Germany last month amid a very defensive looking line up. Matildas: Mackenzie Arnold (gk), Ellie Carpenter, Clare Polkinghorne (capt), Clare Hunt, Alanna Kennedy, Steph Catley; Emily Van Egmond, Winonah Heatley; Kyra Cooney-Cross, Hayley Raso, Caitlin Foord. While we can hope to see some fresh faces for the Matildas this evening, one of the true stalwarts of the side will be closing the curtain on an illustrious career in her home town Brisbane. Clare Polkinghorne will line up for the national side for the 168th time \u2013 a record number of caps for an Australian footballer \u2013 since making her debut in 2006. Our own Jack Snape looks at Polkinghorne\u2019s career in green and gold and what comes next for the former Australia captain (with some kind words from interim coach Tom Sermanni thrown in). She is the defensive stalwart for the sporting team that has become Australia\u2019s darling, yet after 18 years with the Matildas, Clare Polkinghorne has a clear-cut view of retirement: \u201cI\u2019ll definitely need a job.\u201d Hello and welcome to live coverage of the women\u2019s international friendly between the Matildas and Brazil at Suncorp Stadium. This is the beginning of a two-match series between the highly-ranked teams, with the second clash to come on Sunday, as Australia return to Brisbane for the first time since the Women\u2019s World Cup last year. The Matildas and Brazil took different paths through the global showcase as the hosts reached the semi-finals and the visitors were knocked out at the group stage, though they have been heading in opposite directions since then. Brazil have risen to No 8 in the Fifa rankings after their silver medal at the Paris Games, while Australia have slumped to No 15 \u2013 their lowest ranking since 2007 \u2013 in part due to a disappointing Olympic campaign. Australia are taking tentative steps towards regeneration since the departure of coach Tony Gustavsson and are likely to field a dash of the old mixed with the new tonight, especially with several stars sitting out. Mary Fowler has joined Cortnee Vine in taking a break from the Matilda\u2019s four-match home series, while captain Sam Kerr is of course still recovering from an ACL injury. Football Australia revealed about two hours ago that only 1,000 tickets remain for the friendly at Suncorp Stadium, so if you\u2019re still intending to try your luck at the gate I suggest you run, don\u2019t walk. The likely sell-out will make it the 15th home match in a row where the doors are shut behind the Matildas. A competitive showing, perhaps even a victory, feels increasingly critical to ensuring the sheen remains on the women\u2019s team. Kick-off time in Brisbane is 8pm local / 9pm AEDT. I\u2019ll be back shortly with the line-ups and team news. In the meantime, get in touch with any comments, questions, thoughts and predictions. You can shoot me an email, or find me on Bluesky @martinpegan.bsky.social and X @martinpegan. Let\u2019s get into it!",

      "body": "<p>How do you say goodbye to someone like Clare Polkinghorne? Such is the journey she has gone on with the Matildas across an 18-year international career, doing so was always going to prove difficult. The stalwart has, at least, ensured she is going out on her own terms, honoured for her legacy with a send-off game in her hometown of Brisbane on Thursday, and celebrated with an emotional ovation when she was substituted off in the 63rd minute. Of course, this send-off happened to come against fierce rivals Brazil, who did their bit to dampen things by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/28/australia-v-brazil-international-womens-football-friendly-live\">striking twice early on, on the way to a physical, 3-1 win</a>. </p> <p>The most-capped player \u2013 man or woman \u2013 ever in an Australian shirt, Polkinghorne was commemorated with an individual entrance ahead of her 168th game, as well as a presentation by fellow Queensland great Darren Lockyer and a video tribute she watched on with her family. It was enough to bring many of her teammates to tears but, characteristically, the defender was loath to soak in the adulation, ending a brief speech with \u201cThank you very much and let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/28/australia-v-brazil-international-womens-football-friendly-live\">Australia v Brazil: international women\u2019s football friendly \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alas for the romantics, it was the visitors who seemed to heed her words the quickest. After only six minutes, a long ball launched from the backline by Vit\u00f3ria Calhau was nodded into the space behind the Australian defensive line by Mar\u00edlia Furiel, with Amanda Gutierres gathering possession, rounding Mackenzie Arnold and putting <em>As Canarinhas </em>ahead. </p> <p>Reprising the back five from games against Switzerland and Germany in October, a narrow press deployed by the Matildas and the advanced position it demanded by fullbacks Steph Catley and Ellie Carpenter left plenty of room to exploit in behind. This haunted the Australians again in the 13th minute when sprinting back from an advanced position, Carpenter was left chasing the heels of Aline Gomes as she collected a pass and advanced into the penalty area. The 19-year-old cut the ball back for Gutierres, who fired home for a brace.</p>    <p>While Australia are coming off the highs of their own home Women\u2019s World Cup, Brazil are preparing to host their own in 2027, with their national side experiencing a period of rejuvenation and renewal ahead of it. Duda Sampaio was the \u201cveteran\u201d of Arthur Elias\u2019s XI with 29 caps. Gutierres, 23, was getting just her third cap. But this young side was rising to the challenge; 21-year-old Giovana Queiroz, introduced as an early sub for an injured Furiel, caught Alanna Kennedy badly out in possession in the 54th minute before being played in on goal, where she rounded an on-rushing Polkinghorne and netted her side\u2019s third. </p> <p>In what was supposed to be a triumphant emotional send-off, this wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Then again, the game otherwise played out exactly how one would expect of a battle between Australia and Brazil; the familiar and bitter foes, whose rivalry has almost defined Polkinghorne\u2019s career, no quarter given nor asked for. A backline of Calhau and Isa Haas put their bodies on, and sometimes through, Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso early and often and the 47,501-strong crowd was none too impressed with the frequent stoppages \u2013 Calhau receiving a second yellow in the 86th for delaying a re-start.</p> <p>Foord was yet again immense for Australia despite the loss and the Arsenal attacker did extract some semblance of reward in the 43rd minute when she left Haas for dead with a magnificent turn after a Carpenter cross \u2013 one cleverly feinted at by Emily van Egmond in game 150, moving her fourth all-time on the appearances list \u2013 and placed the ball past Natascha Honegger. This, however, was a rare moment of incisive resistance, the only shot on target the Matildas would muster until the 10th minute of added time. </p> <p>With another game against Brazil on Sunday and then two games against Taiwan next week, improvements will be sought by the Matildas. Thursday, though, was also about saying goodbye.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How do you say goodbye to someone like Clare Polkinghorne? Such is the journey she has gone on with the Matildas across an 18-year international career, doing so was always going to prove difficult. The stalwart has, at least, ensured she is going out on her own terms, honoured for her legacy with a send-off game in her hometown of Brisbane on Thursday, and celebrated with an emotional ovation when she was substituted off in the 63rd minute. Of course, this send-off happened to come against fierce rivals Brazil, who did their bit to dampen things by striking twice early on, on the way to a physical, 3-1 win. The most-capped player \u2013 man or woman \u2013 ever in an Australian shirt, Polkinghorne was commemorated with an individual entrance ahead of her 168th game, as well as a presentation by fellow Queensland great Darren Lockyer and a video tribute she watched on with her family. It was enough to bring many of her teammates to tears but, characteristically, the defender was loath to soak in the adulation, ending a brief speech with \u201cThank you very much and let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d Alas for the romantics, it was the visitors who seemed to heed her words the quickest. After only six minutes, a long ball launched from the backline by Vit\u00f3ria Calhau was nodded into the space behind the Australian defensive line by Mar\u00edlia Furiel, with Amanda Gutierres gathering possession, rounding Mackenzie Arnold and putting As Canarinhas ahead. Reprising the back five from games against Switzerland and Germany in October, a narrow press deployed by the Matildas and the advanced position it demanded by fullbacks Steph Catley and Ellie Carpenter left plenty of room to exploit in behind. This haunted the Australians again in the 13th minute when sprinting back from an advanced position, Carpenter was left chasing the heels of Aline Gomes as she collected a pass and advanced into the penalty area. The 19-year-old cut the ball back for Gutierres, who fired home for a brace. While Australia are coming off the highs of their own home Women\u2019s World Cup, Brazil are preparing to host their own in 2027, with their national side experiencing a period of rejuvenation and renewal ahead of it. Duda Sampaio was the \u201cveteran\u201d of Arthur Elias\u2019s XI with 29 caps. Gutierres, 23, was getting just her third cap. But this young side was rising to the challenge; 21-year-old Giovana Queiroz, introduced as an early sub for an injured Furiel, caught Alanna Kennedy badly out in possession in the 54th minute before being played in on goal, where she rounded an on-rushing Polkinghorne and netted her side\u2019s third. In what was supposed to be a triumphant emotional send-off, this wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Then again, the game otherwise played out exactly how one would expect of a battle between Australia and Brazil; the familiar and bitter foes, whose rivalry has almost defined Polkinghorne\u2019s career, no quarter given nor asked for. A backline of Calhau and Isa Haas put their bodies on, and sometimes through, Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso early and often and the 47,501-strong crowd was none too impressed with the frequent stoppages \u2013 Calhau receiving a second yellow in the 86th for delaying a re-start. Foord was yet again immense for Australia despite the loss and the Arsenal attacker did extract some semblance of reward in the 43rd minute when she left Haas for dead with a magnificent turn after a Carpenter cross \u2013 one cleverly feinted at by Emily van Egmond in game 150, moving her fourth all-time on the appearances list \u2013 and placed the ball past Natascha Honegger. This, however, was a rare moment of incisive resistance, the only shot on target the Matildas would muster until the 10th minute of added time. With another game against Brazil on Sunday and then two games against Taiwan next week, improvements will be sought by the Matildas. Thursday, though, was also about saying goodbye.",

The number of responses increased dramatically, the Australian broadcaster ABC reported, after X owner Musk reposted a tweet by Albanese announcing that the bill would be introduced that day, writing, \u201cSeems like a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians.\u201d Most of the submissions were a form response, the ABC reported, with fewer than 100 submissions made by interest groups. Musk has clashed repeatedly with the Australian government this year over requests to remove graphic content and separate legislation aimed at tackling deliberate lies spread on social media platforms. On Tuesday this week, the Senate\u2019s environment and communications legislation Committee supported the bill but added the condition that social media platforms not force users to submit personal data, including passport information. It is unclear what methods social media companies would use to enforce age restrictions, A YouGov survey released on Tuesday this week showed 77% of Australians backed the ban, up from 61% in an August survey. Each of Australia\u2019s eight state and territory leaders supports the ban, though Tasmania\u2019s leader suggested it end at 14. The federal opposition supports the bill, claiming it would have done it sooner \u2013 it has promised to have a ban in place within 100 days if it wins next year\u2019s election. But 140 experts have signed an open letter expressing their concern that the bill is \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively\u201d. Among their concerns are that it \u201ccreates even more risks for children who may still use platforms\u201d and that bans \u201caffect rights to access and participation\u201d. Australia\u2019s human rights commission has \u201cserious reservations\u201d about the ban, \u201cgiven the potential for these laws to significantly interfere with the rights of children and young people\u201d. One of the authors of a UK study of 17,400 young people cited by the government in support of the ban said that the Australian government had \u201cmisunderstood the purpose and findings\u201d of the research, Crikey reported. \u201cThe voices of children and young people have been conspicuously missing from most of the debate and commentary,\u201d Independent MP Andrew Wilkie wrote, in a piece for Guardian Australia explaining why he changed his mind, from supporting the ban to disagreeing with it. Christopher Stone, the executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said in a statement: \u201cThe government is running blindfolded into a brick wall. \u201cComplex issues like this require careful consultation and consideration, not shortcuts. We urge the government to slow down and engage with stakeholders to ensure we get this right for young people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been denied bail for the third time by a judge in New York City who described him as a \u201cserious risk\u201d for witness tampering. Prosecutors had previously accused Combs of trying to contact prospective witnesses from jail in an attempt to create \u201cnarratives\u201d to influence public opinion as well as potential jurors for his impending sex trafficking trial. Combs is at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution and has been accused of violating prison regulations. He has pleaded not guilty and denied multiple sexual assault accusations from more than two dozen civil lawsuits that accuse him of abusing men and women \u2013 some underage at the time of the alleged assaults \u2013 blackmailing them with footage of the incidents, as well as threatening and beating witnesses and committing kidnap and arson. In a bail hearing on Wednesday, US district judge Arun Subramanian ruled: \u201cThe court finds that the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community.\u201d Combs\u2019 lawyers had proposed a $50m bail package that they said would ensure the rapper did not flee or try to intimidate other potential trial witnesses. But, wrote Subramanian, \u201cthere is compelling evidence of Combs\u2019s propensity for violence\u201d. \u201cGiven the nature of the allegations in this case and the information provided by the government, the court doubts the sufficiency of any conditions that place trust in Combs and individuals in his employ \u2013 like a private security detail \u2013 to follow those conditions.\u201d Combs is also accused of misusing jail communications to influence witnesses and coercing peers to post online in his defence. Prosecutors said that Combs enlisted family members to carry out a social media campaign around his 4 November birthday \u2013 encouraging his children to post videos of them gathered to celebrate him to their social media accounts \u2013 after which he monitored analytics and \u201cexplicitly discussed with his family how to ensure that the video had his desired effect on potential jury members in this case\u201d. Combs\u2019 lawyers say he should be released to give him time to prepare for his trial in 2025, and that the seizure from his cell earlier this month of 20 pages was unlawful and that the documents were subject to attorney-client privilege. Prosecutors disagreed, and said that Combs\u2019 alleged tampering could be considered an obstruction of justice. They said Combs used the app ContactMeAsap, for inmates to communicate with sanctioned contacts, to talk to dozens of people, including those not on his approved contact list, as well as paying other inmates to use their phone privileges to reach people outside his approved contacts. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer for musician Dawn Richard, who filed a civil suit against Combs, similarly alleges that he was contacting witnesses from prison, and told BBC TV\u2019s Newsnight that Combs was part of a complex, multi-person arrangement. \u201cWe think it\u2019s very important that not only do predators get brought to justice, but those who conspire with them, who help them, who are complicit\u201d.",

So why did she leave?</p>    <p>\u201cIt was the potential in this team. We have so many players who are such high-quality players and they deliver in clubs all across Europe. So for me it was a huge honour to step into this position and I\u2019m really enjoying it. I knew it [had to be] something special to take me away from Wales. If I\u2019m honest, I knew from the very first conversation that I had that this was something that was really going to suit me and who I am. Norway is a very progressive country. In terms of football, they\u2019re very ambitious, and that matched who I am as a person. It\u2019s been a great decision for me.\u201d</p> <p>In 10 games, all competitive fixtures, Grainger has lost once, away to the Netherlands, and secured five victories, including 13-0 on aggregate against Albania in the first round of the Euros qualifying playoffs last month. Norway\u2019s men have not qualified for a major tournament for 24 years but the women have a proud history, as the 1995 world champions, the Olympic champions of 2000 and two-times Euros winners, and they are craving more.</p> <p>\u201cI wear a badge that has a star above it,\u201d Grainger says. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to be respectful of that history. And then this group, we respect the history but we\u2019re right here in the present and the potential is high. We want to be a team that goes into a tournament next summer and really delivers.</p> <p>\u201cWe know [against Northern Ireland] we\u2019re the higher-ranked team. We know that Northern Ireland will be tagged as the underdogs, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re aware of. The players are excited, I\u2019m excited and the staff are excited. There\u2019s a real determination and desire within the group to be successful.\u201d</p> <p>Grainger\u2019s idol is someone who took success in international football to a whole different level. The former Germany head coach Silvia Neid won back-to-back European titles, having done so as a player, and was the subject of a study Grainger undertook as part of her Uefa Pro Licence coaching qualification course in 2014, when the German invited her to attend her camp.</p> <p>\u201cShe was the first female coach I looked at and thought: \u2018Oh wow, I want to win the European championships, I want to win World Cups,\u2019\u201d Grainger says. \u201cShe had an aura. I used to look at her and think she was calm, collected and a serial winner. The way she dealt with big players in that German team, I was fascinated.\u201d</p>    <p>There is no shortage of big names in Grainger\u2019s squad. If the Chelsea winger Guro Reiten, Arsenal forward Frida Maanum and Barcelona winger Caroline Graham Hansen were not enough, they also have three Manchester United regulars, in the striker Elisabeth Terland, winger Celin Bizet and midfielder Lisa Naalsund. Then comes Ada Hegerberg, the Women\u2019s Champions League\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer and a Ballon d\u2019Or winner.</p> <p>By Norway\u2019s standards they are in something of a dry spell, having not reached a major semi-final for 11 years. But a country of 5.5 million people has a passion for the sport that has caught Grainger\u2019s heart. \u201cI see young girls and young boys going to training, they\u2019ve got their backpacks, they\u2019ve got their gloves on, it\u2019s minus 10 and they\u2019re walking to training. The participation numbers are so high relative to the population. There\u2019s a respectful, trusting nature with Norwegians, but also that resilience, to live in a country so cold and to just get on with it.

      "bodyText": "Even as a proud Middlesbrough lass with ample experience of cold evenings coaching, the Norway manager, Gemma Grainger, was unprepared for her first trip to Oslo. \u201cI came out of the airport and it was minus 24. They were laughing at me because I had some trousers on with trainer socks. \u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 Norwegians say: \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\u2019 It\u2019s a nation with a fascinating grit and determination. The snow, for months on end, is about five- or six-feet high and there\u2019s not an eyelid batted.\u201d Thankfully for Grainger, this week Norway are training in marginally warmer climes near her home in Leeds, using Leeds United men\u2019s team\u2019s pitches to break their journey as they prepare to face Northern Ireland in a playoff for a place at next summer\u2019s European Championship, starting with Friday\u2019s leg at Inver Park in Larne. A week ago she was helping a small grassroots team in the east of Oslo, Forward IL, with eyes on the future of the sport. \u201cBefore every international camp I will go and visit a girls\u2019 club in Oslo and take a coaching session to connect with the community,\u201d Grainger says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our higher purpose here and something that myself and the players are really passionate about: growing women\u2019s football in Norway. When I was a young coach [working at Middlesbrough Football Club in the Community] I had a bag of footballs, cones and bibs in the boot of the car and I would travel around Middlesbrough going to after-school sessions. I don\u2019t forget those grassroots clubs \u2013 they\u2019re a big part of who I am. \u201cMy mum used to say to me: \u2018I think you should be a PE teacher, that\u2019s the career for you.\u2019 But I was adamant I was going to be a coach.\u201d The former England manager Ted Copeland first saw potential in Grainger in the profession. When an 18-year-old Grainger was captaining the side Copeland was managing in the north-east, and he suggested she join him at a primary school coaching session. She has never looked back, going on to manage Leeds and her beloved hometown club, Middlesbrough, and work with England\u2019s youth teams before taking on the Wales job in 2021. A heartbreaking 120th-minute winning goal for Switzerland in October 2022\u2019s World Cup playoffs dashed her dreams of leading Wales to a major tournament, and in January 2024 she left for the Norway role. It is clear how much respect and affection Grainger retains for the Wales team, and she says her \u201cideal scenario would be that Norway qualify for the European championships and Wales do also\u201d. So why did she leave? \u201cIt was the potential in this team. We have so many players who are such high-quality players and they deliver in clubs all across Europe.

In terms of football, they\u2019re very ambitious, and that matched who I am as a person. It\u2019s been a great decision for me.\u201d In 10 games, all competitive fixtures, Grainger has lost once, away to the Netherlands, and secured five victories, including 13-0 on aggregate against Albania in the first round of the Euros qualifying playoffs last month. Norway\u2019s men have not qualified for a major tournament for 24 years but the women have a proud history, as the 1995 world champions, the Olympic champions of 2000 and two-times Euros winners, and they are craving more. \u201cI wear a badge that has a star above it,\u201d Grainger says. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to be respectful of that history.

If the Chelsea winger Guro Reiten, Arsenal forward Frida Maanum and Barcelona winger Caroline Graham Hansen were not enough, they also have three Manchester United regulars, in the striker Elisabeth Terland, winger Celin Bizet and midfielder Lisa Naalsund. Then comes Ada Hegerberg, the Women\u2019s Champions League\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer and a Ballon d\u2019Or winner. By Norway\u2019s standards they are in something of a dry spell, having not reached a major semi-final for 11 years.

She said the laws aren\u2019t meant to apply to messaging services, such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, or online services like Kids Helpline. The laws will also give some exemptions to products used for educational purposes, such as YouTube or Google Classroom.</p> \n<p>The bill is introducing a new term \u2013 \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d \u2013 into the Online Safety Act. This will apply to platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and X, Rowland said \u2013 as well as message board Reddit.</p> \n<p>Specifically, the bill seeks to stop under-16s being \u201clogged in\u201d or having accounts on those services. Young people would still be able to view YouTube videos while being logged out of the platform, or view some Facebook pages used for a business in a logged-out state. For instance, the explanatory memorandum concedes some Facebook pages \u201csuch as the landing page of a business or service that uses social media as their business host platform\u201d would be able to be viewed.</p> \n<h2>Why is it needed?</h2> \n<p>The government has raised major concerns about the mental health effects of social media on young people, including issues around body image, bullying, abuse and harmful messages such as misogynous content.</p> \n<p>Introducing the bill, Rowland said social media could be \u201ca source of entertainment, education and connection with the world and each other\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/07/australian-government-to-legislate-social-media-age-limit-of-16-but-cant-say-how-platforms-will-enforce-it\">Australia to ban under-16s from social media \u2013 but can\u2019t say how TikTok, Instagram and others will enforce it</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cBut for too many young Australians, social media can be harmful. Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-year-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online, including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm, as well as violent material,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The minister went on to detail eSafety Commission research saying parents found online safety to be one of their biggest challenges.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Albanese government has heard the concerns of parents of young people and experts. Social media has a social responsibility.

      "bodyText": "The federal government\u2019s social media ban for under-16s has been passed in the Senate. It is unclear how the new rules will be applied or enforced, and if the legislation will require all Australians to hand over more of their personal data. But while the government has promised \u201crobust\u201d privacy protections for that extra information, and bans on social media giants using that data for other purposes, we still don\u2019t know exactly what kind of data people will have to hand over. The government instead is kicking that can to the big tech firms themselves, essentially asking Facebook, Snapchat and X to come up with their own systems instead. Here\u2019s what we know so far \u2013 and what questions still need to be answered. Which platforms will be targeted? The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, introduced the legislation on Thursday. She said the laws aren\u2019t meant to apply to messaging services, such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, or online services like Kids Helpline. The laws will also give some exemptions to products used for educational purposes, such as YouTube or Google Classroom. The bill is introducing a new term \u2013 \u201cage-restricted social media platforms\u201d \u2013 into the Online Safety Act. This will apply to platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and X, Rowland said \u2013 as well as message board Reddit. Specifically, the bill seeks to stop under-16s being \u201clogged in\u201d or having accounts on those services. Young people would still be able to view YouTube videos while being logged out of the platform, or view some Facebook pages used for a business in a logged-out state. For instance, the explanatory memorandum concedes some Facebook pages \u201csuch as the landing page of a business or service that uses social media as their business host platform\u201d would be able to be viewed. Why is it needed? The government has raised major concerns about the mental health effects of social media on young people, including issues around body image, bullying, abuse and harmful messages such as misogynous content. Introducing the bill, Rowland said social media could be \u201ca source of entertainment, education and connection with the world and each other\u201d. \u201cBut for too many young Australians, social media can be harmful. Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-year-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online, including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm, as well as violent material,\u201d she said. The minister went on to detail eSafety Commission research saying parents found online safety to be one of their biggest challenges. \u201cThe Albanese government has heard the concerns of parents of young people and experts. Social media has a social responsibility. We know they can and should do better to address harms on their platforms.\u201d The memorandum, citing worldwide research and conversation, concedes there is \u201ccurrently no clear and agreed age at which children can safely use social media\u201d \u2013 but that the Australian age of 16 was agreed after wide local consultation. How will it work? In short \u2013 we don\u2019t know exactly. The changes will introduce \u201can obligation on providers of an age-restricted social media platform to take reasonable steps to prevent age-restricted users from having an account with the platform\u201d, according to the bill\u2019s explanatory memorandum. The onus will be on platforms to \u201cintroduce systems and processes that can be demonstrated to ensure that people under the minimum age cannot create and hold a social media account\u201d. Individual users won\u2019t be punished for managing to open an account, and platforms won\u2019t be penalised for \u201cindividual instances\u201d of getting around their tools \u2013 but the new fines, up to $50m, would apply for \u201csystematic\u201d issues where many users are managing to skirt the rules. However, the bill itself is intentionally vague on how that should be achieved. \u201cThe Bill does not dictate how platforms must comply with the minimum age obligation,\u201d the memorandum states. \u201cHowever, it is expected that, at a minimum, the obligation will require platforms to implement some form of age assurance, as a means of identifying whether a prospective or existing account holder is an Australian child under the age of 16 years.\u201d The \u201creasonable steps\u201d test will be assessed on a series of factors like the costs of implementing the technology, the availability of technology and the data implications for users. The government\u2019s age assurance trial, a program meant to look into possible options for age assurance technology, hasn\u2019t even begun yet \u2013 so we don\u2019t know what the platforms might do, or require from their users. The government said the reasonable steps test may \u201cevolve over time\u201d due to technology change. What data will people have to hand over? We don\u2019t know yet, and probably won\u2019t until the platforms are forced to build these systems. The government concedes that complying with the age assurance framework \u201cmay require the collection, use and disclosure of additional personal information\u201d. In a Senate estimates hearing earlier this month, the Greens senator David Shoebridge asked James Chisholm, the deputy secretary of the communications department, if \u201ceverybody [would] have to go through an age-verification process\u201d. \u201cYes,\u201d Chisholm replied. The memorandum goes on to stress there are \u201crobust\u201d privacy protections for any extra data needed, \u201cincluding prohibiting platforms from using information collected for age assurance purposes for any other purpose, unless explicitly agreed to by the individual\u201d. \u201cOnce the information has been used for age assurance or any other agreed purpose, it must be destroyed by the platform (or any third party contracted by the platform).\u201d It also states that \u201cserious and repeated breaches of these privacy provisions\u201d could be met by fines of up to $50m under the Privacy Act. Won\u2019t young people be able to get around the laws? In a word \u2013 yes. Indeed the memorandum says \u201cAustralia should be prepared for the reality that some people will break the rules, or slip through the cracks\u201d \u2013 but, in comparing it to how young people manage to obtain alcohol or cigarettes, the bill is said to \u201cset clear parameters for our society and assist in ensuring the right outcomes\u201d. The government has said that giving parents the power to tell their children that social media is illegal for them, even if the enforcement itself is not perfect, would be a powerful tool. Rowland said the plan \u201cwill not be met with universal acceptance\u201d, but governments should take such steps. \u201cThere is wide acknowledgment that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content, unfiltered and infinite,\u201d she said. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

In the summer of 2010, I was chief economist at the Cabinet Office. Not long after the election, I sent David Cameron an unsolicited paper about his pledge to reduce migration to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/14/david-cameron-toxic-migration-pledge-decade\">\u201ctens of thousands\u201d</a>. It said that this would almost certainly present him with the unpalatable choice between deliberately damaging the UK economy and labour market, and conspicuously failing to deliver a high-profile political commitment. I suggested, gently, ways in which the target could be modified.</p> <p>A brief note from his private office told me that Damian Green, the new immigration minister, had advised the prime minister not to worry \u2013 he (with the assistance of Migration Watch UK) had run the numbers. Unfortunately, their calculations were a combination of elementary errors and economic illiteracy. When asked about this on a recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1\">BBC documentary</a>, Cameron responded: \u201cJonathan Portes is a very intelligent man \u2013 but he didn\u2019t agree with anything the government wanted to do, so he wasn\u2019t the first person I was going to listen to.\u201d</p> <p>His loss, as it turned out. It was true I didn\u2019t share his objectives \u2013 but I genuinely thought that, as a civil servant, it was my job to advise him that there might be better and less risky ways to achieve them. The rest of the story is well known: forced to choose, just as I had warned him, between economically damaging restrictions to skilled and student migration from outside the EU and repeatedly failing to hit his target, Cameron in effect chose first the former and then the latter. And when the UK labour market was opened to Romania and Bulgaria in 2014, the incompatibility of EU membership with numerical migration targets became even more obvious, leaving an open goal for Vote Leave.</p> <p>Now, 14 years after Cameron\u2019s pledge, eight years after the Brexit vote and almost four years since the end of free movement and the post-Brexit system, the latest <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/longterminternationalmigrationprovisionalyearendingjune2024\">immigration figures</a> from the Office for National Statistics, covering the period up to June 2024, allow us to look back at the full record of what Badenoch describes as the Conservatives\u2019 failures. The numbers show that the remarkable and unexpected increase in immigration flows that followed the pandemic and the introduction of the post-Brexit immigration system has now abated. The number of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/672cd0bb62831268b0b1a333/entry-clearance-visa-outcomes-datasets-sep-24.xlsx\">visas issued</a> in the latest quarter was down a third on the previous year, with an especially large fall in the number of health and care visas, down by more than four-fifths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/aKNie/3/\" data-alt=\"Line graph showing net migration of British, EU and non-EU people over years\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/aKNie/3/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>So where next \u2013 and what lessons should this government learn from the failures of its predecessors? Most obviously, targeting immigration numbers, or even measuring the success of your policy by whether they go up or down, is setting yourself up to fail. There are just too many factors, economic and geopolitical, outside the government\u2019s control. Expecting better training and skills provision to reduce the demand for migration is also risky: in dynamic and fast-growing sectors, both more and better-skilled resident workers and high levels of migration are likely to be needed. In other sectors, such as care, we need better funding and higher pay \u2013 but the obstacles are obvious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/28/figures-net-migration-expected-falling-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates\">Number of cases in asylum backlog down 22%, says Home Office, but still higher than before 2022 \u2013 UK politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second is that policy must be informed by the long-term economics, as well as the short-term politics, of immigration. Restrictions won\u2019t necessarily make Labour\u2019s ambitions for growth unachievable, but they certainly won\u2019t help, with in essence all labour-force growth over the past five years <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/employmentbycountryofbirthandnationalityemp06\">coming from migration</a>. The UK\u2019s most successful and productive sectors \u2013 especially professional and business services, which have been a bright spot amid recent economic gloom \u2013 rely heavily on migration to drive innovation and productivity. Nor will falling migration make it easier to improve public services, since new migrants not only help to staff key public services but pay in considerably more than they \u201ccost\u201d the state.</p> <p>The third is the damage done by rapid and unpredictable policy swings, and the resulting unintended consequences. The previous government, by ending free movement, cut off a significant source of workers for the care sector. It then more than reversed this by liberalising care visas. Then, panicked by the numbers, it imposed restrictions on dependents specifically targeted at this disproportionately vulnerable group of workers. On student visas, Cameron and Theresa May abolished the \u201cpost-study work\u201d visa. The Boris Johnson administration not only reintroduced it, but encouraged universities to market it aggressively. That, in turn, was undercut by new restrictions, now undermining the finances of the whole sector.</p> <p>The fourth is the need for proper evaluation. Recent months have seen wild claims from the anti-immigration lobby \u2013 for instance, the Centre for Policy Studies\u2019 entirely baseless <a href=\"https://x.com/jdportes/status/1836019982410371357\">speculation</a> that only 5% of new migrants are in \u201chigh-wage\u201d jobs. In fact, the evidence to date <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/upward-mobility-earnings-trajectories-for-recent-immigrants/\">suggests</a> that the very large cohorts of new non-EU entrants in 2022 and 2023 are seeing relative earnings similar to or higher than their predecessors in most of the pre-pandemic period. But the data, and hence the analysis, is still patchy and preliminary. After the turbulence of the past few years, it would make sense to invest the time and money needed to work out what has worked well and what hasn\u2019t, before changing it yet again.</p> <p>Finally, the government needs a coherent narrative that convinces the public that migration is controlled and is working in the interests of the country. This won\u2019t be easy, but nor is it as hard as it sounds. After the failures of the past 14 years, some honesty \u2013 not making pledges that can\u2019t, won\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be kept \u2013 will go a long way. Many Britons <a href=\"https://natcen.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2024-06/BSA%2041%20Immigration.pdf\">recognise</a> the economic benefits of migration and the value of integration for us and new arrivals, and want to see that made to work better. When it comes to immigration, that is what \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d would mean.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London and a former senior civil servant</p></li> </ul>",

Expecting better training and skills provision to reduce the demand for migration is also risky: in dynamic and fast-growing sectors, both more and better-skilled resident workers and high levels of migration are likely to be needed. In other sectors, such as care, we need better funding and higher pay \u2013 but the obstacles are obvious. The second is that policy must be informed by the long-term economics, as well as the short-term politics, of immigration. Restrictions won\u2019t necessarily make Labour\u2019s ambitions for growth unachievable, but they certainly won\u2019t help, with in essence all labour-force growth over the past five years coming from migration. The UK\u2019s most successful and productive sectors \u2013 especially professional and business services, which have been a bright spot amid recent economic gloom \u2013 rely heavily on migration to drive innovation and productivity. Nor will falling migration make it easier to improve public services, since new migrants not only help to staff key public services but pay in considerably more than they \u201ccost\u201d the state. The third is the damage done by rapid and unpredictable policy swings, and the resulting unintended consequences. The previous government, by ending free movement, cut off a significant source of workers for the care sector. It then more than reversed this by liberalising care visas. Then, panicked by the numbers, it imposed restrictions on dependents specifically targeted at this disproportionately vulnerable group of workers. On student visas, Cameron and Theresa May abolished the \u201cpost-study work\u201d visa. The Boris Johnson administration not only reintroduced it, but encouraged universities to market it aggressively. That, in turn, was undercut by new restrictions, now undermining the finances of the whole sector. The fourth is the need for proper evaluation. Recent months have seen wild claims from the anti-immigration lobby \u2013 for instance, the Centre for Policy Studies\u2019 entirely baseless speculation that only 5% of new migrants are in \u201chigh-wage\u201d jobs. In fact, the evidence to date suggests that the very large cohorts of new non-EU entrants in 2022 and 2023 are seeing relative earnings similar to or higher than their predecessors in most of the pre-pandemic period. But the data, and hence the analysis, is still patchy and preliminary. After the turbulence of the past few years, it would make sense to invest the time and money needed to work out what has worked well and what hasn\u2019t, before changing it yet again. Finally, the government needs a coherent narrative that convinces the public that migration is controlled and is working in the interests of the country. This won\u2019t be easy, but nor is it as hard as it sounds. After the failures of the past 14 years, some honesty \u2013 not making pledges that can\u2019t, won\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be kept \u2013 will go a long way. Many Britons recognise the economic benefits of migration and the value of integration for us and new arrivals, and want to see that made to work better. When it comes to immigration, that is what \u201cfixing the foundations\u201d would mean.

      "bodyText": "Seven-year-old Valdenisa squealed with delight as she grasped the tape measure above her head. It was part of a game so that a doctor could measure the circumference of her head and check her withered legs. She was one of a dozen Indigenous Munduruku children being examined by a trio of child neurologists and geneticists earlier this month in Itaituba, in Brazil\u2019s Par\u00e1 state. Located on the Tapaj\u00f3s River, the town is known as the country\u2019s illegal gold capital, as it accounts for three-quarters of all the illicit gold produced in Brazil. Amid a surge in cases of children suffering from crippling physical and neurological symptoms, medics and Indigenous health specialists are asking if contamination caused by illegal gold mining is to blame and have drawn comparisons with the stark black-and-white images of Minamata \u2013 the Japanese town at the centre of the worst ever case of mercury poisoning, in the 1950s and 1960s. Miners use mercury, mostly contraband, as it is banned in Brazil, to extract gold. More than six out of 10 of Munduruku in three villages were found to have mercury levels above internationally recognised safe norms, and 15% of children had neurodevelopment problems, according to a groundbreaking study by universities, state institutions and civil society in 2020. The report\u2019s lead author, Paulo Basta, an investigator for Brazil\u2019s National School of Public Health (ENSP), part of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), noticed the \u201cincreasingly frequent birth of children with physical abnormalities, intellectual disability and rare neurological syndromes\u201d, over the past decade. Basta is conducting a long-term study that aims to measure the effects of prenatal exposure to mercury on the neurodevelopment of Indigenous children living in areas affected by gold mining. \u201cOur goal is to enrol 300 pregnant women and 300 newborns and to monitor the babies until they are two years old,\u201d he says. So far, 91 pregnant women are participating in the study, and 48 children have been born. The study began in March 2023 and will run until December 2026. Cleidiane Carvalho, a field nurse posted to one of the Munduruku communities in 2010, sounded the alarm when one of her patients in a mining-affected area gave birth to a disabled daughter. \u201cAs soon as I saw the child, I realised she had all the characteristics of a child from Minamata,\u201d she says by phone from Boa Vista, where she worked with the Yanomami, another Amazon people brutally affected by garimpo \u2013 as artisanal gold mining is known in Brazil. \u201cI had read about Minamata and made the connections.\u201d The mother says she was born in a community that has mining activities. \u201cEverything suggests that it was caused by [mercury] contamination. I became even more worried when the patient\u2019s second daughter was born with the same disfigurement,\u201d says Carvalho. *** Years later, Carvalho was promoted to regional coordinator of Indigenous health based in Itaituba, where she managed 28 health clinics and 400 employees in six municipalities. In 2017, she was shocked by the demand for wheelchairs in Munduruku villages, which was high and increasing every year. Alexo, 10, cannot walk. He clings on to his mother, wrapping his legs around her as they sit in the examination room with the medical experts. His father, Aldo Karo Munduruku, short with the wiry build of a man who works with his hands, gently lifts his son on to his feet. He takes a few tottering steps before needing to grasp the back of the bench. Alexo has microcephaly, an abnormally small head, and he can\u2019t walk or talk due to delayed physical and neurological development. \u201cI had this beautiful child, but I felt sad because he was a bit deficient,\u201d says Karo Munduruku. \u201cHe was never normal, you see. He didn\u2019t play like other children.\u201d After taking him for MRI scans and physical therapy in Santar\u00e9m, a day\u2019s journey from Sawr\u00e9 Muybu, the Indigenous territory where the family lives, they decided to use traditional medicine and noticed a slight improvement, he says. \u201cWe used the treatment from our culture, which has traditional remedies like bark, roots and leaves,\u201d Karo Munduruku says. \u201cHe started to sit up slowly, to have motor coordination, to move his hand, to talk to himself.\u201d As scientists try to unravel the mystery around the disproportionate number of disabled children, they have observed that all of the youngsters tested had unsafe levels of mercury in hair samples. However, poisoning does not explain everything. Claudio Gusm\u00e3o, coordinator of the paediatric movement disorders programme at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and one of the visiting experts in Itaituba, says the Munduruku are in a complex chain of circumstances involving mercury poisoning, poverty, poor healthcare and, possibly, a genetic disease. Gusm\u00e3o says the team has found some \u201cclearcut cases where there seems to be a genetic disorder\u201d. Mercury intoxication, he says, can explain \u201ca gamut of neurological problems\u201d, but poisoning would not necessarily be what caused them. Fernando Kok, a child neurologist from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and one of the group, says there is \u201cno evidence that mercury contamination can damage DNA\u201d. One theory suggests this might be a genetic disorder more commonly seen in isolated populations. Ganesh Mochida, the principal investigator at the division of genetics and genomics at Boston children\u2019s hospital in the US, says the group had detected an \u201cautosomal recessive condition\u201d in three children with microcephaly. *** As the health crisis rolls on, it has become the subject of a documentary called The New Minamata. During the medical examinations, the children\u2019s parents said they ate river fish every day, a source of methylmercury, the organic variety of the toxic metal that passes up the food chain. The 2020 study shows that estimated daily intakes of mercury from the fish were two to nine times higher than the limits permitted by the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization. \u201cIn other [Indigenous] territories, there aren\u2019t so many children affected by malformations of neurological illnesses,\u201d says Lucas Albertoni, technical advisor at the special secretariat for Indigenous health at Brazil\u2019s health ministry, adding that an estimated 60 children were affected in a population of about 20,000. Although there is no existing protocol for mercury contamination, the ministry has worked on a public health framework for Indigenous peoples to confront chronic poisoning in garimpo areas such as western Par\u00e1 state, Albertoni says. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who took office last year, promised to confront the environmental criminals that activists alleged were emboldened by his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Garimpo rapidly expanded during Bolsonaro\u2019s government as he weakened regulations and encouraged the garimpeiros to venture into prohibited areas such as Indigenous reserves and national parks. Lula\u2019s campaign against illegal mining has had notable success: there was an 84% drop in gold production at mines in the Brazilian Amazon between January and July 2024 compared with the same period in 2022, according to a report by thinktank Instituto Escolhas. Par\u00e1 was listed in the study as the place with the most significant drop in gold extraction. But while business has slowed in Itaituba\u2019s gold shops, the culture of gold mining, which dates back five decades, stubbornly holds on.",

Hegseth also connected the two, writing: \u201cWe have domestic enemies, and we have international allies \u2026 it\u2019s time to reach out to people who value the same principles, relearn lessons from them, and form stronger bonds.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018False, totally wrong\u2019</h2> <p>In American Crusade, Hegseth presents the medieval crusades as a model for Christian-Muslim relations, but one historian of the period says his presentation of the history of that period is \u201cjust totally wrong\u201d.</p> <p>In a chapter entitled Make the Crusade Great Again, Hegseth writes: \u201cBy the eleventh century, Christianity in the Mediterranean region, including the holy sites in Jerusalem, was so besieged by Islam that Christians had a stark choice: to wage defensive war or continue to allow Islam\u2019s expansion and face existential war at home in Europe,\u201d adding: \u201cThe leftists of today would have argued for \u2018diplomacy\u2019 \u2026 We know how that would have turned out.\u201d</p> <p>Hegseth continues: \u201cThe pope, the Catholic Church, and European Christians chose to fight \u2013 and the crusades were born,\u201d and \u201cPope Urban II urged the faithful to fight the Muslims with his famous battle cry on their lips: \u2018Deus vult!,\u2019 or \u2018God wills it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hegseth has a tattoo of the same crusader slogan, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-the-far-right-and-white-supremacists-have-embraced-the-middle-ages-and-their-symbols-152968\">which is also associated</a> with Christian nationalism, white supremacist and other far-right tendencies.</p> <p>For Hegseth, the crusaders\u2019 short-lived victories in the Holy Land means they can be credited with safeguarding modern values. \u201cEnjoy Western civilization? Freedom? Equal justice under the law? Thank a crusader,\u201d having written the same thing again earlier in the chapter.</p> <p>Matthew Gabriele is a professor of medieval studies in the Department of Religion and Culture at Virginia Tech, and the author, with David Perry, of <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-bright-ages-matthew-gabrieledavid-m-perry?variant=40262551044130\">Bright Ages: A New History of Medieval Europe</a>.</p> <p>In a telephone conversation, he said that Hegseth\u2019s picture of Muslim encroachment in the 11th century was misplaced.</p> <p>\u201cThere were absolutely no incursions into mainland Europe,\u201d he said, adding \u201cIf anything, Islam was kind of on the retreat in Iberia and other places as well. So there was no large geopolitical shift or any kind of immediate threat of Islam taking over Europe.\u201d</p> <p>On Hegseth\u2019s presentation of the crusades as a victory for the west against Islam, Gabriele said: \u201cThe Crusaders lost. They lost everything.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that they kind of like emerged victorious is absolutely false.</p> <p>\u201cThis narrative of the crusades as a defensive war, where if the Christians didn\u2019t launch this offensive towards Jerusalem that Europe would be overrun has been a bog-standard narrative on the right: it\u2019s something that was espoused by Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, in 2011 and by the Christchurch shooter a few years ago.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-crypto-extremism\">Trump\u2019s promise to loosen crypto regulations may be boon for extremist groups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Hegseth drawing a direct line between the crusaders and the modern west, Gabriele said: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of simplistic thinking,\u201d adding: \u201cAnybody who tells you these simple stories is selling something.\u201d</p> <h2>\u201cThe British were invaded, and they didn\u2019t even know it\u201d</h2> <p>Elsewhere in American Crusade, Hegseth repeatedly characterizes Muslim immigration to Europe as an \u201cinvasion\u201d in a way that mimics racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d-style conspiracy theories about immigrants displacing white populations.</p> <p>At one point he tries to connect \u2013 an expert says falsely \u2013 an aspect of Islamic history with the purported \u201ccapture\u201d of Europe.</p> <p>Hegseth writes: \u201cIn Islamist circles, there\u2019s a principle known as hegira,\u201d and then claims: \u201cThis term refers to the nonviolent capture of a non-Muslim country.\u201d</p> <p>Hegseth writes: \u201cHegira is a cultural, physical, psychological, political, and eventually religious takeover. History is replete with examples of this; and because history is not over, it\u2019s happening in the most inconceivable places right now.\u201d</p> <p>Hegseth posits the US as an example where, he claims: \u201cRadical mosques and schools are allowed to operate. Religious police control certain sections of many towns. Sharia councils dot the underground landscape. Pervasive political correctness prevents dissent against disastrous policies such as open borders and nonassimilation.\u201d</p> <p>Adducing proof, Hegseth bizarrely writes: \u201cTake the British cities of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Blackburn, Sheffield, Oxford, Luton, Oldham, and Rochdale. What do they all have in common? They have all had Muslim mayors.\u201d</p> <p>For Hegseth, this shows: \u201cThe British were invaded, and they didn\u2019t even know it. In one generation \u2013 absent radical policy change \u2013 the United Kingdom will be neither united nor a Western kingdom. The United Kingdom is done for.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cThe same can be said across Europe, especially following the disastrous open-borders, pro-migrant policies of the past few decades. Countries such as Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands threw open their doors to Muslim \u2018refugees\u2019 and will never be the same because of it.\u201d</p> <p>According to Hegseth, countries that do not restrict Muslim immigration ignore that \u201cIslam itself is not compatible with Western forms of government. On the other hand, countries that want to stay free \u2026 are fighting like hell to block Islam\u2019s spread.\u201d</p> <p>Jasmin Zine is professor of Sociology and Muslim Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University, and the author of a book-length report, The Canadian Islamophobia Industry: Mapping Islamophobia\u2019s Ecosystem in the Great White North.</p> <p>Zine said Hegseth\u2019s narrative appeared to be an \u201cIslamophobic conspiracy theory distorting the practice of \u2018hijra\u2019 or the migration of the Prophet Muhammad and early Muslims from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD looking for safety from persecution\u201d, which \u201cis now being used to promote the xenophobic idea of a Muslim \u2018takeover\u2019 of the west\u201d.</p> <p>Zine added: \u201cThese ideas are also linked to white nationalist demographic replacement conspiracies about Muslim birth rates in the west (AKA \u2018demographic jihad\u2019) and scare stories about \u2018creeping shariah\u2019, which have spawned retaliatory \u2018crusader\u2019 narratives in far-right subcultures.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Hard-core leftism provides the best gateway for Islamism\u2019</h2> <p>At other points in American Crusade, Hegseth appears to try to scapegoat Muslims for familiar conservative grievances, in narratives that suggest Muslims and leftists are colluding to undermine the US.</p> <p>In case of a Biden victory in 2020, Hegseth predicted that an \u201canti-Israel and pro-Islamist foreign policy\u201d would be introduced along with \u201cspeech codes instead of free speech, bye-bye Second Amendment\u201d and \u201cnaked socialism, government-run everything, Common Core education for everyone, a tiny military, and abortion on demand \u2013 even postbirth\u201d.</p> <p>Hegseth also tries to connect his narrative with gripes about supposed censorship on social media platforms. \u201cWho are the first people being banned on social media?\u201d he asks, answering: \u201cNot intolerant jihadists or filthy leftists but outspoken conservatives.\u201d</p> <p>At times he seems to admire what he imagines to be the thoroughgoing religious zealotry of Muslims compared with an increasingly secular west.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth, who has the crusader motto \u201cdeus vult\u201d tattooed on his arm, has put bigoted anti-Muslim rhetoric at the center of several of his published books, according to a Guardian review of the materials. Hegseth, especially in 2020\u2019s American Crusade, depicts Islam as a natural, historic enemy of the west; presents distorted versions of Muslim doctrine in \u201cgreat replacement\u201d-style racist conspiracy theories; treats leftists and Muslims as bound together in their efforts to subvert the US; and idolises medieval crusaders. Experts say that Hegseth\u2019s view of Islam is riven with falsehoods, misconceptions and far-right conspiracy theories. Yet Hegseth, if his nomination is successful, will head the world\u2019s largest military force at a time of conflict and instability in the Middle East. The Guardian emailed Hegseth and the Trump transition team for comment and received no response. The Guardian has previously reported that in his 2020 book Hegseth calls for an \u201cAmerican Crusade\u201d, targeting both \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cdomestic enemies\u201d and the enemies of Israel. Hegseth also connected the two, writing: \u201cWe have domestic enemies, and we have international allies \u2026 it\u2019s time to reach out to people who value the same principles, relearn lessons from them, and form stronger bonds.\u201d \u2018False, totally wrong\u2019 In American Crusade, Hegseth presents the medieval crusades as a model for Christian-Muslim relations, but one historian of the period says his presentation of the history of that period is \u201cjust totally wrong\u201d. In a chapter entitled Make the Crusade Great Again, Hegseth writes: \u201cBy the eleventh century, Christianity in the Mediterranean region, including the holy sites in Jerusalem, was so besieged by Islam that Christians had a stark choice: to wage defensive war or continue to allow Islam\u2019s expansion and face existential war at home in Europe,\u201d adding: \u201cThe leftists of today would have argued for \u2018diplomacy\u2019 \u2026 We know how that would have turned out.\u201d Hegseth continues: \u201cThe pope, the Catholic Church, and European Christians chose to fight \u2013 and the crusades were born,\u201d and \u201cPope Urban II urged the faithful to fight the Muslims with his famous battle cry on their lips: \u2018Deus vult!,\u2019 or \u2018God wills it!\u2019\u201d Hegseth has a tattoo of the same crusader slogan, which is also associated with Christian nationalism, white supremacist and other far-right tendencies. For Hegseth, the crusaders\u2019 short-lived victories in the Holy Land means they can be credited with safeguarding modern values. \u201cEnjoy Western civilization? Freedom? Equal justice under the law? Thank a crusader,\u201d having written the same thing again earlier in the chapter. Matthew Gabriele is a professor of medieval studies in the Department of Religion and Culture at Virginia Tech, and the author, with David Perry, of Bright Ages: A New History of Medieval Europe. In a telephone conversation, he said that Hegseth\u2019s picture of Muslim encroachment in the 11th century was misplaced. \u201cThere were absolutely no incursions into mainland Europe,\u201d he said, adding \u201cIf anything, Islam was kind of on the retreat in Iberia and other places as well. So there was no large geopolitical shift or any kind of immediate threat of Islam taking over Europe.\u201d On Hegseth\u2019s presentation of the crusades as a victory for the west against Islam, Gabriele said: \u201cThe Crusaders lost. They lost everything. \u201cThe idea that they kind of like emerged victorious is absolutely false. \u201cThis narrative of the crusades as a defensive war, where if the Christians didn\u2019t launch this offensive towards Jerusalem that Europe would be overrun has been a bog-standard narrative on the right: it\u2019s something that was espoused by Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, in 2011 and by the Christchurch shooter a few years ago.\u201d On Hegseth drawing a direct line between the crusaders and the modern west, Gabriele said: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of simplistic thinking,\u201d adding: \u201cAnybody who tells you these simple stories is selling something.\u201d \u201cThe British were invaded, and they didn\u2019t even know it\u201d Elsewhere in American Crusade, Hegseth repeatedly characterizes Muslim immigration to Europe as an \u201cinvasion\u201d in a way that mimics racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d-style conspiracy theories about immigrants displacing white populations. At one point he tries to connect \u2013 an expert says falsely \u2013 an aspect of Islamic history with the purported \u201ccapture\u201d of Europe. Hegseth writes: \u201cIn Islamist circles, there\u2019s a principle known as hegira,\u201d and then claims: \u201cThis term refers to the nonviolent capture of a non-Muslim country.\u201d Hegseth writes: \u201cHegira is a cultural, physical, psychological, political, and eventually religious takeover. History is replete with examples of this; and because history is not over, it\u2019s happening in the most inconceivable places right now.\u201d Hegseth posits the US as an example where, he claims: \u201cRadical mosques and schools are allowed to operate. Religious police control certain sections of many towns. Sharia councils dot the underground landscape. Pervasive political correctness prevents dissent against disastrous policies such as open borders and nonassimilation.\u201d Adducing proof, Hegseth bizarrely writes: \u201cTake the British cities of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Blackburn, Sheffield, Oxford, Luton, Oldham, and Rochdale. What do they all have in common? They have all had Muslim mayors.\u201d For Hegseth, this shows: \u201cThe British were invaded, and they didn\u2019t even know it. In one generation \u2013 absent radical policy change \u2013 the United Kingdom will be neither united nor a Western kingdom. The United Kingdom is done for.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe same can be said across Europe, especially following the disastrous open-borders, pro-migrant policies of the past few decades. Countries such as Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands threw open their doors to Muslim \u2018refugees\u2019 and will never be the same because of it.\u201d According to Hegseth, countries that do not restrict Muslim immigration ignore that \u201cIslam itself is not compatible with Western forms of government. On the other hand, countries that want to stay free \u2026 are fighting like hell to block Islam\u2019s spread.\u201d Jasmin Zine is professor of Sociology and Muslim Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University, and the author of a book-length report, The Canadian Islamophobia Industry: Mapping Islamophobia\u2019s Ecosystem in the Great White North. Zine said Hegseth\u2019s narrative appeared to be an \u201cIslamophobic conspiracy theory distorting the practice of \u2018hijra\u2019 or the migration of the Prophet Muhammad and early Muslims from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD looking for safety from persecution\u201d, which \u201cis now being used to promote the xenophobic idea of a Muslim \u2018takeover\u2019 of the west\u201d. Zine added: \u201cThese ideas are also linked to white nationalist demographic replacement conspiracies about Muslim birth rates in the west (AKA \u2018demographic jihad\u2019) and scare stories about \u2018creeping shariah\u2019, which have spawned retaliatory \u2018crusader\u2019 narratives in far-right subcultures.\u201d \u2018Hard-core leftism provides the best gateway for Islamism\u2019 At other points in American Crusade, Hegseth appears to try to scapegoat Muslims for familiar conservative grievances, in narratives that suggest Muslims and leftists are colluding to undermine the US. In case of a Biden victory in 2020, Hegseth predicted that an \u201canti-Israel and pro-Islamist foreign policy\u201d would be introduced along with \u201cspeech codes instead of free speech, bye-bye Second Amendment\u201d and \u201cnaked socialism, government-run everything, Common Core education for everyone, a tiny military, and abortion on demand \u2013 even postbirth\u201d. Hegseth also tries to connect his narrative with gripes about supposed censorship on social media platforms. \u201cWho are the first people being banned on social media?\u201d he asks, answering: \u201cNot intolerant jihadists or filthy leftists but outspoken conservatives.\u201d At times he seems to admire what he imagines to be the thoroughgoing religious zealotry of Muslims compared with an increasingly secular west. \u201cAlmost every single Muslim child grows up listening to, and learning to read from, the Quran,\u201d Hegseth writes. \u201cContrast this with our secular American schools \u2013 in which the Bible is nowhere to be found \u2013 and you\u2019ll understand why Muslims\u2019 worldview is more coherent than ours.\u201d At another point in the book he engages in a lengthy diatribe about the Council for American Islamic Relations (Cair), which has been a bugbear for US conservatives since the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, and claims Democrats are helping the organization cement a radical \u201cIslamist\u201d agenda. \u201cGroups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and [Cair] have advanced the radical mission of Islamism for decades,\u201d Hegseth claims, adding: \u201cIn the past two years alone, more than one hundred members of Congress \u2013 including Ilhan Omar, Adam Schiff, Rashida Tlaib, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 have signed letters endorsing CAIR.\u201d Hegseth then singles out \u201cSocialist Bernie Sanders\u201d, who he claims is \u201ca favorite among Muslim Americans due to his support for Palestinian causes and distaste for Israel\u201d. Sanders has repeatedly publicly supported Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, even after the commencement of the current war in Gaza, while also saying: \u201cInnocent Palestinians also have a right to life and security,\u201d and calling for humanitarian pauses and ceasefires, and last week leading efforts to restrict the sale of offensive weapons to Israel on the grounds that it was in violation of the international laws of war. Some of Sanders\u2019s positions since 7 October 2023 have drawn criticism from the left, who have seen them as insufficiently critical of Israel and insufficiently supportive of Palestine. Hegseth meanwhile, as previously reported in the Guardian, is unconditionally supportive of Israel, and has appeared to argue that the US military should ignore the Geneva conventions in favor of \u201cwinning our wars according to our own rules\u201d. According to Hegseth in American Crusade, though: \u201cLeaders of CAIR speak very highly of Bernie because his hard-core leftism provides the best gateway for their Islamism.\u201d",

Change Shapes condemns music industry sexism, but suggests Mayberry has \u201clearned the rules\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re all snakes, but what\u2019s a girl supposed to do?\u201d A Work of Fiction\u2019s male lead seems to be a posturing jerk, but, the song admits, that\u2019s what makes him attractive. \u201cIt makes me sick,\u201d she sings of one such relationship, on Punch Drunk, \u201cand I hope it never ends.\u201d In fact, for all its ostensibly straightforward and zeitgeisty MO, Vicious Creatures is quite a messy, contradictory business overall: alternately clumsy and deft, a homage to pop\u2019s past that\u2019s at its best when it fixes its gaze firmly forward. For all the lengthy gestation period between Mayberry\u2019s initial impulse to go solo and her solo debut\u2019s arrival, the finished product still sounds like someone finding their feet in a different landscape. \u2022 Vicious Creature is released 6 December This week Alexis listened to The New Starts \u2013 A Little Stone As more than one observer has pointed out, if the New Starts were a band still wet behind the ears, rather than indie lifer Darren Hayman\u2019s latest project, they\u2019d be all over the tips for 2025 lists: this is a noisy, angular, thrilling rush.",

It is widely believed by observers of the conflict that Israel\u2019s government is seeking to annex parts of the territory. About 44,300 Palestinians have been killed in more than a year of fighting according to the local health ministry, whose figures are considered by the UN to be accurate. A total of 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 taken captive on 7 October 2023. Israel says 63 hostages are still alive.",

The two companies have reached a preliminary agreement on the financial terms of a deal that values Renewi at 870p a share, a 57% premium to its closing price of 554p on Wednesday night. In a joint statement, they said the terms of the deal were final, and Renewi had agreed to provide Macquarie with access to its books so confirmatory due diligence could be conducted. The agreement comes a year after Macquarie was thwarted in an attempt to take over Renewi, when an offer worth 810p a share was rejected. Renewi, formerly known as Shanks Group until a 2017 rebrand, sold its UK municipal bin-collecting business to the rival Biffa earlier this year. It now operates in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Portugal, and says it converts most of the waste it collects into \u201ccircular materials\u201d, which it sells to its customers via the circular economy. Macquarie, which has been criticised for its stewardship of Thames Water when it was a shareholder, has pledged to \u201cmaintain a prudent and sustainable leverage structure\u201d at Renewi, and to safeguard employees\u2019 rights.

He had already admitted escaping from Wandsworth prison as he awaited trial.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to disentangle [Khalife\u2019s] ego \u2013 the fantasy he created, the money he earned, and his inability to understand the damage he was causing here,\u201d Commander Dominic Murphy of Scotland Yard\u2019s SO15 counter-terrorism unit told reporters, when asked about Khalife\u2019s motivation to work for Tehran. \u201cPut it all together and it is a mixed picture. And it is a picture of Daniel Khalife.\u201d</p> <p>For his part, Khalife told the jury he had sought to cultivate his Iranian intelligence contacts to help British security services. He claimed he mainly fed his handlers either fake information, or real documents that were already in the public domain. And, once he had their trust, he had wanted to work as a double agent for the British. The breakout, he said, was to demonstrate the folly of locking up someone with his talents.</p> <p>Here was a man who really was spying for Tehran, a jury has found. He was passing his handlers information that, while often fake, could easily have put the British-Iranian former prisoner in Tehran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe at risk, police say. And, at the same time, here was a man who thought he would be able to secure his recruitment by British intelligence by ringing MI5\u2019s front desk.</p> <p>Here was a man who was able to gather the names of special forces personnel and to subsequently break out of a prison. And, at the same time, here was a man who thought he could play the security apparatus of one nation off against that of another by sending a message on the \u201ccontact us\u201d section on MI6\u2019s website.</p> <p>Khalife\u2019s own defence to the spying charges was that the way he acted was \u201ccrazy perhaps, hare-brained in some respects\u201d, but that he had at least avoided \u201cbetraying or hurting anyone, other than himself\u201d.</p> <p>The 23-year-old also admitted breaking out of Wandsworth prison in south-west London by harnessing himself to the underside of a food delivery lorry in September 2023. He was being held there on remand.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps he did not need to be quite as resourceful as might be thought to carry out his escape. The driver of the van on which Khalife stowed away told the jury he was allowed to leave the site, even though it was known a prisoner was missing. And an inspection later found dozens of failures, describing a facility in crisis, where management could not even account for prisoners during the working day.</p> <p>Khalife said he initially planned only to arouse suspicion of an escape so he could be moved to a higher-security wing, where he would feel safer in prison. But, when his efforts apparently failed to provoke suspicion among senior prison staff, he concluded a blunter instrument was needed to get their attention: an actual escape.</p> <p>During the trial, the court heard Khalife made contact with Iran in April 2019, about seven months after he had joined the British army shortly before his 17th birthday. The court heard he contacted Hamed Ghashgabi, an Iranian intelligence officer who had been placed under sanctions by the US, over Facebook.</p> <p>Prosecutors said he started handing his Iranian contacts information the following month. Khalife has said he produced \u201cfake documents\u201d to help convince the Iranians to trust him. They included a made-up letter supposedly from the then defence secretary, Ben Wallace, to the head of MI6 with a \u201cset of orders \u2026 in regards to Iran\u201d. Another was a fake letter from the former Tory MP Penny Mordaunt to a senior naval figure describing \u201cthe use of unarmed submersible technology to further the UK\u2019s interest in the Middle East\u201d.</p> <p>Other documents fabricated by Khalife \u2013 some of which contained spelling mistakes \u2013 included one titled \u201cNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe intelligense [sic] options\u201d that prosecutors said could have endangered her, and another with a Ministry of Defence header called \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear ambitions\u201d.</p> <p>About three months after first speaking to Iranian agents, Khalife tried to contact the UK\u2019s foreign intelligence service, MI6. He would go on to also try to contact the domestic security service, MI5, in November 2021.</p> <p>But not before travelling to Istanbul to \u201cdeliver a package\u201d to Iranian intelligence, discussing an internal military system with a contact and taking a photo of a handwritten note of 15 troops \u2013 including some serving in the Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS). Prosecutors said he continued to pass information to Tehran until January 2022.

The most recent drop has been fuelled by Rishi Sunak\u2019s policies of banning most international students and health and social care workers from bringing relatives with them to the UK, and hiking the salary required to sponsor a foreign spouse coming to Britain. The figures covering the previous Conservative government are a reminder of the political repercussions of unkept promises on immigration, according to an immigration thinktank. Sunder Katwala, director of the migration thinktank British Future, said: \u201c[Keir] Starmer will oversee a continuing fall from the record levels of net migration but his challenge now is to manage the trade-offs on migration for the economy, NHS, universities and social care. \u201cIt remains to be seen how much the public will notice a fall in visa numbers if there is no progress on controlling the much more visible Channel crossings.\u201d In the year to June 2024, about 94,000 fewer people applied to travel to the UK on study visas than in the previous 12 months, according to Home Office data from earlier this month. \u201cStudy visa\u201d figures include family members or other dependants of students \u2013 but from January 2024 many students were prohibited from bringing them with them, under visa changes by the then Conservative government. Applications for health and care workers and their dependants remained slightly higher in the year to June than in the previous year \u2013 mainly driven by a surge in the second half of 2023. But care workers were also barred from bringing in dependants under visa changes in March 2024. Skilled worker visa applications increased slightly over the same period, with a noticeable rise before a government shake-up of the jobs this visa applies to in April 2024. Applications have since fallen.",

Having unjustifiably ordered a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxgyzq7z2ro\">large-scale ground invasion</a> in Lebanon last month, preceded by aerial bombing and sabotage attacks in Beirut, Israel\u2019s hawkish prime minister is quitting while he\u2019s ahead. Operation Northern Arrows is being presented to the public as a success, unlike the 2006 war. Hezbollah\u2019s military power has undoubtedly been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/world/middleeast/hezbollah-israel-ceasefire.html\">seriously degraded</a>.</p> <p>Yet the reasons why Netanyahu has refused for more than a year to accept a similar ceasefire in Gaza are intrinsically unchanged. The war there suits him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/22/netanyahu-bombing-brinkmanship-stop-us\">politically and personally</a>. Unlike in Lebanon, he continues to seek \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFqSOUt7WE\">total victory</a>\u201d. Concessions to Hamas, such as releasing Palestinian prisoners, would sink his hard-right coalition. The war keeps at bay an official investigation into the security failures surrounding the 7 October 2023 Hamas atrocities \u2013 and likewise, court proceedings against Netanyahu for alleged bribery and corruption.</p> <p>Whatever Biden may hope to achieve in the dog days of his presidency, Netanyahu has no incentive to end Gaza\u2019s agony before his ideological ally, Donald Trump, swaggers into office on 20 January. Only then will he maybe act \u2013 and that\u2019s a big maybe. The Lebanon ceasefire means cohorts of Israel\u2019s overstretched army, once rested and rearmed, may concentrate in even greater force in Gaza. It brings closer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-plan-northern-gaza-palestinian-civilians-hamas\">the forced depopulation</a> and de facto annexation of northern areas of the territory urged by Israel\u2019s far-right extremists.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s sudden Rose Garden conversion into an advocate for Palestinian rights \u2013 \u201cthe people of Gaza have been through hell,\u201d he said \u2013 leaves an especially bad taste. As <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-11-20-2024-5da3ce43df8662fe9eeab4ad804bdc0f\">more than 44,000</a> Palestinians in Gaza, mostly civilians, died and innumerable others \u2013 young and old \u2013 were injured and traumatised, Biden <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c704y7gwr95o\">refused to fully condemn</a> Netanyahu\u2019s illegal actions, impose credible sanctions or cancel weapons deliveries to curb Israeli excesses.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a sobering fact that, under this agreement, Netanyahu can restart the war any time he chooses. Israeli troops have 60 days to withdraw. That timeline may stretch out. If Israel decides Hezbollah\u2019s forces are not staying put behind Lebanon\u2019s Litani River demarcation line, 18 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon boundary, or are rearming, then boom! The whole horror show resumes. If Netanyahu decides, arbitrarily, that a touch more war would be politically useful, he can have it, thanks to a <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/26/five-questions-ceasefire-israel-hezbollah-lebanon/\">flimsy deal</a> that may be blown away in a moment.</p> <p>Almost forgotten, again, and not least by Netanyahu, are the 100 or so unaccounted-for Israeli hostages taken on 7 October. Hamas may be weakened by Hezbollah\u2019s defeat. But there are no imminent or credible signs that the terrorist group, though more badly mauled than even its Lebanese ally, is <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-ceasefire-begins-hamas-says-ready-gaza-truce\">minded to surrender</a> its remaining \u201cbargaining chips\u201d. It is sticking to its demand for a full withdrawal by Israel.</p> <p>In point of fact, as Biden noted, there is presently no bargaining at all. He has reportedly made a ceasefire and hostage release deal that leaves Hamas \u201cwithout power\u201d in Gaza a top priority for the remainder of his term. He hopes that Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will help him out. He has failed in this repeatedly. The chances of success now are slim to nonexistent.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s long-nurtured dream of a wider Middle East settlement looks as remote as ever. The plan revolves around the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, on the model of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/uae-bahrain-and-israel-sign-historic-accords-at-white-house-event-formal-relations-trump-netanyahu\">Abraham accords</a> negotiated by Trump. This, it is thought, would help marginalise Iran while binding the Saudis more closely to the west (and keeping China at bay). Yet the fundamental snag facing this scheme is that it depends on substantive progress towards a two-state solution \u2013 in short, a sovereign Palestinian state.</p> <p>Since 7 October, attitudes on both sides of the Arab-Israeli divide have hardened. The Saudis absolutely insist on Palestinian self-determination. Netanyahu and his far-right crew absolutely insist on thwarting it by any means. This will not change simply because the guns have fallen silent in Lebanon, nor because Biden, at last knockings, wants to bequeath a peace president\u2019s legacy.</p> <p>Not least because of business interests in the Gulf, Trump is also expected to pursue Saudi normalisation. But he lacks skill and focus. He will want an easy win, or he will lose interest. Like Netanyahu, he demonstrates open contempt for Palestinian rights. As a result, any more ambitious peacemaking effort looks bound to fail.</p> <p>Another fact: if the Americans cannot bring about a lasting, comprehensive Middle East peace, no one can. In the coming vacuum, Hezbollah, battered but unbowed, will surreptitiously begin to rearm, assisted as in the past by Iran.

That is compared with the one day\u2019s notice the FCA originally proposed.</p> <p>It will give companies the chance to challenge the FCA\u2019s decision, and if the regulator still decides to push ahead, firms would have an additional 48 hours before the notice goes public.</p> <p>The regulator also clarified that it would not announce any investigations that were launched before the new policy comes into effect. However, it said it may confirm investigations that were already in the public domain if it determined it was in the public interest.</p> <p>City firms are now being asked to weigh in on the new rules by 17 February, with the FCA board planning to make a final decision on the new rules by the end of March next year.</p> <p>The UK Finance chief executive, David Postings, said he welcomed the new proposals after \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the FCA.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to consider the impact on individual firms and the wider market before making any public announcement. We therefore welcome the fact the FCA has listened and taken on board industry feedback.

      "bodyText": "The City regulator has bowed to pressure over plans to \u201cname and shame\u201d some companies it investigates, offering watered-down proposals that would give firms 10 days\u2019 notice and consider the \u201cpotential negative impact\u201d of revealing the identities of companies under inspection. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) put forward new proposals on Thursday after months of intense criticism from businesses, which have tried to thwart the watchdog\u2019s plans to be more transparent with the public and whistleblowers when it is investigating potential wrongdoing across the City. The government had also threatened to intervene, with the City minister, Tulip Siddiq, having told the watchdog to rethink its plans and suggesting she could overrule the FCA. This pressure from companies and the government forced the regulator to review its proposals and run a second consultation. \u201cWe have heard the strength of feedback to our original proposals, and we are making changes as a result,\u201d said Therese Chambers, the FCA\u2019s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight. \u201cWe hope the greater detail published today supports the further engagement we hope to have on the proposals, before we make any final decisions.\u201d Some of the most significant changes include a new set of public interest tests that consider a wider range of risks if the FCA were to disclose individual investigations. It means the FCA would explicitly consider whether an announcement could have a negative impact on the company, either through a fall in its share price and market value \u2013 if investors subsequently dump their stock \u2013 or whether it could lead to a loss of clients or contracts. The regulator will also consider whether any announcement could seriously disrupt public confidence in the financial system. It comes after pressure from lobby groups including UK Finance, which suggested the naming and shaming approach could be \u201charmful to wider financial stability\u201d. However, the FCA said that a large number of investigations into banks had been publicly disclosed before a settlement was reached, and that there was no evidence that they had put financial stability at risk. Meanwhile, the regulator said it would give companies 10 days\u2019 notice ahead of any public announcement being made. That is compared with the one day\u2019s notice the FCA originally proposed. It will give companies the chance to challenge the FCA\u2019s decision, and if the regulator still decides to push ahead, firms would have an additional 48 hours before the notice goes public. The regulator also clarified that it would not announce any investigations that were launched before the new policy comes into effect. However, it said it may confirm investigations that were already in the public domain if it determined it was in the public interest. City firms are now being asked to weigh in on the new rules by 17 February, with the FCA board planning to make a final decision on the new rules by the end of March next year. The UK Finance chief executive, David Postings, said he welcomed the new proposals after \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the FCA. \u201cIt is important to consider the impact on individual firms and the wider market before making any public announcement. We therefore welcome the fact the FCA has listened and taken on board industry feedback. They have made a number of significant changes, including the increased notice period and the more rigorous approach to assessing the potential impact of an announcement within their public interest test.\u201d",

Tepper added that coastline restoration remained a \u201ctop priority\u201d for Healey\u2019s administration. The grants are being awarded through two state programs: the DER\u2019s wetland restoration program and the DER\u2019s cranberry bog restoration program, which converts defunct cranberry bogs into wetlands and streams. To date, scientists and government officials have converted 400 acres of retired cranberry bogs into wetlands, the Washington Post reported. State officials have said they hope to restore an additional 1,000 acres of bogs within the next decade. The state has continued to commit sizable grants for restoration purposes. In April, the state received a $5m federal grant to transition 57 acres of retired cranberry bogs into wetlands on Cape Cod.

A cut-up sleeping bag was wrapped around his legs, shielding them from the bitter cold. The two oil and gas workers, who had spent the previous week surveying the trail, stared dumbfounded. When they took the sticks from his hands to help him into their truck, he nearly collapsed. The harrowing details are a coda to the \u201cunbelievable miracle\u201d of a hiker who survived 50 days lost in the Canadian wilderness \u2013 and to the sustained and desperate search by his family and friends. On Wednesday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed that Sam Benastick, 20, was being treated at the hospital in Fort Nelson, British Columbia, more than seven weeks after he was last seen heading into the wild. He was suffering from frostbite and smoke inhalation caused when his makeshift shelter burned down. Benastick set out on 7 October, on what was supposed to be a 10-day camping trip; he was reported missing by his family after he failed to return home on 17 October. An avid outdoorsman, Benastick was destined for Redfern-Keily provincial park \u2013 an 80,000 hectare swathe of \u201clush alpine meadows, forested valley bottoms, serrated peaks, glaciers, waterfalls and large valley lakes\u201d in the northern reaches of the Rocky mountains. Access is challenging: the park is 50 miles (80km) from the closest road. And its website warns the remote backcountry landscape can be unforgiving. \u201cBe prepared for any weather conditions while visiting the park: you are in an isolated area and weather can change rapidly,\u201d it says. In recent days, temperatures have dipped to below -20C and snow has blanketed the ground. For Benatstick\u2019s family, news he had survived against the odds was vindication for the the sliver of hope they had long clung to. On 23 October \u2013 more than a month before Benastick was eventually found \u2013 his aunt Karen Crocker Essex posted on Facebook that \u201ctomorrow is a big day for our family with helicopters and a larger crew\u201d to support this search. \u201cWinter is setting in and we need to bring Sam home!\u201d More than 50 people, and search dogs, scoured the region for any hint that Benastick was alive. But a week later, his mother, Sandra Crocker, thanked the \u201cendless volunteers\u201d who had been unable to find a trace of her son. The official search had ended, but family refused to accept that Benastick had succumbed to the worsening conditions. Family and friends speculated he might have run into trouble 19 miles into the hike, turning around to sleep in his car, possibly to a different location. They also scoured his online searches of hiking locations, and scouted the nearby Sikanni Chief River with no luck. In the end, Benastick was found close to where the initial search had begun. The oil rig workers piled a cold, fatigued and dehydrated Benastick into their truck and fed him their sandwiches. When they got him back into the range of mobile phone service, he called his father. His voice was weak. Later that day fatigued Benastick told police he had stayed in his car and then walked to a creek, where he camped for nearly 15 days. He later built camp in a dried-out creek bed, before finding the road and flagging down the two oil workers. The Central Okanagan Search and Rescue, which was involved in the search along crews from four other regions, called the discovery an \u201cunbelievable miracle\u201d. Mike Reid, the general manager of the Buffalo Inn in Pink Mountain, BC, said he first received a message from the hotel owner that \u201cRob\u201d had been found alive.

Vould you like to have a roll in ze hay?\" as she famously said \u2026, 3:A - Blushes prevent the Thursday quiz from reminding you what her placard said, 4:D - He played Kate's father who had invented a weather machine and then was whisked away by the government, years before chemtrail conspiracy theories became popular, 5:C - He was, of course, Darth Vader, although the actor on screen in the costume was David Prowse, 6:A - Dave died in February aged 66, and the 20,000 bikers took part in a procession from London to Barrow-in-Furness to pay tribute, 7:D - The song appeared on the under-rated fourth World Party album Egyptology in 1997 and was covered by Williams in 1999, somewhat to Wallinger's displeasure, it transpired, 8:A - He won the first of his six titles in 1970, going on to win in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978. He was runner-up in 1982, 9:B - She was nominated four times, for Othello (1965), A Room with a View (1985) and Gosford Park (2001), and won for California Suite (1978), 10:D - This is sadly true, although he did win golds at two Commonwealth Games and at two European Indoor Championships, and was on the television a lot during the 1970s and 1980s, making him a household name, 11:B - Prepare for trouble! And make it double! Jessie, James and Meowth were always after Ash's Pikachu, 12:D - Damo Suzuki was Can\u2019s vocalist from 1970 until 1973, and was still gigging playing improvised music with local \"sound carriers\" acting as his band with a different lineup at every show very close to his death this year aged 74, 13:B - Neeskens scored in the second minute and that whole Dutch squad during the 1970s deserved more than two runners-up medals, 14:B - The band enjoyed 13 top three singles (if you include their contributions to three charity collectives) but on their own scored No 1 hits with Drag Me Down, One Way or Another, Little Things and of course their signature debut, What Makes You Beautiful, 15:D - She was Jack Torrance's long-suffering wife, 16:B - Running Free was their debut single and reached No 34 in the charts. The eagle-eyed NWOBHM fans among you will know that The Number of the Beast was Bruce Dickinson's first appearance on a single, Bring Your Daughter \u2026 to the Slaughter was their first No 1 single, and Strong Arm of the Law is by somebody else entirely. These words won't stop this being pointed out in the comments, no doubt, 17:A - He took England to three tournament quarter-finals, losing on penalties twice. He achieved an ambition to manage a team at Anfield in the last months of his life, 18:A - She played Brenda Walsh for the first four seasons of the show, 19:B - He punched a bloke who had thrown an egg at him, and Labour went on to win the election, 20:D - The Great Dane lived in West Des Moines, Iowa, and was an astonishing 7ft tall if he stood up on his hind legs</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"1\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Let us know how you got on in the comments!\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian Thursday quiz in memoriam special\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Let us know how you got on in the comments!</p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><em>If you really do think there has been an egregious error in one of the questions or answers \u2013 and can show your working \u2013 you can complain about it in the comments below.

      "body": "<p>Augusta Britt, now 64, says that she met the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/cormac-mccarthy\">Cormac McCarthy</a> in 1976 beside a motel pool in Arizona. McCarthy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/14/cormac-mccarthy-obituary\">who died last year</a>, was 42 at the time. Britt was 16. Britt says that she was quasi-homeless in those years, bouncing between an abusive family home and a series of abusive foster homes, and used to go to the motel so that she could shower in the pool\u2019s changing rooms without fear of men following her into the foster home bathrooms to sexually assault her.</p> <p>Britt says that when McCarthy saw her at the poolside he asked about a gun in a holster at her hip, and that she described some of her history of abuse to him and said that she\u2019d stolen the gun from a foster father so that she would never be hit again.</p> <p>McCarthy apparently saw this disclosure as an opportunity to initiate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/20/cormac-mccarthy-began-relationship-with-16-year-old-while-42-and-married\">romantic relationship with the homeless teenager</a>. He started writing her explicit letters. Within a year, McCarthy had had Britt\u2019s birth certificate forged so that she would appear old enough for an international visa, and taken her to Mexico, where he began to have sex with the girl. She says he spoke frequently of his knowledge of all the various laws he was breaking by having sex with her. It wasn\u2019t until they returned to the United States that Britt discovered that McCarthy was married.</p> <p>The pair would stay in close touch over the intervening decades. McCarthy twice asked Britt to marry him, and then reneged on the offer. Sometimes he sent her money; often, he would pay her a visit at the horse ranch she eventually bought in Tucson to ask her about her childhood experiences of violence \u2013 which seem to have been many and brutal \u2013 and to learn about horse riding and taming, which he wrote about in his many brooding western novels, but never actually did himself. He based characters in his books on Britt, an appropriation of her story and suffering that she found uncomfortable. Often, McCarthy killed off the characters based on her in strange and violent ways.</p> <p>This, according to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/cormac-mccarthy-secret-muse-exclusive?srsltid=AfmBOoqApx5eHSkGhvdr1HhJZNJ8-FYRrAbaVBry2XDwAJzP_0bsK5b8\">Vanity Fair</a>, is a love story. In a lengthy and bizarre piece, the magazine deployed the novice writer Vincenzo Barney \u2013 evidently something of a McCarthy superfan \u2013 to launder the grooming and apparent trafficking and sexual exploitation of a desperate and abused minor, followed by the years-long callous exploitation of an adult, into something that readers are supposed to interpret as romance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Vanity Fair article seeking to romanticize McCarthy\u2019s actions comes at a moment when the legacy of the #MeToo movement ... is coming in for heated contestation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Barney is a florid and heavy-handed writer. His sentences are overladen with multiple metaphors, meant to evoke a scenic south-western breathlessness: he is obviously trying to mimic the masculine seriousness and rugged self-regard that are the hallmarks of McCarthy\u2019s style. \u201cBehind her, framed between the posts of Scout\u2019s stall, the Catalina Mountains loom burnt green, brushed upward with the impressionistic confidence of a child\u2019s paint stroke,\u201d he writes. \u201cBritt stands poised at the picture\u2019s edge like a foreground that has leaked out of its frame, at play between painting and outer world, portrait and subject.\u201d He is perhaps a bit high on his own supply.</p> <p>These belabored sentences have the effect of rendering Barney\u2019s actual account of the events in question a bit opaque: a casual reader could be forgiven for not deciphering the nature of McCarthy\u2019s abuse, which is obscured both by Barney\u2019s disturbing sentimentalization and by his unreadable prose.</p> <p>Among other things, the piece does not seem to have been subjected to rigorous fact-checking. A <a href=\"https://x.com/HeerJeet/status/1859339097430491310\">1974 letter</a> from the writer Guy Davenport to the critic Hugh Kenner complains: \u201cCormac McCarthy has just run off to Mexico with a teenage popsy,\u201d thus abandoning work editing one of Davenport\u2019s manuscripts. If true, this would mean either that Britt met McCarthy some years earlier than the Vanity Fair piece claims \u2013 in 1974, she would have been 14 \u2013 or that McCarthy had previously taken another girl to Mexico.</p> <p>The Vanity Fair article seeking to romanticize McCarthy\u2019s actions comes at a moment when the legacy of the #MeToo movement \u2013 and, indeed, of women in US public life generally \u2013 is coming in for heated contestation.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House comes on the heels of more than two dozen sexual assault allegations against him, one civil finding of responsibility for sexual abuse of an adult, and the overturning of the abortion right in Dobbs, leading to several known deaths and a national degradation of women\u2019s dignity and status. That is to say nothing of the allegations against Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/matt-gaetz-attorney-general-nomination\">cabinet</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/pete-hegseth-sexual-assault-allegations\">picks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/20/elon-musk-denies-he-sexually-harassed-attendant-on-private-jet-in-2016\">closest adviser</a>, or of the gender attitudes of his <a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/jd-vance-views-women\">vice-president</a>. It could be that Barney and Vanity Fair are depicting this relationship in what they see as the politics of our time, and ushering in a return of a previous era when men\u2019s abuse of teenage girls was seen as their prerogative, and objecting to it was dismissed as prudish or overwrought.</p> <p>But it is also true that Britt herself, though she appears deeply ambivalent about McCarthy and at several points expresses discomfort or anger at him, has not chosen to characterize their encounter as abusive. \u201cShe never felt there was anything inappropriate about their relationship,\u201d Barney writes. For her part, Britt is forthright: \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have an obligation to be kind to women like Britt ... But we are under no obligation to pretend that we do not see things that we do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those of us feminists who are committed to clarifying the wrong of sexual violence and working to end it, women like Britt, who view as romantic what we view as abusive, reflect a genuine ethical conundrum. What to do with such women \u2013 the ones who do not mature beyond the infatuated credulity of youth, the ones who continue, long after their girlhood is over, to mistake grooming for concern, or to find the fact that they were selected for abuse flattering? Sometimes, these women frustrate me \u2013 their foolish sense of being exceptional, their stubborn false consciousness. Mostly, though, they just make me very sad.</p> <p>It is impolite, and not a little bit arrogant, for feminists to tell such women that we know more about their lives than they do. But perhaps such arrogance is what is called for, especially amid the backdrop of a media world that is loudly announcing its intention to launder abuse. We have an obligation to be kind to women like Britt, to extend them our empathy and respect. But we are under no obligation to pretend that we do not see things that we do.</p> <p>To me, what McCarthy did to Britt is unambiguous: deeply immoral and a partaking of an unjust gendered hierarchy for personal gratification. For Britt, things are more complicated; she still relishes, with an adolescent eagerness, what she remembers of his early attention. Maybe this is not just the vestige of girlish foolishness. Maybe it is the story that she told herself to survive. Every teenage girl learns the hard way to navigate grown men\u2019s attention. Some \u2013 the least fortunate ones \u2013 also learn that this attention can be the surest route to a hot meal, a dry place to stay, and some degree of protection against other, worse violences that await them in the outside world.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I needed then, so badly, was security and safety and trust,\u201d Britt said. \u201cCormac was my life, my pattern.\u201d That day at the poolside, McCarthy saw Britt\u2019s suffering as his own opportunity. In desperate times, even such gruesome transactions as that can pass for love.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

His sentences are overladen with multiple metaphors, meant to evoke a scenic south-western breathlessness: he is obviously trying to mimic the masculine seriousness and rugged self-regard that are the hallmarks of McCarthy\u2019s style. \u201cBehind her, framed between the posts of Scout\u2019s stall, the Catalina Mountains loom burnt green, brushed upward with the impressionistic confidence of a child\u2019s paint stroke,\u201d he writes. \u201cBritt stands poised at the picture\u2019s edge like a foreground that has leaked out of its frame, at play between painting and outer world, portrait and subject.\u201d He is perhaps a bit high on his own supply. These belabored sentences have the effect of rendering Barney\u2019s actual account of the events in question a bit opaque: a casual reader could be forgiven for not deciphering the nature of McCarthy\u2019s abuse, which is obscured both by Barney\u2019s disturbing sentimentalization and by his unreadable prose. Among other things, the piece does not seem to have been subjected to rigorous fact-checking. A 1974 letter from the writer Guy Davenport to the critic Hugh Kenner complains: \u201cCormac McCarthy has just run off to Mexico with a teenage popsy,\u201d thus abandoning work editing one of Davenport\u2019s manuscripts. If true, this would mean either that Britt met McCarthy some years earlier than the Vanity Fair piece claims \u2013 in 1974, she would have been 14 \u2013 or that McCarthy had previously taken another girl to Mexico. The Vanity Fair article seeking to romanticize McCarthy\u2019s actions comes at a moment when the legacy of the #MeToo movement \u2013 and, indeed, of women in US public life generally \u2013 is coming in for heated contestation. Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House comes on the heels of more than two dozen sexual assault allegations against him, one civil finding of responsibility for sexual abuse of an adult, and the overturning of the abortion right in Dobbs, leading to several known deaths and a national degradation of women\u2019s dignity and status. That is to say nothing of the allegations against Trump\u2019s cabinet picks and closest adviser, or of the gender attitudes of his vice-president. It could be that Barney and Vanity Fair are depicting this relationship in what they see as the politics of our time, and ushering in a return of a previous era when men\u2019s abuse of teenage girls was seen as their prerogative, and objecting to it was dismissed as prudish or overwrought. But it is also true that Britt herself, though she appears deeply ambivalent about McCarthy and at several points expresses discomfort or anger at him, has not chosen to characterize their encounter as abusive. \u201cShe never felt there was anything inappropriate about their relationship,\u201d Barney writes. For her part, Britt is forthright: \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d For those of us feminists who are committed to clarifying the wrong of sexual violence and working to end it, women like Britt, who view as romantic what we view as abusive, reflect a genuine ethical conundrum. What to do with such women \u2013 the ones who do not mature beyond the infatuated credulity of youth, the ones who continue, long after their girlhood is over, to mistake grooming for concern, or to find the fact that they were selected for abuse flattering? Sometimes, these women frustrate me \u2013 their foolish sense of being exceptional, their stubborn false consciousness. Mostly, though, they just make me very sad. It is impolite, and not a little bit arrogant, for feminists to tell such women that we know more about their lives than they do. But perhaps such arrogance is what is called for, especially amid the backdrop of a media world that is loudly announcing its intention to launder abuse. We have an obligation to be kind to women like Britt, to extend them our empathy and respect. But we are under no obligation to pretend that we do not see things that we do. To me, what McCarthy did to Britt is unambiguous: deeply immoral and a partaking of an unjust gendered hierarchy for personal gratification. For Britt, things are more complicated; she still relishes, with an adolescent eagerness, what she remembers of his early attention. Maybe this is not just the vestige of girlish foolishness. Maybe it is the story that she told herself to survive. Every teenage girl learns the hard way to navigate grown men\u2019s attention. Some \u2013 the least fortunate ones \u2013 also learn that this attention can be the surest route to a hot meal, a dry place to stay, and some degree of protection against other, worse violences that await them in the outside world. \u201cWhat I needed then, so badly, was security and safety and trust,\u201d Britt said. \u201cCormac was my life, my pattern.\u201d That day at the poolside, McCarthy saw Britt\u2019s suffering as his own opportunity. In desperate times, even such gruesome transactions as that can pass for love. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

No one could have fought harder for life than she did. \u201cThere is a gaping Liz-shaped hole in our lives that I am not sure how we will ever fill. We have so much gratitude to every single one of you, whether you offered to help, or liked or shared posts \u2013 you ensured Liz\u2019s last two months were her very best. She flew high until the end.\u201d The experiences ticked off on her bucket list included working on a fashion shoot, which she was helped to do by Rankin. The Observer commissioned Hatton to photograph an exhibition launch at Somerset House in June and published her pictures of Tilda Swinton and Erin O\u2019Connor. She also worked alongside press photographers at the premiere of Venom: The Last Dance and shot a portrait of the comedian Michael McIntyre. Hatton was taking photographs on the red carpet of the Royal Variety Performance on Friday. Robayna asked people to share her daughter\u2019s photographs on social media and to help fundraise for research into desmoplastic small round cell tumours. She said: \u201cIn 2024 a 15% five-year survival rate is simply not enough. Together we can change that.\u201d A spokesperson for the charity Sarcoma UK said that Hatton\u2019s death \u201cis a stark reminder of the urgent need for continued research and better treatments for sarcoma \u2013 a rare and aggressive form of cancer that affects too many young lives. Our thoughts are with Liz\u2019s family, friends, and all those who knew and loved her during this immensely difficult time. \u201cWe honour Liz\u2019s memory and her contribution to raising awareness about sarcoma, hoping that her legacy will inspire continued support for research and understanding of this devastating disease.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused at least 111 women and girls over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim said to have been just 13 years old. The scale of the criminality would make Fayed, who died last year at the age of 94, one of Britain\u2019s most notorious sex offenders, and raises urgent questions about how he got away with his crimes. Five unnamed individuals suspected of facilitating Fayed, the former owner of the luxury Knightsbridge store Harrods, are being investigated as potential \u201cfacilitators\u201d, Scotland Yard said. A huge review is also being undertaken into whether opportunities were missed in past police investigations and whether there are grounds to pursue past or current officers over historical corruption claims. Last month, the Guardian reported claims that corrupt police officers had helped Fayed in persecuting members of his staff, including a young woman who allegedly rebuffed the Harrods owner\u2019s sexual advances. The 111 alleged cases of abuse involving Fayed include 21 alleged victims who reported crimes to the police between 2005 and his death, and 90 women who have come forward since the BBC aired a documentary on Fayed in September. The Guardian understands that as soon as next week the Met will find out if it faces an independent investigation into whether it bungled the claims of sexual violence against the Harrods boss. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, is considering whether its own investigators should investigate Britain\u2019s biggest force. A Met spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing complaints from two women about the quality of investigations conducted in 2008, the Met has voluntarily referred these cases to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. \u201cWhile these cases date back over a decade and we cannot change what happened in the past, we are committed to understanding, being open about any shortcomings and improving our response to survivors moving forward.\u201d Cmdr Stephen Clayman, of the Met\u2019s Specialist Crime Command, said he recognised that trust in the police may have been eroded by its past conduct but called for any other survivors to come forward.

Your voice matters, and we are here to listen and to help.\u201d The crimes of which Fayed is accused span between 1977 and 2014. The Met said they had already reviewed more than 50,000 pages of evidence, including victim and impact statements, and retrieved \u201csignificant amounts of material from these investigations\u201d stored in their archives. As part of the inquiry, detectives from the Directorate of Professional Standards are seeking to establish if any serving or former officers at the Met were involved in any misconduct. Detectives have been examining a witness statement from a former security director at the Knightsbridge store, Bob Loftus, who had claimed that one ex-Met commander received luxury hampers \u201cwhenever he had been a particularly great help to Harrods\u201d. Loftus had further claimed that a detective constable, who was accused of regularly taking cash bribes to carry out Fayed\u2019s wishes, was secretly given a mobile phone from Harrods to facilitate his illicit work. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what they will do for just a few readies,\u201d John Macnamara, Fayed\u2019s longtime security chief and an ex-detective, was said to have remarked about the police.

The world may feel a little grim at the moment, but there are small green shoots, even as we stare into the depths of winter \u2013 dark, leafy things always taste better after the first frost, for example. I bought a gorgeous January king cabbage in Edinburgh, last weekend, which would have been delicious in Thomasina Miers\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/14/thomasina-miers-charred-cabbage-artichokes-chestnuts-vegan-recipe\">charred cabbage</a> with jerusalem artichokes and chestnuts or Anna Jones\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/16/crispy-butterbeans-kale-parmesan-lemon-beetroot-orange-orzo-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook\">crispy butter beans</a> with kale, parmesan and lemon (though we paired it with roast pork, swede and leeks).

Sex educators share their tips on how to communicate well with kids about bodies, relationships and consent.</p> <h2>Start young in an age-appropriate way</h2> <p>\u201cYou always want to be ahead of the stage that your child is at, rather than reacting to what is happening to them,\u201d<strong> </strong>says Milly Evans, a sex educator from Margate and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/honest-everything-they-dont-tell-you-about-sex-relationships-and-bodies-9781471411168/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Honest: Everything They Don\u2019t Tell You About Sex, Relationships and Bodies</a>.<strong> </strong>She recalls girls starting their periods at her primary school before anyone had talked about it: \u201cIt was really scary for them.\u201d</p> <p>Dolly Padalia, CEO of the UK-wide charity <a href=\"https://schoolofsexed.org\">School of Sexuality Education</a>, agrees it is never too early to begin conversations about bodily autonomy and consent. With young children, for instance: \u201cYou can say, \u2018You look really sad; is it OK if I give you a hug?\u2019 Or if they don\u2019t want to hug relatives, they absolutely don\u2019t have to, and they\u2019re not going to be forced to.\u201d She refers to the <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/support-for-parents/pants-underwear-rule/\">NSPCC\u2019s \u201cpants rules</a>\u201d: \u201cIt is OK for a young person to understand their own body, but their body belongs to them, particularly what is in their pants.\u201d</p> <h2>Be approachable</h2> <p>\u201cThe most powerful thing we can do is create a safe space where young people know that they can always come to us if they\u2019ve got any questions or if they feel uncomfortable,\u201d says Padalia. \u201cWhen we were growing up, we were told that you have this one conversation about the birds and the bees, and then that is it. But, actually, it is really important that we are having regular conversations about sex and relationships.\u201d</p> <h2>Reflect on your own sex education</h2> <p>\u201cA lot of parents probably didn\u2019t get a very robust sex education themselves, at home or in school,\u201d says Dan Simpson, a sex educator from Brighton who delivers workshops in schools with the organisation <a href=\"https://splitbanana.co.uk\">Split Banana</a>. He recommends some self-reflection when preparing to talk to kids about sex. \u201cWhat has your education been? And actually, a bit deeper than that: where do you individually feel a bit uncomfortable? Where do you have unexamined beliefs or ideas?\u201d Simpson has a young child and is already thinking about how he will talk to her about these issues. \u201cWhen a child brings something to you, you notice your own reaction, your own worries, your own fears.\u201d</p> <h2>Avoid being awkward</h2> <p>If we are taught from a young age that sex education is shameful, \u201cit becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d says Justin Hancock, who runs the <a href=\"https://www.bishuk.com/\">sex ed website Bish</a> and is author of the book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/can-we-talk-about-consent-9780711256545/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Can We Talk About Consent?</a> \u201cThere is nothing about the topic of sex and relationships that makes it an awkward topic. It is just that we make it awkward.\u201d</p> <h2>Choose the right moment</h2>    <p>Rather than sitting a young person down to have \u201cthe talk\u201d, which can feel incredibly awkward, sex educators say it is better to broach big subjects while doing something else. \u201cA lot of the time, the useful conversations about sex and relationships happen in cars, when you\u2019re not looking at each other, or washing the pots. If you\u2019re not necessarily looking at each other, you can keep it quite casual,\u201d says Hancock. Aim for a little-and-often approach, he says. \u201cSee it not just as a talk, but as an opportunity to listen.\u201d</p> <h2>Think about language</h2> <p>All the sex educators recommend avoiding euphemisms or slang for body parts. \u201cUse correct terms for anatomy, rather than shrouding bodies and genitalia in shame and stigma,\u201d says Padalia. \u201cObviously, families have different words, especially with young children,\u201d says Evans, \u201cbut tiptoeing around it, to the point where you\u2019re not really having a conversation about sex, isn\u2019t helpful. Especially as a neurodivergent person, it confused the hell out of me as a child when teachers would insinuate stuff, but I wouldn\u2019t understand what was happening. Being really clear means you\u2019re making sure that you are getting your message across.\u201d</p> <h2>Be neutral and non-judgmental</h2> <p>Evans says it\u2019s best to use neutral language when talking about your child\u2019s future partner. \u201cDon\u2019t say, \u2018When you have a boyfriend,\u2019 but rather, \u2018your future partner\u2019.\u201d Likewise, says Padalia, try to respond in a non-judgmental way when they share their experiences with you. \u201cResponding with judgment is a very quick way of shutting down future conversations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/may/24/kids-schools-sex-relationships-today-in-focus-podcast\">What should kids be taught about sex and relationships? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I was a teenager, if people told me not to do something, I\u2019d do it immediately,\u201d says Jo Morgan, who is based in Portsmouth and runs <a href=\"https://www.engenderingchange.co.uk\">Engendering Change</a>, which delivers sex, relationships and diversity education in schools and beyond. \u201cThe world they are growing up in is different from the one we grew up in. That doesn\u2019t mean that I would legitimise sending nudes, but I would walk into that conversation knowing that a lot of young people have already done it, and help them to navigate that.\u201d</p> <p>It is an honour for a young person to confide in you about such matters, so treat this with the respect it deserves, says Simpson: \u201cI grew up in quite a homophobic, misogynistic, anti-transgender culture, and I think we are still there largely, so it can be quite hard when an unexpected conversation happens with a young person.\u201d He suggests trying to \u201cbring an openness to that young person and not steer them in any direction that we might prefer or that we think might make them happier overall, because that is our judgment. Allow them the space and freedom to explore.\u201d</p> <h2>Embrace the humour of it</h2> <p>Laughter can help, says Evans. \u201cOne of the things that people struggle with is getting the balance between being serious and being embarrassed. But there is a middle ground: silliness. A lot of this is about fun, it\u2019s about pleasure\u201d \u2013 and you can tell a young person that although they might find some things weird or squeamish right now, when they\u2019re older they may be more interested.</p> <p>\u201cSex is funny,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cTalking about sex is funny and fun. I bring that to my classroom and conversations with my own children. If we can overcome that awkwardness and taboo, I think what we give them is sexual literacy, and what that means is they are going to be so much more able to access what they need in terms of sex, whether it\u2019s going to the shop and buying condoms or going to a sexual health clinic and getting a test for a sexually transmitted infection, or, when they\u2019re with a partner, negotiating consent. If we can model sexual literacy and help them to acquire that skill, that is a huge part of a happy and healthy life.\u201d</p> <h2>Spell out the meaning of consent</h2> <p>\u201cPeople assume their kids will grow up to have good morals because they feel they have good morals, and so their kids wouldn\u2019t ever sexually assault someone,\u201d says Evans. \u201cBut we have to teach the very fundamentals of things like consent and communication, because we can\u2019t just assume that a young person will learn that through osmosis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do consensual things in all aspects of our daily lives,\u201d says Hancock. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever shared a meal or watched a TV show with someone, then all of those are very complex consent negotiations, because consent is about having the freedom to choose to agree.\u201d In his workshops, Hancock gets young people to discuss all the things that they do that they know to be consensual and what is happening for each person in that interaction, so that they can \u201capply some of the learning from these other aspects of life to sex\u201d.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t rely on school to teach everything</h2> <p>In England, relationships and sex education became <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06103/\">statutory in 2020</a>. At primary school this includes healthy relationships in the lower years, then puberty and reproduction as part of science as they get older. Secondary schools are required to cover everything from fertility and STIs to coercion and consent. This means, explains Morgan, that \u201cevery student should be getting that statutory content. In faith schools, that can be interpreted from a faith perspective. In reality, what I see is the delivery and the quality are incredibly patchy and really inconsistent.\u201d \u201cThere are schools that are doing great work,\u201d says Evans, \u201cbut most really only cover the basics. It has got very little to do with the modern world and the realities of the relationship landscape that young people are navigating.\u201d</p> <h2>Teach them to think critically about pornography</h2> <p>One thing that probably isn\u2019t happening enough at school is equipping young people with the skills to think critically about what they see online, says Evans. \u201cMore than any other generation, young people have access to loads of sex education online, but a lot of it is terrible. Giving them the skills to determine what is true, what is medically accurate, and what is unhelpful is probably one of the best things you can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe know from the <a href=\"https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/resource/a-lot-of-it-is-actually-just-abuse-young-people-and-pornography/\">Children\u2019s Commissioner report</a> last year that 10% of nine-year-olds have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/13/adults-are-terrified-of-talking-to-us-about-it-10-things-i-learned-from-children-about-pornography\">seen online porn</a>,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThe average age of access is 13.\u201d Delaying conversations around porn means \u201cwe leave children at risk of having their first education about sex from porn, and that is potentially confusing and damaging,\u201d Morgan continues. \u201cI would rather have a difficult conversation with a child, which empowers them and enables them to deal with that, than not. I think people worry that if we have that conversation, they are then going to run into the next room and access porn, because we\u2019ve planted the seed. But actually, if you look at all of the evidence about sex education, it doesn\u2019t lead to sexual behaviours. What it means is they tend to do it later and when they do, their behaviour is less risky.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cMany young people will be looking at porn if they have access to a phone or laptop,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIt is OK for parents to worry, as viewing porn can be addictive and give unrealistic expectations of sex.\u201d But it can be reframed as showing that young people are interested in sex and how bodies work, so \u201ccoming from a place of punishment or shame doesn\u2019t tend to work\u201d. Instead, use it as an opportunity to \u201cspeak about sex and relationships more broadly, but also contextualise most porn as unrealistic in many ways: created by performers, often focused on a male perspective, sometimes violent, and with no conversations about consent or meaning.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t judge them for the things they see</h2> <p>\u201cA really useful thing to say is, \u2018If you go on the internet and see anything that bothers you, just let me know\u2019,\u201d says Hancock. Some <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/yes-your-child-will-be-exposed-to-online-porn-but-dont-panic-heres-what-to-do-instead-149900\">research</a> has shown that when prepubescent children stumble across explicit material online, they are more worried about their parents being angry with them for seeing it than about seeing the material itself.</p> <h2>Be supportive, not forceful about contraception</h2> <p>Evans remembers her parents showing her how to use a condom, but conversations about contraception are not always straightforward. \u201cYoung people might be worried about not feeling like they can book a doctors\u2019 appointment without their parents coming along, even though they can, and worrying that their parents are going to have to give permission for them to go on the pill,\u201d she says. \u201cMake it clear that whatever options they choose to go with, what is important to you is that they are safe and that they are making the right choice for their body.\u201d </p> <h2>Talk about periods, too</h2> <p>Teach all children about all bodies, not just their own. \u201cNone of us would be here if it wasn\u2019t for the menstrual cycle,\u201d says Padalia, \u201cso it is really important that everyone learns about it, not only from a biological and healthcare lens, but also with empathy and understanding.\u201d</p> <h2>Leave useful resources lying around</h2> <p>\u201cMy mum used to leave books on the stairs for me to read,\u201d says Evans. Things have moved on a bit since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/09/judy-blume-f\">Judy Blume</a>. Evans recommends <a href=\"https://www.gaystheword.co.uk/product-page/here-and-queer-a-queer-girl-s-guide-to-life-by-rowan-ellis\">Here and Queer \u2013 a Queer Girl\u2019s Guide to Life by Rowan Ellis</a>, and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/officially-losing-it-9780702333569/\">Officially Losing it by Rebecca Anderson</a>, along with <a href=\"https://suziruffell.com/podcasts/\">Suzi Ruffell\u2019s podcast</a>. Morgan suggests the <a href=\"https://www.sexeducationforum.org.uk\">Sex Education Forum</a> website, and Hancock suggests <a href=\"https://www.scarleteen.com\">Scarleteen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.corysilverberg.com\">Cory Silverberg\u2019s books</a>. Simpson says it is worth watching the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/11/sex-education-review-netflix-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson\">Sex Education</a> with teenagers to use it as a jumping-off point.</p> <h2>Admit that you are still learning, too</h2> <p>Don\u2019t be embarrassed if you don\u2019t know the answer to something, says Evans, recalling having to do this herself during a talk to 150 girls. \u201cFor a young person to see that an adult doesn\u2019t know something, and they can go and find the information, can be very empowering,\u201d says Padalia. \u201cIt is a two-way process \u2013 be prepared to learn things from them.\u201d</p>",

Be supportive, not forceful about contraception Evans remembers her parents showing her how to use a condom, but conversations about contraception are not always straightforward. \u201cYoung people might be worried about not feeling like they can book a doctors\u2019 appointment without their parents coming along, even though they can, and worrying that their parents are going to have to give permission for them to go on the pill,\u201d she says. \u201cMake it clear that whatever options they choose to go with, what is important to you is that they are safe and that they are making the right choice for their body.\u201d Talk about periods, too Teach all children about all bodies, not just their own. \u201cNone of us would be here if it wasn\u2019t for the menstrual cycle,\u201d says Padalia, \u201cso it is really important that everyone learns about it, not only from a biological and healthcare lens, but also with empathy and understanding.\u201d Leave useful resources lying around \u201cMy mum used to leave books on the stairs for me to read,\u201d says Evans. Things have moved on a bit since Judy Blume. Evans recommends Here and Queer \u2013 a Queer Girl\u2019s Guide to Life by Rowan Ellis, and Officially Losing it by Rebecca Anderson, along with Suzi Ruffell\u2019s podcast. Morgan suggests the Sex Education Forum website, and Hancock suggests Scarleteen and Cory Silverberg\u2019s books. Simpson says it is worth watching the TV show Sex Education with teenagers to use it as a jumping-off point. Admit that you are still learning, too Don\u2019t be embarrassed if you don\u2019t know the answer to something, says Evans, recalling having to do this herself during a talk to 150 girls. \u201cFor a young person to see that an adult doesn\u2019t know something, and they can go and find the information, can be very empowering,\u201d says Padalia. \u201cIt is a two-way process \u2013 be prepared to learn things from them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Roughly 36 hours after I first heard about the horrifying Maga taunt \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d, I learned that I was pregnant, despite having a contraceptive coil. My relief that I lived in the UK, not the US \u2013 where abortion is rapidly becoming illegal or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state\">inaccessible at best</a> \u2013 was profound. Yet I realised that I had no idea how to access abortion, having complacently assumed that it would always be available if I needed it. Some fraught Googling led me to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. A couple of days later, I had my first appointment and very quickly learned that it wasn\u2019t purely \u201cmy choice\u201d, even in Britain.</p> <p>Of all the words you don\u2019t want to hear by surprise, \u201ctransvaginal\u201d is up there. I thought the scan to determine how pregnant I was would be the kind where a technician slathers goop on your stomach. I wasn\u2019t told until I arrived that it would be internal, because of the assumed early gestation. A second surprise: the coil was gone, most likely sucked out by my period cup. Later that day, I had a phone consultation. The nurse told me two doctors would have to sign off on the termination and asked me to justify why my life would be negatively affected if I were forced to continue with the pregnancy. Horrified, I said I should just be able to say: I don\u2019t want to. She was extremely kind and agreed, but said this was a legal requirement under the Abortion Act.</p> <p>I told her I lived hundreds of miles from my partner. We hadn\u2019t been together very long and were united on this. I lived in a one-bedroom flat. I could barely afford my own life. My career would suffer. The presence \u2013 or so I thought \u2013 of a coil should show that I had been actively warding against pregnancy. What more did she want? I am bullish in the face of authority I disagree with, but felt furious for any less headstrong person seeking an abortion \u2013 already grappling with guilt and overwhelmed at dealing with the medical establishment \u2013 who might doubt their own needs when confronted in this way.</p> <p>Accessing abortion is like a full-time job, one that sent me to three clinics across north, south and deep west London in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible. If I had waited for a local appointment \u2013 or if a restrictive job or childcare prevented me from travelling \u2013 it would have been another two weeks of increasing nausea, exhaustion and soreness. Termination was not an emotional decision for me and my partner, but the process was beyond draining, even with friends\u2019 loving support. So was dealing with well-meaning people who projected sadness on to the situation. I asked them to talk to me as if I were having a wisdom tooth out (except you don\u2019t need two doctors to sign off on that).</p> <p>On our way to west London for the termination last Monday, I read the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/18/jacob-rees-mogg-on-abortion-religion-and-reality-tv-ive-been-called-worse-than-a-nazi\">interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>, who believes abortion is \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d even in cases of rape or incest. I vibrated with rage while we navigated a delayed Northern line in a panic. What is morally indefensible is the notion that any woman or person who can bear children should have to live with the unwitting products of such violence. If doctors must be satisfied that continued pregnancy would cause \u201cgrave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman\u201d, I defy any situation to more accurately meet those requirements.</p> <p>I had the sense, as a person going through it, that even in the UK the decision to terminate is perceived by some as frivolous, a luxury; not a frankly violating last resort that often leaves you struggling to advocate for yourself in the midst of appalling pain. The male doctor doing my procedure told me period cups were unhygienic and that it was better to use tissue. (The Lancet cites studies that say cups are <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(19)30111-2/fulltext\">less likely to cause infection</a> than tampons or pads.) \u201cSpoken like someone who has never had periods,\u201d I said, exchanging a look with the female nurse. \u201cI mean pads,\u201d he stuttered from between my legs.</p> <p>Not that I wasn\u2019t naive: I had no idea that abortion<strong> </strong>is still <a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/53621/documents/4252#:~:text=Women%20accessing%20abortion%20in%20Great,legal%20in%20certain%2C%20fixed%20circumstances.\">technically illegal in Great Britain</a> unless certain conditions are met. You might think: if abortion remains accessible, surely this is just a technicality.

Any person seeking abortion is already going through enough stress without being subject to a system that legitimises a culture of shame and suspicion.</p> <p>It must also make that fight intersectional. Two days before my abortion, I still ran a 10k that I had entered months prior, determined not to be stopped. Without really thinking about it, I started my playlist with Planningtorock\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37afaihOBj4\">Get Your Fkng Laws Off My Body</a>. It\u2019s a techno anthem about transgender rights, but I hadn\u2019t anticipated how Jam Rostron\u2019s lyrics would gut me that morning.

      "bodyText": "Perched on a hilltop and surrounded by a lush 22-hectare (54-acre) farm, the G.A.S. Farm House outside the village of Iki\u1e63\u1eb9 in southern Nigeria is not your average place for an artist residency. For Kosisochukwu Nnebe, who works at the intersection of food and art, it\u2019s the ultimate retreat. The 31-year-old Nigerian-Canadian is one of the first artists to be hosted at the Guest Artists Space Foundation\u2019s barn house near the town of Ijebu Ode in Ogun state. Although she is a late riser, each morning before she has a chance to prepare eggs on agege bread, Nnebe is out of the door, heading to a banana grove five minutes\u2019 walk away to cut banana leaves for use in a process called chlorophyll printing. The courtyard of the G.A.S. Farm House looks out on to the farm and gardens The technique involves developing images through the action of photosynthesis. Nnebe\u2019s particular interest is using the process to print archival images on banana leaves. \u201cSince 2020, I\u2019ve been exploring the use of foodways \u2013 the eating habits and culinary practices of a people, region or historical period,\u201d Nnebe says. She prints photographs of people and texts as \u201ccounter-archives\u201d to challenge official records, and as a way to \u201copen up subaltern perspectives\u201d. Nigerian-Canadian artist Kosisochukwu Nnebe, one of the first to take up residency at the farmhouse. Photograph: Kresiah Mukwazhi/Vladim Vilain The farmhouse is one of two residences in Nigeria founded by the celebrated British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare. The other is in Lagos, three hours\u2019 drive from Iki\u1e63\u1eb9. When Shonibare started the farm in 2018, one of the first things he had to do was build a 3km access road. A portion of the land is a working farm, where 11 staff cultivate crops including tomatoes, habaneros, bell peppers maize and yams as part of the regenerative practices, with the produce sold at the farm gate and in the local village. The G.A.S. Foundation was opened the following year, followed by the farmhouse residency building, which is solar-powered. Its tall windows and perforated external walls let in natural light, as part of the design by Lagos-based architects MOE+AA, led by Papa Omotayo. Inside the house there is a shared common area with a living room and kitchen, a studio with large desks and easels, and two bedrooms for visiting artists plus a third room reserved for Shonibare. \u201cBesides the whistling of the wind, the intermittent pattering of rain against the roof, the distant sound of machetes cutting through dense plant life on the farm, there is an underlying stillness and quiet that is a welcome and sharp contrast from the chaos of Lagos,\u201d Nnebe says. Images printed on to banana leaves collected by artist Kosisochukwu Nnebe, who tries to communicate the political aspect of food through her art. Photographs: Ofem Ubi Nnebe has been printing archival images on the banana leaves she harvests as a way to tell the complex stories behind the plant and its history. The banana industry, she says, has \u201chistorically had one of the most controversial production and supply systems \u2013 replete with egregious labour practices, the domination of single variants and the associated extensive use of pesticides that arises as a result\u201d. In addition to the small banana grove, the farm features fields full of cassava, another crop that Nnebe became fascinated with after she spent time in Jamaica last year and discovered that enslaved Africans in the 18th century used the plant to make a poison to give to their masters. Among the jobs she did before becoming a full-time artist in 2023, Nnebe worked as part of a team within the Canadian government that led to the development of the country\u2019s first national food policy.

Farm House in the distance The G.A.S. Foundation in Lagos, which started in 2022, hosts three artists at a time and has hosted more than 60 to date. \u201cA central ethos of the foundations is for the three artists to comingle and interact with one another in a way that enriches their experience during the residency,\u201d according to Moni Aisida, the executive director at G.A.S. The first artist in residence this year at the Iki\u1e63\u1eb9 farmhouse was Misheck Masamvu, from Zimbabwe, who stayed for almost six weeks, from August to early October. \u201cThe residency provided fragmented pockets of time, a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle between Lagos and Iki\u1e63\u1eb9,\u201d says Masamvu, who has a farm in Zimbabwe and works as an abstract painter. \u201cIt created the perfect opportunity to slow down, break down boundaries and immerse myself fully into the environment.\u201d Artist Misheck Masamvu holds an open studio for local people at the G.A.S.

It dipped just 0.7% last year to sit at 440.6m tonnes.</p> \n  <p>This change was mainly due to a drop in emissions from stationary electricity, which includes on-site burning of fossil fuels in manufacturing, mining, and commercial and residential buildings. Pollution from agriculture and electricity generation were also down slightly. Transport emissions keep climbing up.</p> \n  <p>The Greens said this showed pollution was higher under Anthony Albanese than in the final year of Scott Morrison\u2019s government, when emissions were 438.4m tonnes. The party\u2019s leader, <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Labor have disappointed the country on climate, talking up renewables while approving 28 new coal and gas projects and lifting emissions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Greens statement neglected to say that pollution in 2022 was still suppressed to some degree by Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>On the other hand, we reported earlier in this blog that <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> has argued \u201cemissions are still lower now than they were at any point during the economy-wide Covid shutdowns\u201d.</p> \n  <p>At first glance this doesn\u2019t seem correct. On further investigation it is technically true \u2013 economy-wide shutdowns were over by mid-2022, and pollution was higher in 2020 and 2021 than today. But that ignores the data from June 2022, when Covid was still affecting emissions. Pollution is a little higher than two years ago.</p> \n  <p>The Climate Change Authority\u2019s conclusion may be the one to pay attention to here. In a progress report, also out today, it said emissions had basically plateaued over the past three years, and that reductions will need to accelerate significantly for the government to meet the legislated 2030 target of a 43% cut below 2005 levels.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T08:49:14.092Z\">at 8.49am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674829338f08844156ee9383\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-basford-canales\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-28T08:26:38.914Z\">8.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some of the bills being guillotined tonight will pass through quickly with support but others could take longer.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far in the opening 45 minutes after a slight delay to the proceedings due to <strong>Simon Birmingham</strong>\u2019s surprise retirement earlier this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>An aged care bill, which will align aged care worker screening checks with NDIS ones among other regulatory changes, passed without amendments.</p> \n  <p>The other was a bill to clarify rules around government entities charging surcharges, which was passed with a minor amendment.

But the 2030 target is \u201cfar too weak\u201d as it is consistent with more than 2C of global heating, and that means \u201clonger heatwaves, more intense bushfires and worse flooding for Australians\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Reynolds says the government is also allowing further global heating by approving new and extended fossil fuel developments for export.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Approving coal and gas projects is the opposite of climate action.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-27T20:07:22.622Z\">at 8.07pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674717518f08917e9a1d7be0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-morton\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-27T19:49:36.545Z\">7.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Household power bills projected to fall over next 10 years</strong></p> \n  <p>Continuing on from the previous post, the government has also released some headline numbers from a separate report by the <strong>Australian Electricity Market Commission</strong>.</p> \n  <p>It says household power bills are projected to fall over the next 10 years.

They include a progress report by the <strong>Climate Change Authority</strong>, an annual statement by the climate change minister, <strong>Chris Bowen</strong>, projections of what will happen with emissions between now and 2030 and the quarterly greenhouse gas inventory update.</p> \n  <p>But wait, there\u2019s more.

According to what has been released, we should expect a significant boost in the share of electricity coming from renewable energy late next year.

I\u2019m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong>, bringing you the best of our overnight stories before <strong>Emily Wind</strong> gears up to helm the day\u2019s coverage.</p> \n  <p>The Albanese government is going to try pushing 36 bills through the Senate today as the session heads towards a frantic conclusion. However, a law to increase tax on super balances over $3m will most likely not be among them. We\u2019re reporting exclusively this morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/27/government-plan-to-raise-tax-on-super-balances-over-3m-all-but-abandoned\">the government has all but abandoned </a>its contentious plan to increase the tax on superannuation balances over $3m. Guardian Australia understands that the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, fears the policy, planned by the treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, could expose Labor to a repeat of the damaging franking-credits campaign that helped cost it the 2019 election.</p> \n  <p>Among the key pieces of legislation likely to be pushed through today are the government\u2019s trio of migration bills giving government extensive powers, from deporting non-citizens to allowing sniffer dogs in immigration detention centres. They have been supported by the Coalition amid strong condemnation from rights advocates and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/28/priya-nadesalingam-hits-out-at-migration-bill-saying-biloela-return-impossible-without-mobile-phone\">today we hear from </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/28/priya-nadesalingam-hits-out-at-migration-bill-saying-biloela-return-impossible-without-mobile-phone\">Priya Nadesalingam</a></strong>, the Tamil woman who won a long fight for her and her family to stay in Australia. She says the government\u2019s immigration detention bill would have made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to succeed and enable her family to return to Biloela in Queensland.</p> \n  <p>Today is known in some parts as \u201cclimate Christmas\u201d because the government is releasing a slew of reports detailing where Australia is at with its attempts to tackle the climate crisis. These include a projection on emissions between now and 2030; <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> to claim that \u201cfully electrified\u201d households will see bills fall for the next 10 years, and the state of the country\u2019s fleet of ageing coal-fired power stations.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today, thanks for reading. Here are the main stories: The Coalition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham announced his retirement from politics. The Senate agreed to Labor\u2019s guillotine motion, which included migration and social media bills. Anthony Albanese said \u201ctomorrow never comes\u201d on Coalition\u2019s nuclear costings as question time wrapped up for the year. The government has been forced to defer its electoral reform bill after the Coalition refused to pass it without last-minute amendments. The independent senator David Pocock said he secured changes to the build-to-rent legislation, amid other changes, in exchange for supporting the government\u2019s \u201cguillotine\u201d motion. The crossbench and Coalition teamed up to support a motion condemning the government for not bringing forward its long-awaited gambling advertising restrictions, calling on the government to finally unveil its plan. The independent senator Lidia Thorpe told a protest outside Parliament House that she wears suspension and censure as \u201cbadge of honour\u201d. Chris Bowen delivered the national climate change statement, saying \u201cthe critical decade is now\u201d. The government has apologised to Indigenous people in the Northern Territory for suffering caused by stolen wages. The Victorian government\u2019s Metro Tunnel may not open in 2025 as planned, after key contract deadlines were pushed back. A second man has been charged after 10 vehicles and buildings were vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs last week. The soon-to-be-sacked chairperson of Queensland\u2019s truth-telling inquiry said he was given no notice of a decision to repeal the body\u2019s legislation. The government has officially launched its National HIV Strategy, which aims to make Australia the first country in the world to eliminate HIV transmission by the end of the decade. Let\u2019s make that 20 bills! At 6.30pm, we had 31 bills ahead of us in the Senate. After more than two hours, we\u2019ve gotten through 20 on my count so far. Those include: Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2024 Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2024 Aged Care (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Tax (Imposition) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) (Consequential Provisions and Other Matters) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Responsible Buy Now Pay Later and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Capital Works (Build to Rent Misuse Tax) Bill 2024 Crimes Amendment (Strengthening the Criminal Justice Response to Sexual Violence) Bill 2024 Family Law Amendment Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Charges) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024 Universities Accord (National Student Ombudsman) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Fairer for Families and Farmers and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 Treasury Laws Amendment (Reserve Bank Reforms) Bill 2023 Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals and Other Measures) Bill 2024 But ahead of us are some more controversial bills, including the three migration bills and the under-16s social media ban. The social media ban bill will have at least an hour of debate before it goes to a vote. At 6.30pm, we had 31 bills ahead of us in the Senate. Two hours in, we\u2019ve gotten through 20 on my count so far. Those include: Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2024 Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2024 Aged Care (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Tax (Imposition) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) (Consequential Provisions and Other Matters) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Responsible Buy Now Pay Later and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Capital Works (Build to Rent Misuse Tax) Bill 2024 Crimes Amendment (Strengthening the Criminal Justice Response to Sexual Violence) Bill 2024 Family Law Amendment Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Charges) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024 Universities Accord (National Student Ombudsman) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Fairer for Families and Farmers and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 But ahead of us are some more controversial bills, including the three migration bills and the under-16s social media ban. The social media ban bill will have at least an hour of debate before it goes to a vote. Aaaaand we\u2019re another one down, and it\u2019s a big one. Labor\u2019s Future Made in Australia bill was actually five bills and they all just passed with some amendments. As mentioned, the bills enable a $23bn package over the decade aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and onshore production of green hydrogen and processed critical minerals. Read more below: The current state of play Here is the lay of the land as the Senate continues to sit on a marathon final night of the year: It might be the last night in Canberra (excluding the House of Representatives returning in the morning to rubber stamp some of the Senate\u2019s amendments) but it\u2019s certainly not a quiet one. Just a moment ago, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, gave a pre-recorded interview on ABC\u2019s 7.30. Albanese said he \u201cfully expects\u201d parliament will return in February amid speculation an early federal election will be called. He\u2019s pressed on it and responds: That\u2019s certainly our plan \u2026 I don\u2019t give election dates or variations to the question. Albanese was also asked about the role he played in negotiations over the Nature Positive reforms. Guardian Australia reported Albanese killed off a potential deal with the Greens to pass the government\u2019s \u201cnature positive\u201d legislation after an intervention by the Western Australia premier, Roger Cook. He said: We\u2019re prepared to listen to arguments, but where it wasn\u2019t consistent with our view of the purpose of legislation, then we wouldn\u2019t just agree to any amendments. When asked directly whether he killed off negotiations with the Greens, Albanese said: I spoke to the premier of WA about my visit to WA next week \u2026 well, I don\u2019t give all the details of my private discussions with premiers \u2026 I informed him that we didn\u2019t have the numbers to get the bill through. We didn\u2019t have the numbers for a range of bills. Housing, family law and Future Made in Australia bills up for vote More bills have sailed through in the Senate and I\u2019m feeling hopeful we won\u2019t be watching until midnight at this stage (perhaps, prematurely). Tax regulations for buy now, pay later services and Labor\u2019s Build to Rent bills both passed. The key housing bill was held up for some time with the Coalition staunchly against it and the Greens attempting to negotiate for more. A family law amendment and laws to change how victims of sexual abuse are dealt with in the criminal system also passed. Now, Labor\u2019s Future Made in Australia bill is up and there\u2019s a lot of amendments. It\u2019s a $23bn package with the lion\u2019s share of it being a bundle of tax incentives for green hydrogen and processed critical minerals. The opposition opposes it. Earlier today, the Greens had a win to ensure that no support will be provided to coal, oil and gas under the program and the commercial investments and programs of Export Finance Australia. Sit tight. More tributes for outgoing Birmingham As we head into a long night in the Senate to vote on 31 bills, let\u2019s quickly revisit some of the comments made about the retiring Senate opposition leader, Simon Birmingham. Birmingham is the most senior Liberal of the moderate wing \u2013 a faction in the Liberals that is outnumbered by the centre-right and conservatives. It\u2019s a point that was highlighted by the Nationals Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, who admitted she was from \u201cthe opposite end of the spectrum\u201d to Birmingham. She said: We have, as he referenced in his opening remarks, been often at the two sides of the internal debates that have consumed the Coalition in our time in politics \u2026 [but] I have always found you\u2019ve been a man of great honour and principle. \u2018A long night ahead of us,\u2019 Senate president cautions This evening\u2019s first bill in the Senate, the anti-money laundering bill, took some time to pass. It ultimately passed after getting through some amendments but the Senate president, Sue Lines, issued a reminder of the night we have ahead as senators voted on whether to pass the bill. It was off-screen but it appeared Senator David Pocock got his positions mixed up. Lines said: Senator Pocock, you can\u2019t be voting from up there \u2026 I\u2019ll put it again. Senators, we have a long night ahead of us. I would ask that you pay attention. You need more than one voice to have a division. Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions dipped 0.7% to 440.6m tonnes, report says Among the raft of climate reports released by the government today was the latest quarterly greenhouse gas emissions report. It said in the year to June climate pollution was 28.2% lower than in 2005. It dipped just 0.7% last year to sit at 440.6m tonnes. This change was mainly due to a drop in emissions from stationary electricity, which includes on-site burning of fossil fuels in manufacturing, mining, and commercial and residential buildings. Pollution from agriculture and electricity generation were also down slightly. Transport emissions keep climbing up. The Greens said this showed pollution was higher under Anthony Albanese than in the final year of Scott Morrison\u2019s government, when emissions were 438.4m tonnes. The party\u2019s leader, Adam Bandt, said: Labor have disappointed the country on climate, talking up renewables while approving 28 new coal and gas projects and lifting emissions. The Greens statement neglected to say that pollution in 2022 was still suppressed to some degree by Covid-19. On the other hand, we reported earlier in this blog that Chris Bowen has argued \u201cemissions are still lower now than they were at any point during the economy-wide Covid shutdowns\u201d. At first glance this doesn\u2019t seem correct. On further investigation it is technically true \u2013 economy-wide shutdowns were over by mid-2022, and pollution was higher in 2020 and 2021 than today. But that ignores the data from June 2022, when Covid was still affecting emissions. Pollution is a little higher than two years ago. The Climate Change Authority\u2019s conclusion may be the one to pay attention to here. In a progress report, also out today, it said emissions had basically plateaued over the past three years, and that reductions will need to accelerate significantly for the government to meet the legislated 2030 target of a 43% cut below 2005 levels. Some of the bills being guillotined tonight will pass through quickly with support but others could take longer. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far in the opening 45 minutes after a slight delay to the proceedings due to Simon Birmingham\u2019s surprise retirement earlier this afternoon. An aged care bill, which will align aged care worker screening checks with NDIS ones among other regulatory changes, passed without amendments. The other was a bill to clarify rules around government entities charging surcharges, which was passed with a minor amendment. It will clarify government entities can impose surcharges where they have authority to collect a payment, noting there are usually options available without a surcharge. It\u2019s part of the Albanese government\u2019s plans to ban debit card surcharges from 1 January 2026, subject to consultation being undertaken by the Reserve Bank. And there we have it \u2013 the first bill of many the Senate is voting tonight has passed with amendments. The anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing amendment bill 2024 was passed with 32 ayes and 28 noes. We then move on to a bill that will change rules about Sydney airport\u2019s slot management. It also passes after amendments by Jacqui Lambie are knocked back. It will give the minister more powers over slot management \u2013 how many take-offs and landings can happen an hour \u2013 as well as introduce new penalties to stop potential for slot hoarding and slot misuse. O\u2019Brien uses climate statement reply to attack Labor\u2019s renewable energy policies The shadow climate change and environment minister, Ted O\u2019Brien, gave a reply to Chris Bowen\u2019s annual climate statement a little earlier. O\u2019Brien launched a lengthy attack on the Albanese government\u2019s renewable energy policies, and defended the Coalition\u2019s uncosted proposal to eventually build nuclear power plants at seven sites as \u201cthe most visionary policy put forward by an Australian political party this century\u201d. He said: Much of the debate on climate change and energy in Australia centres around the target of reaching net zero by 2050. To meet that challenge, the first question we must ask ourselves is not about net zero, nor even about emissions. Rather, the first question to ask ourselves is, what sort of Australia we want to be in 2050, and beyond? O\u2019Brien blamed increases in electricity prices on the government\u2019s renewable energy policies, saying people were \u201cpaying up to $1,000 more than what Labor had promised\u201d \u2013 a $275 annual reduction by 2025. It\u2019s worth remembering what experts have said on this. Take Tony Wood, from the Grattan Institute, who told Guardian Australia that it was \u201cjust not true\u201d to say that electricity was expensive due to Labor\u2019s policies. He said bills leapt 20% last year due to Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine pushing up fossil fuel prices, a lack of available gas, outages at coal plants and extreme weather flooding coalmines. O\u2019Brien challenged the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, to multiple debates before the next election \u2013 both in the regions and on the ABC and Sky News. It has been a hectic day in Canberra today, but we are not quite done. With that in mind, we are going to let the blog settle for a bit, before the Senate returns later tonight to pass the final bills of the year. We will keep you posted as things change, so stay tuned. Two-year-old boy killed in crash at Queensland school In a quick step away from politics, a two-year-old boy has been struck and killed in a single-vehicle crash at a school in Durack, south-west of Brisbane\u2019s CBD. \u201cUnfortunately, despite best efforts, the boy has died at the scene,\u201d Queensland police said in a statement on Thursday evening. An investigation has commenced, and a woman is assisting with police inquiries, the statement said. Victorian government says it is not providing any further financial support to Elbit project A government spokesperson has made the following statement regarding the end of the Elbit Systems deal: As Australia\u2019s advanced manufacturing capital, we are always exploring economic and trade opportunities for our state \u2013 especially those that create local jobs. They said in 2020 the government entered an agreement with Elbit Systems of Australia (ELSA) to establish its Centre of Excellence for Human and Machine Teaming in Melbourne. The project was completed in January 2024 and the government is not providing any further financial support for the project. The government has not made public how much it spent on the funding agreement, citing it is commercial in confidence. The Victorian government\u2019s Metro Tunnel may not open in 2025 as planned, after key contract deadlines were pushed back. A contract variation tabled in Victorian parliament on Thursday pushes back the provisional handover of infrastructure to operators to 30 April. Final acceptance of the tunnels and stations has also been delayed from 17 March to as late as New Year\u2019s Eve 2025. It comes after an auditor general\u2019s report tabled in state parliament in June said it was running over budget and would not be completed until June 2025. The government, however, has described the targets as incentives for the project\u2019s builders and denied Metro Tunnel was delayed. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe said the Metro Tunnel would open in 2025 a year ahead of schedule \u2013 and we remain on track to do that.\u201d In September, the government added an $837m spend to the project, which now totals $13.48bn, well above the $11bn estimated in 2017. Here\u2019s an explainer I wrote at the time: Greens welcome Victorian government ending agreement with Elbit The Greens MP Gabrielle de Vietri has welcomed the news the Victorian government has ended its agreement with weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems: Relentless community pressure has forced Victorian Labor to end its partnership with Elbit. She questioned why the government hadn\u2019t announced the Elbit decision since writing to the Labor MP Bronwyn Halfpenny last week: This is an important step in the right direction, but why are Labor still leaving Victorians in the dark, they clearly have something to hide. Bowen concludes with a swipe at some in the media and an argument for staying the course. I\u2019m happy to admit I believe there is cause for quiet optimism. We hear a lot from some in the media about how hard this transformation is. So hard, in fact, they say we should give up. They don\u2019t back a Future Made in Australia. They \u2013 including some in this parliament \u2013 advocate for failure because failure keeps Australia stuck in the past. It is increasingly obvious that to hope for failure is a ruse to protect the status quo. We want more for Australia, and we are putting everything in place to make it happen. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t challenges. I am acutely aware of them. But the numbers show our plan is working. He says the country is \u201cstarting to see a shift in what our trading partners want to buy\u201d away from fossil fuels exports (which the Australia government is still approving) and towards clean energy. As the Climate Change Authority recognises, it is a global contest to dominate green technologies, to access green resources, including critical minerals. This is a race we want to win, because we are seeing the benefit of building capabilities at home in new industries, not just because it\u2019s good for the climate, but because it\u2019s also good for our national interest, good for our security, good for our economic and international interests and, most of all, good for Australians. Bowen is now running through the government\u2019s achievements. He says they include reforming the safeguard mechanism to limit pollution from major industrial sites. Critics say the policy is not enough to drive change, and we have not yet seen official data from the Clean Energy Regulator on how it is going. Bowen says the Climate Change Authority found it is \u201cperforming even better than expected\u201d, having reduced emissions in its first year. He says the government \u201cdid what others have tried and failed to do for 20 years \u2013 we legislated Australia\u2019s first new vehicle efficiency standard\u201d, and this will cut emissions and create an incentive for the market to offer drivers more choice of electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Wherever I travel across the country, I hear people talking about their plans to buy a new EV or hybrid as their next car. It\u2019s so important they have better choices. Communities and households have a big role to play in reaching net zero, and they are taking action in record numbers, which is why it\u2019s particularly good news for households with solar and EVs that Standards Australia has now enabled vehicle-to-grid charging, or reverse charging, in Australia for the first time. This effectively transforms a car into a household battery on wheels. Bowen says the shift to renewable energy is \u201cas much about creating jobs in the regions as it is about taking climate action or securing Australia\u2019s place in an uncertain world\u201d. Governments around the world change from time to time. There will be heightened global tensions, there will be geopolitical repositioning. We must stay the course through the uncertainty of complex economic and security challenges because we have a window of time to act decisively. We must continue to act in our national interest, charting an Australian path in this global journey. This much is clear from the scientists. It\u2019s clear from the energy and industry experts. We listen to these experts. They tell us this decade will be critical for our energy grid, critical for the climate, and critical if we want to position Australia as a powerhouse in the new global net zero economy. The course of this decade will be shaped by the choice the Australian people make in the next six months. It is worth noting that, while scientists agree Labor\u2019s climate policies are superior to the Coalition\u2019s, they also say the minimum 2030 target of 43% is not enough for the country to play its part in addressing the issue. Much will turn on the 2035 target to be announced next year, and the policies introduced to meet it. It is worth also noting the Coalition has opposed all Labor policies to cut emissions and says it would ditch the 43% target and not announce a 2030 or 2035 target before the election. Bowen\u2019s climate address has moved on to criticising the Coalition\u2019s nuclear energy plan. The notion that nuclear energy in Australia is a serious solution to decarbonise by 2050 is a dangerous furphy. It does not survive contact with reality. Pausing policies that are currently lowering emissions in favour of ramping up policies that would increase emissions will not deliver net zero. Nuclear power generation commencing in the 2040s, less than a decade before we are due to meet the target, is not a solution or an antidote to the increase in emissions from extending fossil fuels in the interim. If it were to be, it would need to be rolled out on such a scale as to replace almost all the other emitting technologies. That would mean hundreds of nuclear reactors built across the country to keep the lights on, connected by thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines. Instead, the current scheme proposed by those in opposition is for just seven plants, with just one to supply all of Western Australia. He says the nuclear policy \u201cwould see a return to the delay, denial and dysfunction that has already cost Australians\u201d. More from Chris Bowen\u2019s climate statement, but focused on energy prices: It\u2019s particularly pleasing to see data from the Australian Energy Market Commission today that confirms more renewables in our grid will continue pushing energy bills down over the next 10 years. It also confirms that any delay to renewables would in fact increase costs. Famously, Labor said before the last election that annual household power bills were expected to fall $275 by 2025 under its policies. Instead, they went up \u2013 mostly, experts say, due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine lifting the cost of fossil fuels. Bowen says prices are now coming down. The latest inflation data shows \u201ca record fall in electricity prices, down more than 35% from October last year\u201d. He says 2024 has set \u201can all-time record for renewables\u201d, with data released by the Clean Energy Regulator today finding up to 7.5GW of renewable capacity will be connected to the grid this year. Just under half of that will come from rooftop solar, a sign that households and businesses are getting real value from the economic benefits that come when you harness free sunshine. On renewable energy, Bowen emphasises 2024 has been a record year and that the \u201cpace is picking up\u201d. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been consistently clear that the government\u2019s solution for a rapid increase in investment to deliver new reliable renewable generation capacity, plus storage and firming and transmission lines, will meet Australia\u2019s growing electricity needs as our current coal fleet retires. Between now and 2035, the market operator expects 90% of Australia\u2019s ageing, increasingly unreliable, coal-fired power generators to retire. Just this week we\u2019ve seen Aemo having to juggle the grid to prepare for forecast higher demand while more than 2.5 gigawatts of ageing coal units are offline \u2013 broken down or taken out for maintenance. The notion that Australia\u2019s ageing coal fleet should, or in fact even could, be relied on to an even greater extent to power our system, is nothing short of magical thinking. Already consumers are feeling the impacts of running old coal generators longer. There has not been a single day in the past 18 months without some coal-fired generation experiencing unplanned outages. As we reported earlier in the week, Bowen says the latest departmental emissions projections suggest current policies should be enough to have Australia on track to meet the legislated 2030 emissions target (a 43% cut below 2005 levels). He says a progress report by the Climate Change Authority released today also says the country has the policies in place to get to its goal. The authority also finds that while emissions are falling, they are not yet falling fast enough. It\u2019s worth checking out this story from before the authority report, which gives some context on what we know so far about how the country is achieving emissions reductions. Bowen says: We\u2019re bringing emissions down in the electricity and land sectors and that means emissions have fallen to 28.2% below 2005 levels. Emissions are still lower now than they were at any point during the economy-wide Covid shutdowns, when heavy industry and transport was in hiatus. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and industry, when measured on a per capita basis, are the lowest they\u2019ve been in Australia since the late 1980s. But they need to fall faster into the future. Parliament is nearly over for the year, but not yet. Chris Bowen is belatedly on his feet in the House of Representatives giving the government\u2019s annual national climate change statement. It was scheduled before question time but was delayed. The climate change and energy minister begins by referring to the pressure on the power grid in parts of the country during the heat this week, saying it is \u201ca reminder of why decarbonising matters\u201d. Not just the unseasonably hot weather, but the increasing unreliability of coal. Renewables address both. Solar, wind and other renewable energy resources are available right now to help tackle the worst of climate change. Crucially they make our energy system more reliable and resilient than a system dominated by ageing coal-fired power stations. He says the government\u2019s climate policies, including the capacity investment scheme underwriting program that it is using to aim to get to 82% renewable energy by 2030, has \u201cnow put in place the systems and processes to set us up for a more prosperous future\u201d. We\u2019ve built a lot of momentum. But there is so much more to do. The key is to build on this momentum, and build on it again, because there is no achievable alternative that doesn\u2019t see otherwise avoidable harm done to our environment, our planet and our future generations. Net zero by 2050 is not optional. Which means the critical decade is now. Not some hypothetical time in the distant future. Dutton hails \u2018outstanding\u2019 Birmingham The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has sung the praises of the retiring senator Simon Birmingham, calling him a \u201cthoroughly decent man\u201d. Dutton released a statement on the retirement, saying Birmingham \u201cexcelled\u201d in all the portfolios he held: Simon Birmingham has been an outstanding Senator who has served his party, his state and his country with distinction for more than 17 years. On the announcement of his retirement from the Parliament, I thank a thoroughly decent man for his commendable contributions to our nation from both the ranks of Government and Opposition. The measure of Simon Birmingham is the high regard in which he is held across the political divide. His fierce intellect and calm demeanour have seen him engage in the battle of ideas in a manner that is persuasive, principled and respectful. Simon has excelled in all the portfolios he has held as a Minister \u2013 from Education and Training, to Trade and Tourism, to Finance. Victorian government says it has ended agreement with Elbit Systems The Victorian government, which last week confirmed it would not renew its defence memorandum of understanding with Israel, has also ended its agreement with weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems. In a letter to the Thomastown MP, Bronwyn Halfpenny, who is also a co-chair of the Victorian parliament\u2019s Friends of Palestine group, the minister for jobs and industry, Natalie Hutchins, confirmed the 2020 partnership between the government and Elbit had ended. The letter, dated 22 November, reads: In 2020, the Victorian government entered an agreement with Elbit Systems\u2019 Australian subsidiary, ELSA, on a project to partner with Victorian research institutions. The project was completed earlier this year. Therefore, the Victorian government is no longer providing support to ELSA for this project. A document tabled in parliament on Thursday showed the project\u2019s \u201ccompletion date\u201d as 31 January 2024, though the \u201cend date\u201d was redacted. The government has been approached for comment. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day\u2019s news. Speaking on the guillotine motion, David Pocock said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of finger-pointing in the Senate but no one has clean hands on this\u201d. It\u2019s been pretty chaotic at times. I guess one of the frustrations in the Senate is you can debate bills [but] at some point you need to come to a position and actually vote on them. And unfortunately, sometimes that ends up [meaning] you have to guillotine bills that have actually had a Senate committee process, there\u2019s been some debate, but you\u2019ve got to force people to actually vote. Pocock explains what happened with Nature Positive negotiations Just earlier, the independent senator David Pocock spoke with the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing about the government\u2019s \u201cguillotine\u201d motion in the Senate. Overnight, he had indicated to the government that the Nature Positive legislation was a requirement for him to back the motion. But this did not happen \u2013 and Pocock backed the motion, securing other measures. He told the program that he had good-faith negotiations with the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek: She\u2019s been really keen to get this through the parliament. Unfortunately, it just wasn\u2019t possible. The thing I hear from people here in the ACT is they want housing and cost of living dealt with, but they want us to look after this incredible continent. One of the disappointing things this term has been the lack of progress on nature. Pocock noted \u201csome of the pressures they\u2019ve come under from industry in WA\u201d. Did the government acknowledge to him if they were acceding to the requests of the WA premier? Pocock said it came down to \u201cdetails and timing\u201d \u2013 and that it\u2019s \u201call very last-minute\u201d in the Senate. A second man has been charged after 10 vehicles and buildings were vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs last week. Detectives have previously charged a 21-year-old man for his alleged role in the incident. He remains before the court. This morning, police arrested a 19-year-old man at a residence on Queen Street, Arncliffe. He was taken to Kogarah police station and charged with 21 offences, including: Destroying or damaging property (14 counts). Entering a building or land with intent to commit an indictable offence (three counts). Destroying property in company using fire to the value of more than $5,000. Destroying property in company using fire to the value of less than or equal to $2,000. Behaving in an offensive manner in or near a public place or school. Having a blackened or disguised face with intent to commit an indictable offence. He was refused bail and was due to appear before Sutherland local court today. Bill Shorten leaves question time for one last time Just circling back to question time in the House of Representatives earlier this afternoon. As we\u2019ve previously reported, the NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, will retire from politics in February and take up the role of vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra. That means that today\u2019s question time was his last, after 17 years. Mike Bowers captured the moment he waved the lower house goodbye: The soon-to-be-sacked chairperson of Queensland\u2019s truth-telling inquiry says he was given no notice of a decision to repeal the body\u2019s legislation. The state\u2019s pathway to treaty legislation is scheduled to be repealed tonight, making it the first bill passed by the new parliament. It will be debated as an urgent bill, with no committee process. Josh Creamer says his first notice of the bill was an email sent shortly after the deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, introduced the legislation. Creamer told a press conference earlier: There\u2019s not any room in this government to listen to voices opposed to them, and there\u2019s certainly not any room in this government to listen to the voices of strong Indigenous leadership. The government certainly have no interest in listening. Creamer says the government has lost a lot of trust in the community and compared the decision to one made under Campbell Newman. I think the last time this government were in, they were known for their attack on institutions such as the arts and law, as two examples, and we\u2019ve seen here today, really attack on an important institution as an inquiry. As Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, we deserve better. We deserve the best and equal to what everyone else receives. Wong thanks Birmingham for constructive engagement as he announces retirement Penny Wong is now speaking after Simon Birmingham\u2019s announcement he will retire from politics. She notes that they disagree often, but says Birmingham \u201chas always engaged respectfully and with integrity\u201d. He is a thoroughly decent person and I want to thank him personally for his constructive engagement. Wong says he has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to rise above personal politics, and has shown \u201ca great deal of kindness\u201d to her at times. After thanking various senators, his staff and family, Simon Birmingham becomes emotional at times and tells the senators in the chamber: It is not necessary to target one another and personalise debates to advance the issues important to you. It is not necessary to undermine the principles and practices at this Senate to advance the issues important to you. Every senator is accorded with remarkable privileges at a platform like no other in this nation to advance those issues \u2026 Use those privileges, make the most of your platform and you will be amazed at what you can achieve in this place, without crossing the line \u2026 Thank you, and farewell. Penny Wong shakes his hand, as those in the chamber give him a standing ovation. Mike Bowers informs me that the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and other frontbenchers are in the Senate to watch Simon Birmingham\u2019s speech, along with crossbencher Rebekha Sharkie. On Peter Dutton, Simon Birmingham says they \u201ccertainly don\u2019t agree on everything\u201d but he is \u201cgrounded, thoroughly decent and has a perspective in touch with many hard-working Australians\u201d. I am confident that he would be a strong and effective prime minister, and I wish Peter and the Coalition team nothing but success. Birmingham goes on to say he doesn\u2019t want to pre-empt future decisions, but his departure will likely lead to the first all-woman leadership across the Senate, with his deputy, Michaelia Cash, likely to step up. Good luck to you, Michaelia. Thank you for being a loyal, good friend. Simon Birmingham says he is \u201cproud\u201d of being the first Coalition frontbencher to publicly back marriage equality reform. The ultimate strength of the yes vote for marriage equality demonstrated that Australians overwhelmingly back concepts of equality and respect for each other, regardless of our differences. We must learn this lesson in all aspects of our work, but including in the pursuit of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. We should strive to make Australians proud of having the oldest continuously living culture in the world \u2026 For all those on the harder edges of the left and the right who seek to divide our country, only make us weaker in our division, little is gained by culture wars, politicians obsessing over what happens in private bedrooms, or anyone seeking to override evidence-based medical practice. Birmingham fears era \u2018where populism trumps policy\u2019 Simon Birmingham tells the Senate he fears \u201cthe world is headed into an era where populism trumps the policy\u201d. On migration, he says: We should also acknowledge that Australia needs migration if we are to fund the ambitions and sectors like defence and maintain essential services as our population ages. We should also be bold in the use of data to drive government efficiency and steer down the conspiracy theorists who jeopardise such productivity measures. Birmingham reflects on decisions made during Covid-19 pandemic Simon Birmingham also speaks on his time as trade and tourism minister, and the meeting where it was determined to close Australia\u2019s borders to China amid the beginning of Covid-19. It was the first of so many monumental decisions to be taken. Further border closures, the jobkeeper program, standing up a government-run air freight coordination mechanism, actions to save tourism businesses and just so many more through Covid. Our actions weren\u2019t perfect, nor in such unprecedented times was the information we had available to us to base those decisions on perfect. But on the whole, I am very confident [that] Morrison government decisions saved many Australian lives and livelihoods in the midst of this global crisis. Birmingham reflects on time as education minister Simon Birmingham has been reflecting on his time in politics, saying that when he entered the chamber in May 2007, he was its youngest member at the time. I will leave, thankfully, not as its oldest, but as the longest continuously serving of my current Coalition colleagues. In particular, he\u2019s been speaking about his time as education minister, listing various achievements \u2013 including Gonski. The Coalition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, is addressing the Senate, announcing his retirement from politics. Some will be kind enough to be disappointed to see me go, maybe only a few, but some. To them, I\u2019m sorry \u2026 As is the nature of this business [some] will be delighted to see the back of me. To them I am also sorry \u2013 sorry that I\u2019m giving you this joy. But staying just to spite my opponents or to prove them wrong is no good reason to stay. In any event, it is always better to go when there are some wishing you to stay, and none of us is irreplaceable. Now is the right time for me, for my family and for new career pathways. He says he will move in a \u201cnew, commercially oriented direction\u201d. You can all be relieved to know that it has nothing to do with lobbying, government relations or commentary. The independent senator David Pocock has issued a statement, outlining what he secured in exchange for supporting the government\u2019s \u201cguillotine\u201d motion, and the 27 bills listed in this. As part of the agreement: Significant amendments to the build-to-rent legislation were agreed, including five-year leases for tenants, no cause evictions and a truly affordable component of some 80,000 new properties and passage of the bill. Bringing forward the mandatory food and grocery code to better protect Australians struggling with record high prices. $10m in federal funding for gene drive technology research and development to address invasive species. Two further significant measures that will be announced in the coming days. In the statement, Pocock said the government and Greens \u201cdisappointingly\u201d refused his \u201cgood faith proposal\u201d to move forward with Nature Positive legislation in this sitting period, and \u201cthe transparency and disclosure elements of electoral reform\u201d. I am here to negotiate constructive outcomes and deliver for my community and that\u2019s what I have done today. Alongside environment and health, housing and cost-of-living are the top two issues Canberrans constantly raise with me. Today\u2019s agreement with the government will deliver tangible benefits to people in the ACT and around the country. Liberal senator Simon Birmingham to retire from politics AAP is reporting the Coalition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, will announce his retirement from politics. The opposition foreign spokesperson is expected to quit at the next federal election, due to be held by May, sources told AAP. Birmingham entered parliament in 2007 and has served as trade, finance and education ministers in previous Coalition governments under Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. Queensland teachers condemn decision to repeal truth-telling The union representing 17,000 teachers and support staff in Queensland and Northern Territory non-government schools has condemned today\u2019s move by the new Queensland government to repeal the Path to Treaty process as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. The Independent Education Union\u2019s Queensland and Northern Territory branch secretary, Terry Burke, said: Today is a shameful day in our state\u2019s history. The Crisafulli government has continued to show its absolute disrespect to Queensland\u2019s First Nations Peoples and communities in using the first day in Parliament to repeal this important process. Burke said it showed \u201ccontempt for reconciliation\u201d. The Crisafulli government might like to think it can stop the truth from being told but the truth of their disrespect towards Queensland\u2019s First Nations Peoples and communities cannot be hidden. David Crisafulli has made his choice to be on the wrong side of history by repealing the Path to Treaty process and in seeking to silence the voices of First Nations Peoples. The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has gifted senators in question time a Christmas present, or lump of coal, depending on your perspective. In the final dixer of the year for the upper house, Watt decided to perform an \u201code to the workers of Australia\u201d. He says in the tune of the popular Christmas poem, Twas the Night Before Christmas: Twas the sitting before Christmas and all through the Senate, every creature was stirring, especially Senator Rennick, At work, Australians are in shops, schools and sheds, while thoughts of Christmas leave, dance in their heads, All year, Labor\u2019s worked hard to deliver a pay rise, for workers, the Libs have been nos, but Labor has been ayes, Now an outraged Senator Cash and a Grinchy Mr Dutton have settled their IR plans, which would leave workers with nothing, Cutting pay, cutting casuals, their cuts, many pages, but all with one aim, cutting Aussie workers\u2019 wages, Then out from the house, there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my seat to see what\u2019s the matter, When, what, to my shocked eyes, did suddenly appear, but a shadowy cabinet sucking up to billionaires near and dear, Now, Gina, now, Gina. Oh, what a laugh, on Clive, on Ray, on Sky After Dark, Down the chimney, Peter Dutton came on foot and his clothes were all tarnished with coal and black soot. At this point, the Liberal senator James McGrath stands on a point of order, saying: \u201cThis is cringe\u201d. The Senate president, Sue Lines, responds: \u201cThat isn\u2019t a point of order, Senator McGrath.\u201d Watt continues: A bundle of nuclear rods, Mr Dutton had flung on his back, straight from Chernobyl, just opening his pack, Dreaming of post-election, when he gets to work, raiding every worker\u2019s pockets then he turned with a jerk, He considered a sleigh, but said to his friends, \u2018do not fret\u2019. And away they all flew on their billionaires\u2019 jets, With his billionaire mates, he flew out of sight, saying \u2018happy Christmas to all and have a good night\u2019. Albanese gives end of year speech to parliament In his end of year speech to parliament, Anthony Albanese says despite his \u201cideological differences\u201d with Peter Dutton they are able to have civil discussions. Someone said to me the other day, \u2018it doesn\u2019t seem like you hate each other\u2019, and that\u2019s absolutely right. He wished Dutton and his family well for Christmas, before moving to the crossbenchers and joking there was a lot of them \u2013 noting they have constructive discussions regularly. Star Entertainment faces difficult road ahead, CEO says Star Entertainment Group has a difficult road ahead and remains in an \u201cextremely challenging position\u201d, its incoming chief executive says, but its leadership believes it can survive a significant cash crunch on top of its other regulatory issues. As AAP reports, Steve McCann told Star\u2019s annual general meeting at The Star Brisbane today the troubled casino company had made progress on a range of important issues but revenue had continued to decline significantly amid challenges in implementing cashless play. Meanwhile, the cost of Star\u2019s transformation and the cost of external advice and assistance Star has required have continued to be at inflated levels, said McCann, whose appointment as CEO and managing director remains subject to regulatory approvals. The Star chair, Anne Ward, said that while Star had significant short-term liquidity issues and significant financial pressures, its directors were of the view that Star could continue as a going concern if it was successful on a range of matters. Those include meeting various conditions to allow it to access two $100m debt facilities, securing additional sources of liquidity and further progressing its plans for longer-term funding. Star incurred an operating loss of $18m in the September quarter, with its revenue dropping 18% to $351m. It had $149m in cash available as of 30 September, the company announced on 29 October. Company executives are working to raise $150m in subordinated capital, which would allow it to access the second $100m in debt. Revenue is down 15.5% at Star\u2019s Queensland and NSW casinos since cashless and mandatory carded play in those states began. Question time ends And with that, question time has wrapped up in the House of Representatives \u2013 Anthony Albanese is now giving an end-of-year speech. Taking a dixer, Anthony Albanese is making his election pitch \u2013 in this last question time for the year. In particular, he calls out the opposition\u2019s nuclear policy and the fact that it has still not announced its costings on this. He has spent all year saying the costings on his nuclear policy are coming next week or next fortnight. The clock is ticking and it never happens. Tomorrow never comes. He also labels Peter Dutton as an \u201cNPC\u201d, stating: Those opposite just say no to absolutely everything. I mean, talking to the leader of the opposition is like talking to an NPC, a non-playable character. It is just like a bot that does exactly the same thing \u2026 The reckless arrogance of those opposite who have not got the confidence to put forward a single costed policy, render them not an alternative government at all. Render them just a reckless bunch who will not put anything forward. Wilkie\u2019s retort to answer on whisteblower protections After Mark Dreyfus responds to Andrew Wilkie\u2019s question about whistleblower protections, the independent MP yells out: \u201cTell that to Richard Boyle.\u201d Wilkie asks question on whisteblower protections The independent MP Andrew Wilkie has asked about whistleblower protections \u2013 and whether the government would establish a whistleblower protection authority in this term of parliament, or next? The attorney general responds that last June the government passed an amendment to the Public Interest Disclosure Act, ensuring \u201cimmediate improvements to the public sector whistleblower scheme in place to ensure they would be in place in time for the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission\u201d. Regrettably, the former government failed to act on that 2016 review by Mr Philip Moss, we did act. This was the first significant public sector whistleblower reform since the Public Interest Disclosure Act was first enacted a decade ago. The government is now progressing a second broader stage of reforms \u2026 O\u2019Neil recognises work of crossbench The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, has noted the work of the crossbench in both houses while taking a dixer on housing legislation. Listing a few names, she says: I want the public to understand we have been elected at a time when crossbenchers have also come into this parliament and have done the hard yack, worked with experts, worked with stakeholders and engaged with our government and as a consequence we are making better laws because of their contribution. Bowen hits back at question about power prices The Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh has asked about power prices, saying Labor has broken a promise by not delivering a $275 reduction to bills. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, says inflation figures from the ABS this week showed a 35% reduction in energy prices and \u201cthe biggest fall in energy prices recorded in Australian history\u201d. These are things we are happy to talk about with the Australian people and with the opposition because the opposition\u2019s track record when it comes to delivering real cost-of-living relief to the Australian people is appalling. Catherine King speaks of \u2018shameful\u2019 record of robodebt The transport minister, Catherine King, is asked a question about regional development and takes aim at the opposition about robodebt: We have spent a lot of time returning integrity to programs following, frankly, what was a shameful record of those opposite. We have, of course, had to deal with \u2026 the legacy of robodebt and the contracting arrangements that have resulted as a result of robodebt from those opposite in all of our grants programs. Opposition questions price of renewables The shadow climate change minister, Ted O\u2019Brien, was next up to ask a question \u2013 bringing up a report by Frontier Economics regarding the cost of renewables. For more context on this report, you can read this analysis from Peter Hannam below: The climate minister Chris Bowen read out lines from the report, stating: \u201cWe found the report modelling matched Aemo\u2019s modelling results very closely.\u201d [It] went on to say, \u201cSimilarly when we went on to compare the real cost of 2050 we found the report modelling is about 91% the same as Aemo\u2019s results.\u201d Yes, I do think that is accurate. Blackout debate The Nationals MP Michael McCormack has got up to ask a question about calls for New South Wales residents to reduce energy consumption yesterday evening as extreme heatwave conditions put pressure on the grid. Climate change minister Chris Bowen hit back at the suggestion this would be more common with the rollout of renewables, arguing those opposite were \u201cdisappointed\u201d that there was enough energy reserves in the state, and no blackouts. He then took aim at the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, who used to be energy minister \u2013 and listed blackouts that occurred while he was minister. Continuing from our last post: Anthony Albanese told the chamber it was \u201cunusual to see [Tony] up there in the gallery, rather than behind the counter at Aussies\u201d. Tony is the man who did so much to enhance the seat of democracy here \u2026 You have been such an important part of this building. The prime minister noted that his son had been going there since he was in a pram \u2013 \u201cand now this week he was there having a cappuccino as a 23-year-old\u201d. Peter Dutton also spoke, saying that Tony and his family were such constant fixtures at Aussies that he didn\u2019t know what was happening at the cafe right now, joking there might be free coffees. Tony came as a 14-year-old migrant to our country. He has worked every day since then, he has educated his children [and been a] a role model \u2026 Tony, to you every success in your health and into the future. There was a brief applause, before questions re-commenced. Tribute to Parliament House cafe owner The House just paused for quite a nice moment, giving a tribute to Tony Calabria \u2013 a name that many readers of the blog might not immediately recognise, but a person whose work has literally helped lubricate the wheels of democracy for quite some time. Tony, who is in the public gallery during question time, has helped run Aussies cafe, the famous institution inside Parliament House, for more than 20 years. The long-running cafe has served politicians, staffers, lobbyists, visitors and of course journalists for as long as anyone can remember. Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton are both pausing to speak about how they\u2019ve been going to Aussies for as long as they\u2019ve been in parliament, and the service the family-owned cafe has given to federal politics. If you\u2019ve been to Parliament House, as many of the long-running fans of the blog have, then you\u2019ve probably been served or helped by Tony. We at Guardian Australia similarly pay tribute to Aussies, which has sometimes kept us running on pure caffeine alone on some of these hectic sitting days. The speaker has sent Liberal MP Aaron Violi out for interjecting 17 times. Milton Dick said a tally is kept, and \u201cthat behaviour is completely unacceptable\u201d. Assistant treasurer takes aim at state and local governments over insurance costs Back at question time in the House of Representatives, the independent MP Dai Le has asked what the government is doing about the rising cost of insurance. Assistant treasurer Stephen Jones responded, taking aim at other levels of government: In fact, some of the immediate things that other tiers of government could do to address insurance affordability would be to address the stamp duty imposed on insurance contracts, which is adding a tax for insurers, households, and small businesses. He called out those who \u201cdo dumb things by building the wrong buildings in the wrong places\u201d, and said: If there is anyone in this space who has the capacity to influence local governments and the decisions they are making around approvals and planning processes, then that would add to improving insurance affordability across the country. Queensland\u2019s pathway to treaty legislation is set to be repealed on the first sitting day of parliament. The new LNP government introduced the Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games Arrangements and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024. One of the \u201cother\u201d provisions immediately sacks the state\u2019s truth-telling and healing inquiry and treaty body. The government passed an urgency motion \u2013 over Labor opposition \u2013 to press the legislation through without a committee inquiry, tonight. It\u2019s expected to pass, because the government has the numbers on the floor of parliament. If it does so, it would be the first legislation passed by the new government. Queensland parliament poised to override human rights act a third time for youth crime bill Queensland parliament is poised to override the state\u2019s human rights act a third time to imprison children longer. The LNP introduced its headline \u2018Making Queensland Safer\u2019 legislation this morning, its first bill in government. The legislation doubles the sentence for a number of offences for children, and sets a mandatory life sentence for children convicted of murder. The legislation is contrary to the state\u2019s human rights act. Greens MP Michael Berkman was the only MP to speak against the legislation, during an urgency motion this morning: We can\u2019t overlook the fact as well that this bill, again proposes to override the Human Rights Act. Now, if I\u2019m not mistaken, this house has on only two previous occasions, suspended the Human Rights Act. On both of those occasions, it was for the purpose of locking up more kids. \u201cCriminals,\u201d an LNP member interjected. \u201cKids,\u201d Berkman responded. This is the kind of legislation that will make our communities less safe in future. We can\u2019t pretend that locking up kids isn\u2019t going to harden them. A parliamentary committee will be given just 8 days to consider the legislation. Albanese says opposition policy \u2018half baked\u2019 Continuing his answer, the prime minister labelled Peter Dutton\u2019s approach to policy as: \u201cIf you cannot ban them, join them.\u201d His schemes are half baked. He has nothing but anger and recklessness. He has no costings, no detail for any policy that he is putting forward. Policy positions that barely survive around breakfast TV. PM calls out Dutton for pushing for TikTok ban before creating his own account Next on his feet was the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, but before he could even conclude his question the Labor MP Graham Perrett was sent out under 94a. Dutton finished his question on government spending, asking: Why not call an election now to put Australians out of their misery and allow a competent Coalition government to get our country back on track? Anthony Albanese responded that Dutton called for an election when Labor announced the stage-three tax cuts, before \u201che rolled over and had his tummy tickled and voted for it\u201d. Now he is suggesting we have an election New Year\u2019s Day. New Year\u2019s Day! Talk about out of touch. The prime minister then listed a number of times Dutton has, as he called it, \u201crecklessly [mouthed] off\u201d. Remember in the lead up last year to Australia Day, he demanded a boycott of Australia\u2019s largest employer, Woolworths, because they didn\u2019t stock the right [merchandise]. He dubbed his own 2030 targets without warning his party. He talks about a referendum [but] he promised another one \u2013 he hasn\u2019t mentioned it since, but he made that commitment before the election \u2026 He called for a national ban on TikTok before he set up his own account. Albanese touts number of bills expected to pass Senate today Taking a dixer, the prime minister Anthony Albanese said the Future Made in Australia bill would pass the Senate today. We\u2019ve also got important legislation on social media to protect our young people. We also have important migration legislation that will also pass the Senate later today. Indeed, the Senate is expecting to pass more than 30 pieces of legislation just today. Question time has begun with a question on whether the government will reform the EPBC act in this term of Parliament. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, responded that stage one passed last year, and stage two was in the Senate right now: And if those opposite had any sense, they would vote for it in the Senate. Greens declare Mother Nature on the ballot at the next election The Greens have declared the next federal election will be \u201ca referendum on Mother Nature\u201d after the prime minister vetoed an agreement to pass its Nature Positive legislation. Greens environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young paid tribute to environment minister Tanya Plibersek for negotiating in good faith. But Hanson-Young condemned the government for the last-minute veto that sank legislation to introduce a national environment protection agency. If you want strong action to save Australia\u2019s native forests, this is the fight we are taking to the election, and if you want to stop logging koala habitat, you have to put the Greens back in the balance of power. This election will be a an election that is a referendum on Mother Nature, and we will make sure that it is at the top of the agenda. Question time about to begin After all the chaos of the Senate this morning, we\u2019re about to head over to the House of Representatives, where question time is due to begin in around five minutes. Grab a coffee, and stay tuned for all the highlights right here on the blog. Adam Bandt says \u2018pressure works\u2019 after legislation negotiation with Labor The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has written a post to X about negotiations the party has undertaken with Labor, to pass 27 pieces of legislation through the government\u2019s guillotine motion. Bandt said this demonstrates that \u201cpressure works\u201d. Everything\u2019s impossible until it\u2019s not. These are good outcomes that will make a real difference to people and the climate. List of bills the Greens will help pass in Senate Here is a list of bills the Greens says it will help pass through the Senate this week: Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 Treasury Laws Amendment (2024 Tax and Other Measures No. 1) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Build to Rent) Bill 2024 and Capital Works (Build to Rent Misuse Tax) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Mergers and Acquisitions Reform) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Reserve Bank Reforms) Bill 2023 Treasury Laws Amendment (Responsible Buy Now Pay Later and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Treasury Laws Amendment (Fairer for Families and Farmers and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Tax (Imposition) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) (Consequential Provisions and Other Matters) Bill 2024 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2024 Crimes Amendment (Strengthening the Criminal Justice Response to Sexual Violence) Bill 2024 Family Law Amendment Bill 2024 Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Charges) Bill 2024 Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional Broadcasting Continuity) Bill 2024 Crown References Amendment Bill 2023 Customs Amendment (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area Second Protocol Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Amendment Bill 2024 Surveillance Legislation (Confirmation of Application) Bill 2024 Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2024 Universities Accord (National Student Ombudsman) Bill 2024 The Greens have issued a statement, outlining what it secured in exchange for supporting the guillotine motion \u2013 and the 27 bills included in this. The Greens said it has secured $500m for social housing upgrades, no coal, oil and gas funding in Future Made In Australia, and an end to the commercial financing of fossil fuel projects overseas. The Greens also said it would pass the Future Made In Australia legislation and \u201cother bills\u201d this week. Their statement reads: [The social housing] will be proportionally distributed to the states without requirement of co-contributions from the states, meaning 50,000 social homes will be retrofitted with energy efficient upgrades such as air conditioning, insulation and shading; electric hot water water systems, cooktops and ovens; and solar panels and batteries. An estimated quarter of all social homes across the country could be retrofitted under the program. Amendments to the Build to Rent legislation will increase the minimum lease term that must be offered to tenants in new developments from three to five years. The government has also agreed to support Greens amendments to retain the government\u2019s power to override the Reserve Bank where there is disagreement. The ability of the Reserve bank to direct the lending activities of banks will also be retained. Spender disappointed in outcome of nature positive legislation In a post to X, the independent MP Allegra Spender said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to see the nature positive legislation \u201cblocked\u201d in the senate. As Lisa Cox and Karen Middleton reported yesterday, Anthony Albanese killed off a potential deal with the Greens to pass the legislation after an intervention by the WA premier, Roger Cook. Spender wrote to X this afternoon: So disappointed to see important environmental reforms being blocked in the Senate. Establishing an independent EPA is a modest step forward to protect our environment for future generations. It isn\u2019t the overhaul of our laws that we needed, but it would be progress. Senate will deal with social media ban and migration bills today Labor and the Coalition have just voted 44 votes to 19 in the Senate to deal with the social media age ban and the migration bills today, with one hour of debate. By our count that\u2019s now 31 bills that have been the subject of a guillotine: 27 in a Labor-Greens crossbench deal; and four in a Labor-Coalition deal. Note, this is not the bills actually passing the Senate \u2013 it\u2019s just procedural votes determining that they will all be voted on today. We also still don\u2019t know what crossbenchers may have won in return for their support. For example, earlier David Pocock was insisting on the EPA in return for his vote. That didn\u2019t happen, and yet he voted with the government and Greens. The Senate is now debating the anti-money laundering bill. What a relief to actually be talking legislation and not procedure! The Senate has agreed to Labor\u2019s guillotine motion, 34 votes to 32. Earlier, Penny Wong confirmed she will \u201cmove a further amendment\u201d \u2013 to include the migration bills and social media ban with an hour of debate \u2013 and that she believes the opposition will support that. Simon Birmingham\u2019s amendment to add the four bills to the government guillotine has been dropped, perhaps reflecting that agreement. Wong is now adding those four bills now. Labor is trying to have its cake and eat it too: different dance partners, for different sets of bills. So far it is succeeding. Thorpe holds impromptu press conference outside parliament After Lidia Thorpe delivered her speech at a rally outside Parliament House, as we reported earlier, the independent senator held an impromptu press conference to make a subtle slight at the Albanese government for suspending her. Thorpe\u2019s suspension meant the Albanese government was short on the numbers required for its guillotine motion today. Thorpe said: They certainly got wedged by suspending me while I\u2019m out, you know, enjoying the sunshine and good company, they\u2019re losing out on passing legislation. They do rely on my vote. I do work with the government on good policy and legislation. Earlier today, 2GB reported Pauline Hanson was considering legal action against Thorpe for falsely calling her a \u201cconvicted racist\u201d. Thorpe responded to the report: Senator Hanson was taken to court by Senator Faruqi and was found to be racist towards Senator Faruqi, so I\u2019m not sure what she would be suing me for or taking me to court. Yesterday, Hanson filed an appeal against a court ruling that she engaged in racial discrimination against Mehreen Faruqi when she tweeted the Greens senator should \u201cpack your bags and piss off back to Pakistan\u201d. Thorpe was suspended from the Senate yesterday for making \u201cinappropriate and sometimes abusive comments\u201d, and after she appeared to throw paper at Hanson during a tense parliamentary debate earlier in the day. Food and grocery standards bill also being rushed through While the shenanigans are capturing attention in the Senate, over in the House the guillotine is also being applied, on the government\u2019s food and grocery standards bill. After introducing the Treasury Laws Amendment (Fairer for Families and Farmers and Other Measures) Bill 2024 yesterday, the government is pushing it to a vote 24 hours later. Independent MP Helen Haines protested that the bill was being rushed through without proper debate, calling it \u201ca bandaid solution\u201d. I want to put on the record that what we\u2019ve seen in this Parliament today is not considered calm legislation. What we\u2019ve seen today is more akin to Schoolies Week I\u2019ve got to say and I\u2019m really unimpressed. Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, has explained that the social media ban and migration bills are not in this current guillotine motion \u2013 but they are going to be dealt with today, with an hour of debating time. That\u2019s why they\u2019re NOT in the current guillotine. But they\u2019re happening. Earlier One Nation senator, Malcolm Roberts, was up arguing that it is hypocritical of the Greens and crossbench to have complained about Labor\u2019s guillotine motion this morning, but now voting for its second attempt. He described this as a \u201cfraud\u201d and accused the Senate of \u201cselling out the Australian people\u201d. He demanded to know what deals have been done to support Labor\u2019s guillotine. The Greens have moved an amendment to add mergers and acquisitions to the guillotine. Senator Matt Canavan has written on X: The Government has just gagged debate on 27 bills. These bills - listed in photos - will be dealt with in just a few hours with almost no debate this afternoon. The social media ban is NOT one of the bills. But there may still be an attempt to ram the social media ban later this evening. Senate debates guillotine, Coalition to move to add social media ban and migration The Senate is currently debating Penny Wong\u2019s proposed guillotine motion. Simon Birmingham has already given notice of an amendment to add the under 16 social media ban and the three migration bills. We\u2019re not sure if Labor will vote with the Coalition to add those four bills or if, after passing its guillotine with the crossbench, it will then come back and attempt to add the final four bills with the Coalition. What the government is trying to achieve here is to pass as many of its bills as possible, some with crossbench support and some with the Coalition, but without losing those deal partners for the procedural vote that forces the bills to be dealt with today. Greens senator Nick McKim is talking about mergers and acquisitions. We could be here a while, strap in. The Senate has now voted 33 votes to 31 to debate a motion to vary its routine of business, preparing a guillotine motion put by the Albanese government to deal with a list of urgent legislation today. The motion said that these bills will be dealt with today: (i) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2024, (ii) Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2024, (iii) Aged Care (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, (iv) Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) Tax (Imposition) Bill 2024 Commonwealth Entities (Payment Surcharges) (Consequential Provisions and Other Matters) Bill 2024 (v) Treasury Laws Amendment (Responsible Buy Now Pay Later and Other Measures) Bill 2024 Capital Works (Build to Rent Misuse Tax) Bill 2024, (vi) Crimes Amendment (Strengthening the Criminal Justice Response to Sexual Violence) Bill 2024 (vii) Family Law Amendment Bill 2024, (viii) Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Guarantee of Origin Charges) Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia Bill 2024 Future Made in Australia (Omnibus Amendments No. 1) Bill 2024, (ix) Universities Accord (National Student Ombudsman) Bill 2024, (x) Treasury Laws Amendment (Fairer for Families and Farmers and Other Measures) Bill 2024, (xi) Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023, (xii) Treasury Laws Amendment (Reserve Bank Reforms) Bill 2023, (xiii) Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals and Other Measures) Bill 2024, (xiv) Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional Broadcasting Continuity) Bill 2024, (xv) Crown References Amendment Bill 2023, (xvi) Customs Amendment (ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area Second Protocol Implementation and Other Measures) Bill 2024, (xvii) Midwife Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Amendment Bill 2024, (xviii) Treasury Laws Amendment (2024 Tax and Other Measures No. 1) Bill 2024, (xix) Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024, (xx) Surveillance Legislation (Confirmation of Application) Bill 2024, These will all be voted on at 5pm, if not dealt with sooner. Simon Birmingham, the Coalition leader in the Senate, has noted that the guillotine motion doesn\u2019t include the three migration bills and the under-16s social media ban. We will try to discover why. He suggested the Greens tail is \u201cwagging the government dog\u201d. We haven\u2019t had the final vote yet. Labor wins bid to suspend standing orders in Senate Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong has moved a closure motion to suspend standing orders in the Senate, to allow a motion to change the order of business. We think this is preparing for the second attempt to guillotine debate on a number of priority bills. The government motion succeeded 34 votes to 32. The Greens and senators David Pocock and Tammi Tyrrell voted with Labor. They\u2019re now voting on suspending standing orders. But if the government had the numbers for the first motion, it\u2019s looking good for them. As AAP reports, Indigenous people who worked for little or no wages under discriminatory commonwealth laws have received an apology from the federal government. Speaking in the Senate, Indigenous Australians minister Malarndirri McCarthy acknowledged the injustice of these laws for people who worked for little or no wages in the Northern Territory between 1933 and 1971. Indigenous people were used for back-breaking labour, building new communities that often excluded them. We know they did gruelling and critical work, particularly in the Northern Territory \u2026 I am sorry for the suffering and injustice inflicted on First Nations people, my people, through the laws of the Commonwealth that denied them the right to fair pay for work done. I hope the Commonwealth\u2019s recent settlement of the Northern Territory Historical Wages class action, bravely led by Ms Minnie McDonald, can help to bring closure to this shameful chapter in Australia\u2019s history. New Queensland premier faces first question time Queensland\u2019s new premier David Crisafulli has faced his first question time in the top job. It\u2019s the first time an LNP leader has taken a question since 2015, when Campbell Newman squandered a record majority government in just a single term. Vanquished former premier Steven Miles, now opposition leader, asked whether Crisafulli would fulfill his promise to promise before the next election if the number of victims of crime was not lower than the 289,657 measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2023. When the premier said, when I say something, it will mean something, does the premier stand by his promise to resign if the total victim number does not decrease, or will the premier try to give himself wriggle room? Crisafulli said: \u201cYes, there will be fewer victims\u201d. There will be a change in the way that victims are in Queensland. The change is the number will go down. For the first time in 10 years, number will go down. Later today the LNP will introduce their headline Making Queensland Safer legislation, implementing the party\u2019s election promise of \u201cadult crime, adult time. It will increase the maximum sentence for a number of offences for children as young as 10, including a mandatory life sentence for child murderers. In that same speech, Lidia Thorpe addressed her suspension from the Senate, saying she wears \u201cthose disciplinary colonial actions like a badge of honour.\u201d She addressed protestors, who had arrived in support of her private members\u2019 bill against genocide, before dismissing Parliament as being led by \u201cwhite men.\u201d That\u2019s why they\u2019re scared, because we are rising. I\u2019ve got the day off today. I\u2019ve been suspended, I\u2019ve been censured and I wear those disciplinary colonial actions like a badge of honour. I am the mechanism, I am the body. Forget about Lidia Thorpe. I am guided by my ancestors, I am guided by my people. My Senate spot belongs to my people. It\u2019s horrible to work in that place every day and be surrounded by mainly white men in suits, who look down on people like me. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has been giving a speech outside Parliament House in Canberra, and she has decried the fact that the recommendations of Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This is a very racist, divided country. But thats not what we want, we want peace, we want liberation, we want self determination. We want to decide our own destinies, not this place with the native police. Native police are the ones that lead us to our slaughter. And they still haven\u2019t implemented the recommendations of deaths in custody. It\u2019s 33 years old, same age as my oldest boy. The bringing them home report that my mother was involved in no implementation of bringing our kids home. I\u2019ve seen my people, my family, my elders, fight every day for justice all my life, and I want our children to see justice. There is no no peace without justice. She went on to address climate protesters, saying they needed to remain connected to Indigenous causes, before finishing off with one final message for the king: We want our land back. We want our babies back, and we want the king to just fuck off. Albanese urges parliament to pass critical mineral tax credits bill Anthony Albanese has just spoken in the House of Representatives, urging the parliament to back legislation on tax incentives for hydrogen and critical-minerals production. Albanese has pitched the legislation as being central to the energy transition and to the future economy. Our plan is about building an economy that is more resilient and more diversified, more productive and more prosperous, more self reliant and more secure, because being more secure depends on becoming more self reliant. It is unclear whether the bill has enough support in the Senate to become law. Albanese is using the legislation to make a political point, emphasising it will create jobs in Western Australia and Queensland where he is very focused on holding and recovering seats respectively. While urging the Parliament to support the production tax credits bill, he pointedly did not say it would pass. He did claim that about his Future Made in Australia legislation, also on the list to be voted on in the Senate today and expected to pass with the support of the Greens and some crossbenchers. The prime minister noted that the Coalition opposed it. If you\u2019re not for a future made in Australia, I just wonder where they think the future should be made for Australians. Chris Bowen defends government\u2019s approach to pushing nearly 40 bills through Senate We asked energy and climate minister Chris Bowen whether it was democratic or fair for the government to try to ram nearly 40 bills through the Senate in one day. As we brought you before, Jacqui Lambie and the Coalition are livid at the government\u2019s tactics. Bowen defended the government\u2019s approach: You\u2019re going to see a lot of bills dealt with today, a lot of bills that have been talked about for a long time. You know, these are not bills that the Parliament should be surprised about. These are bills the government\u2019s been progressing for a long time with a very heavy legislative agenda, because we do it. We\u2019re an activist government doing a lot of things. We must point out that not all the bills have been hanging around for a long time. The under-16s social media ban was only unveiled last week; the electoral reforms not long before that. Bowen continued: Now, I\u2019ve been here for 20 years. If we didn\u2019t try and get legislation through on the last sitting day, it would be the first time in 20 years that that would happen. Governments try and get legislation through, that\u2019s what governments are for. And whether we get all our legislation through or not is a matter for the Senate. Governments of course try up until the last minute to get bills through, and often it\u2019s a flurry of last-minute negotiation and late nights \u2013 but it is very unusual to try and ram through 40 bills in a day. The minister said the government had \u201ca bit of work to do in the Senate, but I know that that is well in hand with our discussions with prospects\u201d. The government has officially launched its National HIV Strategy, which aims to make Australia the first country in the world to eliminate HIV transmission by the end of the decade. The strategy also endorses the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) campaign, a global effort to highlight that HIV cannot be sexually transmitted when a person with HIV has an undetectable viral load thanks to antiretroviral therapy. Australia became the fourth country in the world to sign on to the principles of U=U in May. The health minister, Mark Butler, said he wanted to assure people living with HIV that as Australia stems the rate of transmission, \u201cwe are not leaving any Australians behind and will continue offering high quality care to people living with HIV in Australia.\u201d A parliamentary breakfast was also held this morning for the occasion of World Aids Day, Butler said of the goal of eliminating transmission by 2030, \u201cif we can\u2019t do it, if you look around the world, I\u2019m not sure which country can.\u201d However, he warned: While the trajectory is positive, we are not on track to reach the virtual end of transmission by the end of this decade. New infection rates are down by about a third in the past 10 years. We need to accelerate that trajectory considerably. While he hailed the virtual elimination of transmission in the inner west of Sydney, which was one of the early epicenters of the epidemic, he said there are still \u201chard-to-reach populations in our community that require a different response.\u201d The government is looking at how to provide PrEP for people who are not eligible for Medicare, communicate better with CALD communities, and target health professionals in those communities who might not have been reached yet, and explore more opportunities for self-testing, Butler said. The Greens have seized on the apparent impasse between the Coalition and Labor on the electoral bill (see earlier post) to call to break out the transparency measures (real-time donation disclosure and a $1,000 donation disclosure threshold) and pass those today. I think the government would be very unlikely to agree to that: if you take the more popular bits out of the bill, it might make it more difficult in future to legislate spending and donations caps and increased public funding for elections. The Greens\u2019 Senate leader and democracy spokesperson Larissa Waters said: The Greens are ready to pass transparency measures but we want an inquiry to ensure that the proposed funding reforms don\u2019t entrench the two party system, making this bill a rort not a reform. Thorpe and supporters gathering outside parliament As we mentioned earlier, the independent senator Lidia Thorpe is planning to speak outside parliament about her private member\u2019s bill. The bill would strip the attorney general of his power to block the prosecution of genocide in Australian courts. It was due to be introduced to the Senate this morning, but has been adjourned until next year. Thorpe is suspended from the Senate today, but as we flagged earlier, made an unexpected appearance in the press gallery area. Mike Bowers is outside parliament capturing the action, and has snapped these photos: All the action is in the Senate today, but it\u2019s tense in the lower house too. The crossbench and Coalition teamed up to support a motion condemning the government for not bringing forward its long-awaited gambling advertising restrictions, calling on the government to finally unveil its plan \u2013 nearly 18 months on from the Labor MP Peta Murphy recommending a full ad ban. Independent Rebekha Sharkie proposed a motion, noting the government had \u201cfailed to take any action to reduce gambling advertising, 17 months after receiving unanimous recommendations from a Labor chaired committee\u201d. She asked the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, to explain to the House why they had not taken any action, and for the government to either introduce its own legislation or to allow other proposed legislation from crossbenchers to debate their own bills on gambling advertising. The government did not grant leave for Sharkie\u2019s motion. One of the crossbenchers \u2013 it sounded like Andrew Wilkie \u2013 yelled out \u201cshame\u201d. Sharkie said gambling was \u201ca national emergency\u201d, urging the government to finally move. Next to speak was Jenny Ware, the Liberal MP who was on the Murphy inquiry committee. Ware claimed the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, had missed the opportunity to show moral courage and leadership on \u201ca national social and health epidemic\u201d. The Liberal MP said people who had participated in the Murphy inquiry were \u201cbewildered\u201d at the delay, and was critical that Albanese had \u201cdisregarded questions\u201d on the issue. Sharkie\u2019s motion was narrowly defeated, 71-63. Wilkie put up a motion of his own, calling for the House to condemn the government\u2019s delay. That motion is likely to be defeated too, and the vote is happening now. Ryan criticises government\u2019s attempts to push through legislation The independent MP for Kooyong, Monique Ryan, has weighed in on the government\u2019s attempts to push more than three dozen bills through the Senate today. In a post to X, Ryan said: We need a government that will consider legislation appropriately, with consideration of due process, in a way which is evidence-based and reasonable. What we are seeing right now is not that. Mike Bowers says that Lidia Thorpe stood for a long while with her fist in the air, before turning to go and shouting: \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\u201d Here is the full quote of what Lidia Thorpe, suspended from the Senate today, could be heard saying above the Senate chamber, with her fist raised: Free free Palestine. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. Our photographer Mike Bowers was on the scene for her unexpected interjection. He says she entered the gallery area, where journalists and photographers watch the Senate. Her voice would be heard over the Senate\u2019s recording system. Lidia Thorpe has entered the Senate press gallery area, behind the President\u2019s chair, and shouted: \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d. There is a door on the first floor that allows entry to the press gallery, and she used that to go into the chamber. Thorpe made the comments with her first in the air as senators were discussing her private members bill. Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer Mike Bowers witnessed the event. Thorpe was suspended from the Senate yesterday, after she appeared to throw paper at Pauline Hanson during a tense parliamentary debate. Demolition of vacant Victorian public housing towers to start next year The state\u2019s housing minister, Harriet Shing, said the demolition of the two vacant towers will start early next year, with construction expected to be completed by 2028. This isn\u2019t a demolition as far as a wrecking ball situation. The configuration of the buildings themselves means we\u2019ll actually dismantle them, and we\u2019ve got works happening to actually remove many of the fixtures and the internal materials from the site. And you\u2019ll see from the new designs that sustainability has been a really important part of the way in which the architects have come up with these new designs ... that reflect the community, the colours and the materials used in the surrounding area. Shing confirmed the \u201centire development\u201d of 248 homes will be public housing. Victorian premier holds press conference on public housing towers in Carlton The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has held a press conference this morning after she released renders of the apartments set to replace public housing towers in Carlton (see earlier post). She said the site will have a 26% increase in homes, which have been especially designed for public housing tenants: We\u2019re listening to tenants, which is why there\u2019s going to be a mix of homes ... For example, on this site, there\u2019ll be homes that will be four and five bedrooms, not just the standard three-bedroom homes, because we know families come in all shapes and sizes, and we want to make sure we\u2019re building the homes for them, for their kids and for their future. That\u2019s why we\u2019re really excited today to be releasing these concept designs, and I want to thank everyone who\u2019s been part of this process. Here are some more renders of the housing towers: The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, this morning said that electoral reforms reached an impasse with the Coalition last night. But talks are still continuing today, and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has signalled the Coalition could still help Labor. He told reporters in Canberra: We want to see fair \u2013 continue to see what we\u2019ve always had in this country \u2013 fair, transparent elections. [And on] this legislation, we\u2019ve been constructive with the government throughout. We\u2019ve sought to work with them closely to get an outcome on this, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But at the end of the day, the legislation, like any legislation, has to get the balance right, and reasonable people can take different views on what the right balance is, but we will continue to work with Labor to give this legislation the best possible chance of being passed in this cycle of the parliament. Earlier (see post), he told ABC News Breakfast one of its sticking points is \u201cmaking sure we\u2019re not imposing unnecessary administrative burden on individual Australians or small businesses\u201d. I mean, obviously big businesses can deal with things when they make bigger donations. That\u2019s up to them. And same with the unions and others. But we don\u2019t want to create uncertain, unnecessary administrative burden. On the other hand, we do want to see reasonable levels of transparency. These things are always about balance and that reasonable people can have reasonable, different views on what the right balance is. And we certainly are taking a view on that. And we\u2019ll continue to work with the government in a constructive way. Education union launches pre-election campaign for funding with drones over Sydney skyline In what is perhaps a first for OzPol, the Australian Education Union (AEU) has launched their pre-election campaign for full school funding with a drone show over the Sydney skyline. As parliament limps towards the end of the year, the AEU used more than 300 individual drones to light up Sydney harbour, calling on Labor to fund public schools to 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS). The AEU federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the prime minister\u2019s commitment to fully fund public schools was in danger of become a broken promise, with outstanding negotiations in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. In the lead-up to the last federal election, Prime Minister Albanese promised to ensure that every public school was on the pathway to 100% full funding. Yet only 1.3% of public schools are funded at the SRS currently, the minimum cost of educating a child. The prime minister must act now and negotiate new bilateral school funding agreements \u2026 to ensure that all public schools are resourced at a minimum of 100% of the SRS by 2029. The 22.5% offer from the Albanese government is inadequate and does not deliver on their promise. The Senate has just voted on Jacqui Lambie\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders. She was seeking permission to put forward what was basically a protest motion against the government\u2019s decision to \u201cguillotine\u201d bills. But the vote was 33 to 33, and a dead heat equals a fail \u2013 meaning she could not put forward her motion. Lambie\u2019s motion reads that the Senate note: The Albanese government has guillotined more than 160 bills in the 47th parliament and continues to undermine democratic principles by proposing to rush through about 40 pieces of legislation today without adequate debate. By fast-tracking legislation, the Albanese government is circumventing proper scrutiny and accountability. This reckless approach places excessive and unreasonable pressure on parliamentary staff and risks compromising the quality and integrity of legislative outcomes. Does Thorpe plan on attending Senate despite suspension? Does Lidia Thorpe agree with Penny Wong and Simon Birmingham, that her actions would be unacceptable in any workplace? Thorpe responded: \u201cI wish they would say that about racism\u201d. Pauline Hanson has walked in there with a burqa, she constantly is across the floor spewing racism \u2026 That is not acceptable behaviour either, and why won\u2019t Wong and Birmingham call that out? \u2026 If we can\u2019t stamp it out here, then we can\u2019t stamp it out for the rest of the nation. I will continue to disrupt until it is taken seriously \u2026 Asked if she plans on attending the Senate today, despite the suspension, Thorpe said: \u201cNo-one tells me the rules around here until I break them\u201d. I think they make it up as they go along and that is part of the problem \u2026 Thorpe: \u2018I would do it all over again\u2019 Independent senator Lidia Thorpe also spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier about her suspension, and the actions leading up to it, and said \u201cI would do it all over again\u201d. Thorpe told the program that \u201cI will do what it takes to stamp out racism that I have experienced all my life\u201d, pointing to the motion she and Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi attempted to move earlier in the week: Thorpe continued: Labor sided with the Coalition to railroad that motion and have an in-house inquiry into racism in the Senate that no-one can see. We wanted the public to see a proper inquiry into stamping out racism in the chamber, and we weren\u2019t successful in ensuring that that can be thoroughly done in a way that everybody can see the problems in our workplace \u2026 What senator [Pauline] Hanson did to Senator [Fatima] Payman was an act of disgusting racism, questioning Senator Payman\u2019s legitimacy to be in this place \u2026 I am not one to stand or sit silent and allow this to happen. I would do it again. I ripped up the letters that Hanson wrote to the Senate, calling on Payman to be investigated for her legitimacy here. That is an act of racism and we need to stamp that out as a nation, otherwise we will continue to be divided. Pauline Hanson was contacted for a response, and her office responded: \u201cThorpe does not merit a response\u201d. Gallagher says guillotine motion relates to \u2018blockers\u2019 mentality from opposition Katy Gallagher is now speaking to the Senate, saying that the number of guillotine motions \u201cdirectly relates to the lack of constructivity from those opposite\u201d. She has been taking aim at the opposition for being \u201cblockers\u201d, and said: We have a range of bills as we reach the end of this sitting year that we would like to pass. I don\u2019t think that is any surprise \u2026 Now, the way we have tried to set this up is that we [have listed] bills that are the government priority, and then people are able to vote and we progress through that motion. We think that is a sensible way to vote, as you may on each bill, but don\u2019t just block, say yes or no. She said many of the bills \u201chave been on the notice paper for over a year\u201d. These have not been last-minute bills that have been dropped in to everybody\u2019s surprise. This legislation has been in this chamber, it has been blocked in this chamber for months and months, there have been Senate inquiry reports on most of them, there have been lots of negotiations with people. I don\u2019t accept that we are trying to circumvent scrutiny or accountability. Earlier this morning, independent senator Lidia Thorpe spoke with the Today Show. The Senate voted to suspend her yesterday, after she appeared to throw paper at Pauline Hanson during a tense parliamentary debate. Weighing in on what happened, Thorpe said it had been \u201ca horrible week.\u201d It\u2019s been a horrible week, and when you\u2019re subjected to racism \u2013 which I have been since I was a kid \u2026 I stand up against it. And that\u2019s what I did, I ripped up a piece of paper\u2026 Does she regret doing that? Thorpe responded: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Host Karl Stefanovic said, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that these days\u201d, and Thorpe responded: Well, you can\u2019t be racist these days either, and that is what is creating the hate and harm in this country \u2026 We all have a responsibility to stamp racism out. Senator Hanson gets away with so much \u2026 She has worn a burqa in the chamber. She baits me regularly with racial taunts, and what she did to Senator Payman [when she] questioned her legitimacy in this place. Thorpe went on to say \u201cit was a bit of a coincidence that they decided to suspend me when my private senator\u2019s bill was about to be voted [on today]\u201d. Birmingham says opposition will oppose guillotine motion in Senate Simon Birmingham said the opposition would not be supporting the guillotine motion, telling the Senate: The Albanese Labor government has guillotined more bills through this Senate in three years than the previous Coalition government did in the previous nine years. I\u2019ve never seen a motion that seeks to ram 41 bills through the Senate in a single day. It is unprecedented. It is extraordinary, and it is shameful, and the government should just withdraw this motion. He said the opposition would \u201coppose the motion in its entirety\u201d. He said they asked for more time but instead, \u201cwe\u2019re just given this motion \u2026 that is so counterproductive to the effective operation of the Senate\u201d. Lambie lashes government in Senate for pushing through legislation Things have kicked off in the Senate today, with Jacqui Lambie on her feet criticising the government for pushing through a raft of legislation without proper scrutiny. As Karen Middleton reported overnight, the government is seeking to ram around 37 bills through the Senate today, including key legislative measures on migration, electoral reform and the social media ban for under-16s. This will be done using a guillotine motion \u2013 which truncates the usual debate time and brings on rapid-fire votes. Addressing the Senate, Lambie has said: To say that I am disappointed in this government is an understatement. It doesn\u2019t even cut it \u2026 How is it safe for the employers please in my office to go through 41 bills in a matter of about 12 hours. How is that safe? It is dangerous to shove bills down our throats \u2026 without us properly going through and actually having a good look at [them] and putting it under the microscope. I was not voted into this place to give you a free pass to put through 40 bills in one day. Liberal senator Simon Birmingham stood up and said: \u201cI could summarise my remarks simply as \u2018what Jacqui said\u2019.\u201d We\u2019ll bring you more of his comments in a moment. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe says she will address a gathering of First Nations elders and community members outside parliament about her private member\u2019s bill this morning. Her private member\u2019s bill, due to be voted on in the Senate this afternoon, would strip the attorney general of his power to block the prosecution of genocide in Australian courts. But Thorpe was suspended by the Senate yesterday, and won\u2019t be able to attend. The Greens opposed the motion, with Larissa Waters saying they did not condone the use of physical violence, and did not support Thorpe\u2019s actions, but it would be unfair to deny her the chance to speak about her bill. In a statement, Thorpe said \u201cthe Senate has suspended me to shut down this debate [but] we will not be silent\u201d. It\u2019s no coincidence that Labor suspended me from parliament today. My bill was scheduled for debate today. This was always a debate they didn\u2019t want to have. First look at renders for new Carlton housing towers Circling back to our earlier post, with the Victorian government releasing renders of its first major public housing tower redevelopment \u2013 set to replace Carlton\u2019s Elgin Towers. Here is the first look at that: Canavan calls for Senate to return next week to keep working through legislation The Nationals senator Matt Canavan has called for the Senate to come back next week, as the government attempts to \u201cram\u201d three dozen bills through on this final sitting day. In a post to X, he said this amounts to \u201caround an average of 15 minutes of debate per bill\u201d. The reason this is happening is because the Labor party scheduled no parliamentary sittings in December. What other workplace gets to knock off in November and not back until February? Let\u2019s come back next week, keep working and properly scrutinise the \u201cworld leading\u201d plan to ban under-16s from almost all apps, from Strava to Deputy. First look at Victorian public housing tower redevelopment The Victorian government has released renders of its first major public housing tower redevelopment, after it committed to knocking down and rebuilding all 44 in the state last year. The premier, Jacinta Allan, took to social media to share the renders of the new towers set to replace Carlton\u2019s Elgin towers. She said: These new designs come with 26% more housing than the original towers, with 248 new modern and accessible social housing homes for Victorian families \u2013 including some of our most vulnerable. The new towers will have better accessibility, better heating and cooling, ceiling fans, a laundry in each apartment, double-glazed windows and modern kitchens \u2013 a level up from towers past. But Allan did not say how many of the homes would remain in public hands. The redbrick towers in Carlton were built in the 1960s and consist of 196 dwellings. But they were vacated in 2023. Last year, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the then premier, Daniel Andrews, announced the redevelopment would be the first project to use the federal government\u2019s $2bn social housing accelerator fund. A day later, Andrews announced all of Melbourne\u2019s 44 high-rise public housing towers would be knocked down and rebuilt, describing it as the biggest urban renewal project in the nation\u2019s history. As flagged just a moment ago, the government has been forced to defer its electoral reform bill after the Coalition refused to pass it without last-minute amendments. The manager of government business in the Senate, Katy Gallagher, just told ABC RN that the bill would now not proceed among the list of almost 40 pieces of legislation that the Senate was being asked to pass in a single day. She said the special minister of state, Don Farrell, would keep negotiating and try again in February, when parliament is due to resume. It\u2019s off the table for today but Senator Farrell will be working over summer with all senators across the Senate chamber to try and reach agreement for that. We want to get big money out of politics. We want to have donation caps. We haven\u2019t been able to land that. Gallagher outlines priorities before mammoth day in the Senate Earlier in the interview, Katy Gallagher was also asked what her priorities were, among the three-dozen bills the government is hoping to push through the Senate today. She pointed to the under-16 social media ban as key, as well as migration bills \u2013 both of which the Coalition have indicated support for. On the RBA reforms, the Coalition have said no. Where are negotiations at with the Greens? Gallagher responded: I think there\u2019s the Greens have been clear \u2026 in earlier months about some of the amendments they would want to see \u2013 it was around the ability for the treasurer to override decisions, which is, it\u2019s essentially its status quo \u2026 They\u2019re very focused on that. We would have preferred to work with the Coalition. They\u2019ve blocked this bill, so that leaves us no alternative but to work with other parties in the Senate. Crossbench to make Nature Positive condition of any support Host Patricia Karvelas said the crossbench, or David Pocock at least, would be making Nature Positive a condition of any guillotine support \u2013 where does that leave the government? Katy Gallagher said she was made aware of that view overnight, and \u201cit\u2019s a long way before nine o\u2019clock in Senate time\u201d. That\u2019s a position that\u2019s been pushed by Senator Pocock. I indicated to the senator last night that I didn\u2019t believe that that was agreeable to us, because we hadn\u2019t been able to reach agreement on that bill. So I indicated that back to him. Obviously, he\u2019s still pushing for that, so [we] continue to work across the chamber. Gallagher weighs in on reports regarding Nature Positive Katy Gallagher was also asked about the Nature Positive legislation. As Lisa Cox and Karen Middleton reported yesterday, Anthony Albanese killed off a potential deal with the Greens to pass the legislation after an intervention by the Western Australian premier, Roger Cook. Gallagher said she wasn\u2019t in those meetings and \u201cI\u2019m not aware of that\u201d but \u201cwe weren\u2019t able to reach agreement to everyone\u2019s satisfaction\u201d. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual that we would want to fully understand some of the amendments that the Greens were seeking. There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that Tanya Plibersek was working closely, not just with the Greens, but with others to see if we could land Nature Positive. We weren\u2019t able to do so \u2013 just like electoral reform \u2026 there\u2019s either a sticking point in relation to electoral reform or further work to be done to understand some of the implications of what was being sought. Have talks between Labor and the Coalition over election funding reforms reached a last-minute impasse? Katy Gallagher said a decision was made that the bill would not be proceeded today. She said it was off the table for today and Don Farrell \u201cwill be working over summer with all the senators across the Senate chamber to try and reach agreement for that\u201d. We want to get big money out of politics. We want to have donation caps. We haven\u2019t been able to land it. The independents, I know, have some strong views about this, and Senator Farrell will work over summer, and we will try and deal with this in February, because we\u2019re really, really, very keen to get this done before the election. Gallagher says government prepared to sit \u2018through the night\u2019 in the Senate to pass raft of legislation The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has been speaking with ABC RN about the raft of legislation the government is hoping to push through the Senate today, and said \u201cif people want to sit through the night, we\u2019re prepared to do that to get these bills done\u201d. With about three dozen bills on the agenda, Gallagher said: We\u2019re very keen to get all of the as much of the important pieces of legislation through the Senate as we can. We\u2019ve already had a number of bills passed this week, about six \u2026 and we rate these as equally important. So I guess the position we\u2019ve taken is to be upfront. How is it actually possible to work through this much legislation in a day? Gallagher said: The motion sets up how we like to treat the bills through the day, so it allows time on each bills. It allows for such reading on the bills, and we will sit until they\u2019re finished. There may be amendments coming in late, but there have been months and months of negotiations on these bills \u2013 so I don\u2019t accept that people would be learning of things at the last minute \u2026 Sometimes those amendments land a bit late but we get the job done if those amendments are important for the passage of the bill. Youth crime top of agenda in mammoth Queensland parliament day Moving to Queensland politics for a moment, where controversial youth crime laws will be top of the agenda for the state government today. As AAP reports, \u201cadult time, adult crime\u201d legislation will be the introduced to Queensland parliament today in what looms as a marathon sitting. The new LNP Queensland government has vowed to push through the laws, which would see serious juvenile offenders face harsher sentences if they commit a serious crime including murder, manslaughter, unlawful wounding, aggravated break and enter and stealing a car. The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, said the laws were ready to be presented to parliament, with the government aiming for them to be passed and assented before Christmas. He also promised today would be jam-packed with the government wanting to get to work on their election promises. The government flagged there would be the introduction of at least two other bills today, leading into a late-night sitting. Nuclear costings coming \u2018in coming weeks and months ahead of election\u2019: Taylor The shadow treasurer was also asked when the Coalition would release the costings of its nuclear plan. Angus Taylor said it would be unveiled \u201cin the coming weeks and months in advance of the election\u201d. The Coalition has previously pledged to announce its costing before Christmas \u2013 is this no longer the case? Taylor responded: We will not be announcing it on your program this morning, as much as you might like me to. Taylor takes aim at government over inflation, spending Angus Taylor also weighed in on inflation, after yesterday\u2019s figures showed it remaining steady: The shadow treasurer argued that core inflation had gone up, meaning prices are rising at a faster rate. The government is in denial about it. The prime minister refused yesterday confirmed that is the case. That is the case \u2013 underlying inflation is going up. Will the Coalition keep the energy rebate if it wins government? Taylor responded that \u201cyou cannot subsidise your way out of an inflation crisis\u201d, taking aim at the government for \u201creckless spending\u201d. Shadow treasurer weighs in on electoral reform legislation The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier, to discuss some of the legislation the government is hoping to push through the Senate today. On electoral reform, he said the right balance needs to be struck \u201cbetween making sure we have that transparency \u2013 that I think is so important \u2013 but also making sure small businesses and others can get on and do what they want to do\u201d. Is that the sticking point \u2013 small business, and being worried about donations? Taylor said: One of them is sure we\u2019re not imposing unnecessary administrative burden on individual Australians or small businesses. Obviously, big businesses can deal with things when they make bigger donations \u2013 that is up to them, same with the unions and other. But we don\u2019t want to create unnecessary administrative burden [and] we do want to see reasonable levels of transparency. These things always about balances. Reasonable people can have reasonable different views on what the right balance is and we certainly are taking a few on that and will continue to work with the government in a constructive way. Today the Senate economics committee, chaired by the Liberal shadow assistant minister for home ownership, Andrew Bragg, will report back on its inquiry about how financial regulations can encourage home ownership. In October the committee received evidence that financial rules are making it harder to own a home, which Bragg summarised in a statement that: The \u201cblunt\u201d 3% serviceability buffer is damaging first home ownership; There is no structural focus on home ownership; and Different risk weightings would change pricing and access. Guardian Australia understands that the inquiry will recommend changes to relax lending standards for first home buyers in line with these three observations. It will do so by recommending a direction to the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority for new guidelines to allow a reduced serviceability buffer tailored for first home buyers. That would mean that instead of banks testing a mortgage application to ensure a prospective borrower can pay back the current interest rate +3%, there would be flexibility to apply a smaller buffer when interest rates are at the top of the cycle. For example, if interest rates are 6% and expected to fall, a first home buyer would be eligible if they could repay an 8% interest rate, down from 9%. The committee also wants to change the rules on mortgage risk weightings, which some witnesses told the inquiry would effectively mean a first home buyer mortgage could be 0.29% cheaper by making other owner-occupiers and investors pay 0.06-0.07% more. That would amount to a saving of $37,000 to a first home buyer over the life of the mortgage. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties on the final sitting day of the year \u2013 we\u2019re officially in the home stretch. As Karen Middleton reported overnight, and Martin flagged earlier, the government is seeking to ram around 37 bills through the Senate today, including key legislative measures on migration, electoral reform and the social media ban for under-16s. It feels almost like the calm before the storm right now, after an absolutely jam-packed day yesterday. I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage today alongside the whole Canberra team \u2013 Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Sarah Basford Canales, as well as Mike Bowers, capturing all the action. Let\u2019s get into it. Bowen says reliance on ageing coal-fired power stations \u2018magical thinking\u2019 The government has also released sections of an annual statement to parliament to be delivered today by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen. It focuses on problems with the country\u2019s ageing fleet of coal-fired power stations and the need to make a rapid shift to renewable energy. According to the excerpts, Bowen will say Australia\u2019s coal fleet is becoming increasingly unreliable, with 90% of capacity expected to retire by 2035. He will say more than 2.5GW of ageing coal-fired capacity was either broken down or out for maintenance during a heatwave this week, forcing the market operator to \u201cjuggle the grid\u201d to keep supply going, and there had \u201cnot been a single day\u201d in the past 18 months without an unplanned coal-fired capacity outage. The notion that Australia\u2019s ageing coal fleet should, or in fact could, be relied on to an even greater extent to power our system, is nothing short of magical thinking. The opposition climate change spokesman, Ted O\u2019Brien, will get to respond to Bowen. He has said a Coalition government would back increased use of coal and gas power, allow less renewable energy than Labor\u2019s planned 82% of generation by 2030, and use taxpayer-funds to build nuclear energy at seven sites. Critics say this approach would increase costs and emissions and make the power grid less reliable as a single nuclear plant would not be possible until after 2040. Only five large nuclear projects have reached construction in North America and western Europe this century. Four suffered delays, taking roughly twice as long to build as forecast, and cost somewhere between double and six times initial estimates. The fifth was cancelled. We\u2019ll bring you more on \u201cclimate Christmas\u201d during the day. Emissions report suggests Australia on track to meet 2030 target The government has also given journalists a snapshot of a departmental emissions projections report that we expect to be released in full today. The snapshot suggests Australia is on track to meet its 2030 target of a 43% cut in climate pollution below 2005 levels. It says under current policies it should reach at least 42.6%. We haven\u2019t seen all the numbers underneath that yet, but there is some broad context that we do know, including where the reductions are coming and what is counted towards the target. We have a story setting that out. You can read it here. The Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Annika Reynolds says the headline numbers show the government has made \u201csolid progress\u201d in cutting emissions from electricity generation. But the 2030 target is \u201cfar too weak\u201d as it is consistent with more than 2C of global heating, and that means \u201clonger heatwaves, more intense bushfires and worse flooding for Australians\u201d. Reynolds says the government is also allowing further global heating by approving new and extended fossil fuel developments for export. Approving coal and gas projects is the opposite of climate action. Household power bills projected to fall over next 10 years Continuing on from the previous post, the government has also released some headline numbers from a separate report by the Australian Electricity Market Commission. It says household power bills are projected to fall over the next 10 years. In a barely veiled reference to the Coalition\u2019s plan to slow the roll out of large-scale renewable energy, it emphasises that delays in solar and wind being built will increase costs. It says the AEMC has found that an average household that \u201cfully electrifies\u201d \u2013 that is, has solar panels and replaces cars and gas appliances with electric alternatives \u2013 could cut their annual electricity spending by 70%, or $3,500. Today is what some people call the Albanese government\u2019s \u201cclimate Christmas\u201d, when it releases a handful of reports on the country\u2019s response to the crisis. They include a progress report by the Climate Change Authority, an annual statement by the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, projections of what will happen with emissions between now and 2030 and the quarterly greenhouse gas inventory update. But wait, there\u2019s more. The government has also promised new figures on renewable energy growth this year from the Clean Energy Regulator and a report on electricity price trends from the Australian Energy Market Commission. The government has been dripping out selected excerpts from some of these reports over the past couple of days. They have included a look at the Clean Energy Regulator data. According to what has been released, we should expect a significant boost in the share of electricity coming from renewable energy late next year. This year will set a record for solar and wind installations, with Australia set to add 7.2-7.5GW of capacity. Nearly half of this rooftop solar, mostly on homes. More than 4.2GW of large-scale renewable energy plants are expected to be approved this year, including the 923MW MacIntyre windfarm in Queensland, which the operators have described as the biggest power station of its type in the southern hemisphere. The government says the regulator is forecasting that the average share of electricity from renewable energy will reach 45% next year, up from about 39% over the past 12 months. It says: This significant new generation capacity is mainly wind (70%) and will result in a material step up in the share of renewables as these new power stations reach full generation in the second half of 2025. Good morning and welcome to our live blog from Canberra on what promises to be a very busy day in Parliament House. I\u2019m Martin Farrer, bringing you the best of our overnight stories before Emily Wind gears up to helm the day\u2019s coverage. The Albanese government is going to try pushing 36 bills through the Senate today as the session heads towards a frantic conclusion. However, a law to increase tax on super balances over $3m will most likely not be among them. We\u2019re reporting exclusively this morning that the government has all but abandoned its contentious plan to increase the tax on superannuation balances over $3m. Guardian Australia understands that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, fears the policy, planned by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, could expose Labor to a repeat of the damaging franking-credits campaign that helped cost it the 2019 election. Among the key pieces of legislation likely to be pushed through today are the government\u2019s trio of migration bills giving government extensive powers, from deporting non-citizens to allowing sniffer dogs in immigration detention centres. They have been supported by the Coalition amid strong condemnation from rights advocates and today we hear from Priya Nadesalingam, the Tamil woman who won a long fight for her and her family to stay in Australia. She says the government\u2019s immigration detention bill would have made it \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to succeed and enable her family to return to Biloela in Queensland. Today is known in some parts as \u201cclimate Christmas\u201d because the government is releasing a slew of reports detailing where Australia is at with its attempts to tackle the climate crisis. These include a projection on emissions between now and 2030; Chris Bowen to claim that \u201cfully electrified\u201d households will see bills fall for the next 10 years, and the state of the country\u2019s fleet of ageing coal-fired power stations. More details coming up.",

The former prime minister, who previously opposed changing the law, said he had been persuaded by the safeguards in the bill and believed it would achieve a \u201cmeaningful reduction in human suffering\u201d. Cameron is the first former prime minister to declare his support for the legislation. Gordon Brown, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss have all indicated that they are opposed to it. Tony Blair has not expressed a view. On Friday, MPs will vote on legislation that would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill patients who have been given less than six months to live. In an article for the Times, Cameron said he was persuaded that the bill proposed by Kim Leadbeater, a Labour backbencher, was \u201cnot about ending life, it is about shortening death\u201d. He wrote: \u201cWhen we know that there\u2019s no cure, when we know death is imminent, when patients enter a final and acute period of agony, then surely, if they can prevent it and \u2013 crucially \u2013 want to prevent it, we should let them make that choice.\u201d The former Conservative prime minister said he was previously opposed to legalising assisted dying because he feared that \u201cvulnerable people could be pressurised into hastening their own deaths\u201d. But he wrote that the safeguards in Leadbeater\u2019s bill were \u201cextremely strong\u201d. They include a requirement for two doctors and a judge to approve decisions, and for the judge to speak to at least one of the doctors. Cameron said he would vote in favour of the bill if it progresses to the House of Lords. David Neuberger, the former president of the supreme court who ruled against high-profile assisted dying applications, including those of Debbie Purdy in 2009 and Tony Nicklinson, told the Guardian he supported the law change. Neuberger said he believed the status quo was failing \u201cthe fundamental aims of the law \u2013 to respect people\u2019s right of personal autonomy, and to protect the vulnerable\u201d.

Keir Starmer has not said which way he will vote but backed assisted dying in 2015 and promised to make time for the issue to be debated in this parliament. Starmer made that promise to actor Esther Rantzen last year after she revealed she had stage-four cancer and was considering ending her life in Switzerland. Asked whether the prime minister should be taking a more active role in the debate in the run-up the vote, Rantzen told LBC on Thursday: \u201cI think he did the right thing \u2026 This is a personal issue of conscience, and I think he is taking it very seriously\u201d. \u201cDuring the last debate, he supported assisted dying because, as DPP, he\u2019d come across so many heart-rending cases when compassionate bereaved families were being investigated by the police for assisting with suicide, which is the mess that the current law makes poor families in that situation go through.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s appalling.

HV Club Sandwich Widely available, episodes weekly Henry Southan and Jordan Sangha\u2019s new romance captured hearts in last year\u2019s Big Brother, and fans who continued to watch the \u201cdaahhling\u201d pair eat their way around London\u2019s finest restaurants on social media will be delighted to hear they now have a podcast. It\u2019s loosely based on food but mostly it\u2019s a lot of very entertaining bickering. Hollie Richardson There\u2019s a podcast for that This week, Hannah Verdier chooses five of the best podcasts featuring advice from experts in their field, from private investigators spilling their secrets to financial advice from Britain\u2019s most trusted man Private Eyes One of the greatest jobs for an inquisitive person must be private investigator. And one of the next best things to getting that job is listening to PIs Bari Kroll and Jennifer Rosant reveal the mystery of their jobs. Start with the episode on disguises, where they answer every question their friends have about how they blend in undercover. \u201cHalf the battle is getting out of your own head and feeling like: \u2018I belong here, let me look like it,\u2019\u201d they say about robing up to track down people living double lives. Sometimes that means a quick change into swimwear \u2026 Movers &amp; Shakers No one wants to be an expert on Parkinson\u2019s, but this podcast is packed with them, including broadcasting legend Jeremy Paxman and retired high court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn. The six friends who live with the condition meet up in a pub to share their experience on pain and challenges with the NHS as well as getting on with it and campaigning for their community. Early episodes can help people who\u2019ve recently been diagnosed, but the best thing about this podcast is that it\u2019s anything but grim, thanks to all the dynamic, likable and powerful personalities who sit down to chat. Where Should We Begin? Who knows relationships like Esther Perel? She sounds like a therapist should, with her Belgian accent that makes you instinctively sit up and listen, and she nails all aspects of modern love, from rushing into a lockdown relationship to finding your boundaries and setting them. Listening to her podcast is like eavesdropping on a therapy session and even if you\u2019ve made your decision on the couple\u2019s relationship, Perel is full of surprises, showcasing her sometimes unconventional wisdom. It\u2019s a great way to nose into other people\u2019s business while you pretend to learn about love languages. Black History Buff Podcast King Kurus is your expert host, brilliant storyteller and Black history buff for this straight-from-the-heart podcast. Throughout Black History Month, he delivers bite-size stories of key British figures, packing in their achievements and legacy in two-minute taster episodes: Mary Seacole, Stormzy and Malorie Blackman are all present. Earlier episodes go beyond the well-trodden history path and stray into proverbs, myths and legends from the African diaspora, and the way Kurus tells them is just spellbinding. There\u2019s no shortage of great history podcasts out there and this one is something special. The Martin Lewis Podcast What Martin Lewis (pictured above) doesn\u2019t know about the energy price cap or power of attorney isn\u2019t worth thinking about. When the good egg of the money world isn\u2019t hassling the government or getting excited about pension credit on the telly, he also fits in this podcast. Even if you\u2019re allergic to managing your cash, Lewis\u2019 enthusiastic and clear advice will permeate your credit card collection. His podcast mixes light and shade to perfection: one minute he\u2019s holding your hand as you try to get an affordable mortgage deal, the next he\u2019s asking what you did with your first pay packet. Why not try \u2026 If I Speak \u2026 , in which leftwing journalists Ash Sarkar and Moya Lothian-McLean ruminate politics and personal problems from a progressive perspective. Afropean, a thrilling exploration of thriving Black diaspora communities in Europe from Brussels to Berlin by author Johny Pitts. The Art of Deciding, journalist Bruce Whitfield\u2019s guide to making good choices in our personal and professional lives.

      "body": "<p>The<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/12/the-white-pube-art-criticism\"> White Pube</a>, the collaborative identity of critics Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad, have always pushed hard at the idea of&nbsp;art criticism. The name is a sardonic twist on both the \u201cwhite cube\u201d method of presenting art and the eponymous blue-chip gallery. The pair&nbsp;set up a website in 2015 and have become remarkable essayists and critics, refusing to conform to the&nbsp;expectations of the art world establishment. Each time they write, they seem to be asking themselves and&nbsp;the reader: what is criticism?</p> <p>Poor Artists is their first book, and although they tell us directly in the introduction that we \u201care reading a&nbsp;piece of art criticism\u201d, they also ask us&nbsp;to \u201clet go of any expectations of rationality\u201d. Most art criticism doesn\u2019t feature a fictional main character, various monsters and ghosts, or a&nbsp;novelistic narrative arc. At the centre of the book is Quest Talukdar, an aspiring artist who is learning about the way the art world chews up and spits out its artists. Muhammad and De la Puente build the book around Quest\u2019s quest (ahem) to make it as an&nbsp;artist. They interviewed 22 anonymous artists and art world people for the book, and they use this material as the basis for a&nbsp;series of strange Ali Smith-esque vignettes that feature talking babies, zombies, a&nbsp;professor made out of discarded art, beheaded critics, and the ghost of Gustave Courbet, among other oddities. Short chapters on real pieces&nbsp;of contemporary art, often performances that critique the art world itself, are also interspersed, along with references to real artists, galleries and people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The book is, at its heart, trying to get at the slippery, eternal problem of\u00a0what art is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Quest is a sort of fictional amalgam; she blends De la Puente\u2019s Liverpudlian identity, Muhammad\u2019s love of old paintings, and their shared experience at Central Saint Martins, where they met as art students and became jaded by the commodification of the London art world. But she is also an inherently empty character, because she is a vessel for the competing, contradictory voices of the people she meets, who in turn are mouthpieces for the White Pube\u2019s own views and the various people they interviewed. The contrived, expositional nature of the book\u2019s structure is extremely didactic, at times to a painful degree. But as it gathered pace, I could feel the strength and hopefulness of the authors\u2019 narrative. It&nbsp;feels written for readers who have not previously had the space or guidance to think about the way art is valued and policed. It is not, unlike a lot of art writing, written for other critics.</p> <p>The book is, at its heart, trying to get at the slippery, eternal problem of&nbsp;what art is. Quest\u2019s struggles are grounded in questions about the point of art, and how it should exist in the world. Within the book art is variously defined as something that \u201cbegins where language ends\u201d, \u201cjust a thing someone did&nbsp;because they wanted to\u201d, \u201can interpersonal skill that you could practise and use to interrogate your relationship with the world\u201d, and the opportunity to \u201ctransform something, and have it transform you in return\u201d. Quest never resolves these conflicting definitions of the thing she wants to do with her life. She tries to find a way to sit with their unresolvability.</p> <p>Poor Artists is critical of the art world as it exists: the convoluted funding applications, sycophantic gallery dynamics and snobby collectors, art schools that overpromise and underdeliver, and the poverty and precarity of life as a working artist. It is not particularly critical of any art in itself, except to disparage \u201cbeautiful<em>\u201d</em> art made to appeal to \u201cmagpie\u201d collectors and influencers.</p> <p>Sociopolitical critique stands for art&nbsp;criticism here in the same way that it&nbsp;often stands for contemporary art.

      "bodyText": "The White Pube, the collaborative identity of critics Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad, have always pushed hard at the idea of art criticism. The name is a sardonic twist on both the \u201cwhite cube\u201d method of presenting art and the eponymous blue-chip gallery. The pair set up a website in 2015 and have become remarkable essayists and critics, refusing to conform to the expectations of the art world establishment. Each time they write, they seem to be asking themselves and the reader: what is criticism? Poor Artists is their first book, and although they tell us directly in the introduction that we \u201care reading a piece of art criticism\u201d, they also ask us to \u201clet go of any expectations of rationality\u201d. Most art criticism doesn\u2019t feature a fictional main character, various monsters and ghosts, or a novelistic narrative arc. At the centre of the book is Quest Talukdar, an aspiring artist who is learning about the way the art world chews up and spits out its artists. Muhammad and De la Puente build the book around Quest\u2019s quest (ahem) to make it as an artist. They interviewed 22 anonymous artists and art world people for the book, and they use this material as the basis for a series of strange Ali Smith-esque vignettes that feature talking babies, zombies, a professor made out of discarded art, beheaded critics, and the ghost of Gustave Courbet, among other oddities. Short chapters on real pieces of contemporary art, often performances that critique the art world itself, are also interspersed, along with references to real artists, galleries and people. Quest is a sort of fictional amalgam; she blends De la Puente\u2019s Liverpudlian identity, Muhammad\u2019s love of old paintings, and their shared experience at Central Saint Martins, where they met as art students and became jaded by the commodification of the London art world. But she is also an inherently empty character, because she is a vessel for the competing, contradictory voices of the people she meets, who in turn are mouthpieces for the White Pube\u2019s own views and the various people they interviewed. The contrived, expositional nature of the book\u2019s structure is extremely didactic, at times to a painful degree. But as it gathered pace, I could feel the strength and hopefulness of the authors\u2019 narrative. It feels written for readers who have not previously had the space or guidance to think about the way art is valued and policed. It is not, unlike a lot of art writing, written for other critics. The book is, at its heart, trying to get at the slippery, eternal problem of what art is. Quest\u2019s struggles are grounded in questions about the point of art, and how it should exist in the world. Within the book art is variously defined as something that \u201cbegins where language ends\u201d, \u201cjust a thing someone did because they wanted to\u201d, \u201can interpersonal skill that you could practise and use to interrogate your relationship with the world\u201d, and the opportunity to \u201ctransform something, and have it transform you in return\u201d. Quest never resolves these conflicting definitions of the thing she wants to do with her life. She tries to find a way to sit with their unresolvability. Poor Artists is critical of the art world as it exists: the convoluted funding applications, sycophantic gallery dynamics and snobby collectors, art schools that overpromise and underdeliver, and the poverty and precarity of life as a working artist. It is not particularly critical of any art in itself, except to disparage \u201cbeautiful\u201d art made to appeal to \u201cmagpie\u201d collectors and influencers. Sociopolitical critique stands for art criticism here in the same way that it often stands for contemporary art. Muhammad and De la Puente scrutinise dysfunctional structures of inequality through Quest\u2019s naive eyes, but it\u2019s beyond the scope of the book to think especially critically or interpretively about the art she sees and makes. The conclusion is simply that it should be easier to be an artist, and that there should be space in the world to make stuff just for the pleasure of making it. What happens next is anyone\u2019s guess: how would the fabric of society shift if we acknowledged the centrality of art to the human experience? The many voices in Poor Artists start us thinking about how to find out. \u2022 Poor Artists by The White Pube is published by Particular Books (\u00a320).

A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/01/myths-about-tattoos\">Vanity Fair account</a> from 1926 is typical of many similar interventions both before and after: \u201cTattooing has passed from the savage to the sailor, from the sailor to the landsman. It has since percolated through the entire social stratum; tattooing has received its credentials, and may now be found beneath many a tailored shirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a long, complicated and important history relating tattoos to sailors, and also to criminals and assorted ne\u2019er do wells\u201d, explains Matt Lodder, author of Tattoos: The Untold History of a Modern Art), a handsomely illustrated new book on the subject. \u201cBut the main reason, certainly in Britain, we have a tattooing industry is because rich people wanted to get tattooed. I&nbsp;wanted to explore that industry and how it developed, and especially look at the people involved in it who have, with varying degrees of success, made tattooing a serious and standardised professional practice.\u201d</p> <p>Debunking the commonly held notion of tattooing arriving in the UK&nbsp;after Captain Cook\u2019s Pacific voyages of&nbsp;the mid-18th century \u2013 \u201cThere was tattooing in Britain before&nbsp;and after and the styles didn\u2019t change\u201d \u2013 Lodder&nbsp;instead identifies the key event&nbsp;as the opening up of&nbsp;Japan in 1858 to foreign visitors and&nbsp;trade. \u201cJust&nbsp;as Japanese prints, clothing, furniture and so on became&nbsp;exciting and exotic to aristocratic tastes, so did&nbsp;the Japanese tradition of&nbsp;tattooing.\u201d A succession of British royal visitors and future monarchs were tattooed while there along with&nbsp;various other crowned heads of&nbsp;Europe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If your king, or your bank manager, has a tattoo it\u2019s unlikely to be visible. If you are a labourer it\u2019s a different story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inevitably the trend cascaded down the social hierarchy, and what was an expensive upper-class pursuit, with gentlemen maybe privately sharing their tattoos over dinner, eventually became a more public spectacle among a wider demographic. \u201cIf your king, or your bank manager, has a tattoo it\u2019s unlikely to be visible,\u201d explains Lodder. \u201cBut if you are a manual labourer rolling up your sleeves it\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p> <p>Over the years the popularity of tattoos has waxed and waned, with a&nbsp;particular low point coming in the decades after the second world war. However, emerging vibrant subcultures from the gay scene to punk began to readopt the practice, supported by innovative and energetic practitioners.</p> <p>Lodder identifies a remarkable lineage of tattooists who established the craft, kept the flame alive and broke new ground: Sutherland Macdonald, who adopted a hi-tech electric machine as early as 1891, and was a society tattooist who advertised in the likes of Country Life and the Sporting Times; Les Skuse, a key British figure during the post-second world war slump, when he estimated there were as few as eight full-time tattooists working in the UK; Phil Sparrow, an American novelist and college professor, who went from corresponding with Gertrude Stein to becoming the Hells Angels\u2019 official tattooist in Oakland; and Jessie Knight, one of the few women in the tattooing world and who would advertise her work in blank verse.</p> <p>\u201cThe question as to why people go into a shop and pay someone they don\u2019t know to get tattooed is a fascinating one,\u201d says Lodder. \u201cIn part it\u2019s as simple as people wanting images that they like, but there is so much more going on and the stories of the people who made those images cast a&nbsp;remarkable light on something that is still often regarded as a deviant social practice and yet is simultaneously a thriving global industry.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tattoos: The Untold History of a&nbsp;Modern Art by Matt Lodder is published&nbsp;by Yale.</em></p> <h2><strong>Feel good ink: five highlights from the book</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Girls all go for the man Phil Sparrow<br></strong>There is some irony in this image advertising Sparrow \u2013 real name Samuel Steward \u2013 who was openly gay at a time when it was illegal.

I wanted to explore that industry and how it developed, and especially look at the people involved in it who have, with varying degrees of success, made tattooing a serious and standardised professional practice.\u201d Debunking the commonly held notion of tattooing arriving in the UK after Captain Cook\u2019s Pacific voyages of the mid-18th century \u2013 \u201cThere was tattooing in Britain before and after and the styles didn\u2019t change\u201d \u2013 Lodder instead identifies the key event as the opening up of Japan in 1858 to foreign visitors and trade. \u201cJust as Japanese prints, clothing, furniture and so on became exciting and exotic to aristocratic tastes, so did the Japanese tradition of tattooing.\u201d A succession of British royal visitors and future monarchs were tattooed while there along with various other crowned heads of Europe. Inevitably the trend cascaded down the social hierarchy, and what was an expensive upper-class pursuit, with gentlemen maybe privately sharing their tattoos over dinner, eventually became a more public spectacle among a wider demographic. \u201cIf your king, or your bank manager, has a tattoo it\u2019s unlikely to be visible,\u201d explains Lodder. \u201cBut if you are a manual labourer rolling up your sleeves it\u2019s a different story.\u201d Over the years the popularity of tattoos has waxed and waned, with a particular low point coming in the decades after the second world war. However, emerging vibrant subcultures from the gay scene to punk began to readopt the practice, supported by innovative and energetic practitioners. Lodder identifies a remarkable lineage of tattooists who established the craft, kept the flame alive and broke new ground: Sutherland Macdonald, who adopted a hi-tech electric machine as early as 1891, and was a society tattooist who advertised in the likes of Country Life and the Sporting Times; Les Skuse, a key British figure during the post-second world war slump, when he estimated there were as few as eight full-time tattooists working in the UK; Phil Sparrow, an American novelist and college professor, who went from corresponding with Gertrude Stein to becoming the Hells Angels\u2019 official tattooist in Oakland; and Jessie Knight, one of the few women in the tattooing world and who would advertise her work in blank verse. \u201cThe question as to why people go into a shop and pay someone they don\u2019t know to get tattooed is a fascinating one,\u201d says Lodder. \u201cIn part it\u2019s as simple as people wanting images that they like, but there is so much more going on and the stories of the people who made those images cast a remarkable light on something that is still often regarded as a deviant social practice and yet is simultaneously a thriving global industry.\u201d \u2022 Tattoos: The Untold History of a Modern Art by Matt Lodder is published by Yale. Feel good ink: five highlights from the book Girls all go for the man Phil Sparrow There is some irony in this image advertising Sparrow \u2013 real name Samuel Steward \u2013 who was openly gay at a time when it was illegal. He said he finally left academia when he realised he could make more money in a week tattooing than he could in a month as a professor of literature. Hand-painted flash on cardboard c.1914-18 \u2013 Alexander Colville Gordon An American who came to London in 1907, Gordon\u2019s use of standardised design sheets was aimed at a new demographic of working-class customers. Long overlooked, his work is now held in the National Museum of Wales collection. Bristol Tattoo Club members playing cards at the White Swan pub, 1954 \u2013 Designs by Les Skuse The club, still in existence today, was set up by Les Skuse to showcase his work and was modelled on Japanese tattoo clubs. It attracted widespread media attention at a time when tattooing was deeply unfashionable. Jessie Knight (right) with friend, 1950s \u2013 Paul King Knight, by far the most prominent women in the industry, had mixed feelings about tattooing other women. Her salon was filled with verse signs including one that read: \u201cWhen tattoos are on a lady, folks are apt to think she\u2019s shady. But as this is not always true, tattoos for ladies is taboo.\u201d Reginald A Loyd, 1905 \u2013 Design by Sutherland Macdonald Loyd was typical of Macdonald\u2019s wealthy upper-class clients as the son of an MP who later became a barrister and land tax commissioner for Berkshire. The design includes catfish taken from Hokusai.",

      "bodyText": "Some good news at last for Conor McGregor. Probably there\u2019s a way of spinning it as bad news, which is what the scum mainstream media will do. But in the wake of his defeat in a Dublin civil case against a woman who accused him of raping her, as brands and fans scramble to disown him, as murals are hastily painted over across the island, you have to take your pledges of support where you can find them. Step forward: Andrew Tate. \u201cBullshit ruling against Conor McGregor,\u201d Tate wrote from Romania, where he is facing his own legal issues, including charges of trafficking and rape. \u201cWomen sleep with rich men and if that man doesn\u2019t fund their life afterwards, they lie and sue. Their brutal narcissism can\u2019t take the L of being undesired. We\u2019ve set a dangerous precedent. It\u2019s literally impossible to be a man in the western world.\u201d Notwithstanding the fact that many men in the western world do occasionally manage to struggle by \u2013 where\u2019s our podcast empire and internet university? \u2013 there is a certain plaintive quality to all this. The hyper\u2011sensitivity, the victim card, the persecution complex: is this not quite \u2026 woke? Then again, perhaps you need an intellect on Tate\u2019s hyper\u2011extended level to find any kind of common ground with McGregor right now and to wilfully ignore that a jury found Nikita Hand had told the truth when she claimed she had been assaulted by him. Of course, kicking McGregor at this point in time \u2013 whether in print or in the pocket \u2013 is the easy bit. We know this because even the brands, those famous arbiters of ethical taste, have now begun to part ways. Tesco and Costcutter are among the supermarkets no longer stocking his brand of whiskey. All McGregor content and likenesses have been removed from the Hitman series of video games. \u201cWe take this matter very seriously,\u201d said a spokesperson from IO Interactive. At which juncture it is worth reflecting on all the previous matters that McGregor\u2019s many commercial confederates have over the years not deemed worthy of taking very seriously. Not serious: the time he was convicted of punching a man in a Dublin pub or snatching and smashing a fan\u2019s mobile phone. Not serious: the time he aimed racist slurs at Floyd Mayweather and his entourage. Not serious: the time he called rival Khabib Nurmagomedov \u2013 a practising Muslim \u2013 a \u201cbackwards cunt\u201d for refusing to drink whiskey. Or called Nurmagomedov\u2019s manager \u201ca terrorist\u201d and his wife \u201ca towel\u201d, or threw a metal dolly at his bus. The Nurmagomedov fight \u2013 its chaotic build-up, violent aftermath and toxic fallout \u2013 is often held as the start of McGregor\u2019s decline. Perhaps this is true in a strictly athletic sense. But the wider McGregor universe \u2013 the sinister cult of content and hype and commercial vindication and para-social sycophancy that he constructed around his talents \u2013 endured for years after those talents deserted him.

      "body": "<p>When Chris Hoy began to feel pain in his shoulder in 2023, he thought little of it. As an Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist accustomed to pushing himself at the gym and on his bike, twinges weren\u2019t unusual. But, as the pain became constant, his physiotherapist referred him for a scan where a tumour was detected. Further scans and a second consultation revealed prostate cancer that had spread to his pelvis, hip, ribs and spine. Then came the final blow: it&nbsp;was incurable. The prognosis was between two and four years.</p> <p>In a state of shock, Hoy \u2013 who is now 48 \u2013 went home with his wife, Sarra, to digest their new reality. The couple have two young children so, until they knew the treatment plan, they decided to keep the news to themselves aside from close friends and family. Hoy continued with his usual work commitments: talks, sports punditry and a weekly podcast. A few weeks later, he would begin a course of chemotherapy in a bid to stop the cancer spreading further.</p> <p>It is hard to fathom, given all that has happened, quite how Hoy found the time and wherewithal to record his experiences in a memoir, written with the journalist Matt Majendie. While the process may have been cathartic, there is clearly more to it than that. There is a thread of gratitude in the book that runs far deeper than performative celebrity humility. All&nbsp;That Matters is, above all, Hoy\u2019s love letter to his family and a keepsake for his children, who are too young to fully comprehend what is happening but will likely have questions further down the line.</p> <p>It\u2019s with rawness and clarity that the early chapters detail those first shattering consultations. On learning that his cancer was terminal, Hoy went \u201ccompletely numb. I go green in the face, Sarra tells me afterwards. I&nbsp;definitely feel nauseous, I can\u2019t form&nbsp;words or even thoughts to ask questions, but I am vaguely aware of Sarra doing that while I sit there. The noise is distant, the words totally indiscernible.\u201d Compounding the shock, he notes, was the fact that he was \u201cstill at the peak of my fitness, eating well, I\u2019ve never smoked, never done drugs and yet somehow these words were directed at me\u201d. But there was nothing he could have done. \u201cCancer is indiscriminate and, in my case, living the healthiest of lives could not have prevented the genetic predisposition I have to it.\u201d</p> <p>The book goes on to document Hoy\u2019s treatment, while fitfully jumping back in time to recall high points from his career as the first Briton to win six Olympic golds. This is surprisingly relevant, as Hoy finds he is able to utilise old training tools. \u201cOutrunning a&nbsp;terminal illness is a lot tougher than going for Olympic gold but ultimately it is about a person facing challenges and finding ways to&nbsp;take them on,\u201d he notes. Crucial to&nbsp;this process is his former team psychologist Steve Peters who, at&nbsp;the height of Hoy\u2019s sporting career, taught him how to shrug off external pressure, to shift focus away from what he couldn\u2019t control and to refine the mental side of his performance. Once the early shock has subsided, and via further sessions with Peters, Hoy finds he is able to navigate the panic and negative thoughts that come with a terminal diagnosis. But there are further hurdles, specifically the chemotherapy which he approaches like an 18-week training block, three weeks at a time. But even he, a decorated sportsman, struggles with the brutal physical impact of this toxic treatment which puts him \u201con the verge of fight or flight at any given moment\u201d.</p> <p>Astonishingly, there is more hardship to come for the Hoy family. Shortly after his own diagnosis, his wife learns she has multiple sclerosis. Since this is Hoy\u2019s book and not hers, he doesn\u2019t dwell on the details but you&nbsp;are left wondering just how much trauma one family can endure. And yet for much of this candid, sad yet ultimately life-affirming book Hoy finds himself marvelling at his good fortune, both professional and personal. For him, cancer is now a fact of life: \u201cI can\u2019t chase it away, but I can choose how I approach each day. It\u2019s a commitment, something I consciously practise. I choose to influence my life, and allow my attention to focus on the&nbsp;good, and the present.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>All That Matters is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a322).

      "bodyText": "A lawyer for the Northern Territory police has told an inquest into the death of Kumanjayi Walker that it is \u201cabsolutely undeniable\u201d that Zachary Rolfe is a racist. The inquest into the death of Walker is holding its final hearings, almost two years after it was due to be completed. Walker, 19, was killed by the then Northern Territory police constable Rolfe during a bungled arrest in the remote NT community of Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. Rolfe was later charged with murder but was acquitted of all charges after a supreme court trial. The inquest into the case is hearing final oral submissions in Alice Springs this week. Ian Freckelton KC, for the NT police, told the coroner, Elisabeth Armitage, on Thursday that a combination of Rolfe\u2019s text messages, his evidence, and other corroborating evidence meant that \u201cit is absolutely undeniable that Mr Rolfe is a racist\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cPeople who talk about loser locals, coons, neanderthals, losers on the basis of their Aboriginality, are racist, and it\u2019s important to call it as it is. And the position of the Northern Territory police force is that it is trying to call things as it is. \u201cWe have no reservation about saying to your honour that you should have no hesitation in making similar robust characterisations.\u201d Rolfe said during his evidence earlier this year that racist language was normalised in the force, but that he had never seen an officer treat anybody differently because of their race. Freckelton said Rolfe was \u201csexist, misogynistic, homophobic\u201d and had a \u201cdistrust for authority and contempt for bush cops\u201d. He said his attitudes were \u201cinconsistent with contemporary policing anywhere in Australia\u201d, including in the NT. \u201cHe lacks insight, he has a propensity to deny what cannot be denied, and he rationales what he cannot avoid confronting. \u201cHis credibility, to put it in a very generous way, is open to serious doubt.\u201d Freckelton went on to say, however, that concerns about Rolfe\u2019s attitudes, and about five incidents where excessive force may have been used during his policing, were not known at the time Walker was killed. He said it was wrong to think that the force allowed Rolfe to engage in a pattern of behaviour that culminated in the death of Walker, and submissions to Armitage that suggested this lacked cogency and rigour, and were not supported by evidence. Freckelton said the force was committed to reform, including in weeding out \u201cwarrior mentality\u201d, taking a zero tolerance approach to racism, which resulted in the recent removal of recruits from training, and would consider working with the Yuendumu community to limit the occasions when guns were carried by officers. \u201cWe know about what Mr Rolfe really thought \u2026 but the issue for the Northern Territory police force is what to do to try to eradicate these kinds of values.\u201d Freckelton said the force\u2019s appointment of Leanne Liddle was not tokenistic or an experiment, and she was not a panacea or a magician, but that her work in the first five months of her tenure was \u201cvery positive\u201d. \u201cThere is every reason, we submit, to be optimistic that the police force has learned lessons,\u201d Freckelton said. \u201cWe very much hope that those who loved and valued Kumanjayi Walker can derive some modest comfort that they have been listened to and changes have been made, and more will continue to be made.\u201d Rolfe\u2019s lawyer Luke Officer said on Thursday that Armitage should \u201cbe careful not to single out Mr Rolfe\u201d if she came to make findings in relation to racism, given the court had heard evidence about other police being racist. This included officers in the Tactical Response Group who were revealed after Rolfe\u2019s evidence, Officer said. On Wednesday, Officer said that Armitage should limit the scope of her findings to matters that directly related to Walker\u2019s death, and that to do otherwise would risk her threatening the jury verdict in Rolfe\u2019s case. Armitage said that she would consider an invitation to deliver the findings of the inquest in Yuendumu. She said she expected to deliver these findings in late February.",

Four market workers, caught out by this overly authentic addition to the festive decor, are busy shovelling the ground in front of the bao stalls and craft gin chalets. Above them, the cathedral\u2019s medieval towers stand tall and cold in the heaven-filling flurry. Winter has arrived in Devon with bells on.</p> <p>I\u2019m here to catch a train to see some birdlife. A breakfast blizzard wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but sometimes these things don\u2019t go as expected. The city\u2019s Queen Street has turned into a real-life snow globe \u2013 Narnia with sandwich shops \u2013 yet the little two-carriage train I\u2019m catching trundles into Exeter Central bang on time.

It\u2019s an epic rail journey, but not in the customary sense. \u201cThat\u2019s \u00a36.40 return,\u201d says the ticket-seller. \u201cAnd not a problem to break your journey in <a href=\"https://www.visitexeter.com/things-to-do/visit-topsham\">Topsham</a> on the way back.\u201d Built in 1861 as the Exmouth branch railway, the line covers a mere 11 miles, passes eight small stations and takes less than 30 minutes to travel end to end. For the second half of its length, however, the track hugs the shoreline of the Exe estuary \u2013 which is where the magic comes in.</p>    <p>The estuary is a fine spectacle in any season, more than a mile across at its widest point and stretching for eight miles. It\u2019s sheltered by hills, lined by sandbars and sprinkled with shipwrecks. There\u2019s year-round birdlife, in winter especially as more than 20,000 birds base themselves here to feed on the vast, nutrient-rich mudflats. Each muddy cubic metre, it\u2019s said, provides the same energy as 14 Mars bars. The majority of avian visitors are seasonal migrants, drawn to this brackish low-tide buffet from their more northerly breeding grounds. For hungry waders, it\u2019s the place to be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The estuary shallows are alive with feeders: slow-stepping little egrets, mobs of stocky turnstones, a lone heron</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when the estuary looms into view this morning, north of Exton, the tide is high and it is sleeting. Through the mizzled train windows, I see a shape that might be a duck. By Exmouth, however, things are markedly brighter. Rain is spotting from the sky and estuary waters are lapping at the tide walls. The views are deep, damp and fresh. A stunt-team flock of overwintering dunlin, here from the Baltic, banks and turns above the water.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this since I was a boy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.stuartlinecruises.co.uk/about-us-history-of-stuart-line-cruises/meet-the-team/\">Jake Stuart</a> tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life. I love it.\u201d He is skippering today\u2019s Stuart Line Cruise, a 75-minute sailing from Exmouth around the estuary. He\u2019s the third generation of his family to work for the company, which was set up by his grandfather. Today, his passengers number me and a 40-strong coach trip from Sidmouth. Mince pies and whisky-laced hot chocolates do the rounds.</p> <p>\u201cRight now most of the birds are roosting,\u201d Jake confirms on the PA. \u201cThey\u2019ll appear at low tide to feed.\u201d Taking a November pleasure cruise on a scenic inlet feels like getting one over on the calendar. There\u2019s something out-of-time about the Exe estuary, too, something about its big skies and green hues that lifts you out of the digital age and makes life a little simpler. There are castles on the foreshore, boats in the harbours and oystercatchers on the sandbanks. But the day\u2019s truest joys are still in store.</p>    <p>If, like me, you\u2019re a bird-lover rather than a fully badged birder and your visit here coincides with a mid-afternoon low tide, here\u2019s my advice. Bring binoculars. Buy a portion of salt-laced, vinegar-drenched chips for lunch and eat them on Exmouth\u2019s Imperial Recreation Ground, watching the tide ebb and the brent geese appear. If you\u2019ve got time, wander over to the esplanade to enjoy the wave-bashed views towards Torquay. Then catch the train back up to Topsham.</p> <p>As I roll northwards, the estuary shallows are already alive with feeders: slow-stepping little egrets, mobs of stocky turnstones, a lone heron. At Topsham, with the sun now blazing overhead (did I dream the snowfall?), I start walking. This was once one of England\u2019s busiest ports, its docks full of shipbuilders and wool shipments. Today, its streets are still lined with centuries-old pubs, while on its outskirts lies <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/days-out/reserves/bowling-green-and-goosemoor\">RSPB Bowling Green Marsh</a>.</p> <p>A 15-minute stroll brings me to a hide overlooking a reedy pool full of wigeons, teals and shelducks. Their chestnuts, greens and yellows are aflame in the afternoon sun. A happy half-hour later, I follow local advice to head to the <a href=\"https://goatwalklandtrust.org/\">Goat Walk</a> (\u201cfor the views and the waders\u201d), a raised, bench-dotted walkway directly above the mudflats. And here I stay until dusk, watching the winter feeders, a motley feathered crew variously arrived from Siberia, Scandinavia, East Anglia and the Arctic.</p>    <p>It\u2019s amusing how the different species wade and forage. Redshanks nibble as they stride above their own reflections; bar-tailed godwits plunge almost eye-deep into the mud; and, thrillingly, 30 avocets sweep the mud with upturned bills. When I scan the distance with binoculars, the whole low-tide estuary is stirring with birds, tiny glowing silhouettes sprinkled like salt. Shimmering in the low sunlight, it\u2019s beautiful.</p> <p>\u201cCurlews out there somewhere. Seen any avocets?\u201d asks a passerby. I tell him yes. \u201cWonderful, aren\u2019t they? They arrived yesterday, you know,\u201d he says, then gestures along the shoreline. \u201cI live just up there. Caused great excitement in our house.\u201d Yesterday! I treat the fact as a gift. I cast my mind back to this morning\u2019s snowstorm, then gaze again at the sunset mudflats, the sight a bona fide winter marvel.

Redshanks nibble as they stride above their own reflections; bar-tailed godwits plunge almost eye-deep into the mud; and, thrillingly, 30 avocets sweep the mud with upturned bills. When I scan the distance with binoculars, the whole low-tide estuary is stirring with birds, tiny glowing silhouettes sprinkled like salt. Shimmering in the low sunlight, it\u2019s beautiful. \u201cCurlews out there somewhere. Seen any avocets?\u201d asks a passerby. I tell him yes. \u201cWonderful, aren\u2019t they? They arrived yesterday, you know,\u201d he says, then gestures along the shoreline. \u201cI live just up there. Caused great excitement in our house.\u201d Yesterday! I treat the fact as a gift. I cast my mind back to this morning\u2019s snowstorm, then gaze again at the sunset mudflats, the sight a bona fide winter marvel. Sometimes, \u00a36.40 can take you a long way.

      "bodyText": "Who knew that the laborious process of democracy, of simply voting over and over again, could be so exciting and so amusing? Edward Berger\u2019s drama is adapted with masterly flair by screenwriter Peter Straughan from the Robert Harris pageturner; Ralph Fiennes is on sumptuous form as the deeply troubled Cardinal Lawrence at the centre of a murky Vatican plot. The result is a high-camp gripper, like the world\u2019s most serious Carry On film. Fiennes\u2019 character is Italian in Harris\u2019s book, but Straughan makes him an Englishman: an unquiet soul who is theoretically on the verge of becoming the first English pope since Adrian IV, although no one is so vulgar or nationalistic as to point that out. With the ailing pope in extremis, Cardinal Lawrence arrives at His Holiness\u2019s death bed to find other ambitious cardinals, who have all cultivated an opaque, unreadable manner of cordially respectful friendship with each other, now manoeuvring to be considered the successor in the imminent conclave, or election. In this blue chip supporting cast Stanley Tucci plays Bellini, the liberal; Sergio Castellitto is pugnacious, reactionary Tedesco, a racist bigot; John Lithgow is Tremblay, whose blandly emollient manner is misleading; Lucian Msamati is the bullish Adeyemi; and Carlos Diehz is Benitez, an unknown figure who to everyone\u2019s polite consternation had been created Cardinal Archbishop of Kabul without anyone realising.

Official figures show <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/latest-homelessness-figures-september-2024-6524638-Oct2024/\">14,760 people</a> \u2013 4,561 of them children \u2013 are living in emergency accommodation because of a housing crisis that has been growing for a decade. Average rents have <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/average-rents-up-43-on-pre-covid-levels-daft-price-rental-report-6540424-Nov2024/\">risen by 43%</a> on the current government\u2019s watch.

Until last weekend, they seemed to be coasting back to the cabinet room.

The party led by Mary Lou McDonald, who once seemed guaranteed to become the first female taoiseach as a result of her popularity, has been dogged by a series of allegations of <a href=\"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/politics/arid-41500607.html\">inappropriate behaviour</a> by two parliamentary members in Dublin and the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn8g18r29djo\">jailing of one of its press officers</a> for sexual offences against children.</p> <p>Those Sinn F\u00e9in scandals informed the decision by Fine Gael\u2019s leader, Simon Harris, to call the election early. His own popularity was another reason. At 38, Harris is energetic, ambitious and social-media savvy, earning him the moniker the TikTok taoiseach. Fine Gael\u2019s rise in opinion polls since he succeeded Leo Varadkar in March has been attributed to the \u201cHarris hop\u201d, but since he called the election, the hop has <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/podcasts/inside-politics/the-harris-hop-becomes-the-simon-slump-as-poll-shows-fine-gael-behind-sinn-fein/\">turned into a hobble</a>. A dismal party campaign began when the Ryanair chief, Michael O\u2019Leary, launched a Fine Gael minister\u2019s election campaign with an <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-oleary-endorses-fine-gael-6538210-Nov2024/\">attack on teachers\u2019 aptitude for government</a>, given that the D\u00e1il, he said, was \u201cfull\u201d of them.</p> <p>Next came a viral online video of another Fine Gael candidate punching a man six years ago, which culminated in a civil court order for damages against the politician. The lowest point was last weekend, when Harris was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/26/irish-pm-simon-harris-slump-drops-points-polls-election-fine-gael\">filmed walking away</a> mid-conversation from a care worker complaining about the sector\u2019s low pay during a canvassing walkabout. By Monday, Fine Gael had <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/11/25/the-irish-times-ipsos-ba-poll-november-2024-full-results-in-charts/\">dropped back to 19%</a> in an Irish Times Ipsos/B&amp;A poll, one point below Sinn F\u00e9in and two behind Fianna F\u00e1il on 21%.</p> <p>That party\u2019s Miche\u00e1l Martin is the only leader of the outgoing three-party coalition who is still in situ since 2020, following Varadkar\u2019s departure and that of the Green party\u2019s Eamon Ryan.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon\u2019s devastated south <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/displaced-return-to-southern-lebanon-amid-uneasy-ceasefire\">were already on their way back</a>, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there.</p> <p>The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state.</p> <p>For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s <em><strong>William Christou</strong></em>, as he returned from a reporting trip to the southern border, about what he saw and what comes next. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Assisted dying</strong></em> | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/27/ex-supreme-court-president-backs-assisted-dying-law-change\">has declared his support</a> for the law change. David Neuberger\u2019s intervention came as MPs backing the bill say they believe they have the numbers for Friday\u2019s historic vote to pass.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused more than 111 women over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohamed-al-fayed\">said to have been 13 years old</a>. The Metropolitan police said that five unnamed individuals were being investigated for facilitating the offences.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Ukraine</strong></em> | Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure was \u201cunder massive enemy attack\u201d on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/ukraine-russia-massive-attack-energy-power-network\">the country\u2019s energy minister said</a>, after a nationwide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Weather</strong></em> | The third named storm of the autumn, Conall, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/storm-conall-train-cancellations-power-cut-warnings\">has brought more disruption</a> to the UK, with trains cancelled in parts of southern England on Wednesday and the Met Office warning of delays on roads and potential power cuts.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Trade </strong></em>| Canada\u2019s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/canada-donald-trump-tariffs-leaders-chrystia-freeland\">work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs</a> on Canadian imports. Possible retaliatory measures are under consideration after Trump said one of his first executive orders would be a 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: Tackling mass displacement and destruction with meagre resources</h2>    <p>William Christou set off from Beirut to the devastated port city of Tyre at 7am yesterday. You can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/thank-god-we-are-home-lebanese-return-south-after-ceasefire-with-israel\">read about his visit here</a>. The drive usually takes just over an hour: this time, it was twice as long. \u201cThere were jubilant scenes on the highway,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were people clapping, cars with mattresses on top, a minority waving Hezbollah flags. There was a sense of excitement at going home.\u201d</p> <p>Later, the traffic intensified: the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cnvjl42g9m1t?post=asset%3A81cddc74-ece3-4a63-82c5-5b6aa55563d6#post\">Hugo Bachega reported that</a> the drive from Beirut to Sidon, the first major city on the coast south of Beirut, took more than four hours instead of the usual 20 minutes.</p> <p>But on a tour of areas near the border organised by Hezbollah later in the day, a grimmer reality presented itself. About 6km from the border, William saw two dogs eating the corpse of a dead horse in an otherwise deserted village, Silaa. In a nearby town, Zibqeen, two sisters called Zeinab and Dina, aged 19 and 28, said that they had started driving at 3am. \u201cThey were excited to make the journey, but sad for those who had died, and for the damage that has been done,\u201d William said. \u201cTheir house had been destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The return</strong> | Many will have to stay in shelters</p> <p>At least 1.2 million Lebanese people have fled their homes since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel began. About 96,000 Israelis have been displaced on the Israeli side of the border. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than a fifth of internally displaced people in Lebanon are in collective shelters and more than a third are children.</p> <p>Yesterday, Lebanese parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri told those forced to flee: \u201cI invite you to return to your homes \u2026 return to your land.\u201d But the Lebansese government and military, as well as the Israeli military, have warned people not to rush back to war-torn areas. And it is likely that most of those going home are realistic about the fact that they will not be able to stay there, William said. \u201cThey are mostly just checking on their houses \u2013 many of them will be gone, and there may be unexploded bombs.\u201d</p> <p>The Lebanese Real Estate Authority warned that bombs, weapons and booby-traps could still be in and around people\u2019s homes, and urged the authorities to conduct a thorough survey before people are given the green light. \u201cSo they will still need to be housed elsewhere, whether that\u2019s in shelters or with relatives,\u201d William said. \u201cThe internal displacement crisis will continue.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The reconstruction</strong> | A huge task with few resources</p> <p>More than 100,000 homes have been destroyed in southern Lebanon, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The destruction is most intense in the border area, which Israel has been attempting to clear out to prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in the future: <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/zone-destruction-israel-southern-lebanon-towns-idf/\">an NBC News investigation</a> using satellite data found that 42% of buildings in areas seized by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been destroyed. Water and electricity supplies have widely been cut off, as well.</p> <p>There were some nascent signs of a reconstruction effort yesterday, William said, with excavators arriving, rubble being removed and roads being cleared. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear how the work can be done on a large scale.\u201d Lebanon has been in the grip of corruption and an economic crisis for years, and is virtually a failed state, while Hezbollah, which has long effectively ruled much of the south, has been vastly weakened by Israel\u2019s onslaught. After the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, \u201cthe Gulf states [and] Russia put money in. It\u2019s not clear if they\u2019re interested this time.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, an international summit in Paris last month secured about $1bn in reconstruction pledges from international donors. But <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-hezbollah-conflict-cost-lebanon-85-billion-world-bank-says-2024-11-14/\">a World Bank report</a> two weeks ago estimated the damage and loss from the conflict so far to be about $8.5bn. Lebanon\u2019s GDP is $20.1bn.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Hezbollah</strong> | Claims of victory undermined by severity of losses</p> <p>Hezbollah might once have been expected to fill much of that gap, perhaps using resources funnelled from its Iranian sponsors. That appears less likely this time. Yesterday, William asked Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah how it would be involved in reconstruction efforts: \u201cHe answered in vagaries. He couldn\u2019t say how long it would take.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the vast losses it has suffered, with all of its senior leadership killed, including secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, and its capacity to wage war vastly diminished, Hezbollah has sought to present the ceasefire as a victory. \u201cThe new secretary general, Naim Qassem, made a speech recently saying that it\u2019s going to be Hezbollah cleaning up the roads and coordinating the work,\u201d William said. \u201cThey say they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>But whether they will retain the support they have long enjoyed among a section of Lebanon\u2019s population is not clear. </p> <p>One image in particular, which summarised how much they have been weakened, stuck with William: \u201cIn 2000, Nasrallah gave a famous speech to a huge crowd at the Bint Jbeil stadium after the Israelis withdrew from south Lebanon. We went there, and there\u2019s still a little memorial where he stood. Hassan Fadlallah spoke in the same place with an audience of a dozen journalists and empty stands covered in wreckage. He declared victory, and it rang hollow.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The Lebanese army</strong> | A new role \u2013 but a very weak force</p> <p>In theory, the Lebanese army will now be taking charge of the south of the country, and the ceasefire calls for a deployment of 5,000 troops. Yesterday, former Lebanese army general Khalil Helou described the ceasefire as a chance for the army to \u201cassert itself\u201d, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s not only a matter of hope, it\u2019s a matter of taking responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>The army lacks the cohesion and support it may need to take a more commanding role. Meanwhile, Lebanon\u2019s economic crisis has left the army denuded of resources, and at least for now it has no significant presence in the south.</p> <p>\u201cIt was telling that this tour was organised by Hezbollah, not the army,\u201d William said. \u201cNo one was manning the army checkpoints. And Unifil [the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/15/what-is-unifil-and-why-has-israel-been-firing-on-its-positions-in-lebanon\">United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon</a>] says that it can\u2019t always coordinate patrols with the army because they don\u2019t have gas for their vehicles. Soldiers are paid about $100 [\u00a379] a month.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What happens next</strong> | Anxiety about whether the ceasefire will hold</p> <p>The ceasefire has been agreed for 60 days. In theory, it should then lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities. \u201cBut there is a lot of apprehension in Lebanon about whether the 60 days will hold,\u201d William said. \u201cThat\u2019s not so much on the Hezbollah side: they have their tail between their legs, and they\u2019re not in a position to fight.\u201d</p> <p>But Israel has reserved its right to respond to military activity on the ground, and the IDF said that warning shots were fired yesterday to dissuade suspected Hezbollah operatives in border areas. \u201cThe worry is: if Israel sees weapons being transported and launches a drone strike, would Hezbollah then respond? It will be quieter in the short term, no doubt. But in the long term, Hezbollah is going to want to rebuild, and to return to a scenario where it is able, despite an agreement that says otherwise, to operate freely.\u201d</p> <p>As for the wider picture in the region: in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/israels-ceasefire-with-lebanon-makes-peace-in-gaza-ever-less-likely\">this analysis piece</a>, the Guardian\u2019s senior international correspondent Julian Borger writes that Israeli domestic politics mean that \u201cthe ceasefire in Lebanon arguably makes it less likely that an agreement can be struck in Gaza\u201d. For now, at least, the prospects for real stability at Israel\u2019s borders look remote.</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>A meat market in central London which has been operating for more than 800 years is being shut down. <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/an-emotional-wrench-smithfield-traders-absorb-news-that-market-is-to-close\">Caroline Davies spoke to</a> shocked workers about the closure of the <strong>Smithfield</strong> site. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>You might know that famous portrait of <strong>Samuel Beckett</strong>, staring straight down the lens of the camera; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/27/samuel-beckett-smoking-my-best-photograph-royal-court\">photographer John Haynes\u2019 favourite</a>, detailed in this week\u2019s My Best Shot column (and pictured above), is a different one.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon\u2019s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s William Christou, as he returned from a reporting trip to the southern border, about what he saw and what comes next. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Assisted dying | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, has declared his support for the law change. David Neuberger\u2019s intervention came as MPs backing the bill say they believe they have the numbers for Friday\u2019s historic vote to pass. UK news | Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused more than 111 women over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim said to have been 13 years old. The Metropolitan police said that five unnamed individuals were being investigated for facilitating the offences. Ukraine | Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure was \u201cunder massive enemy attack\u201d on Thursday, the country\u2019s energy minister said, after a nationwide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles. Weather | The third named storm of the autumn, Conall, has brought more disruption to the UK, with trains cancelled in parts of southern England on Wednesday and the Met Office warning of delays on roads and potential power cuts. Trade | Canada\u2019s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Possible retaliatory measures are under consideration after Trump said one of his first executive orders would be a 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico. In depth: Tackling mass displacement and destruction with meagre resources William Christou set off from Beirut to the devastated port city of Tyre at 7am yesterday. You can read about his visit here. The drive usually takes just over an hour: this time, it was twice as long. \u201cThere were jubilant scenes on the highway,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were people clapping, cars with mattresses on top, a minority waving Hezbollah flags. There was a sense of excitement at going home.\u201d Later, the traffic intensified: the BBC\u2019s Hugo Bachega reported that the drive from Beirut to Sidon, the first major city on the coast south of Beirut, took more than four hours instead of the usual 20 minutes. But on a tour of areas near the border organised by Hezbollah later in the day, a grimmer reality presented itself. About 6km from the border, William saw two dogs eating the corpse of a dead horse in an otherwise deserted village, Silaa. In a nearby town, Zibqeen, two sisters called Zeinab and Dina, aged 19 and 28, said that they had started driving at 3am. \u201cThey were excited to make the journey, but sad for those who had died, and for the damage that has been done,\u201d William said. \u201cTheir house had been destroyed.\u201d *** The return | Many will have to stay in shelters At least 1.2 million Lebanese people have fled their homes since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel began. About 96,000 Israelis have been displaced on the Israeli side of the border. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than a fifth of internally displaced people in Lebanon are in collective shelters and more than a third are children. Yesterday, Lebanese parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri told those forced to flee: \u201cI invite you to return to your homes \u2026 return to your land.\u201d But the Lebansese government and military, as well as the Israeli military, have warned people not to rush back to war-torn areas. And it is likely that most of those going home are realistic about the fact that they will not be able to stay there, William said. \u201cThey are mostly just checking on their houses \u2013 many of them will be gone, and there may be unexploded bombs.\u201d The Lebanese Real Estate Authority warned that bombs, weapons and booby-traps could still be in and around people\u2019s homes, and urged the authorities to conduct a thorough survey before people are given the green light. \u201cSo they will still need to be housed elsewhere, whether that\u2019s in shelters or with relatives,\u201d William said. \u201cThe internal displacement crisis will continue.\u201d *** The reconstruction | A huge task with few resources More than 100,000 homes have been destroyed in southern Lebanon, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The destruction is most intense in the border area, which Israel has been attempting to clear out to prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in the future: an NBC News investigation using satellite data found that 42% of buildings in areas seized by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been destroyed. Water and electricity supplies have widely been cut off, as well. There were some nascent signs of a reconstruction effort yesterday, William said, with excavators arriving, rubble being removed and roads being cleared. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear how the work can be done on a large scale.\u201d Lebanon has been in the grip of corruption and an economic crisis for years, and is virtually a failed state, while Hezbollah, which has long effectively ruled much of the south, has been vastly weakened by Israel\u2019s onslaught. After the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, \u201cthe Gulf states [and] Russia put money in. It\u2019s not clear if they\u2019re interested this time.\u201d Meanwhile, an international summit in Paris last month secured about $1bn in reconstruction pledges from international donors. But a World Bank report two weeks ago estimated the damage and loss from the conflict so far to be about $8.5bn. Lebanon\u2019s GDP is $20.1bn. *** Hezbollah | Claims of victory undermined by severity of losses Hezbollah might once have been expected to fill much of that gap, perhaps using resources funnelled from its Iranian sponsors. That appears less likely this time. Yesterday, William asked Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah how it would be involved in reconstruction efforts: \u201cHe answered in vagaries. He couldn\u2019t say how long it would take.\u201d Despite the vast losses it has suffered, with all of its senior leadership killed, including secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, and its capacity to wage war vastly diminished, Hezbollah has sought to present the ceasefire as a victory. \u201cThe new secretary general, Naim Qassem, made a speech recently saying that it\u2019s going to be Hezbollah cleaning up the roads and coordinating the work,\u201d William said. \u201cThey say they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d But whether they will retain the support they have long enjoyed among a section of Lebanon\u2019s population is not clear. One image in particular, which summarised how much they have been weakened, stuck with William: \u201cIn 2000, Nasrallah gave a famous speech to a huge crowd at the Bint Jbeil stadium after the Israelis withdrew from south Lebanon. We went there, and there\u2019s still a little memorial where he stood. Hassan Fadlallah spoke in the same place with an audience of a dozen journalists and empty stands covered in wreckage. He declared victory, and it rang hollow.\u201d *** The Lebanese army | A new role \u2013 but a very weak force In theory, the Lebanese army will now be taking charge of the south of the country, and the ceasefire calls for a deployment of 5,000 troops. Yesterday, former Lebanese army general Khalil Helou described the ceasefire as a chance for the army to \u201cassert itself\u201d, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s not only a matter of hope, it\u2019s a matter of taking responsibility.\u201d The army lacks the cohesion and support it may need to take a more commanding role. Meanwhile, Lebanon\u2019s economic crisis has left the army denuded of resources, and at least for now it has no significant presence in the south. \u201cIt was telling that this tour was organised by Hezbollah, not the army,\u201d William said. \u201cNo one was manning the army checkpoints. And Unifil [the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] says that it can\u2019t always coordinate patrols with the army because they don\u2019t have gas for their vehicles. Soldiers are paid about $100 [\u00a379] a month.\u201d *** What happens next | Anxiety about whether the ceasefire will hold The ceasefire has been agreed for 60 days. In theory, it should then lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities. \u201cBut there is a lot of apprehension in Lebanon about whether the 60 days will hold,\u201d William said. \u201cThat\u2019s not so much on the Hezbollah side: they have their tail between their legs, and they\u2019re not in a position to fight.\u201d But Israel has reserved its right to respond to military activity on the ground, and the IDF said that warning shots were fired yesterday to dissuade suspected Hezbollah operatives in border areas. \u201cThe worry is: if Israel sees weapons being transported and launches a drone strike, would Hezbollah then respond? It will be quieter in the short term, no doubt. But in the long term, Hezbollah is going to want to rebuild, and to return to a scenario where it is able, despite an agreement that says otherwise, to operate freely.\u201d As for the wider picture in the region: in this analysis piece, the Guardian\u2019s senior international correspondent Julian Borger writes that Israeli domestic politics mean that \u201cthe ceasefire in Lebanon arguably makes it less likely that an agreement can be struck in Gaza\u201d. For now, at least, the prospects for real stability at Israel\u2019s borders look remote.

Caroline Davies spoke to shocked workers about the closure of the Smithfield site. Nimo You might know that famous portrait of Samuel Beckett, staring straight down the lens of the camera; photographer John Haynes\u2019 favourite, detailed in this week\u2019s My Best Shot column (and pictured above), is a different one. Unsurprisingly, Beckett was petrifying.

      "bodyText": "Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. The Senate is expected to pass 31 government bills on its final scheduled sitting day after a flurry of negotiations and a Labor deal with the Greens. In exchange for $500m for social housing energy upgrades, as well as commitments against fossil fuel investment, the Greens agreed to align with the government on 27 bills including its Future Made in Australia agenda and a range of Treasury and attorney general\u2019s portfolio bills. The government will rely on the Coalition to pass three controversial migration bills and the under-16s social media ban. The Coalition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, this afternoon announced his retirement from politics. And parliament was just as action-packed outside, with independent senator Lidia Thorpe telling a rally on the lawns that she wears her recent suspension from the Senate as \u201ca badge of honour\u201d. The nation\u2019s leaders were clearly in the mood for action today with the South Australian parliament passing \u201cworld-leading\u201d laws banning political donations. In Queensland, new hardline youth crime legislation will require the third override of the state Human Rights Act in two years. The state\u2019s human rights commissioner says the laws, which will see children as young as 10 sentenced to life for five offences, are evidence of a \u201csociety that has lost its way\u201d. Top news Kristian White suspended from NSW police | The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb confirmed White has been suspended without pay after he was convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting 95-year-old Clare Nowland in a nursing home with a Taser. Gambling ad reform taking \u2018longer than hoped\u2019 | The communications minister\u2019s office has apologised to multiple people harmed by the gambling industry after delaying long-awaited advertising reforms. Emails seen by Guardian Australia show Michelle Rowland\u2019s office \u201ccan\u2019t confirm a revised timeframe\u201d. Inquest into the death of Kumanjayi Walker continues | A lawyer for the Northern Territory police has told the hearing that it is \u201cabsolutely undeniable\u201d that Zachary Rolfe is a racist. Rolfe, then an NT police constable, killed Walker during a bungled arrest in 2019 \u2013 Rolfe was later charged with murder but was acquitted of all charges after a supreme court trial. Australia facing heightened bushfire risk | Large areas of Victoria, Western Australia and NT are at increased risk of bushfires over the summer. Meanwhile, Sydney, Wollongong, Goulburn, Orange and Gosford are anticipating severe thunderstorm activity towards the end of the week, after days of intense heat in the state. Ukraine urged to lower conscription age | A source within the Biden government has said the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age from 25 to 18 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available. Doctors hail first breakthrough in asthma treatment in 50 years | A \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d trial found offering patients an injection was more effective than the current care of steroid tablets, and cuts the need for further treatment by 30%. Two companies drop Conor McGregor | Alcohol brand Proximo Spirits and video game developer IO Interactive will no longer feature McGregor\u2019s name or image after a civil court jury in Ireland ruled last week that he must pay nearly \u20ac250,000 (A$406,600) to a woman who accused the mixed martial arts fighter of raping her. Canada leaders agree to unite against Trump tariff threat | Canada\u2019s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports, with one official saying the country was already examining possible retaliatory measures.

What they said \u2026 *** \u201cThere are worse places to hide.\u201d Residents of the sleepy Welsh town Maenan, where only a few hundred people live, are coming to terms with the fact one of their neighbours, Daniel Andreas San Diego, was for decades one of the FBI\u2019s most wanted men. One local, perched at the nearby Pen Y Bryn pub, saw the logic in San Diego\u2019s decision: \u201cIt\u2019s a good choice of place.\u201d In numbers Western Australia\u2019s endangered Carnaby\u2019s cockatoos are now classed as one of the world\u2019s longest-living species of bird, with eight known Carnaby\u2019s cockatoos aged between 21 and 35 years being recorded.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s the testimony we\u2019ve long been waiting for. On Monday, at <a href=\"https://www.ucpi.org.uk/2024/10/11/undercover-policing-inquirys-tranche-2-phase-2-hearings-start-monday/\">the undercover policing inquiry</a>, the man whose cruel and disgusting deceptions have come to epitomise the \u201cspy cops\u201d scandal will be questioned. Many of us are hoping for answers, not least because his story suggests a closing of ranks across the British establishment. Even if you think you\u2019ve heard it all, some of the details in this column will take your breath away.</p> <p>Bob Lambert worked for the Metropolitan police\u2019s Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) in the 1980s and 1990s, first as an undercover cop infiltrating environmental and animal rights protests, then as operational controller of the squad, supervising other spy cops doing similar work. In the course of his undercover assignments, while posing as a radical activist called Bob Robinson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/22/undercover-police-lovers\">he deceived</a> four unsuspecting women, innocent of any crime, into starting relationships. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/21/anatomy-of-betrayal-undercover-police\">stole his identity from a dead child</a>.</p> <p>With one of the women, Jacqui, he fathered a child. Two years later, he vanished. She discovered his true identity by chance more than 20 years later, and has yet to recover from the devastating shock. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/24/undercover-police-spy-girlfriend-child\">She says she feels</a> \u201craped by the state\u201d. The person she loved and trusted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29743857\">was a ghost</a>. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got no foundations in my life \u2026. your first serious relationship, your first child, the first time you give birth \u2013 they\u2019re all significant, but for me they\u2019re gone, ruined \u2026 I was not consenting to sleeping with Bob Lambert, I didn\u2019t know who Bob Lambert was.\u201d</p> <p>When he sat with her as she went through 14 hours of labour, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29743646\">she later wondered</a>, was he being paid overtime? His abandoned son <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/04/abandoned-son-of-police-spy-sues-met-for-compensation\">was also traumatised</a> by the discovery of who his father really was. According to another former spy cop, Peter Francis, when Lambert was his manager, he advised Francis to wear a condom when sleeping with activists.</p> <p>These fake relationships were standard practice in the team of spy cops Lambert ran. The officers used similar seduction techniques, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/22/undercover-police-lovers\">built similar falsehoods</a> about their lives and used similar methods for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/23/undercover-police-animal-liberation-front\">destroying or abandoning the relationships</a> when they were redeployed. It looks like a refined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/it-was-as-if-he-set-out-to-destroy-my-sanity-how-the-spy-cops-lied-their-way-into-womens-hearts-and-beds\">state-sanctioned grooming operation</a>. As Helen Steel, another woman deceived by a spy cop, remarked, \u201cthere weren\u2019t any genuine moments \u2013 they were purely manipulative and abusive. \u2026. it was as if he set out to destroy my sanity.\u201d</p> <p>We now know that Lambert and other police spies <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/undercover-police-bob-lambert-exclusive\">repeatedly lied in court</a> when they were arraigned as \u201cactivists\u201d on minor charges, using their fake names to maintain their cover. They withheld crucial evidence from the trials of genuine activists, whom they had stitched up: the courts were not informed of their role. As a result, many environmental campaigners have now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/23/activist-conviction-quashed-undercover-police-officer\">had their convictions overturned</a>.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/20/met-opens-inquiry-after-claims-undercover-officer-set-fire-to-shop\">in parliament </a>and by another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/13/spy-cops-inquiry-undercover-officer-accused-debenhams\">witness to the inquiry</a>, Lambert has been accused of acting as an agent provocateur and planting an incendiary device in a Debenhams department store in Harrow that caused \u00a3340,000 worth of damage. Lambert has denied this.</p>    <p>The spy cops, among many other unlawful intrusions, used their relationships to gain access to privileged information: discussions between defendants and their lawyers that are legally confidential. Among the lawyers whose advice was compromised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/mclibel-leaflet-police-bob-lambert-mcdonalds\">was a young Keir Starmer</a>.</p> <p>The great majority of the people being spied on were peaceful activists who presented no danger to democracy or human life. Many were involved in campaigning against corporate abuses. Some of the spying, like Lambert\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/mclibel-leaflet-police-bob-lambert-mcdonalds\">infiltration of a campaign</a> against McDonald\u2019s, looks like policing on behalf of corporate power. But even that was not the worst of it. Police spies were also used to infiltrate the campaign for justice for Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager murdered by racists in 1993, whose case the Met, as a result of institutional racism, failed properly to investigate. Police spies were allegedly deployed to find \u201cdirt\u201d that could be used to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/23/stephen-lawrence-undercover-police-smears\">smear Stephen\u2019s family</a>. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC, now the Independent Office for Police Conduct) found that Lambert \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35706700\">played a part</a>\u201d in the intelligence gathering by spies inserted into the Lawrence campaign.</p> <p>None of the spy cops have suffered legal consequences, though activities such as identity theft and entering homes without a warrant are illegal. Their pensions remain intact, they have kept their medals and commendations. On Tuesday at the inquiry, Belinda Harvey, one of the women deceived into an 18-month relationship with Lambert, damned him as a <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/27/undercover-police-officer-bob-lambert-deceived-women-cruel-liar-inquiry\">\u201ccruel and manipulative\u201d liar</a>. But the authorities see him differently. In 2008, Lambert <a href=\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/58729/supplement/19\">received an MBE</a> for services to the police.</p> <p>After retiring from the police, Lambert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2015/jan/06/university-under-pressure-to-sack-controversial-former-undercover-spy-bob-lambert\">reinvented himself</a> as a right-on lecturer on community engagement, Islamophobia and counter-terrorism. He obtained prestigious positions at Exeter, London Metropolitan and St Andrews universities. Astonishingly, he received the London Metropolitan position <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821155531/http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/faculties/faculty-of-social-sciences-and-humanities/research/john-grieve-centre-for-policing--community-safety/\">after being exposed as a police spy</a>. As I have a connection with St Andrews, I <a href=\"https://sourcenews.scot/lambert-is-no-role-model-campaign-builds-to-sack-ex-sex-spy-from-st-andrews-university/\">joined the campaign</a> calling for the university to take action. But it stonewalled us. Scandalously, in my view, the university\u2019s then principal, Louise Richardson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/23/bob-lambert-ex-undercover-officer-quits-st-andrews-london-metropolitan\">remarked</a>: \u201cI think hiring people who have had real-world experience in an institution which is teaching counter-terrorism is entirely legitimate \u2026 I\u2019m not going to get involved in what people do privately whoever they are.\u201d When the real-world experience a university values consists of deceiving, abusing and destroying innocent lives, you have to wonder what the disqualifications would be. The issue was resolved only when Lambert, as the Stephen Lawrence revelations began to emerge, resigned.</p> <p>Such closing of ranks seems almost ubiquitous. Richard Walton, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/02/stephen-lawrence-ipcc-met-commander-spying-claims\">commander accused</a> with Lambert of involvement in spying on the Stephen Lawrence campaign, retired just after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/02/stephen-lawrence-former-police-officer-avoids-charges-over-alleged-spying\">IPCC concluded</a> he would have had a \u201ca case to answer for discreditable conduct\u201d, avoiding potential disciplinary proceedings. Did he shuffle off into obscurity? No. He <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/extremism-rebellion/\">authored a report</a> by the dark-money junktank Policy Exchange, calling for stricter penalties for environmental protesters. His recommendations <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2023/06/29/rishi-sunak-boasts-that-oil-funded-think-tank-helped-us-draft-crackdown-on-climate-protests/\">were adopted</a> by the government and incorporated into the draconian 2022 Police Act. So while the spy cops face no consequences, peaceful protesters, on his recommendation, now receive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/19/protest-democracy-labour-tories-laws\">massive prison sentences</a>.</p> <p>We know this went all the way to the top. The SDS, for which the police spies worked, was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/411785/2015-01-06_FINAL_Report_on_HO_links_to_SDS_v2.4_REDACTED_FINAL.pdf\">funded by the Home Office</a>, and fell under the supervision of several home secretaries. Despite being a victim of spying himself, Starmer, in his later role as director of public prosecutions, has been accused <a href=\"https://campaignopposingpolicesurveillance.com/2021/02/04/starmer-must-give-evidence-inquiry-say-activists-fitted-up-spycops/\">of presiding over</a> a major cover-up of spy cop activities.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the testimony we\u2019ve long been waiting for. On Monday, at the undercover policing inquiry, the man whose cruel and disgusting deceptions have come to epitomise the \u201cspy cops\u201d scandal will be questioned. Many of us are hoping for answers, not least because his story suggests a closing of ranks across the British establishment. Even if you think you\u2019ve heard it all, some of the details in this column will take your breath away. Bob Lambert worked for the Metropolitan police\u2019s Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) in the 1980s and 1990s, first as an undercover cop infiltrating environmental and animal rights protests, then as operational controller of the squad, supervising other spy cops doing similar work. In the course of his undercover assignments, while posing as a radical activist called Bob Robinson, he deceived four unsuspecting women, innocent of any crime, into starting relationships. He stole his identity from a dead child. With one of the women, Jacqui, he fathered a child. Two years later, he vanished. She discovered his true identity by chance more than 20 years later, and has yet to recover from the devastating shock. She says she feels \u201craped by the state\u201d. The person she loved and trusted was a ghost. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got no foundations in my life \u2026. your first serious relationship, your first child, the first time you give birth \u2013 they\u2019re all significant, but for me they\u2019re gone, ruined \u2026 I was not consenting to sleeping with Bob Lambert, I didn\u2019t know who Bob Lambert was.\u201d When he sat with her as she went through 14 hours of labour, she later wondered, was he being paid overtime? His abandoned son was also traumatised by the discovery of who his father really was. According to another former spy cop, Peter Francis, when Lambert was his manager, he advised Francis to wear a condom when sleeping with activists. These fake relationships were standard practice in the team of spy cops Lambert ran. The officers used similar seduction techniques, built similar falsehoods about their lives and used similar methods for destroying or abandoning the relationships when they were redeployed. It looks like a refined, state-sanctioned grooming operation. As Helen Steel, another woman deceived by a spy cop, remarked, \u201cthere weren\u2019t any genuine moments \u2013 they were purely manipulative and abusive. \u2026. it was as if he set out to destroy my sanity.\u201d We now know that Lambert and other police spies repeatedly lied in court when they were arraigned as \u201cactivists\u201d on minor charges, using their fake names to maintain their cover. They withheld crucial evidence from the trials of genuine activists, whom they had stitched up: the courts were not informed of their role. As a result, many environmental campaigners have now had their convictions overturned. Both in parliament and by another witness to the inquiry, Lambert has been accused of acting as an agent provocateur and planting an incendiary device in a Debenhams department store in Harrow that caused \u00a3340,000 worth of damage. Lambert has denied this. The spy cops, among many other unlawful intrusions, used their relationships to gain access to privileged information: discussions between defendants and their lawyers that are legally confidential. Among the lawyers whose advice was compromised was a young Keir Starmer. The great majority of the people being spied on were peaceful activists who presented no danger to democracy or human life. Many were involved in campaigning against corporate abuses. Some of the spying, like Lambert\u2019s infiltration of a campaign against McDonald\u2019s, looks like policing on behalf of corporate power. But even that was not the worst of it. Police spies were also used to infiltrate the campaign for justice for Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager murdered by racists in 1993, whose case the Met, as a result of institutional racism, failed properly to investigate. Police spies were allegedly deployed to find \u201cdirt\u201d that could be used to smear Stephen\u2019s family. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC, now the Independent Office for Police Conduct) found that Lambert \u201cplayed a part\u201d in the intelligence gathering by spies inserted into the Lawrence campaign. None of the spy cops have suffered legal consequences, though activities such as identity theft and entering homes without a warrant are illegal. Their pensions remain intact, they have kept their medals and commendations. On Tuesday at the inquiry, Belinda Harvey, one of the women deceived into an 18-month relationship with Lambert, damned him as a \u201ccruel and manipulative\u201d liar. But the authorities see him differently. In 2008, Lambert received an MBE for services to the police. After retiring from the police, Lambert reinvented himself as a right-on lecturer on community engagement, Islamophobia and counter-terrorism. He obtained prestigious positions at Exeter, London Metropolitan and St Andrews universities. Astonishingly, he received the London Metropolitan position after being exposed as a police spy. As I have a connection with St Andrews, I joined the campaign calling for the university to take action. But it stonewalled us. Scandalously, in my view, the university\u2019s then principal, Louise Richardson, remarked: \u201cI think hiring people who have had real-world experience in an institution which is teaching counter-terrorism is entirely legitimate \u2026 I\u2019m not going to get involved in what people do privately whoever they are.\u201d When the real-world experience a university values consists of deceiving, abusing and destroying innocent lives, you have to wonder what the disqualifications would be. The issue was resolved only when Lambert, as the Stephen Lawrence revelations began to emerge, resigned. Such closing of ranks seems almost ubiquitous. Richard Walton, the commander accused with Lambert of involvement in spying on the Stephen Lawrence campaign, retired just after the IPCC concluded he would have had a \u201ca case to answer for discreditable conduct\u201d, avoiding potential disciplinary proceedings. Did he shuffle off into obscurity? No. He authored a report by the dark-money junktank Policy Exchange, calling for stricter penalties for environmental protesters. His recommendations were adopted by the government and incorporated into the draconian 2022 Police Act. So while the spy cops face no consequences, peaceful protesters, on his recommendation, now receive massive prison sentences. We know this went all the way to the top. The SDS, for which the police spies worked, was funded by the Home Office, and fell under the supervision of several home secretaries. Despite being a victim of spying himself, Starmer, in his later role as director of public prosecutions, has been accused of presiding over a major cover-up of spy cop activities. To this day, the police refuse to release the files their spies compiled, like the Stasi, on the innocent people they deceived. It is hard to escape the conclusion that official life in this country is rotten to the core. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "The federal court has ordered the Environmental Defenders Office to pay $9m in costs to Santos after a failed legal challenge to the company\u2019s Barossa offshore gas project. The case, brought by the EDO on behalf of three Tiwi Island traditional owners, was dismissed in January when Justice Natalie Charlesworth delivered a scathing judgment that made adverse findings against the legal firm. On Thursday the court ordered the EDO to pay $9,042,093.05 to Santos on an indemnity basis, after lengthy costs proceedings throughout the year. Santos said the EDO had volunteered to pay the sum, which represented 100% of the legal costs it had incurred throughout the proceedings. The company said it had not sought costs from the Aboriginal and Tiwi Islander applicants but had sought information relating to the funding of the proceedings from the EDO and other third parties opposed to project, some of whom were involved in the \u201cStop Barossa Gas\u201d campaign. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The EDO\u2019s chief executive, David Morris, said: \u201cAfter careful consultation with our insurer and with deep consideration of the best interests of our clients, staff, and the organisation, EDO has agreed to resolve the claim. \u201cThroughout this matter, EDO has diligently adhered to client instructions. We have also treated the court\u2019s findings with the utmost seriousness.\u201d The traditional owners, led by Simon Munkara, a member of the Jikilaruwu clan, challenged the construction of an export pipeline from the Barossa field off the Northern Territory to the existing Bayu-Undan pipeline, which connects to Darwin. The proceedings were launched in late October 2023, shortly before Santos planned to start work on the pipeline. The case argued Santos had not properly assessed submerged cultural heritage and sought an injunction on the pipeline works until the company submitted a new environmental plan and it was assessed by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. In a judgment in January, Charlesworth made adverse findings against the EDO, ruling that one of its lawyers and a cultural heritage consultant had engaged in a form of \u201csubtle coaching\u201d in a meeting with Tiwi islanders. She also found that evidence from one expert witness involved \u201cconfection\u201d. Charlesworth found that evidence from witnesses for the three applicants asserting that the pipeline posed a risk to intangible underwater heritage, including Crocodile Man songlines and an area of significance for the rainbow serpent Ampiji, was not \u201cbroadly representative\u201d of the beliefs of Tiwi people who would be affected by the pipeline. The judge dismissed evidence provided in an expert report about potential impacts to underwater archaeological sites, finding there was a \u201cnegligible chance\u201d of a significant impact to tangible cultural heritage. In her judgment, Charlesworth found a cultural mapping exercise undertaken by an expert witness for the applicants and \u201cthe related opinions expressed about it are so lacking in integrity that no weight can be placed on them\u201d. Santos said on Thursday that the cultural mapping exercise had led to \u201can adapted account\u201d which was said to involve a \u201creinterpretation\u201d of traditional cultural beliefs \u201cthrough a Western scientific lens\u201d. The company said the judgment had also found the EDO \u201cwas an active participant in the \u2018Stop Barossa Gas\u2019 campaign\u201d. \u201cThe clear, advertised objective of the \u2018Stop Barossa Gas\u2019 campaign was to disrupt, delay and potentially shut down the Barossa gas project, thereby causing economic harm to the Barossa [joint venture] partners and to participants in the Darwin LNG JV,\u201d it said. Morris said the EDO \u201chas been providing crucial public interest legal services for nearly 40 years, with a formidable track-record of success for clients\u201d. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to provide public interest legal support to communities fighting to keep the climate safe, defend cultural heritage and protect the species and places they love,\u201d he said. \u201cOur role has never been more critical.\u201d The federal government sought a review of the EDO\u2019s funding arrangements this year after the court judgment in January. The review found the EDO had not breached the conditions of its $8.2m in federal funding.",

Hi! \u201cAnother sleepless night ahead of us. Its great being retired. I see Athers has questioned the wisdom of bringing three spinners on a tour to NZ and only one keeper.

Meanwhile since the loss that condemned them to a 2-1 series defeat in Pakistan last month England have gone from three spinners to one, given Ollie Pope the gloves and brought in a debutant of their own in No3 Jacob Bethell, veteran of 20 first-class games.

Kane Williamson\u2019s reaction It was challenging and we had to work hard to put some partnerships together. The ball did a little bit throughout, but as we know the wicket here is generally fair for ball and bat. The guys applied themselves really well. Both teams fought hard and got some rewards. It\u2019s pretty evenly poised after day one. It\u2019ll depend on how the surface changes throughout. It\u2019s nice to be back with the team. It was an incredible effort in India and a really proud moment. They played so bravely in conditions that are foreign to us. It was an amazing achievement. [On Shoaib Bashir] He bowled nicely, he got a bit of drop into the wind and he\u2019s a tall guy so he got some bounce too. He got some nice rewards. New Zealand and England rarely let us down. That was a really good day of Test cricket, at the end of which both sides will be happy enough. New Zealand were going well at 199 for 3, then badly at 252 for 7 and now it feels about even. Kane Williamson top-scored with a serene 93, while Shoaib Bashir took four of the eight wickets to fall for England. Nobody saw that coming. 82nd over: New Zealand 319-8 (Phillips 41, Southee 10) One last incident on what has been a pretty eventful day. Phillips has a furious drive at Atkinson and inside-edges the ball just short of Pope, who does well to stop the boundary as he dives to his left. 82nd over: New Zealand 318-8 (Phillips 40, Southee 10) Southee has his 93 Test sixes, which puts him sixth on the all-time list behind Stokes, McCullum, Gilchirst, Gayle and Kallis. He tries to deposit Woakes over square leg for No94 and is beaten. It was also a no-ball, England\u2019s 11th of the day. That\u2019s really unlike them. 81st over: New Zealand 317-8 (Phillips 40, Southee 10) Atkinson gets plenty of zip with the new ball. Phillips doubles up after being hit in the vicinity of you know where; Southee clunks drives just wide of the diving Stokes at mid-off. I think Stokes slipped slightly which cost him a yard. 80th over: New Zealand 312-8 (Phillips 40, Southee 6) Southee slugs Carse over midwicket for four to bring up the 300. It\u2019s the start of an expensive over from Carse, who still looks stiff as a board. A bumper flies over Pope for four byes, then Phillips pulls confidently on front of square for four more. A poor end to an otherwise excellent day\u2019s work from Carse. Now, with about 12 minutes remaining, England are going to take the second new ball. 79th over: New Zealand 299-8 (Phillips 36, Southee 1) A big cheer for the incoming Tim Southee, who will retire after this series unless New Zealand reach the WTC final. So much for Bashir being tired: he\u2019s changed ends and taken his fourth wicket! Henry tried to go down the ground but dragged the ball straight to long on to give Duckett a simple catch. 78th over: New Zealand 297-7 (Phillips 35, Henry 18) Brydon Carse replaces Bashir, who was starting to tire after a surprisingly full day\u2019s work. Carse looks really stiff, with his pace down below 85mph, but it\u2019s an accurate over that stalls New Zealand\u2019s charge. 77th over: New Zealand 296-7 (Phillips 35, Henry 18) Phillips is not out! He tried a forcing shot outside off stump but didn\u2019t make contact. England are down to their last review. England review for caught behind against Phillips! Phillips hits successive boundaries off Stokes, then survives a big shout for caught behind. England are going upstairs, though Phillips looked pretty relaxed about the whole thing. This is quietly a pretty big moment. 76th over: New Zealand 288-7 (Phillips 27, Henry 18) This partnership is becoming irksome for England, not just the runs but the speed of scoring. They\u2019ve added 36 in 6.3 overs, a platform from which to go after the second new ball if England take it tonight. 75th over: New Zealand 283-7 (Phillips 23, Henry 17) Henry, who is batting superbly, drives Stokes through extra cover for three more. I shouldn\u2019t sound so surprised after how well he\u2019s playing; he has four Test fifties, three of them in Christchurch. An affronted Stokes hits him on the shoulder with a pretty good short ball. 74th over: New Zealand 278-7 (Phillips 21, Henry 14) A stinker of a long hop from Bashir is hoicked into the crowd by Phillips. That\u2019s the first six of the match. Useful runs, there, and New Zealand still have the six-hitting fiend Tim Southee to come. 73rd over: New Zealand 267-7 (Phillips 11, Henry 13) Henry moves into double figures with a classy back-foot drive off Stokes. He\u2019s playing his shots, which I guess is a win-win. If he scores runs, great; if he gets out there\u2019s a fair chance he\u2019ll crack at England\u2019s openers tonight. Stokes\u2019 over ends with a big LBW appeal that is turned down by Ahsan Raza. England have two reviews left but he decides not to risk one. It would have been umpire\u2019s call. 72nd over: New Zealand 261-7 (Phillips 11, Henry 7) Henry chips Bashir nicely down the ground for a one-bounce four. This has been a stirring comeback from England, who were in bother when New Zealand reached 199 for 3 shortly after tea. They have certainly improved as the day has progressed, even if they\u2019re still a fair way from their best. 71st over: New Zealand 255-7 (Phillips 10, Henry 2) Phillips pushes at a short ball from Stokes and is given out caught down the leg side. He reviews straight away, which is the sign of either an innocent or deluded man. In Phillips\u2019 case it\u2019s the former; there\u2019s nothing on HotSpot and the decision is overturned. 70th over: New Zealand 253-7 (Phillips 9, Henry 1) Bashir\u2019s first wicket came from a full toss; the second and third have been down to the extra bounce that he gets. Shoaib Bashir\u2019s fine day continues. Smith turns him round the corner towards leg gully, where Joe Root crouches to take a lovely sharp catch. Cricket is a peculiar old game. England put New Zealand into bat in seamer-friendly conditions, and their leading wicket-taker is the spinner. 69th over: New Zealand 252-6 (Phillips 9, Smith 3) Stokes takes over from Atkinson, who might have one last burst with the second new ball depending on England\u2019s over-rate. A quiet over, just a single from it. Drinks It will frustrate New Zealand that five of their top six got starts, with only Kane Williamson going on to reach fifty. England will hope to be more ruthless when the time comes. 68th over: New Zealand 251-6 (Phillips 9, Smith 3) Smith gets his first Test runs, two of the buggers, with a nice back-foot drive off Bashir. A single off the last ball means he\u2019ll keep strike. It\u2019s really well poised, this. Tests between England and New Zealand often are. 67th over: New Zealand 247-6 (Phillips 8, Smith 0) 66th over: New Zealand 246-6 (Phillips 7, Smith 0) The new batter is the debutant Nathan Smith, who has a first-class hundred to his name. Bashir has been a big plus for England: his figures are 14-1-40-2. It was important for him to start the tour well, too, after a disappointing series in Pakistan. A second wicket for Shoaib Bashir! Blundell skids back to drive but is undone by the extra bounce and slices to Atkinson at backward point. 65th over: New Zealand 245-5 (Blundell 17, Phillips 6) Blundell pulls Atkinson for four with a touch of swagger. He\u2019s beaten later in the over, pushing at a good delivery that snaps off the seam, before Atkinson bowls his seventh over of the day. Apart from the no-balls his last two spells have been much better. 64th over: New Zealand 240-5 (Blundell 13, Phillips 6) Bashir tosses one up to Phillips, who accepts the invitation and blasts a drive over cover for four. The fielder, possibly Bethell, leapt with intent but needed a telescopic arm to have any chance of catching it. As they are outlawed by the ICC, the ball ran away to the boundary. 63rd over: New Zealand 236-5 (Blundell 13, Phillips 2) I\u2019d love to see a breakdown of Atkinson\u2019s Test wickets \u2013 not just the method of dismissal but also the manner. It feels like he has a greater variety of wickets than the majority of bowlers, which is a fine trait to have. As is the ability to play positively even when your form is abysmal. Tom Blundell, who has looked to score right from ball one, gets his first boundary with an excellent square drive. 62nd over: New Zealand 230-5 (Blundell 7, Phillips 2) Phillips is beaten, trying to cut a ball from Bashir that grips and bounces. This is a chance for England, though it\u2019s worth stressing that New Zealand have a very short tail. In short, nobody knows anything. 61st over: New Zealand 228-5 (Blundell 6, Phillips 1) I\u2019d have to double check but I think that\u2019s the first time Williamson has fallen in the nineties in a Test match since Sunday 16 December 2018 against Sri Lanka. Atkinson almost gets his third wicket when Phillips is dropped on 0 by Stokes! He smashed a full ball towards mid-off, where Stokes swooped to his left but couldn\u2019t hold on. It was a really tough chance, even for Stokes. Kane Williamson, the man who never gets nervous in the nineties, has fallen for 93. He tried to cut the new bowler Atkinson but was cramped for room and slapped it straight to Crawley at backward point. A huge wicket for England. 60th over: New Zealand 227-4 (Williamson 93, Blundell 6) The world would be a much better place if we all had Kane Williamson\u2019s boredome threshold. He\u2019s faced almost 200 balls and his tempo hasn\u2019t changed one bit. Right, Shoaib Bashir is back on for Woakes, whose overseas bowling average (sorry) has sneaked up to 53.44. I doubt he or we will ever fully understand why such a skilful, indefatigable bowler struggled quite so much outside England. Blundell is keen to get after Bashir and dances down the pitch twice, though on each occasion he is only able to knock the ball back to the bowler. 59th over: New Zealand 226-4 (Williamson 92, Blundell 6) Duckett hurts his finger while fielding a hook from Blundell, though there doesn\u2019t appear to be any serious damage. Jacob Bethell is high enough at No3, thank you. Carse almost strikes again when a back-foot defensive from Blundell got into the ground and bounces over the stumps. He had no idea where the ball was. His frustration is compounded when the last ball of the over scoots away for four leg-byes. 58th over: New Zealand 217-4 (Williamson 90, Blundell 4) Blundell is beaten by a lovely delivery from Woakes that gives the off stump an air kiss. After that he takes a single, allowing Williamson to defend the rest of the over with soul-crushing certainty. 57th over: New Zealand 216-4 (Williamson 90, Blundell 3) Williamson is squared up by a good delivery from Carse, who then clonks him on the helmet later in the over. Williamson was too early on a pull shot and was hit flush on the noggin. There\u2019s a break in play for a concussion test but he\u2019s fine. When play resumes, Carse hits Williamson on or close to the elbow with a nasty nipbacker. Terrific bowling. He has troubled Williamson much more than anyone else today. Carse, like Mikey, is the big winner of the England bowling attack. And if anyone has any humble pie I\u2019ll take a slice; until about six weeks ago I couldn\u2019t see why England were so keen on him. This is Kane Williamson\u2019s run of scores in home Tests in the last four years: 251, 129, 21, 238, 6, 0, 4, 132, 1, 121*, 215, 118, 109, 43, 133*, 0, 9, 17, 51, 90*. That adds up to 1688 runs at an average of 99.29. Sub-Bradman. 56th over: New Zealand 215-4 (Williamson 90, Blundell 2) Williamson flicks Woakes fine for four to move into the nineties. The longer he bats, the more you wonder whether England will consider Matthew Potts as a Williamson specialist for the rest of the series. Even allowing for the small sample size, his record against Williamson in Test cricket is remarkable: 32 balls, 3 runs, 3 wickets. It\u2019s hard to know what to make of Woakes. He\u2019s been unlucky at times, loose at others, and his figures are all too familiar in overseas Tests: 14-4-52-0. 55th over: New Zealand 211-4 (Williamson 86, Blundell 2) Blundell works Carse off the hip to get off the mark. He batted really well against England 18 months ago but has struggled since, with 296 runs at an average of 14. Given his form England might be better off bowling normally to him while still bouncing Williamson. 54th over: New Zealand 207-4 (Williamson 84, Blundell 0) Williamson pushes defensively at Woakes and edges just short of Root at first slip; as Shane Bond says on commentary, \u201csoft hands saved him\u201d. Four leg-byes earlier in the over had taken New Zealand past 200, and Williamson gets four more with a back cut later in the over. This has been a bit of an odd day. It feels like England have been well below par yet another quick wicket would probably put them on top. 53rd over: New Zealand 199-4 (Williamson 80, Blundell 0) New Zealand bat very deep, with Glenn Phillips at No7 and Tim Southee at No10, though there\u2019s still plenty of work for England to do. England\u2019s short-ball tactic has worked! Daryl Mitchell tries to swivel-pull Brydon Carse and contrives to top-edge a simple catch to Brook on the third man boundary. That\u2019s a bonus wicket for England \u2013 but also a deserved reward for Carse, who has again been England\u2019s best bowler. They might have found one here you know. 52nd over: New Zealand 197-3 (Williamson 79, Mitchell 18) It\u2019s so windy that even the heavy bails are occasionally being blown off. When play resumes, Mitchell takes Woakes off middle stump with a thick inside edge, without which he\u2019d have been plumb LBW. That\u2019s the first of three singles in an otherwise comfortable over. The ball is doing nothing for the seamers now. The players are back on the field and Chris Woakes is about to return to the attack. \u201cThere\u2019s a short straw somewhere\u2026\u201d says David Gower on commentary. A bit of 2.40am reading 51st over: New Zealand 193-3 (Williamson 77, Mitchell 16) Stokes decides to explore the middle of the pitch in the last over before tea, with the field set accordingly. Williamson and Mitchell play it comfortably enough, collecting three singles, but we\u2019ll probably see more of this from England after tea. They\u2019ve had a poor day so far and that was certainly New Zealand\u2019s session. They scored 89 in 27 overs for the loss of Rachin Ravindra, who did something unthinkable with a Shoaib Bashir full toss. Kane Williamson, who has played with increasing authority on his return to the side, needs 23 more for his 33rd Test century. We\u2019ll have a long evening session, two and a half hours, and New Zealand will have the chance to punish a tiring attack. This is the first day of the series, sure, but it\u2019s never too early for a Big Last Session. 50th over: New Zealand 190-3 (Williamson 75, Mitchell 15) Ben Stokes gives Jacob Bethell an over before tea. He\u2019s an occasional left-arm spinner, more suited to white-ball cricket at this juncture, and he starts with a nervous loosener that Williamson puts away for four. The rest of the over is fine. 49th over: New Zealand 185-3 (Williamson 70, Mitchell 15) Williamson\u2019s eyes widen when a ball from Stokes hits higher on the bat than he anticipated. The pitch is essentially very good, and those in the know expect it to get better tomorrow, but there have been one or two hints of uneven bounce. 48th over: New Zealand 184-3 (Williamson 69, Mitchell 15) Bashir tries his luck around the wicket to Williamson. England have been a bit impatient, particularly in the morning session when the pitch didn\u2019t do as much as they expected. 47th over: New Zealand 182-3 (Williamson 68, Mitchell 14) A bouncer from Stokes to Mitchell trampolines down the leg side for five wides. Pope had no chance of stopping that. Williamson punches confidently off the back foot for three to bring up the fifty partnership in only 62 balls. England are in a peedie bit of bother here. 46th over: New Zealand 172-3 (Williamson 65, Mitchell 12) Beautiful bowling from Bashir, who beats Williamson with a slower, wider delivery. Pope whips the bails off but Williamson, despite overbalancing, manages to drag his back foot behind the line. The square-leg umpire goes upstairs just to make sure. 45th over: New Zealand 171-3 (Williamson 65, Mitchell 11) Stokes jags one back to hit Williamson on the pad. Too high but this is a threatening start from Stokes, who has changed ends and has the wind behind him. Just under half an hour until tea. As things stand it\u2019s New Zealand\u2019s session. 44th over: New Zealand 170-3 (Williamson 65, Mitchell 10) Williamson has a bit of fortune, dragging a slog-sweep past leg stump off Bashir. In the circumstances Bashir is bowling pretty well; England would certainly have taken figures of 8-1-29-1 before tea on the first day. The problem has been the lack of consistency from the seamers. 43rd over: New Zealand 166-3 (Williamson 62, Mitchell 9) Ben Stokes replaces Atkinson, who bowled a mixed spell of 4-1-7-0, and draws a late inside-edge from Williamson with a very good delivery. England\u2019s cordon were about to go up for what would have been a plumb LBW. Stokes pointedly chases after every defensive stroke from Williamson, trying to lift England\u2019s intensity, and is so keen to impose himself on the game that he gives away two overthrows. Those runs aside it was an excellent over. 42nd over: New Zealand 163-3 (Williamson 59, Mitchell 9) Williamson drives Bashir\u2019s last ball down the ground to complete a quiet over. He looks comfortable against Bashir, if slightly wary because of the wind as much as anything. 41st over: New Zealand 161-3 (Williamson 58, Mitchell 8) A terrific lifter from Atkinson jags back to hit Williamson high on the bat, though it turns out it was a no-ball. That\u2019s his fifth, another symbol of England\u2019s disappointing performance, and there\u2019s another later in the over. Before today Atkinson had only bowled seven no-balls in eight Tests. 40th over: New Zealand 157-3 (Williamson 57, Mitchell 7) New Zealand\u2019s only left-handers have all been and gone, which isn\u2019t ideal for Bashir, but England need a spell from him while their seamers recharge. Four from the over. 39th over: New Zealand 153-3 (Williamson 54, Mitchell 6) Kane Williamson averages 66 in this decade, which puts him behind only Kusal Mendis among those with at least 1000 runs. He grits his way through a good maiden over from Atkinson and is hit in the stomach when he misses an attempted pull. Thanks Simon, morning everyone. New Zealand are scoring at more than four an over after being put in, a reflection of a scruffy performance from England but also New Zealand\u2019s confidence and purpose with the bat. They were similarly aggressive \u2013 in much tougher conditions \u2013 during that glorious victory in India. And this time they have Kane Williamson to anchor the whole thing. 38th over: New Zealand 153-3 (Williamson 54, Mitchell 6) A slightly dodgy single, to which neither batter fully commits until they\u2019re already halfway through it, leads to what David Gower describes, not inaccurately, as \u201ca moment of near-excitement\u201d. Then Williamson pulls, hard, straight into the top of the helmet of Joe Root at short leg. For some reason there\u2019s no concussion test after that one either, but one ball later it is indeed drinks. At which point I\u2019ll hand over to Rob Smyth. Bye! 37th over: New Zealand 149-3 (Williamson 52, Mitchell 4) New Zealand scored 12 runs in the 34th over, but have added just three in three since then. Some refreshing drinks would seem to be in order, and are now imminent. 36th over: New Zealand 148-3 (Williamson 52, Mitchell 3) Better from Bashir, and this one\u2019s a maiden. And it ends with a bit of a ripper, that Williamson really isn\u2019t sure what to do with and thus doesn\u2019t really do anything with. 35th over: New Zealand 148-3 (Williamson 52, Mitchell 3) Atkinson seems to be finding it a bit of a grind at present. He grinds his way through another over, with a bonus delivery because of a no-ball, and despite an extremely optimistic review with no real reward. The ball was not at all close to the bat at any stage. A pretty half-hearted appeal for a catch off Williamson, but Stokes decides to check it! 34th over: New Zealand 146-3 (Williamson 51, Mitchell 3) Bashir drags one down the leg side and Williamson punishes it for four, then the bowler almost exactly repeats it next ball, with identical results. That takes Williamson to 50, off precisely 90 balls. 33rd over: New Zealand 134-3 (Williamson 40, Mitchell 2) There\u2019s suddenly a strong wind blowing across the Hagley Oval, which keeps blowing the bails off the stumps, and the resulting aborted run-ups extend Carse\u2019s over a bit. 32nd over: New Zealand 131-3 (Williamson 38, Mitchell 1) Some intel from the venue! \u201cA rather somnolent and subdued atmosphere here in the ground - a bit like a Sunday afternoon county game,\u201d writes Showbizguru. \u201cEven the Barmy Army trumpeter is struggling to raise any interest. Strange that both skippers would have bowled first on this green top. A couple of quick wickets are required [one since delivered]. On the plus side there\u2019s great grub on offer. A ribeye steak with melted cheese in a ciabatta or a full wood-fired pizza. Just under a tenner each.\u201d The post-lunch lull, everyone too full of steak ciabatta to make much noise. A breakthrough! Ravindra attacks Bashir, dancing down the pitch to turn the delivery into a full toss, but then biffs it straight to midwicket! 31st over: New Zealand 130-2 (Williamson 38, Ravindra 34) Well Williamson times this well enough, swatting Carse past mid-on for four, and then follows it with a straight drive for four more, and if those are his only two shots of the over, they\u2019ll do. 30th over: New Zealand 122-2 (Williamson 30, Ravindra 34) England toss the ball to Shoaib Bashir, and try to see if their spinner can have a bit more luck than their seamers. Not yet. 29th over: New Zealand 120-2 (Williamson 29, Ravindra 33) Woakes bowls to Williamson, who seems to have temporarily misplaced his timing. Maiden. 28th over: New Zealand 120-2 (Williamson 29, Ravindra 33) Carse\u2019s delivery flicks Williamson\u2019s gloves and deflects into his helmet, but apparently not hard enough to require a concussion test. The only partnership in New Zealand\u2019s entire Test history that has had as many as eight innings and outperformed this one is Nathan Astle and Mark Richardson, who averaged 74.11 in nine innings, the last of them a shade over a decade ago. 27th over: New Zealand 119-2 (Williamson 28, Ravindra 33) Woakes to Ravindra, who cuts past point for four. The Ravindra-Williamson partnership, currently in action for the eighth time, averages 68.42 in Tests, which is pretty handy, and that shot takes this one past 50. 26th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Williamson 28, Ravindra 29) Brydon Carse ends his over with a cracker to Williamson, who is beaten by the away movement. England haven\u2019t really had the rub of the (very) green (pitch). 25th over: New Zealand 112-2 (Williamson 26, Ravindra 29) The first ball after lunch raps Ravindra on the pad, to much chuntering from the cordon, but it was heading down leg, and possibly flicked the bat on its way through. From there there are a few fine shots, culminating with a tasty four wide of mid-on. And with those runs Ravindra overtakes Williamson, despite facing 36 balls to his teammate\u2019s 57. The players emerge from their dressing-room-based mealtime, and more cricket is about to happen. Brace, brace, brace, etc. \u201cJust to check,\u201d writes Tom Hopkins, \u201cis overlooking a caught behind something that proper wicketkeepers tend to do?\u201d I think it generally is more the kind of thing improper wicketkeepers get up to, but hey, nobody\u2019s perfect. Meanwhile in Guyana, Hampshire are playing Rangpur Riders in the Global Super League, with Shan Masood and James Fuller at the crease. Action here if you need something to see you through the lunch break. And that is luncheon. New Zealand will be pretty pleased with that, while in England\u2019s dressing room they\u2019ll be turning off all the TVs, awkwardly avoiding the captain\u2019s gaze, and pretending nothing interesting just happened. 24th over: New Zealand 104-2 (Williamson 26, Ravindra 21) Stokes bowls, Ravindra edges through to the keeper, and \u2026 nobody notices! Not a whisper from England. Nothing. Ooooh!, says Ollie Pope, before tossing the ball to Joe Root. Stokes just turns around and marches back to his mark. Scenes! 23rd over: New Zealand 103-2 (Williamson 26, Ravindra 20) Woakes is back for an over or two before lunch. Three runs off it. 22nd over: New Zealand 100-2 (Williamson 26, Ravindra 17) Stokes falls over in his follow-through, those slippy, dusty footholes wreaking havoc again, and to add insult to inconvenience it\u2019s a wide and he has to bowl it again. He gets it right second time, beating Williamson\u2019s outside edge, but that\u2019s followed by a cover drive and then a pull, both for four, and Stokes has his head in his hands. 10 off the over, and New Zealand are in triple figures. 21st over: New Zealand 90-2 (Williamson 18, Ravindra 16) Edged, and short again! Ravindra pokes at Atkinson\u2019s first ball but it plops just short of Root at first slip, but then the second ball is much less good and the result much less good also, Ravindra pulling for four. 20th over: New Zealand 83-2 (Williamson 18, Ravindra 9) Ben Stokes has a bowl, and when he bowls one short Williamson produces the shot of the day so far, pulling dismissively for four. 19th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Williamson 13, Ravindra 6) Atkinson keeps plugging away. England keep threatening, but they haven\u2019t got the rewards they would have wanted at this point, having seen the pitch and won the toss. Meanwhile I\u2019ve got some bad news for Leo Walmsley \u2013 as Ali reminds me from the ground, there\u2019s no TMS, with TalkSport hogging the rights for this tour. You could try here. 18th over: New Zealand 72-2 (Williamson 12, Ravindra 5) Another cracking delivery, this time from Carse to Williamson, but again the batter gets nothing on it. Meanwhile Leo Walmsley would like the overseas TMS link if anyone\u2019s got it to hand? 17th over: New Zealand 71-2 (Williamson 12, Ravindra 5) Phwoar, that is a peach of a delivery from Atkinson, but it rises just past Ravindra\u2019s outside edge. Then Ravindra has a swing at a short one and misses, and there\u2019s some discussion behind the stumps over whether he might have got a little something on it. But he didn\u2019t get anywhere near it, and England wisely choose not to review. 16th over: New Zealand 71-2 (Williamson 12, Ravindra 5) Ravindra already looking pretty decent, and England starting to settle down for a bit of a grind. 15th over: New Zealand 68-2 (Williamson 12, Ravindra 2) Atkinson comes back. So far today a few players have found the pitch a bit skiddy, just where the bowlers\u2019 feet are landing in their delivery stride, but the outfield hasn\u2019t been skiddy enough, which is why there have been only six boundaries, all scored by Latham. 14th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Williamson 8) England make the breakthrough with (deep breath) the last ball of the first over of the second hour of the first day! Nips off the seam, kisses the outside edge, gives Pope an easy catch behind the stumps, very nicely bowled. A couple of balls earlier there\u2019d been loud shout as Carse slammed one into Latham\u2019s front pad, but it looked a bit high and England didn\u2019t think it was worth a review. Plus it pitched outside the line of leg stump, so there\u2019s that. 13th over: New Zealand 58-1 (Latham 44, Williamson 7) And that is DRINKS. An excellent first hour for New Zealand, with just the one wicket down and Tom Latham rattling along at a fair old pace \u2013 44 now off 49 and a strike rate of 89.79. 12th over: New Zealand 49-1 (Latham 39, Williamson 4) Carse starts out over the wicket to Latham, who pushes at it as it angles across him but again no edge. Then an inside edge clears the stumps and runs away for a single. 11th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Latham 36, Williamson 1) Woakes is bowling excellently, though this is a quiet over rather than a dangerous one \u2013 he\u2019s going at 2.66 an over, with all three of the day\u2019s maidens, Atkinson 5.25, Carse 6.00. 10th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Latham 36, Williamson 1) Brydon Carse replaces Atkinson, and Kane Williamson scores a single off his 14th delivery. Then Latham edges well wide of the slips and that\u2019s another boundary. 9th over: New Zealand 37-1 (Latham 32, Williamson 0) Gorgeous delivery from Woakes, moving quite sharply off the seam, and somehow Latham doesn\u2019t get any bat on it! He gets plenty of bat on the next mind, middling it through mid-off for four. 8th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Latham 28, Williamson 0) Another no ball from Atkinson, another boundary for Latham. \u201cHi there,\u201d writes Dean Kinsella. Hi! \u201cAnother sleepless night ahead of us. Its great being retired. I see Athers has questioned the wisdom of bringing three spinners on a tour to NZ and only one keeper. The upshot of which is that Pope is picked at 6 and gets the gauntlets. My feeling is he was pretty close to being dropped. Is he going to be the latest batter/keeper who keeps his place even with poor form?\u201d That\u2019s down to Bethell, I think. If another batter gets a chance and makes an unarguable claim for inclusion in the side, and with Jamie Smith certain to come back in at the start of the summer, then Pope\u2019s grip on a place becomes extremely uncertain. 7th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Latham 21, Williamson 0) Edged! But it doesn\u2019t carry to Ben Duckett at fourth slip, and Williamson gets away with it. And again! This one lands even shorter. A maiden from Woakes, who hasn\u2019t had much luck so far. 6th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Latham 21, Williamson 0) Since Conway\u2019s wicket Latham has faced 21 deliveries, and Kane Williamson has faced just three. He faces all six of these, sending the first of them rattling through mid-off for four. 5th over: New Zealand 19-1 (Latham 15, Williamson 0) It\u2019s all going on here. Latham leaves Woakes\u2019 second delivery, which bounces just over the top of the stumps. Then he works one to fine leg for four, and hits the next to Bashir, who gathers and sends a bizarre throw nowhere near Ollie Pope or indeed any of the four members of the cordon and away for four overthrows! Then the last shapes away, just beating the edge. 4th over: New Zealand 8-1 (Latham 4, Williamson 0) Apparently, the commentary team tells me, this pitch is not as green, as dark or indeed as lush as it often is here, so perhaps my description a short while ago was a little overblown. Looks plenty green to me, though. 3rd over: New Zealand 5-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 0) Four leaves and then two not-leaves from Latham, the last of which gets him off the mark. 2nd over: New Zealand 4-1 (Latham 0) Gus Atkinson shares new ball duties. There are a couple of no balls but alongside those he tempts Devon Conway into having a bit of a push at one he should have left well alone, but he doesn\u2019t get bat on ball, and then Conway mistimes a drive off the last, his bat slips in his hands as the ball hits it and it goes back whence it came, into Atkinson\u2019s mitts. Last ball of the over, and Conway prods it back towards Atkinson, who reacts well to grab it as it flies to the left of his left shin! 1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Latham 0, Conway 0) Just as the first ball is bowled, the big bongs of (arguably) major breaking news chime as the following lands from ECB HQ. Looks like Ollie Robinson\u2019s new passport has been delivered: Durham\u2019s Ollie Robinson added to England Men\u2019s Test Squad Durham wicketkeeper-batter Ollie Robinson has been added to the England Men\u2019s Test squad for the tour of New Zealand. Robinson replaces Essex\u2019s Jordan Cox, who sustained a fractured right thumb during the team\u2019s warm-up period last weekend in Queenstown. This marks the 25-year-old Robinson\u2019s first call-up to the senior England squad. He has delivered solid performances for Durham in the County Championship, boasting an average of 48 with the bat in 2024 and an impressive 58 in 2023. Robinson has also demonstrated his skill behind the stumps, with 92 Championship dismissals across the past two seasons. A regular in England Lions squads since 2019, Robinson has gained valuable experience on tours to Australia, Sri Lanka, and India in recent years. Robinson is expected to join the squad in New Zealand on Saturday. Right, anthems sung, players out. Chris Woakes has the ball. Cricket imminent. \u201cWhy is Bashir playing instead of Leach?\u201d harrumphs Paul McIntyre. Well, because he\u2019s England\u2019s first-choice spinner in all conditions, as Ben Stokes put it in Pakistan last month. Meanwhile I\u2019ve just had my first ever tacle and it was extremely nice, though I\u2019m not convince we need any more similarly-flavoured orange citrus fruits. Enough already! We\u2019ve had our first look at the Test match pitch, and it is greener than a jealous, queasy tree frog. So the debutants can chill out for a while: Jacob Bethell is unlikely to be batting this morning, and Nathan Smith is unlikely to bowl. Meanwhile, an email! \u201cI loved the idea of Moneyball and using recognised but under appreciated metrics of genuine impact, but also love the adrenaline-fuelled gut-feeling selection policy of Bazball,\u201d says Tom van de Gucht. \u201cBut rather than, as Harry Hill would say, \u2018Which one is better, there\u2019s only one way to find out, Fiiiiigghghhhht!\u2019 I\u2019d genuinely love to know how much the data crunching has progressed and is still going on behind the scenes. \u201cThere must be so much more intel on all biomechanical data, yet Stokes and McCullum seem to be going back to the style of the talent scouts Billy Beane fought against, who used selection criteria such as how symmetrical the player\u2019s face was and if they looked good when running. Unless it\u2019s all a smokescreen and their selections are massively data driven, but they\u2019d prefer to sell their laid back image to pull opponents onto a false sense of security.\u201d In short, and to summarise, you don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on. Ben Stokes has won the toss for England and has chosen to have a bowl. Right then, the British TV coverage has started and a coin toss should be incoming. Ali\u2019s been a busy little bee, there not being much else to do in New Zealand except write about cricket, and here\u2019s his bit on a reenergised and refocused Ben Stokes: Come rain or shine, New Zealand cricketers tend to wear a smile on their faces. But this week there is a palpable glow around the place, that remarkable clean sweep in India, coupled with victory for the women\u2019s team in the T20 World Cup, still fresh in the memory. Hagley Oval is sold out for the first Test against England, folks drawn to its inviting grass banks. English cricket has felt a little less cheery by contrast, be it their women\u2019s team flunking that latest shot at a global title, the continuing culture war as the sale of the Hundred teams gathers pace, or the men\u2019s Test side having lost in Pakistan to reopen the debate about the merits of so-called Bazball. Ben Stokes seemed to embody the mood in Pakistan, his return from a hamstring injury resulting in what he calls one of his toughest trips. A burglary back at home added to the stress levels and nearly forced an early flight back, only for his wife, Clare, to persuade him otherwise. But before the first Test that gets under way on Thursday (10pm on Wednesday in the UK), Stokes appeared refreshed and re-energised. Much more here: Here\u2019s a memorable quote from Warwickshire\u2019s Olly Hannon-Dalby about Jacob Bethell: He\u2019s just one of those guys. A cool cat, quietly confident, funny but also seriously hungry and hard-working. He\u2019s made two international debuts already, just bagged an IPL deal and he is about to play Test cricket. He\u2019ll probably end up marrying a Bond girl. And here\u2019s Ali Martin\u2019s profile of Bethell, which handily is the article the quote came from: If you\u2019re only as good as your last game, New Zealand are phenomenal and England concerning. But Christchurch is not Rawalpindi and nor is it Mumbai, and at the risk of stating the obvious these will be different teams in a different situation. Since they wrapped up a 3-0 series win at the Wankhede at the start of the month New Zealand have left out Will Young, who scored 244 at 48.80 in India and was named player of the series, and Ajaz Patel, who took 15 wickets in those three games, bringing back old-timers Tim Southee and Kane Williamson as well as a debutant seamer in Nathan Smith. Meanwhile since the loss that condemned them to a 2-1 series defeat in Pakistan last month England have gone from three spinners to one, given Ollie Pope the gloves and brought in a debutant of their own in No3 Jacob Bethell, veteran of 20 first-class games. If this isn\u2019t quite a clean slate it is at least a slate that requires only minor washing up. There seems to have been a lot of interesting Test cricket happening over the last couple of months, and I\u2019m looking forward to a bit more. Welcome! Since we already know the teams, this might be a good place to put them: New Zealand XI: Tom Latham (capt), Devon Conway, Kane Williamson, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell (wk), Glenn Phillips, Nathan Smith, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Will O\u2019Rourke. England XI: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ollie Pope (wk), Ben Stokes (c), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, Shoaib Bashir. Umpires: Ahsan Raza (Pak) and Rod Tucker (Aus). TV umpire: Adrian Holdstock (SA).",

At a press conference, Laila Soueif and her two daughters Sanaa and Mona said they felt listened to by Lammy but that he had made no concrete promises and they wished the meeting had happened months ago. \u201cHe listened to me, I hope my message got through. My main message was that I\u2019m on hunger strike, I\u2019m not about to break my hunger strike until Alaa is released,\u201d Soueif, who has lost 16kg (35lbs) since starting her strike, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lucky break by the fact that my body has been so resilient and my body has not collapsed.\u201d To date, Abd el-Fattah has yet to have a visit from the British consulate. \u201cThings like consular access can be pushed on a ministerial level and I still want to see progress on that,\u201d said Soueif, adding that it would \u201cmake a lot of difference\u201d for her son\u2019s morale. Sebastien Lai, the son of detained media mogul and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai, was in the room for Lammy\u2019s first committee hearing as foreign secretary. His father, whose trial resumed last week after repeated delays, has been in a Hong Kong jail cell for almost four years. He is being held in solitary confinement and faces a life sentence if convicted. Asked about Canada, the US and Australia getting several of their detained citizens out of China in recent years, Lammy said the UK had been held back by the \u201clack of engagement\u201d with Beijing under the Conservatives. Lai\u2019s supporters have said the UK government\u2019s support for him has been \u201cridiculously\u201d lacking compared with the US, Canada and Australia, which have lobbied for him. Keir Starmer raised Lai\u2019s case at his bilateral meeting with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, on the margins of the G20 summit in Brazil earlier this month.",

      "body": "<p>Abandonment, when it came, crept in from the outskirts. Homes at the edge of town were first to go, then the peripheral grocery stores. It moved inward, slow but inexorable. The petrol station closed, and creeper vines climbed the pumps, amassing on the roof until it buckled under the strain. It swallowed the outer bus shelters, the pharmacies, the cinema, the cafe. The school shut down.</p> <p>Today, one of the last institutions sustaining human occupation in Tyurkmen, a village in central Bulgaria, is the post office. Dimitrinka Dimcheva, a 56-year-old post officer, still keeps it open two days a week, bringing in packages of goods that local shops no longer exist to sell. Once a thriving town of more than 1,200, Tyurkmen is now home to fewer than 200 people.</p> <p>On a warm spring afternoon, Dimcheva stood in the town square. \u201cThe weddings took place here, all of the folk dances, the volleyball. There were lots of young people. A pool,\u201d she said. She gazed around, pointing to ruins or now-empty spaces where buildings once stood, remembering. There, the building that housed a small cinema. Behind it, the space for a school that burned down, was rebuilt, then closed. \u201cLife was bubbling.\u201d Now, she said, \u201clife in the villages is dying\u201d.</p> <p>Thousands of similar villages are scattered across Bulgaria. After the fall of communism, people flocked to the cities in search of work, and over the next 30 years many villages emptied to the point of obliteration. As of the 2021 census, almost 300 villages were completely abandoned, and more than 1,000 had populations below 30 \u2013 most of them very elderly. With its low birthrates and high rates of emigration, Bulgaria has been emptying out for decades. Its population has dropped from close to 9 million in 1989, to fewer than <a href=\"https://eurydice.eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-education-systems/bulgaria/population-demographic-situation-languages-and-religions\">6.5 million</a> \u2013 one of the worst peacetime <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290752133_Bulgaria's_population_implosion\">population declines</a> in modern history.</p> <p>Bulgaria lies at the extreme end of this kind of demographic change, but the forces reshaping it are acting everywhere. Over the past half century, the global portion of people living in rural areas has decreased by almost a third. Farming is becoming increasingly industrial and concentrated. More than <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2023/goal-11/#:~:text=The%20world's%20population%20reached%208,exacerbating%20inequalities%20and%20urban%20poverty.\">half of all people</a> now live in and around cities, and that figure is expected to rise to 70% by 2050. In many countries, birthrates are dropping steadily, and while the global population is projected to keep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/11/global-population-predictions-offer-hopeful-sign-for-planet-un-says?CMP=share_btn_url\">growing until 2080</a>, around half of that growth is being driven by fewer <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf\">than 10 countries</a>.</p> <p>As populations move and shrink, people are leaving long-occupied places behind. Often they leave everything in place, ready for a return that never comes. In Tyurkmen, Christmas baubles still hang from the curtain rails in empty houses, slowly being wrapped by spiders. In one abandoned home, a porcelain cabinet lay inside a crater of rotted floorboards, plates still stacked above a spare packet of nappies for a visiting grandchild. Occasionally, abandonment happens all at once, when a legal ruling or evacuation sends people scuttling. But mostly, it is haphazard, creeping, unplanned. People just go.</p> <p>Since the 1950s, some scholars <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf1099\">estimate up to 400m hectares</a> \u2013 an area close to the size of the European Union \u2013 of abandoned land have accumulated across the world. A team of scientists <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad2d12\">recently calculated</a> that roughly 30m hectares of farmland had been abandoned across the mainland US since the 1980s. As the climate crisis renders more places unliveable \u2013 too threatened by flooding, water shortages and wildfires to build houses, soil too degraded and drought-stripped to farm \u2013 we can expect further displacements.</p>    <p>This world-altering shift has drawn remarkably little attention. \u201cIt has been there all the time \u2013 but we did not really describe it,\u201d says Prof He Yin of Kent State University, one of the scientists now using remote sensing to create global maps of abandoned land. \u201cWe talk about expansion,\u201d he said, referring to development of land. \u201cYes, absolutely that\u2019s important. But there\u2019s this other side \u2013 abandonment \u2013 that people don\u2019t really talk about.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside this story of depopulation is another story \u2013 of what happens to the land left behind. To preserve a livable planet, it is crucial to preserve and expand forests, grasslands, healthy ecosystems and wild places. Huge expanses of abandoned land represent an opportunity but also a question, an ongoing experiment without clearly predictable outcomes. For thousands of years, humans have dramatically shaped the places where they live, transforming the Earth\u2019s face. So what happens to the natural world when people disappear?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It was this puzzle that drew ecologist Gergana Daskalova to Tyurkmen. On a hot, quiet morning in May she walked down the main street. It was empty of people, but lined by papers that fluttered in the early summer heat, tugging at their staples on the fences, gates and power poles. When a member of the household dies in Bulgaria, it is traditional to mark their passing with a notice. The A4 printouts featured a name, photograph, date of death and a brief tribute. Each noted how long ago the loved one had died: six months, a year, a decade, 22 years. In villages across the country, these posters often also mark the end of human habitation. \u201cIf you walk around, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s like this clock that\u2019s ticking, measuring the time since those people have left us,\u201d Daskalova said. \u201cOn a human level, that\u2019s very sad. But that clock, it\u2019s also measuring the end of human impact, and the onset of environmental change afterwards.\u201d</p>    <p>Daskalova specialises in global change ecology: how large-scale human activity is reshaping the natural world. She is in the middle of an ambitious research project, studying 30 villages across the Bulgarian countryside in different stages of abandonment. Along with collaborators and students, she is gathering a huge range of data: using aerial drones to map the return of forests, block-by-block botany surveys to see what plants are growing, audio recorders on trees to capture shifts in the density and volume of birdsong. Over time, she hopes to compare the ecology of derelict villages with those where some people remain, providing a comprehensive picture of how nature responds when humans leave.</p> <p>Daskalova, is in her early 30s, with a chatty warmth and patient knack for breaking down scientific theory, possibly honed by a year of explaining to curious shepherds why she\u2019s out strapping microphones to trees in remote fields. She recently gave birth to her son, and on some days he watched from her hip, swaying and serious-eyed, as she strode around research plots.</p> <p>Tyurkmen was not a randomly selected research site \u2013 it is the place she grew up. Like many of her generation, as a young child Daskalova was largely raised by grandparents while her parents went to work in the nearest city. Eventually, she left for university. \u201cFor a decade, I was one of the people who left the village and only returned occasionally, and every time I came back, there were less and less people living on my street,\u201d she said. When she was younger, Daskalova would track the creep of abandonment in the wintertime, watching to see whether smoke emerged from a chimney down the street, or light shone from one of the windows. \u201cInstead, one by one, the lights get turned off,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For the first few years of her career, Daskalova worked in far-flung places, including the arctic tundra. But she remembered the great depopulation she had lived through, and recognised that it was part of something wider, with scope to reshape the future of thousands of species.</p>    <p>Today, she lives and works in the home in Tyurkmen that once belonged to her grandparents. All around her, homes stand empty. Across the street, one house has crumpled inward, like a cardboard box left in the rain. Inside, that morning, nesting barn swallows orbited a bedroom. The front door had been knocked off its hinges, still carrying an enamel plaque: an award dispensed by communist-era local authorities, reading \u201cexemplary home\u201d.</p> <p>Abandoned places are not the most alluring research sites: \u201cThey\u2019re not the rainforests, not the gorillas,\u201d said Daskalova. Individually, each research site is just a village, like thousands of others. \u201cBut in a way that\u2019s what makes it special,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause depopulation is happening at a really big scale.\u201d And what comes after abandonment is often not what we expect.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>News that great swathes of our planet are being abandoned can excite visions of a rewilded Eden in the ruins of humanity. In the absence of humans, nature will come roaring back. Deer will roam the streets of crumbling cities, vines will crack the concrete, football fields will give way to forests. The skies will clear and species will flourish. In 2020, lockdowns gave many people a taste of what semi-abandonment might look like. As humans were forced indoors, wild creatures returned to some urban streets and suburban gardens. \u201cHumans are the virus,\u201d observers declared, in a mixture of earnest commentary and internet punchlines. In their absence, \u201cnature is healing\u201d.</p> <p>Visions of humans as a pox upon the natural world \u2013 and of paradise sprouting in our absence \u2013 are intertwined with some of ecology\u2019s oldest ideas. In the late 19th century, botanist Frederick Clements helped popularise succession theory, the idea that left to its own devices, any disturbed landscape will follow a step-by-step progression. A ploughed field, for instance, will be overtaken first by fast-growing grasses and weeds, then shrubs, which finally thicken into trees and forest. Clements argued that any place would move through succession to a \u201cclimax\u201d state of stable equilibrium. The final result could differ according to climate and geography, an alpine forest being different from a swamp or desert. But the essential trajectory was always the same: a \u201cuniversal law\u201d, Clements wrote, of ecosystems climbing toward climax like an animal progressing through infancy toward adulthood.</p>    <p>The idea gained traction through the early 20th century, coinciding with a period of explosive growth in human cities, populations and industry. It had a kind of simple, elegant beauty. As people watched human activity transform the earth around them, it also offered a certain comfort. No matter how dramatic the disturbance \u2013 whether the retreat of a glacier or the razing of a forest for farmland \u2013 nature\u2019s capacity to return remained. That ideal climax state would rest like a substrate beneath the soil, lying dormant even as the land above was tilled or excavated or burned or paved. To return, all it needed was time and benign neglect.</p> <p>Over time, Clements\u2019 more sweeping theories were picked apart by fellow botanists. The stable, permanent climax communities he had theorised proved elusive: field studies continued to find ecosystems passing through unpredictable cycles of collapse, regeneration, divergence and stasis. Today, this deterministic version of succession theory is seen as widely debunked. But Clements\u2019 vision endured in the popular imagination \u2013 sometimes to the frustration of ecologists. \u201cMany popular ideas about the environment are premised on the conviction that nature is \u2026 capable of preserving its natural balance more or less indefinitely if only humans can avoid disturbing it,\u201d ecological historian William Cronon wrote in 1995. \u201cThese stories are ours, not nature\u2019s. The natural world does not organise itself into parables.\u201d</p> <p>In practice, scientists have found that humanity\u2019s relationship to the natural world is far more complex than we often assume. This is one of Daskalova\u2019s more counterintuitive findings: rather than always being antithetical to nature, human presence can help make life possible for a vast array of species. Even more surprisingly, total abandonment can sometimes have worse consequences for biodiversity than landscapes where some people remain.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>To show how this could be possible, Daskalova drove me to a village buried in vines. Kreslyuvtsi lies in semi-mountainous regions of central Bulgaria. For years now, most of the village has been completely abandoned. In the spectrum of villages that Daskalova is studying, it offers a case study of what something approaching absolute human absence brings.</p> <p>Standing at the edge of a hillside, Daskalova gingerly took a step off the path and out into space. When her foot landed, she bounced ever so slightly, held up by the latticing of thousands of bramble vines, woven tightly enough to create their own buoyant elasticity. Somewhere beneath was a steeply sloped bank of land, and out a few metres in front was one of the long-abandoned homes of Kreslyuvtsi village. Its form was slowly collapsing as the stone walls crumbled. Brambles had surged up over the house until only an upper corner of the tiled roof was fully visible, jutting above the vines like the prow of a boat in its final stages of sinking. \u201cThey will swallow this place whole,\u201d Daskalova said.</p>    <p>The brambles illustrate the first force that abandoned land faces: when humans leave en masse, new dominant species can make a clean sweep. The worst offenders are not brambles, but imported, invasive species. In Poland, where about 12% of farmland was abandoned after the fall of communism, the fields have turned thick mustard yellow, blanketed by the bright pollen cascades of Canadian goldenrod. This species has colonised about 75% of the country\u2019s abandoned fields, and where goldenrod grows, little else thrives. Scientists studying this abandoned land found that wild pollinators <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adi7833?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D18000268606165266184876740783268588076%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1709251200\">decreased by 60%-70%</a>, and the number of birds halved. In Bulgaria, an emerging threat is the Tree of Heaven (<em>Ailanthus altissima</em>), a hardy, fast-growing, disease-resistant tree from northern China, with bitter-smelling sap that repels other plant, animal and microbial life.</p> <p>These monocultures can create \u201cbiological deserts\u201d, where just one species grows. The need to diversify them is not only an aesthetic, human preference. Monocultures are associated with soil degradation and nutrient depletion, extinctions of other species, difficulty purifying water, catastrophic wildfires, vulnerability to drought and the rapid spread of disease.</p> <p>In some cases, a monoculture\u2019s dominance is temporary. Even virulent invasive species can sometimes act as \u201cnursery\u201d environments for a variety of plants and creatures that might eventually outgrow them. Other times, an ecosystem may stall, failing to recover or diversify. \u201cIt is widely believed that once destroyed, forests can recover naturally from grassland or shrubland within a few decades in a process known as forest succession, and that tree planting can help,\u201d scientists <a href=\"https://www.kfbg.org/en/press-release/article/KFBG-Study-Finds-That-Trees-Planted-in-Monocultures-Impede-Forest-Recovery#:~:text=Jinlong%20Zhang%2C%20a%20senior%20ecologist,that%20tree%20planting%20can%20help.\">discussing the process</a> on Hong Kong plantations wrote in 2023. \u201cOur study shows that forests do not recover as much, or as rapidly, as people think they do.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Humans are often responsible for creating monocultures. But there is also a surprising, unacknowledged role that people can play in holding them back.</p> <p>Out among the brambles in Kreslyuvtsi, Daskalova turned, carefully dragging her gumboots back toward the path winding up the hillside. Reaching the path, she crouched in the grass and began to name species around her feet: grasses, ivy, but also buttercups, purple flowering vines, a tiny yellow orchid. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine many people walk up this road, but every once in a while some do,\u201d she says. In the process, they have held back the rising tide of brambles, and opened up space for this small flurry of species, a scatter of colour against the flat green opacity of vines.</p> <p>From where Daskalova stood, the path led up to an opening in the trees, where long grass and wildflowers grew in a clearcut meadow. Here, again, a small island of fragile blooms revealed the history of this land. Buttercups and agricultural weeds signalled that humans were here in the not-too-distant past, as did the clearing itself. Daskalova pointed to the thick-woven darkness of trees around the space, arranged like an audience in an amphitheatre, their network of branches already forking into the precious light of the clearing. \u201cThey\u2019re right at the edge, ready to move in when that opportunity arises,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s no grazing or mowing, it could only be something like five years until it\u2019s all in the shadows of a denser canopy.\u201d</p> <p>When people imagine ecosystems recovering, this return to forest is often what springs to mind. But forests only represent a small sliver of possible habitats. For other species, the currency of life is light, and a dense, closed canopy of forest is impossible to survive. A swallow is perfectly adapted to vast, open fields: the curve of its wings and distinctive forking tail designed for fast pursuit of insects hovering above meadows. A starling murmuration, moving across the sky like spilled pepper over a tablecloth, is an adaptation to open fields: repelling predators, protecting the roost. Vast numbers of species adapted and co-evolved with these open places \u2013 plants, mammals, insects, grazers, species like wildflowers, that relish disturbance and light. The rich biodiversity of open grasslands can be even greater than that of temperate forests.</p>    <p>Once, many of these kinds of environments were created by megafauna. Mammoths, giant water buffalo, bison and cave bears were large enough to reshape forests, toppling trees to create steppes and prairie. Scientists have estimated that megafauna were responsible for keeping <a href=\"https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01593\">about 30%</a> of South America\u2019s forests at bay. Almost all of them are now extinct, the timing of their demise <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.3254\">usually linked</a> to the arrival of humans. In many places, humans are the only remaining creatures that can consistently reshape landscapes in these radical ways, pushing back the shade of the trees for other creatures to take root.</p> <p>For millennia, all across the planet, humans have been using fire and tools to open up land for agriculture, gardens, grazing and hunting. In the process, we created ecological \u201cmosaics\u201d, or \u201cpatchworks\u201d: landscapes that hold a mixture of habitats, like meadows, gardens and forests. These places were not designed as nature reserves, but they often catered to hugely diverse animal life. In her book Nature\u2019s Ghosts, Sophie Yeo <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/managing-biodiversity-rich-hay-meadows-in-the-eu-a-comparison-of-swedish-and-romanian-grasslands/3FB1EEF21C821CB667CC6D87B9F1A817\">details research</a> indicating that European hay meadows cultivated for animal feed were actually more successful at preserving a vast array of species than meadows explicitly cultivated for biodiversity. Looking back over the early Holocene \u2013 beginning 11,700 years ago \u2013 researchers have found that human presence was about as likely to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-024-02457-x\">increase biodiversity as reduce it</a>.</p> <p>Not all human-created landscapes have the same value. A paved subdivision with astroturfed lawns is very different to a village with diverse vegetable and flower gardens. A traditional hay meadow is radically different from a pesticide-drenched plantation of soya beans. But scientists continue to find evidence that the old idea of humans as antithetical to nature is also wrong-headed, and that rosy visions of thriving, human-free environments are more imaginary than real. \u201cPeople are still imagining [nature as] this kind of pristine place that\u2019s going to be saved from people,\u201d says US environmental scientist Erle Ellis. \u201cThat is definitely a misunderstanding.\u201d</p> <p>In 2021, Ellis published new research that looked back 12,000 years. He and his colleagues found that nearly three-quarters of Earth\u2019s land was occupied and shaped by human societies. Other researchers have pushed even further back. Examining human-biodiversity interactions in the Late Pleistocene \u2013 back as far as 120,000 years \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1525200113\">scientists concluded</a> that across most of the planet, \u201c\u2018Pristine\u2019 landscapes simply do not exist and, in most cases, have not existed for millennia\u201d.</p> <p>Many of the landscapes people now tend to think of as untouched, from the savanna lands of equatorial Africa to the deep Amazon rainforest, have already been deeply transformed by human presence. \u201cThe essential role that people play in ecology is the critical thing, and it\u2019s been ignored,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cThe most biodiverse places left on Earth \u2013 this is almost universally true \u2013 have Indigenous people in them. Why? Well, they conserve a lot of that biodiversity and actually produce it. They maintain that heterogeneous landscape.\u201d</p> <p>There is no question that recent human activity \u2013 particularly the massive clearing of ecosystems and industrial consumption of fossil fuels \u2013 has been an ecological catastrophe. But for nature to be restored to a past version of itself, the question might be less one of human absence, than what form human presence can take.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the small communities riding out abandonment in Bulgaria, you sometimes see patches of gentle human presence that might offer paths for the future, as well as glimpses of the past. Off Tyurkmen\u2019s main street, a dirt road leads to a stretch of scrubby meadowland. On the day I visited, Slavcho Petkov Stoyanov, who is 56 years old, stood watching as his sheep grazed among the shrubs. \u201cYears ago, nobody would have let me graze here,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this was used for growing vegetables.\u201d His is the last flock in the village and he usually employs shepherds to watch them \u2013 but recently those young men left town and he was back out in the fields himself, sitting in a patch of shade to dodge the midday sun.</p>    <p>Stoyanov is one of the few remaining people here who help to maintain a diverse, \u201cmosaic\u201d landscape: in some empty blocks, the canopy of trees is expanding, but others are cleared by grazing and littered with wildflowers. He offers an example of how some forms of human occupation can be a protection against environmental damage rather than a source. As rural places like Tyurkmen depopulate, they become vulnerable to new forms of exploitation: land prices drop, and there are fewer people around to oppose projects like mines and quarries. \u201cWhat you can get is depopulation as a stepping stone to industrialisation,\u201d Daskalova told me.</p> <p>Stoyanov pointed to the reservoir below the fields. His grandparents helped dig it themselves. Then, a few years ago, a company was granted cheap contracts by the municipality to take fish from it. The process followed a brutal, short-term logic: they installed pumps, drained the reservoir, and scooped the fish out. Almost everything else died. \u201cThey got about 20 tonnes of fish,\u201d Stoyanov said. The remaining villagers were furious, and mounted a successful campaign to have the contract ended. The reservoir has slowly refilled, with water, fish, birds. Over time, he hopes parts of the village will refill, too. They have new opponents now, including a limestone quarry proposed at the village boundary.</p> <p>To harness the full environmental possibilities offered by the great abandonment will require changing our conception of humanity\u2019s relationship to nature, and understanding how our species can benefit ecosystems as well as harm them. It will also require human intention: neglect alone is not enough. Around Slavcho\u2019s herds, the backdrop of Tyurkmen was transforming. Patches of forest thrust outward, vines demolished villas, chemical-smelling invasive thickets occupied meadows. The march of nature seemed inexorable, but its future was still uncertain, contingent on the remaining people: what would they allow to grow? What would they keep at bay?</p> <p>This point about uncertainty recurs again and again in conversations with scientists studying abandoned land. For biodiversity to thrive it needs time. The same forces that drive people from a place \u2013 pandemics, wars, shifting economic tides \u2013 can send them flowing back. He Yin, working with a group of scholars, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9132457/\">found that</a> millions of hectares of abandoned land were recultivated within a few decades. Their neglect was \u201ctoo ephemeral\u201d to translate into true gains for nature.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">The Anthropocene epoch: have we entered a new phase of planetary history?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At one of Daskalova\u2019s longest-abandoned monitoring sites, she had seen the trees grow thick and steady, undisturbed since the last occupants left. \u201cNobody had stepped on that plot in nearly half a century,\u201d she said. Then, this year, a new set of owners appeared. They had plans for a guesthouse, transforming the isolated plot into a sanctuary for holidaymakers. \u201cThe first thing they did was to clear every single bit of vegetation \u2013 they just bulldozed the whole thing,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Abandonment, when it came, crept in from the outskirts. Homes at the edge of town were first to go, then the peripheral grocery stores. It moved inward, slow but inexorable. The petrol station closed, and creeper vines climbed the pumps, amassing on the roof until it buckled under the strain. It swallowed the outer bus shelters, the pharmacies, the cinema, the cafe. The school shut down. Today, one of the last institutions sustaining human occupation in Tyurkmen, a village in central Bulgaria, is the post office. Dimitrinka Dimcheva, a 56-year-old post officer, still keeps it open two days a week, bringing in packages of goods that local shops no longer exist to sell. Once a thriving town of more than 1,200, Tyurkmen is now home to fewer than 200 people. On a warm spring afternoon, Dimcheva stood in the town square. \u201cThe weddings took place here, all of the folk dances, the volleyball. There were lots of young people. A pool,\u201d she said. She gazed around, pointing to ruins or now-empty spaces where buildings once stood, remembering. There, the building that housed a small cinema. Behind it, the space for a school that burned down, was rebuilt, then closed. \u201cLife was bubbling.\u201d Now, she said, \u201clife in the villages is dying\u201d. Thousands of similar villages are scattered across Bulgaria. After the fall of communism, people flocked to the cities in search of work, and over the next 30 years many villages emptied to the point of obliteration. As of the 2021 census, almost 300 villages were completely abandoned, and more than 1,000 had populations below 30 \u2013 most of them very elderly. With its low birthrates and high rates of emigration, Bulgaria has been emptying out for decades. Its population has dropped from close to 9 million in 1989, to fewer than 6.5 million \u2013 one of the worst peacetime population declines in modern history. Bulgaria lies at the extreme end of this kind of demographic change, but the forces reshaping it are acting everywhere. Over the past half century, the global portion of people living in rural areas has decreased by almost a third. Farming is becoming increasingly industrial and concentrated. More than half of all people now live in and around cities, and that figure is expected to rise to 70% by 2050. In many countries, birthrates are dropping steadily, and while the global population is projected to keep growing until 2080, around half of that growth is being driven by fewer than 10 countries. As populations move and shrink, people are leaving long-occupied places behind. Often they leave everything in place, ready for a return that never comes. In Tyurkmen, Christmas baubles still hang from the curtain rails in empty houses, slowly being wrapped by spiders. In one abandoned home, a porcelain cabinet lay inside a crater of rotted floorboards, plates still stacked above a spare packet of nappies for a visiting grandchild. Occasionally, abandonment happens all at once, when a legal ruling or evacuation sends people scuttling. But mostly, it is haphazard, creeping, unplanned. People just go. Since the 1950s, some scholars estimate up to 400m hectares \u2013 an area close to the size of the European Union \u2013 of abandoned land have accumulated across the world. A team of scientists recently calculated that roughly 30m hectares of farmland had been abandoned across the mainland US since the 1980s. As the climate crisis renders more places unliveable \u2013 too threatened by flooding, water shortages and wildfires to build houses, soil too degraded and drought-stripped to farm \u2013 we can expect further displacements. This world-altering shift has drawn remarkably little attention. \u201cIt has been there all the time \u2013 but we did not really describe it,\u201d says Prof He Yin of Kent State University, one of the scientists now using remote sensing to create global maps of abandoned land. \u201cWe talk about expansion,\u201d he said, referring to development of land. \u201cYes, absolutely that\u2019s important. But there\u2019s this other side \u2013 abandonment \u2013 that people don\u2019t really talk about.\u201d Alongside this story of depopulation is another story \u2013 of what happens to the land left behind. To preserve a livable planet, it is crucial to preserve and expand forests, grasslands, healthy ecosystems and wild places. Huge expanses of abandoned land represent an opportunity but also a question, an ongoing experiment without clearly predictable outcomes. For thousands of years, humans have dramatically shaped the places where they live, transforming the Earth\u2019s face. So what happens to the natural world when people disappear? * * * It was this puzzle that drew ecologist Gergana Daskalova to Tyurkmen. On a hot, quiet morning in May she walked down the main street. It was empty of people, but lined by papers that fluttered in the early summer heat, tugging at their staples on the fences, gates and power poles. When a member of the household dies in Bulgaria, it is traditional to mark their passing with a notice. The A4 printouts featured a name, photograph, date of death and a brief tribute. Each noted how long ago the loved one had died: six months, a year, a decade, 22 years. In villages across the country, these posters often also mark the end of human habitation. \u201cIf you walk around, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s like this clock that\u2019s ticking, measuring the time since those people have left us,\u201d Daskalova said. \u201cOn a human level, that\u2019s very sad. But that clock, it\u2019s also measuring the end of human impact, and the onset of environmental change afterwards.\u201d Daskalova specialises in global change ecology: how large-scale human activity is reshaping the natural world. She is in the middle of an ambitious research project, studying 30 villages across the Bulgarian countryside in different stages of abandonment. Along with collaborators and students, she is gathering a huge range of data: using aerial drones to map the return of forests, block-by-block botany surveys to see what plants are growing, audio recorders on trees to capture shifts in the density and volume of birdsong. Over time, she hopes to compare the ecology of derelict villages with those where some people remain, providing a comprehensive picture of how nature responds when humans leave. Daskalova, is in her early 30s, with a chatty warmth and patient knack for breaking down scientific theory, possibly honed by a year of explaining to curious shepherds why she\u2019s out strapping microphones to trees in remote fields. She recently gave birth to her son, and on some days he watched from her hip, swaying and serious-eyed, as she strode around research plots. Tyurkmen was not a randomly selected research site \u2013 it is the place she grew up. Like many of her generation, as a young child Daskalova was largely raised by grandparents while her parents went to work in the nearest city. Eventually, she left for university. \u201cFor a decade, I was one of the people who left the village and only returned occasionally, and every time I came back, there were less and less people living on my street,\u201d she said. When she was younger, Daskalova would track the creep of abandonment in the wintertime, watching to see whether smoke emerged from a chimney down the street, or light shone from one of the windows. \u201cInstead, one by one, the lights get turned off,\u201d she said. For the first few years of her career, Daskalova worked in far-flung places, including the arctic tundra. But she remembered the great depopulation she had lived through, and recognised that it was part of something wider, with scope to reshape the future of thousands of species. Today, she lives and works in the home in Tyurkmen that once belonged to her grandparents. All around her, homes stand empty. Across the street, one house has crumpled inward, like a cardboard box left in the rain. Inside, that morning, nesting barn swallows orbited a bedroom. The front door had been knocked off its hinges, still carrying an enamel plaque: an award dispensed by communist-era local authorities, reading \u201cexemplary home\u201d. Abandoned places are not the most alluring research sites: \u201cThey\u2019re not the rainforests, not the gorillas,\u201d said Daskalova. Individually, each research site is just a village, like thousands of others. \u201cBut in a way that\u2019s what makes it special,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause depopulation is happening at a really big scale.\u201d And what comes after abandonment is often not what we expect. * * * News that great swathes of our planet are being abandoned can excite visions of a rewilded Eden in the ruins of humanity. In the absence of humans, nature will come roaring back. Deer will roam the streets of crumbling cities, vines will crack the concrete, football fields will give way to forests. The skies will clear and species will flourish. In 2020, lockdowns gave many people a taste of what semi-abandonment might look like. As humans were forced indoors, wild creatures returned to some urban streets and suburban gardens. \u201cHumans are the virus,\u201d observers declared, in a mixture of earnest commentary and internet punchlines. In their absence, \u201cnature is healing\u201d. Visions of humans as a pox upon the natural world \u2013 and of paradise sprouting in our absence \u2013 are intertwined with some of ecology\u2019s oldest ideas. In the late 19th century, botanist Frederick Clements helped popularise succession theory, the idea that left to its own devices, any disturbed landscape will follow a step-by-step progression. A ploughed field, for instance, will be overtaken first by fast-growing grasses and weeds, then shrubs, which finally thicken into trees and forest. Clements argued that any place would move through succession to a \u201cclimax\u201d state of stable equilibrium. The final result could differ according to climate and geography, an alpine forest being different from a swamp or desert. But the essential trajectory was always the same: a \u201cuniversal law\u201d, Clements wrote, of ecosystems climbing toward climax like an animal progressing through infancy toward adulthood. The idea gained traction through the early 20th century, coinciding with a period of explosive growth in human cities, populations and industry. It had a kind of simple, elegant beauty. As people watched human activity transform the earth around them, it also offered a certain comfort. No matter how dramatic the disturbance \u2013 whether the retreat of a glacier or the razing of a forest for farmland \u2013 nature\u2019s capacity to return remained. That ideal climax state would rest like a substrate beneath the soil, lying dormant even as the land above was tilled or excavated or burned or paved. To return, all it needed was time and benign neglect. Over time, Clements\u2019 more sweeping theories were picked apart by fellow botanists. The stable, permanent climax communities he had theorised proved elusive: field studies continued to find ecosystems passing through unpredictable cycles of collapse, regeneration, divergence and stasis. Today, this deterministic version of succession theory is seen as widely debunked. But Clements\u2019 vision endured in the popular imagination \u2013 sometimes to the frustration of ecologists. \u201cMany popular ideas about the environment are premised on the conviction that nature is \u2026 capable of preserving its natural balance more or less indefinitely if only humans can avoid disturbing it,\u201d ecological historian William Cronon wrote in 1995. \u201cThese stories are ours, not nature\u2019s. The natural world does not organise itself into parables.\u201d In practice, scientists have found that humanity\u2019s relationship to the natural world is far more complex than we often assume. This is one of Daskalova\u2019s more counterintuitive findings: rather than always being antithetical to nature, human presence can help make life possible for a vast array of species. Even more surprisingly, total abandonment can sometimes have worse consequences for biodiversity than landscapes where some people remain. * * * To show how this could be possible, Daskalova drove me to a village buried in vines. Kreslyuvtsi lies in semi-mountainous regions of central Bulgaria. For years now, most of the village has been completely abandoned. In the spectrum of villages that Daskalova is studying, it offers a case study of what something approaching absolute human absence brings. Standing at the edge of a hillside, Daskalova gingerly took a step off the path and out into space. When her foot landed, she bounced ever so slightly, held up by the latticing of thousands of bramble vines, woven tightly enough to create their own buoyant elasticity. Somewhere beneath was a steeply sloped bank of land, and out a few metres in front was one of the long-abandoned homes of Kreslyuvtsi village. Its form was slowly collapsing as the stone walls crumbled. Brambles had surged up over the house until only an upper corner of the tiled roof was fully visible, jutting above the vines like the prow of a boat in its final stages of sinking. \u201cThey will swallow this place whole,\u201d Daskalova said. The brambles illustrate the first force that abandoned land faces: when humans leave en masse, new dominant species can make a clean sweep. The worst offenders are not brambles, but imported, invasive species. In Poland, where about 12% of farmland was abandoned after the fall of communism, the fields have turned thick mustard yellow, blanketed by the bright pollen cascades of Canadian goldenrod. This species has colonised about 75% of the country\u2019s abandoned fields, and where goldenrod grows, little else thrives. Scientists studying this abandoned land found that wild pollinators decreased by 60%-70%, and the number of birds halved. In Bulgaria, an emerging threat is the Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima), a hardy, fast-growing, disease-resistant tree from northern China, with bitter-smelling sap that repels other plant, animal and microbial life. These monocultures can create \u201cbiological deserts\u201d, where just one species grows. The need to diversify them is not only an aesthetic, human preference. Monocultures are associated with soil degradation and nutrient depletion, extinctions of other species, difficulty purifying water, catastrophic wildfires, vulnerability to drought and the rapid spread of disease. In some cases, a monoculture\u2019s dominance is temporary. Even virulent invasive species can sometimes act as \u201cnursery\u201d environments for a variety of plants and creatures that might eventually outgrow them. Other times, an ecosystem may stall, failing to recover or diversify. \u201cIt is widely believed that once destroyed, forests can recover naturally from grassland or shrubland within a few decades in a process known as forest succession, and that tree planting can help,\u201d scientists discussing the process on Hong Kong plantations wrote in 2023. \u201cOur study shows that forests do not recover as much, or as rapidly, as people think they do.\u201d * * * Humans are often responsible for creating monocultures. But there is also a surprising, unacknowledged role that people can play in holding them back. Out among the brambles in Kreslyuvtsi, Daskalova turned, carefully dragging her gumboots back toward the path winding up the hillside. Reaching the path, she crouched in the grass and began to name species around her feet: grasses, ivy, but also buttercups, purple flowering vines, a tiny yellow orchid. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine many people walk up this road, but every once in a while some do,\u201d she says. In the process, they have held back the rising tide of brambles, and opened up space for this small flurry of species, a scatter of colour against the flat green opacity of vines. From where Daskalova stood, the path led up to an opening in the trees, where long grass and wildflowers grew in a clearcut meadow. Here, again, a small island of fragile blooms revealed the history of this land. Buttercups and agricultural weeds signalled that humans were here in the not-too-distant past, as did the clearing itself. Daskalova pointed to the thick-woven darkness of trees around the space, arranged like an audience in an amphitheatre, their network of branches already forking into the precious light of the clearing. \u201cThey\u2019re right at the edge, ready to move in when that opportunity arises,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s no grazing or mowing, it could only be something like five years until it\u2019s all in the shadows of a denser canopy.\u201d When people imagine ecosystems recovering, this return to forest is often what springs to mind. But forests only represent a small sliver of possible habitats. For other species, the currency of life is light, and a dense, closed canopy of forest is impossible to survive. A swallow is perfectly adapted to vast, open fields: the curve of its wings and distinctive forking tail designed for fast pursuit of insects hovering above meadows. A starling murmuration, moving across the sky like spilled pepper over a tablecloth, is an adaptation to open fields: repelling predators, protecting the roost. Vast numbers of species adapted and co-evolved with these open places \u2013 plants, mammals, insects, grazers, species like wildflowers, that relish disturbance and light. The rich biodiversity of open grasslands can be even greater than that of temperate forests. Once, many of these kinds of environments were created by megafauna. Mammoths, giant water buffalo, bison and cave bears were large enough to reshape forests, toppling trees to create steppes and prairie. Scientists have estimated that megafauna were responsible for keeping about 30% of South America\u2019s forests at bay. Almost all of them are now extinct, the timing of their demise usually linked to the arrival of humans. In many places, humans are the only remaining creatures that can consistently reshape landscapes in these radical ways, pushing back the shade of the trees for other creatures to take root. For millennia, all across the planet, humans have been using fire and tools to open up land for agriculture, gardens, grazing and hunting. In the process, we created ecological \u201cmosaics\u201d, or \u201cpatchworks\u201d: landscapes that hold a mixture of habitats, like meadows, gardens and forests. These places were not designed as nature reserves, but they often catered to hugely diverse animal life. In her book Nature\u2019s Ghosts, Sophie Yeo details research indicating that European hay meadows cultivated for animal feed were actually more successful at preserving a vast array of species than meadows explicitly cultivated for biodiversity. Looking back over the early Holocene \u2013 beginning 11,700 years ago \u2013 researchers have found that human presence was about as likely to increase biodiversity as reduce it. Not all human-created landscapes have the same value. A paved subdivision with astroturfed lawns is very different to a village with diverse vegetable and flower gardens. A traditional hay meadow is radically different from a pesticide-drenched plantation of soya beans. But scientists continue to find evidence that the old idea of humans as antithetical to nature is also wrong-headed, and that rosy visions of thriving, human-free environments are more imaginary than real. \u201cPeople are still imagining [nature as] this kind of pristine place that\u2019s going to be saved from people,\u201d says US environmental scientist Erle Ellis. \u201cThat is definitely a misunderstanding.\u201d In 2021, Ellis published new research that looked back 12,000 years. He and his colleagues found that nearly three-quarters of Earth\u2019s land was occupied and shaped by human societies. Other researchers have pushed even further back. Examining human-biodiversity interactions in the Late Pleistocene \u2013 back as far as 120,000 years \u2013 scientists concluded that across most of the planet, \u201c\u2018Pristine\u2019 landscapes simply do not exist and, in most cases, have not existed for millennia\u201d. Many of the landscapes people now tend to think of as untouched, from the savanna lands of equatorial Africa to the deep Amazon rainforest, have already been deeply transformed by human presence. \u201cThe essential role that people play in ecology is the critical thing, and it\u2019s been ignored,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cThe most biodiverse places left on Earth \u2013 this is almost universally true \u2013 have Indigenous people in them. Why? Well, they conserve a lot of that biodiversity and actually produce it. They maintain that heterogeneous landscape.\u201d There is no question that recent human activity \u2013 particularly the massive clearing of ecosystems and industrial consumption of fossil fuels \u2013 has been an ecological catastrophe. But for nature to be restored to a past version of itself, the question might be less one of human absence, than what form human presence can take. * * * In the small communities riding out abandonment in Bulgaria, you sometimes see patches of gentle human presence that might offer paths for the future, as well as glimpses of the past. Off Tyurkmen\u2019s main street, a dirt road leads to a stretch of scrubby meadowland. On the day I visited, Slavcho Petkov Stoyanov, who is 56 years old, stood watching as his sheep grazed among the shrubs. \u201cYears ago, nobody would have let me graze here,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this was used for growing vegetables.\u201d His is the last flock in the village and he usually employs shepherds to watch them \u2013 but recently those young men left town and he was back out in the fields himself, sitting in a patch of shade to dodge the midday sun. Stoyanov is one of the few remaining people here who help to maintain a diverse, \u201cmosaic\u201d landscape: in some empty blocks, the canopy of trees is expanding, but others are cleared by grazing and littered with wildflowers. He offers an example of how some forms of human occupation can be a protection against environmental damage rather than a source. As rural places like Tyurkmen depopulate, they become vulnerable to new forms of exploitation: land prices drop, and there are fewer people around to oppose projects like mines and quarries. \u201cWhat you can get is depopulation as a stepping stone to industrialisation,\u201d Daskalova told me. Stoyanov pointed to the reservoir below the fields. His grandparents helped dig it themselves. Then, a few years ago, a company was granted cheap contracts by the municipality to take fish from it. The process followed a brutal, short-term logic: they installed pumps, drained the reservoir, and scooped the fish out. Almost everything else died. \u201cThey got about 20 tonnes of fish,\u201d Stoyanov said. The remaining villagers were furious, and mounted a successful campaign to have the contract ended. The reservoir has slowly refilled, with water, fish, birds. Over time, he hopes parts of the village will refill, too. They have new opponents now, including a limestone quarry proposed at the village boundary. To harness the full environmental possibilities offered by the great abandonment will require changing our conception of humanity\u2019s relationship to nature, and understanding how our species can benefit ecosystems as well as harm them. It will also require human intention: neglect alone is not enough. Around Slavcho\u2019s herds, the backdrop of Tyurkmen was transforming. Patches of forest thrust outward, vines demolished villas, chemical-smelling invasive thickets occupied meadows. The march of nature seemed inexorable, but its future was still uncertain, contingent on the remaining people: what would they allow to grow? What would they keep at bay? This point about uncertainty recurs again and again in conversations with scientists studying abandoned land. For biodiversity to thrive it needs time. The same forces that drive people from a place \u2013 pandemics, wars, shifting economic tides \u2013 can send them flowing back. He Yin, working with a group of scholars, found that millions of hectares of abandoned land were recultivated within a few decades. Their neglect was \u201ctoo ephemeral\u201d to translate into true gains for nature. At one of Daskalova\u2019s longest-abandoned monitoring sites, she had seen the trees grow thick and steady, undisturbed since the last occupants left. \u201cNobody had stepped on that plot in nearly half a century,\u201d she said. Then, this year, a new set of owners appeared. They had plans for a guesthouse, transforming the isolated plot into a sanctuary for holidaymakers. \u201cThe first thing they did was to clear every single bit of vegetation \u2013 they just bulldozed the whole thing,\u201d she said. The forest was shorn back and ploughed into dirt, the plot left dotted with a few invasive weeds. After clearing the land, the buyers realised their new project would not be profitable. \u201cThey gave up on the guesthouse idea,\u201d Daskalova said. \u201cNow it\u2019s abandoned again.\u201d \u2022 Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Yes, Hezbollah has suffered, but it is mostly on its leadership and high level commanders, but the organisation is intact.\u201d</p> <p>He also ridiculed claims by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel had agreed to the Lebanon ceasefire partly because Israel wanted to focus its energies on preventing Iran from securing a nuclear weapon. </p> <p>\u201cA full-scale war with Iran and a ceasefire in Lebanon?

Contrary to Israelis, we don\u2019t want war, but we are fully prepared for that, and we are not scared of war. And if they want to try us, they can do that.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was up to Hezbollah to decide if it wanted to withdraw its weaponry north of the Litani River, as set out in the ceasefire agreement with Israel, and said the group was not an Iranian proxy. \u201cHezbollah and others are not our proxies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only support them as our friends, so we have never dictated on them or any other resistance group in the region.

Seyed Abbas Araghchi said in an interview that Iran already had the capability and knowledge to create nuclear weapons, but said they did not form part of its security strategy. He also said Tehran was prepared to keep supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Western officials will be concerned by Araghchi\u2019s warning over the reimposition of sanctions, which were lifted when Iran signed the 2015 deal intended to limit its nuclear activities. Araghchi was appointed foreign minister by Iran\u2019s reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who was elected this year on a promise to improve Iran\u2019s economy by pursuing improved relations with the west. He was speaking in Lisbon before a meeting between Iranian and European negotiators in Geneva on Friday, which he described as a brainstorming session to see if there was a way out of their impasse. He admitted he was pessimistic about the meeting, saying he was not sure Iran was speaking to the right party. He said he believed European nations \u2013 chiefly the UK, Germany and France \u2013 were set on confrontation after a board meeting last week of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in which a European-tabled censure motion was passed saying Iran had failed to cooperate with inspectors and was building a uranium stockpile that had no peaceful civilian purpose.

      "body": "<p>The atmosphere in the club is friendly, people generally aren\u2019t drunk, and since it\u2019s dark inside, it could just as well be 4am instead of 4pm. Welcome to the daytime rave, where you can dance, meet people and still be curled up on the sofa afterwards in time for Newsnight. It\u2019s a home from home for Joyce Harper, who says she has been \u201ca big clubber my whole life. In the 1990s, I used to go religiously twice a month and we\u2019d stay up all night. We were knocked out for days and always felt terrible. I realised, as I\u2019ve got older and wiser, the importance of sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Last week she was at a day rave at the London club Fabric, and the week before that at Ministry of Sound. \u201cI am aiming to do two a month at the moment,\u201d says Harper, who is professor of reproductive science at University College London, as well as <a href=\"https://joyceharper.com/podcasts/\">a podcaster</a> and author. She\u2019s 61 but, she adds, \u201cFor any age, staying up all night has so many disadvantages \u2013 obviously all the effects on sleep, but also things like getting home, having to wait for the first train.\u201d</p>    <p>In the last couple of weeks alone, several conversations I\u2019ve had have highlighted how rare a big night out is becoming. First, the person who partied till 6am was talked about in my social circle with a kind of hushed awe. Someone else went out on a Saturday night and reported that the pubs were dead. Other friends went to a daytime club and headed home by 10pm. All this is secondhand reporting from the field because I, of course, am in bed shortly after 9pm, even at the weekend. This is not just the life of a middle-aged bore \u2013 there are multiple warning signs that the night out is in peril.</p> <p>At the weekend, David McDowall, chief executive of the Stonegate group, which runs more than 4,000 bars, said people\u2019s drinking habits had gone from night to day. At the Slug and Lettuce chain, the busiest time is now between 3pm and 4pm on a Saturday; it used to be between 9pm and 10pm. \u201cBy the time 8pm comes around, it is time to head home,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/peak-pub-time-has-changed-day-drinking-bwxf9kgm5\">he told the Sunday Times</a>. As for Friday evening, traditionally the time to let your hair down after a week of work, it\u2019s \u201cbingo night\u201d at the chain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If there isn\u2019t more funding from the top, we are in danger of seeing more decline in a really important aspect of UK culture</p> <footer> <cite>Patrick Hinton, Mixmag</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nightclubs are under threat \u2013 a report by the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) last month <a href=\"https://ntia.co.uk/ntia-figures-reveal-extent-of-crisis-uk-nightclubs-struggle-as-dance-floors-nationwide-shut-down/\">found 31% of clubs had closed</a> between March 2020 and December 2023, an average of 10 a month. Meanwhile, all sorts of other leisure spaces, from escape rooms to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/17/ice-cream-parlours-great-britain-flavours-covid\">ice-cream parlours</a> \u2013 the type of places that close at a reasonable hour \u2013 are thriving.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that the \u201chottest new bedtime for twentysomethings\u201d was 9pm. Those aged between 18 and 35 were going to bed earlier, and businesses were shifting in response \u2013 bars and clubs in New York were hosting earlier events, and pre-6pm dinner reservations were increasing. One woman, a 32-year-old actor who likes to go to bed between 8pm and 9pm, said social media had helped make an early turning-in time more acceptable, such as TikTok\u2019s \u201csoft life\u201d trend, which prioritises peace and rest above hedonism and hustle culture.</p> <p>To look at the complaints of clubbers online, everything from sexual harassment to the boom in the tranquilliser ketamine has been blamed for killing the party vibes. As with everything these days, people filming on their phones, rather than enjoying the moment, seems to be an irritating fixture of club life \u2013 and nobody wants to be the person whose dancing becomes a viral meme.</p>    <p>Nightlife, says Patrick Hinton, editor of the dance music magazine Mixmag, is in danger of \u201cdying out for a list of reasons, which cross political, economic and sociological boundaries\u201d. He thinks people are going out much less frequently, and when they do, it tends to be to a big club or music venue. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift to massive festival-style events, massive clubs, and a real concentration of money in the biggest parts of the industry, rather than the regular weekend grassroots clubbing that was more common in the past.\u201d Covid was catastrophic for venues, and the energy crisis has put pressure on profit margins.</p> <p>Everything is more expensive, and people \u2013 especially younger people \u2013 have less disposable income to spend each week on Friday and Saturday nights out. \u201cAbout 10 years ago, a nightclub ticket might be \u00a35; the bus home would be \u00a31. But now, you\u2019re looking at \u00a340 or \u00a350 for these big nights, and even the smaller club nights are about \u00a320. The economic impact is huge in general \u2013 it\u2019s harder to be a musician, it\u2019s harder to put on events. A lot of grassroots club nights are run by passionate individuals who aren\u2019t careerist, but a 19-year-old promoter still can\u2019t afford to lose thousands of pounds on a night.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do a lot more afternoon activities, lovely dinners, so it\u2019s just a case of not being out until the early hours </p> <footer> <cite>Millie Gooch, Sober Girl Society</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic and its lockdowns meant that those who were in their prime early clubbing years \u2013 the older teens \u2013 never really got into the habit of going out, says Hinton. \u201cA lot of people\u2019s introduction to dance music was from livestreams on the internet. We\u2019ve seen 90s rave nostalgia booming among gen Z, but these are scenes that are developing on platforms like TikTok. DJs are getting loads of followers, but people aren\u2019t going out to see them as regularly.\u201d</p> <p>Young people, says Hinton, are into dance music and culture, but \u201cthey\u2019re poorer, they have less opportunities for it. It\u2019s harder for them to go out in the same way, or with the same frequency.\u201d He worries about the effects. \u201cHistorically, nightlife has been pretty good at weathering economic downturns, but now people aren\u2019t turning to it in the same way. If there isn\u2019t more policy and funding from the top to help the bottom, we are in danger of seeing more decline in a really important aspect of UK culture.\u201d</p>    <p>The primary concern for clubs and bars, says Mike Kill, director of the NTIA, is the economic situation and high running costs, but there are other challenges \u2013 \u201cthings like transport infrastructure that doesn\u2019t support the late-night economy\u201d. The increase in remote working has put an end to the spontaneous night out and virtually killed the Friday blow-out, with more people working from home at the end of the week.</p> <p>Late-night safety is also a concern \u2013 this week, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/thousands-of-bar-staff-in-england-and-wales-to-be-trained-to-spot-spiking\">spiking of drinks was highlighted</a> and the government announced that thousands of bar staff in England and Wales will be trained to deal with it. \u201cWe know that there are places up and down the country where petty crime and antisocial behaviour is rife because the policing isn\u2019t strong enough,\u201d says Kill. Nightclubs, he thinks, tend to be good at managing issues inside, \u201cbut the reality is, as soon as people leave to go home, that\u2019s where the concerns lie\u201d.</p> <p>The pandemic supercharged some aspects of on-demand life, meaning we need never leave home \u2013 we can order restaurant food, find a partner and spend hours watching TV. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work hard to get people out,\u201d says Kill. \u201cThere is that societal armchair culture that we\u2019ve got to battle against.\u201d</p> <p>For those who drink, alcohol prices in bars and clubs are alarming, compared with a night at home with a pack of supermarket beer. Then there are the growing number of people who have gone sober, or decreased their alcohol consumption, particularly among younger generations, who are now the most likely of any age group not to drink.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Great art always starts outside the cultural institutions. Great music starts outside the major venues</p> <footer> <cite>Dave Haslam, DJ</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Millie Gooch, the founder of Sober Girl Society, gave up drinking when she was 26 (she\u2019s now in her early 30s). She had been a \u201cparty girl\u201d, she says. \u201cI loved it until it got dangerous for my mental health. I started drinking when I went to uni, and I was using drinking as a bit of a crutch, going out drinking myself into oblivion, waking up, having hangover anxiety for the next three days, and then got into a bit of a cycle.\u201d</p> <p>She still had nights out after she stopped drinking, but it tailed off. \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot to do with age, but I realised that I didn\u2019t enjoy nights out as much without drinking. I would get more tired, and go home earlier, whereas before I\u2019d stay to the very end. I think when you\u2019re sober, you notice your energy levels dipping a bit towards midnight \u2013 it\u2019s that point when everyone around you is on a different level.\u201d Gooch doesn\u2019t miss it, though. \u201cMy whole social life has just shifted forwards. I do a lot more afternoon activities, lovely dinners, so it\u2019s just a case of not being out until the early hours of the morning any more.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s possible to admire sensible young people for not drinking themselves sick and staying out all night as older generations did, while at the same time mourning the decline of the big night out and what it might mean for all of us \u2013 even those of us who do prefer to be in bed by 9pm. In the 1990s, says Dave Haslam, a DJ, writer and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/life-after-dark-9780857206992/\">Life After Dark</a>: A History of British Nightclubs &amp; Music Venues: \u201cPeople would go out every week. It\u2019s almost inconceivable now.\u201d It\u2019s not that younger generations value culture and music any less, he says. \u201cI just think that they consume it in a different way and some of their choices are down to the fact they haven\u2019t got the money.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/04/amy-lame-steps-down-london-night-czar-and-nightlife-could-be-poorer-for-it\">Amy Lam\u00e9 has stepped down as London\u2019s night czar \u2013 and nightlife could be poorer for it | Ed Gillett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grassroots venues \u2013 \u201cwhat we used to call the underground\u201d, he says \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to closure. \u201cIt is where people are interested in new or weird things, or emerging things. The grassroots drives all kinds of culture. Great art always starts outside of the cultural institutions; great music starts outside of the major venues. I\u2019m very utopian about the whole idea of small clubs and music venues \u2013 they\u2019re an incredible resource in any town and city. They have a personal impact on people when they discover somewhere they feel at home, that\u2019s providing them with entertainment they feel is really life-enhancing. So we lose a lot personally, socially and culturally when those smaller underground venues disappear.\u201d Haslam hopes the Labour government will see their value and intervene.</p> <p>Whether or not the popularity of daytime raves or gigs could produce the next influential subculture remains to be seen. But for those of us who enjoy an early bedtime, it\u2019s a welcome development. \u201cI just think it\u2019s the best thing ever,\u201d says Harper, who is already planning her next daytime parties. \u201cI think dancing and music is a really important part of our wellbeing, and it makes people very happy. It\u2019s so good for our mental and physical health. We\u2019re there to hear great music, support DJs, dance, meet people, be social \u2013 it just ticks every box for me.\u201d While the crowd does tend to be older, she says there are a lot of young people too, who presumably also value an early night. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t spent so much of my younger years staying up all night and then feeling absolutely terrible for days afterwards.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But for those of us who enjoy an early bedtime, it\u2019s a welcome development. \u201cI just think it\u2019s the best thing ever,\u201d says Harper, who is already planning her next daytime parties. \u201cI think dancing and music is a really important part of our wellbeing, and it makes people very happy. It\u2019s so good for our mental and physical health. We\u2019re there to hear great music, support DJs, dance, meet people, be social \u2013 it just ticks every box for me.\u201d While the crowd does tend to be older, she says there are a lot of young people too, who presumably also value an early night. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t spent so much of my younger years staying up all night and then feeling absolutely terrible for days afterwards.\u201d \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just about everyone at the invite-only event found fame in a particular niche. Among the online stars in attendance were <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@aussiebrosquad\">a quartet of brothers</a> who perform highly choreographed dances in public (160,000 followers), <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@joshandmattdesign\">a gay couple</a> who constantly redecorate their home (3.4m followers), and a woman who has built her following <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@theaussierapunzel?lang=en\">on having very long hair</a> (The Aussie Rapunzel, 1.3m followers). Another woman has amassed 1.5m followers by posting videos where she <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jennawiththepink/video/7436667104130059527\">asks strangers if they are currently on their period.</a> These are people who are regularly stopped on the street by fans, and who have so many followers they can make their living from brand deals.</p>    <p>The ceremony, held in Sydney\u2019s Hordern Pavilion, was a safe space for the hyper-online. Brand activations encouraged guests to strike a pose in elaborate photo set-ups. Creators in the audience were live on TikTok all night from their seats, having packed their own portable ring lights \u2013 often meaning the crowd stayed uncomfortably quiet during the award presentations, as it is hard to clap and hold your phone at the same time. It was impossible to use the bathroom without accidentally crashing a TikTok being filmed in the mirror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Leah Halton\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@looooooooch/video/7332342275151760642&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7332342275151760642&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@looooooooch&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@looooooooch?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@looooooooch&lt;/a&gt; Summer\ud83d\ude0a&lt;a title=&quot;inverted&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/inverted?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#Inverted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c Praise Jah In The Moonlight - YG Marley&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/Praise-Jah-In-The-Moonlight-7316395635354127106?refer=embed&quot;&gt;\u266c Praise Jah In The Moonlight - YG Marley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe main advice I have to give is stay true to yourself and hit post,\u201d TikToker Leah Halton told the room, while accepting the award for video of the year for a 12-second <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@looooooooch/video/7332342275151760642\">lip-sync video</a> that has been watched 939m times. \u201cYou never know where it might take you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/26/tiktok-to-block-teenagers-from-beauty-filters-over-mental-health-concerns\">TikTok to block teenagers from beauty filters over mental health concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Entertainment throughout the night spanned the flashy and the absurd.

Beatmaker Cyril Riley enlisted Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll for a song. Host Robert Irwin brought out a live snake. Branded T-shirts were shot into the crowd from an airgun. The evening\u2019s skincare sponsor even had performers dressed as bottles of their product perform a dance to a jagged electronic track while a DJ dropped disembodied spoken word soundbites like \u201cdermatologist recommended\u201d. There were onstage references to memes that were popular on TikTok this year, like the Four Seasons Orlando Baby.</p> <p>But the audience weren\u2019t entirely internet natives. In attendance was 76-year-old TV chef Iain \u201cHuey\u201d Hewitson, nominated in the food category and incongruously sharing a table with the twenty and thirtysomethings also up for the award (eventually won by <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@michaelfinch\">Michael Finch</a>, a former beauty vlogger turned viral chef).

She spoke in her acceptance speech about struggling to find her place in the world, until she found acceptance being herself on TikTok.

It\u2019s 2%,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was bad financial advice you could end up poor, but here you could end up dead.

      "bodyText": "Between them, the Australian online personalities who took the stage at the annual TikTok awards on Wednesday have more than 100 million followers \u2013 but if you\u2019re over the age of 30, you probably haven\u2019t heard of any of them. About 3.4m public votes were cast for this year\u2019s TikTok awards, which honour the top creators in categories like beauty, fitness, food, comedy and music. Just about everyone at the invite-only event found fame in a particular niche. Among the online stars in attendance were a quartet of brothers who perform highly choreographed dances in public (160,000 followers), a gay couple who constantly redecorate their home (3.4m followers), and a woman who has built her following on having very long hair (The Aussie Rapunzel, 1.3m followers). Another woman has amassed 1.5m followers by posting videos where she asks strangers if they are currently on their period. These are people who are regularly stopped on the street by fans, and who have so many followers they can make their living from brand deals. The ceremony, held in Sydney\u2019s Hordern Pavilion, was a safe space for the hyper-online. Brand activations encouraged guests to strike a pose in elaborate photo set-ups. Creators in the audience were live on TikTok all night from their seats, having packed their own portable ring lights \u2013 often meaning the crowd stayed uncomfortably quiet during the award presentations, as it is hard to clap and hold your phone at the same time. It was impossible to use the bathroom without accidentally crashing a TikTok being filmed in the mirror. \u201cThe main advice I have to give is stay true to yourself and hit post,\u201d TikToker Leah Halton told the room, while accepting the award for video of the year for a 12-second lip-sync video that has been watched 939m times. \u201cYou never know where it might take you.\u201d Entertainment throughout the night spanned the flashy and the absurd. US pop star JoJo Siwa, who performed her song Karma and presented the music artist of the year award (won by an absent Royel Otis). Beatmaker Cyril Riley enlisted Australian Idol runner-up Shannon Noll for a song. Host Robert Irwin brought out a live snake. Branded T-shirts were shot into the crowd from an airgun. The evening\u2019s skincare sponsor even had performers dressed as bottles of their product perform a dance to a jagged electronic track while a DJ dropped disembodied spoken word soundbites like \u201cdermatologist recommended\u201d. There were onstage references to memes that were popular on TikTok this year, like the Four Seasons Orlando Baby. But the audience weren\u2019t entirely internet natives. In attendance was 76-year-old TV chef Iain \u201cHuey\u201d Hewitson, nominated in the food category and incongruously sharing a table with the twenty and thirtysomethings also up for the award (eventually won by Michael Finch, a former beauty vlogger turned viral chef). Also present was Dr Karl Kruszelnicki, who won the high quality content creator category for his investigations of topics like why coffee makes you poop. Other winners included ABC personality and primary school teacher Mr. Luke, who posts infectious video updates about the ins and outs of working with \u201ctiny humans\u201d, and took out the learn on TikTok award. Edgar\u2019s Mission, a nonprofit that rescues neglected farm animals, won the TikTok for good award. One award was presented by NSW\u2019s minister for youth, Rose Jackson, who used her time on stage to speak about how social media should be a place that young people can engage with their leaders and hold them to account \u2013 perhaps in reference to the federal government\u2019s proposed social media ban for under-16s. \u201cThere is so much potential for the power of TikTok to be used for good,\u201d she said. But that was the closest the proposed ban got to being mentioned on stage all night. Twenty-three-year-old Bridey Drake was crowned the TikTok creator of the year, the night\u2019s biggest award, for her relatable videos about the struggles of adulthood. She spoke in her acceptance speech about struggling to find her place in the world, until she found acceptance being herself on TikTok. But the ban facing today\u2019s teens wasn\u2019t top of mind for her. \u201cTo be honest with you, I haven\u2019t given it much thought,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy whole mind has been so consumed with the awards.\u201d Kruszelnicki had more to say: \u201cOn one hand, we definitely know the human brain does not mature until the early 20s,\u201d he said. \u201cOn another hand, it would mean that everybody who goes on social media anywhere has to have an ID and everything they say and do can be tracked by the government \u2026 One of the things that bothers me is that if they put in place a unique identifier, then when that identifier gets hacked \u2013 and it will be \u2013 does that mean that this person\u2019s identity is gone for ever? It\u2019s a complicated situation, and I\u2019m still trying to work it out myself.\u201d Kruszelnicki, now in his 70s, is a good few decades older than the other winners. But he is still content with his place on TikTok, where he tries to counter misinformation with scientific facts. \u201cWhat percentage of medical information floating around [social media] do you think is accurate or correct? It\u2019s 2%,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was bad financial advice you could end up poor, but here you could end up dead. I see my role in all of this as trying, in my own little way, to make the world a better place with fewer dead people.\u201d",

She described burning the girl\u2019s kindergarten cot sheets. She said she would take walks in the heavy rain where she could \u201chowl and howl\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a day goes by where I\u2019m not fearful of the future,\u201d the woman said.</p> <p>\u201cI have night terrors, awaking with crippling fear of what might happen if she somehow discovers \u2026 the horrific abuse. I fear that some day someone will make the terrible mistake of revealing our daughter\u2019s identity.\u201d</p> <p>Another victim\u2019s mother said: \u201cI stand here today to express the unimaginable pain \u2026 his heinous actions have left scars that will never heal. He preyed on them \u2026 exploiting their innocence.</p> <p>\u201cThe horror of that knowledge is something I can never escape. The weight of this trauma is unbearable. He took away their trust, their innocence and their ability to feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>The court heard from parents of victims who spoke about forming a close relationship with Griffith.</p> <p>\u201cWe invited him into our home, into our life, and into our family,\u201d one woman, the mother of a victim, said.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole situation has installed a deep mistrust of everyone in our two oldest boys. We were once a very welcoming family, with an open door policy. Since the abuse has come to light there have been noticeable changes in our beautiful, confident girl.\u201d</p> <p>She said her daughter had said: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the dark.

      "bodyText": "Parents and victims who were raped and abused by former childcare worker Ashley Paul Griffith have told a Queensland court about the \u201cunimaginable pain\u201d his crimes have caused. Griffith is being sentenced in the Queensland district court after pleading guilty to committing 307 sexual offences against dozens of children under his care in Brisbane and Italy between 2007 and 2022. Most of the victims are girls who were aged between three and five at the time. The court was told that Griffith \u201clacked empathy for his victims\u201d and had attempted to justify his actions. He sat impassively in the dock, often wringing his hands, as victims and their parents spoke about the impact of his actions. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email A young woman, who was abused by Griffith on more than 50 separate occasions when she was three and four years old, told the court she grew up exhibiting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. She began self-harming at 12 years old and had panic attacks at school. \u201cI will never know what my life could have been like,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI can never know what it would have been to grow up unafraid of people. \u201cHe recorded himself abusing me and put recordings of me on the dark web. His actions have profoundly impacted my life. I have missed out on a normal childhood.\u201d The woman\u2019s mother said, as a five-year-old, the girl had withdrawn from speaking to adults. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have the vocabulary to tell us why she was scared of adults. She just knew they were people to be feared. \u201cHow were we to know the greatest danger to our child was the one entrusted with her care? \u201cHow do you tell your child, who is also at crisis point, that you\u2019ve been the victim of sexual abuse?\u201d Another parent of a victim told the court she had decided never to reveal the abuse to her daughter. She described burning the girl\u2019s kindergarten cot sheets. She said she would take walks in the heavy rain where she could \u201chowl and howl\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s not a day goes by where I\u2019m not fearful of the future,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI have night terrors, awaking with crippling fear of what might happen if she somehow discovers \u2026 the horrific abuse. I fear that some day someone will make the terrible mistake of revealing our daughter\u2019s identity.\u201d Another victim\u2019s mother said: \u201cI stand here today to express the unimaginable pain \u2026 his heinous actions have left scars that will never heal. He preyed on them \u2026 exploiting their innocence. \u201cThe horror of that knowledge is something I can never escape. The weight of this trauma is unbearable. He took away their trust, their innocence and their ability to feel safe.\u201d The court heard from parents of victims who spoke about forming a close relationship with Griffith. \u201cWe invited him into our home, into our life, and into our family,\u201d one woman, the mother of a victim, said. \u201cThis whole situation has installed a deep mistrust of everyone in our two oldest boys. We were once a very welcoming family, with an open door policy. Since the abuse has come to light there have been noticeable changes in our beautiful, confident girl.\u201d She said her daughter had said: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the dark. I\u2019m afraid of what\u2019s in the dark.\u201d How a blanket led to Griffith\u2019s arrest Earlier, prosecutors summarised details of the charges and the investigation that had resulted in Griffith\u2019s arrest. In about 2013, Griffith posted child exploitation material to a now defunct child exploitation community on the dark web under the username Zimble. Authorities had been searching for Zimble for almost a decade until a breakthrough in 2022, when a brand of blanket sold to Queensland childcare centres was identified by investigators in one of the photographs. Griffith was identified by matching centres who had bought those blankets with employment records. Police found Griffith had catalogued video recordings of his offending against dozens of children. He had folders where he \u201cretained enrolment and attendance records and child photographs and \u2026 created montages and films of various interactions\u201d. He pleaded guilty to 15 counts of \u201crepeated sexual contact\u201d, 28 counts of rape, 190 counts of indecent treatment of a child in his care, and 67 counts of making child exploitation material. Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of life imprisonment, with a delay to the statutory 15-year parole eligibility date. The court heard that a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report had found Griffith had a \u201cpaedophilic disorder\u201d but \u201cno other disorders or background factors which explained the offending\u201d. \u201cHe was assessed as having a high level of sexual deviance and is a high risk of reoffending,\u201d the prosecutor said. Despite expressing remorse, those reports found he \u201clacked empathy to the victims\u201d, engaged in \u201cminimisations and cognitive distortions\u201d and had attempted to justify his actions. District court judge Paul Smith will hand down his sentence on Friday.

The Australasian Fire And Emergency Services Authorities Council (Afac) has forecast increased bushfire risk for most of western Victoria, large parts of Western Australia\u2019s south-eastern coastline and central west and much of the Northern Territory interior. In Victoria, greater Melbourne, the Mornington Peninsula and parts of the state\u2019s northeast are also at increased risk. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The risk is also heightened in central northern and central southern New South Wales, and the lower coastal southeast and lower Eyre Peninsula of South Australia. Rainfall across southern Australian was below average into spring, and as a result, soil moisture heading into summer is below average across much of the southern and eastern parts of the country. Mean temperatures for April to October were the third highest on record since 1910. Victoria\u2019s emergency management commissioner, Rick Nugent, said the bushfire season in Victoria had already started. \u201cWe\u2019ve had over 150 grass and scrub fires so far this \u2026 season and two major fires,\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday. \u201cA dry autumn and winter and \u2026 the hottest winter on record with maximum temperatures for Victoria has resulted in higher fuel loads and dryer conditions which will make it easier for fires to start and to run.\u201d Through winter, Victoria\u2019s mean maximum temperature was a record 14.34C, which was 1.31C above the 30-year average from 1961 to 1990. Keris Arndt, a meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology said it had been an exceptionally dry, exceptionally warm winter in the state. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting that heat trend to continue over the next few weeks and as we move into summer, with the indications very strong that we\u2019re heading towards a warm summer, with temperatures forecast during the daytime and the night-time \u2026 to be above average to well above average.\u201d Arndt said that Victoria was expected to have a wetter than average December, but \u201cwe\u2019re coming off the back of a very dry past 18 months. That\u2019s going to take a long while to replenish our catchments. \u201cAll Victorians and many Australians need to prepare for multi-hazard events, whether it be bushfire, whether it be storm associated with flash flooding, and potentially riverine flooding if we get extensive rainfall over an extended period of time.\u201d Afac encouraged people to be vigilant even in areas with normal risk of fires, as \u201ccatastrophic fires can still occur during normal bushfire seasons\u201d. Afac chief executive, Rob Webb, said communities should prepare and implement bushfire plans. \u201cThe dry winter and spring period across southern Australia mean the landscape is well primed for bushfires,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe hope the rains come but it makes sense to plan as if they don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cSit down with your family, work out your plans,\u201d Nugent said. \u201cKnow how you\u2019re going to react and respond, and at different times.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A New South Wales police officer has been suspended from the force without pay after he was convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting a 95-year-old woman in a nursing home with a Taser. It came as Sen Const Kristian James Samuel White, who was found guilty by a jury over the death of Clare Nowland, returned to the supreme court on Thursday where prosecutors argued he should have his bail revoked. White had used a Taser to shoot great-grandmother Clare Nowland, who was armed with a serrated knife and threatening police and staff, at her Cooma nursing home in May 2023. She died a week later from head injuries sustained when she fell backwards from the force of the Taser. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, told reporters shortly after the verdict was handed down on Wednesday that White had been on leave with pay from the police force and his employment was \u201cunder consideration\u201d. In a statement released Thursday morning, NSW police said White had been notified that he was suspended without pay the previous day. \u201cRegarding the officer\u2019s position in the NSW Police Force, the NSW Police Commissioner is following the procedure mandated under the Police Act 1990, s181D,\u201d the police statement said. On Thursday, Justice Ian Harrison heard arguments from the defence and prosecution as to whether White\u2019s bail should be continued and said \u201ca sentence of imprisonment\u201d for the police officer was \u201cnot inevitable\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThese are weighty matters and I want to consider them in detail,\u201d Harrison told the court, as he reserved his decision until Friday. The crown had applied for White to be detained while his sentence was considered. White\u2019s defence, Troy Edwards SC, argued bail should be continued until he is sentenced, because his manslaughter offence was the \u201clowest end of seriousness\u201d. Harrison told the court that most cases he had dealt with involved \u201csome form of intent\u201d that is \u201cnearly always coupled with one or other of emotions such as greed or punishment or revenge or passion\u201d. He said there was no intention to cause harm or serious injury in this case, \u201ceven though that was the outcome\u201d. \u201cThis case is different to any I\u2019ve had to deal with in the past 18 years,\u201d Harrison said.",

      "bodyText": "A senior official in Joe Biden\u2019s administration has told the Associated Press that the US is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and lowering the conscription age to as young as 18. The official, speaking to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age from 25 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available. The Biden administration is preparing another urgent weapons package for Ukraine, this time worth $725m, two US officials said on Wednesday. It is predicted to include land mines, drones, Stinger anti-air missiles, and Himars ammunition, including GMLRS rockets with cluster warheads. The formal notification to Congress of the weapons package could come as soon as Monday, one official said. It is much more than the US president\u2019s recent use of his presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which allows him to use weapons stocks to help allies in an emergency. Recent PDA announcements have typically ranged from $125m to $250 million. Biden has an estimated $4bn to $5bn in PDA already authorised by Congress that he could use before Donald Trump takes over on 20 January. Ukrainian forces made a \u201ccomplex drone and missile strike\u201d against Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Wednesday, targeting the Belbek military airfield and a naval school, according to Russian and Crimean sources cited by the Institute for the Study of War. The attack reportedly used Ukraine\u2019s homegrown Neptune cruise missiles, Soviet-style S200 missiles, western-provided Storm Shadow missiles, 40 strike drones and unspecified ballistic missiles. The US-based thinktank said: \u201cISW continues to assess that the provision of long-range strike weapons to Ukrainian forces will allow Ukrainian forces to augment their existing long-range strike capabilities and scale up the effects Ukraine can generate through long-range strikes against Russian rear areas.\u201d Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due on Thursday to sign Ukraine\u2019s 2025 budget, which calls for the country\u2019s first wartime tax increases. The finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said Ukraine hoped tax increases would generate additional budget revenues of 141bn hryvnia (US$3.39bn). The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said record sums would be directed to weapons production and purchases including modernising Ukraine\u2019s defence industry and buying drones. There was no word on whether South Korea will supply arms to Ukraine after Kyiv\u2019s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, met with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, in Seoul on Wednesday. Yoon\u2019s office said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers, while closely coordinating with the US. Umerov briefed other South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul would strengthen cooperation, the statement said. Umerov predicted a \u201ctangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions\u201d. Russia\u2019s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions, Pjotr Sauer writes. Donald Trump has picked Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia \u2013 a newly conceived role given the ongoing war, Gloria Oladipo writes. Kellogg served as a national security adviser to the former vice-president Mike Pence, then acting security adviser to Trump himself after Michael Flynn had to resign. Kellogg has said he would emphasise getting the two countries to the negotiating table. Russia\u2019s sabotage of western targets may prompt Nato to consider invoking its article 5 mutual defence clause, Bruno Kahl, head of Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, has warned. The BND chief, speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, said he expected Moscow to further step up its hybrid warfare. Nordic and Baltic states and Poland said on Wednesday that they would in the coming months step up support for Ukraine, including to its defence industry, and invest in making more ammunition available. \u201cWe are committed to strengthening our deterrence, and defence, including resilience, against conventional as well as hybrid attacks, and to expanding sanctions against Russia as well as against those who enable Russia\u2019s aggression,\u201d the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden said in a statement. The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, called for more defence spending in Europe over the next five years, as her top team was voted in by a wafer-thin majority in the European parliament. The EU faces acute challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump and the climate crisis, all against a backdrop of deepening fears of economic decline as von der Leyen starts her second term. Poland said on Wednesday that it had detained a German citizen and charged the suspect with brokering and exporting dual-use goods to Russia. The German citizen traded in specialist machines used in the technological industry, which \u2013 through his company \u2013 were illegally sent to Russian military plants involved in the production of weapons, said the Internal Security Agency (ISA). \u201cThe suspect pleaded guilty and filed a motion for voluntary submission to punishment.\u201d Vladimir Putin arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday.

You can read the latest on Democrats winning a California house seat here: Democrat Derek Tran ousted Republican Michelle Steel in a southern California House district Wednesday that was specifically drawn to give Asian Americans a stronger voice on Capitol Hill. Steel said in a statement: \u201cLike all journeys, this one is ending for a new one to begin.\u201d When she captured the seat in 2020, Steel joined Washington state Democrat Marilyn Strickland and California Republican Young Kim as the first Korean American women elected to Congress. Tran, a lawyer and worker rights advocate and the son of Vietnamese refugees, declared victory earlier this week. He said his win \u201cis a testament to the spirit and resilience of our community. As the son of Vietnamese refugees, I understand firsthand the journey and sacrifices many families in our district have made for a better life.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilization laws to allow for the conscription of those as young as 18, the Associated Press reports. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private consultations, said Wednesday that the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18 from the current age of 25 to expand the pool of fighting-age men available to help a badly outnumbered Ukraine in its nearly three-year-old war with Russia. The official said \u201cthe pure math\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight. Currently Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace its battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia\u2019s growing military, the official added. A bill that would accomplish Donald Trump\u2019s goal of abolishing the federal Department of Education has been introduced into the US Senate. The Republican senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota introduced the bill, called the Returning Education to Our States Act, on Thursday. If passed, the bill would see $200bn in funding and the work of the education department redistributed to other federal agencies and states. \u201cThe federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it\u2019s long past time to end this bureaucratic department that causes more harm than good,\u201d Rounds said in a statement announcing the bill. He added: \u201cFor years, I\u2019ve worked toward removing the federal Department of Education. I\u2019m pleased that president-elect Trump shares this vision, and I\u2019m excited to work with him and Republican majorities in the Senate and House to make this a reality. This legislation is a roadmap to eliminating the federal Department of Education by practically rehoming these federal programs in the departments where they belong, which will be critical as we move into next year.\u201d Major responsibilities of the Department of Education would be rerouted to other offices: the administration of federal student loans would become the responsibility of the treasury department; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which enforces protections for the 7.5 million students with special needs, would fall under the Department of Health and Human Services; the Fulbright-Hays Program would be overseen by the Department of State. US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is preparing a $725m weapons package for Ukraine, two US officials told Reuters on Wednesday, as the outgoing president seeks to bolster the government in Kyiv before leaving office in January. According to an official familiar with the plan, the Biden administration plans to provide a variety of anti-tank weapons from US stocks to blunt Russia\u2019s advancing troops, including landmines, drones, Stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). Today So Far Thanks for joining us so far today. Here are some of the top headlines we\u2019ve covered: The Associated Press called two more House races, leaving only one congressional race undecided. Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, won reelection in her district in Iowa; while Democrat Derek Tran won his race in California\u2019s 45th congressional district, beating incumbent Michelle Steel. Canada and Mexico have begun considering retaliatory tariffs they may levy on certain items from the United States should Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods. Several Trump appointees were confirmed to have been targets of bomb threats at their homes on Wednesday. The FBI confirmed it is investigating the threats. Those targeted include: Pete Hegseth, Matt Gaetz, Elise Stefanik, Howard Lutnick and Lee Zeldin. House speaker Mike Johnson said he would host a meeting with Republican lawmakers and the two leaders of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to discuss government cuts next week. A lawsuit was dismissed against Fox News brought by Ray Epps, a Donald Trump supporter who became the subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory about the January 6 attack and sued the outlet for defamation. Democrats are criticizing Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign for failing to critically analyze her loss and any missteps she made. Mark Zuckerberg joined Donald Trump for a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago this afternoon, the New York Times reports. Although the Facebook founder did not back Trump, Zuckerberg called the president-elect in July after the first assassination attempt. Not long after, Zuckerberg called Trump\u2019s response to the attempt on his life \u201cbadass\u201d on a podcast. Zuckerberg joined a host of tech leaders who reached out to Trump in the days leading up to the election. Canada has begun considering retaliatory tariffs it may levy on certain items from the United States should Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian goods, the Associated Press reports. The senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Canada is preparing for every eventuality, but stressed no decision had been made. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is holding an emergency meeting today with leaders of the nation\u2019s provinces, who\u2019ve called on Trudeau to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the US, as opposed to the current, trilateral US-Mexico-Canada agreement. For her part, the Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum announced that her administration is also preparing a list of retaliatory tariffs \u201cif the situation comes to that\u201d. Amid criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s transition from top Democrats like senator Elizabeth Warren, Trump\u2019s team submitted an ethics plan that does not appear to include provisions for the president-elect himself, CNN reports. \u201cThere does not appear to be a provision addressing the requirement for the president-elect to address his conflicts of interest,\u201d Valerie Smith Boyd, director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, told CNN. The president-elect raised eyes for potential conflicts of interest during his first term in matters regarding his businesses and brands, particularly his hotels. During his recent campaign, Trump capitalized on his brand by selling a line of watches, bibles, shoes and NFTs. Trump\u2019s transition team submitted the ethics plan as part of paperwork governing the presidential transition. Although agreements with the Biden White House and General Services Administration were due in September, Trump\u2019s team only signed the White House agreement yesterday (and declined to sign an agreement with the GSA). Negotiations over transition paperwork with the Department of Justice are still ongoing. The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced that he is in contact with law enforcement about the bomb threats and swatting targeting several of Donald Trump\u2019s political appointees. \u201cI\u2019m in touch with law enforcement and closely monitoring the reports of bomb threats targeted at politicians. Violence has no place in our politics. Period. Law enforcement will work to keep everyone safe, and those responsible must be held fully accountable,\u201d Schumer wrote in a social media post. With results still coming in from this year\u2019s House elections, Axios reports that \u201cat least two dozen ambitious House members are already sizing up runs for higher office in 2026\u201d. Those potential runs for office could disrupt the razor-thin margins in the House if candidates are absent campaigning. Axios named a long list of Republicans and Democrats alike considering bids for the Senate or governorship, including congresswoman Nancy Mace and representative Michael McCaul. With Iowa representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks and California representative-elect Derek Tran declared the winners of their respective races, the Associated Press has yet to declare a winner in only one remaining House race. Results are still too close to call in California\u2019s 13th District, where Democrat Adam Gray is slightly ahead of Republican incumbent John Duarte. As the Associated Press called California\u2019s 45th district for Democrat Derek Tran, Republican incumbent Michelle Steel appeared to concede. In a statement posted on social media, Steel did not use the word \u201cconcede\u201d or name Tran but said her journey in Congress \u201cis ending\u201d. \u201cEverything is God\u2019s will and, like all journeys, this one is ending for a new one to begin,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe a debt of gratitude to my supporters, my staff, my family, my daughters and especially my husband, Shawn, for standing by me through endless campaigns. To my volunteers, we would never have made it this far without your tireless efforts. And, to the voters, thank you.\u201d Derek Tran, who won his race for California\u2019s 45th district today, flipped one of just three seats for Democrats this election. The other two pick-ups for Democrats were elsewhere in California and Oregon. Tran, an attorney and Army veteran, defeated two-term Republican Michelle Steel, largely by focusing on her record on abortion rights. Steel had twice co-sponsored a nationwide abortion ban, called the Life at Conception Act, but later withdrew her support from the bill. Despite criticism from Donald Trump, who called Tran a \u201cRadical Left Puppet of Communist China\u201d, Tran was able to dodge such criticism as the son of war refugees from Vietnam. His district \u2013 which is anchored by Orange County \u2013 includes the nation\u2019s largest Vietnamese community. Tran will be the district\u2019s first Vietnamese American representative. He said his win \u201cis a testament to the spirit and resilience of our community. As the son of Vietnamese refugees, I understand firsthand the journey and sacrifices many families in our district have made for a better life.\u201d Democrat Derek Tran has won election to the US House of Representatives in California\u2019s 45th congressional district, beating incumbent Michelle Steel. The AP has called the race for Tran after a weeks-long count. Republicans already control the US House, as well as the Senate, but picking up the seat is a big win for Democrats, who lost it to Steel in 2020. Although Steel initially had a commanding lead, the race became neck and neck as election workers tallied more ballots. Iowa representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, has won reelection to the House of Representatives, the Associated Press announced after a recount. Miller-Meeks\u2019 lead over her opponent, Democrat Christina Bohannan, was less than a percentage point. Although Miller-Meeks had declared victory, the AP had not called the race because the margin was close enough that it could prompt a recount \u2013 which Bohannan\u2019s campaign called for on 14 November. \u201cThis is a delaying tactic to thwart the will of the people,\u201d the Miller-Meeks campaign said of the recount, adding that it wasted taxpayer dollars. \u201cA recount won\u2019t meaningfully change the outcome of this race as the congresswoman\u2019s lead is mathematically impossible to overcome.\u201d Miller-Meeks\u2019 victory gives Republicans 220 seats in the House to Democrats\u2019 214 (the AP has yet to call one remaining House race). It also marks the first time in three decades that Iowa will have an all-Republican congressional delegation. A little-known Florida-based drones company said on Wednesday it had appointed Donald Trump Jr as an adviser \u2013 then saw its stock price surge. The Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly has more on the president-elect\u2019s son: \u201cDon Jr joining our board of advisors provides us unique expertise we need as we bring drone component manufacturing back to America,\u201d said Allan Evans, chief executive of Unusual Machines. By mid-morning on the New York stock exchange, company shares had climbed as high as $11.67, more than double the day\u2019s opening price. Unusual Machines also said Trump Jr, the oldest son of the president-elect, was among its investors. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed Trump Jr as the second-biggest shareholder. In a press release that described Trump Jr as \u201ca globally recognized business leader\u201d and \u201cbest-selling author\u201d, Evans said he would \u201cbring a wealth of experience\u201d. Trump, typically referred to as Don Jr, has spent most of his adult life working for his father\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, on real estate and branding. But he has risen to political prominence since his sister Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, distanced themselves from Donald Trump following his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters who tried in vain to overturn his loss. A host of Trump appointees experienced bomb threats today. To recap the day: Several Trump appointees were confirmed to have been targets of bomb threats at their homes on Wednesday. The FBI confirmed it is investigating the threats. Those targeted include: Pete Hegseth, Matt Gaetz, Elise Stefanik, Howard Lutnick and Lee Zeldin. Trump named some new people to round out his second administration. He added Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health; Jim O\u2019Neill as deputy health secretary; John Phelan as Navy secretary and Keith Kellogg as a special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. House speaker Mike Johnson said he would host a meeting with Republican lawmakers and the two leaders of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to discuss government cuts next week. A lawsuit was dismissed against Fox News brought by Ray Epps, a Donald Trump supporter who became the subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory about the January 6 attack and sued the outlet for defamation. Democrats are criticizing Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign for failing to critically analyze her loss and any missteps she made. Democrats are criticizing Kamala Harris and her campaign for not critically analyzing her run or acknowledging any errors that could have contributed to her loss. Harris participated in a video call to thank donors, clips of which spread around the internet, with one Democratic National Committee official calling the call essentially \u201cjust patting each other on the back\u201d, despite Harris\u2019s loss. Separately, Pod Save America released an episode yesterday with several Harris campaign officials which has received pushback for failing to hold the campaign to account for its decisions and saw the aides defensive rather than reflective of any mistakes. For more on how some Democrats are reacting to the Harris post-mortems, the Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait has the full story: House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that he would host Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy on Capitol Hill next Thursday to talk about ways to cut the government as part of the two men\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency effort. In a post on Musk\u2019s platform, X, Johnson said Republican House and Senate members were invited to \u201cdiscuss major reform ideas to achieve regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings\u2014&amp; revive the principle of limited government!\u201d While it\u2019s called a \u201cdepartment,\u201d the new effort is not a department of the government \u2013 a president cannot unilaterally create a department. Instead, it is expected to offer suggestions to Trump on places to cut, which could include entire agencies and programs. Musk has previously said the government should have 99 agencies, a seemingly arbitrary number, instead of the several hundred it has now. Earlier today, he suggested getting rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency tasked with protecting consumers from predatory behavior in the finance sector. A report released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that abortions decreased by 2% in 2022, the year Roe v Wade was overturned. Since Roe\u2019s demise, abortion restrictions and bans in some states have closed off or limited access in those places \u2013 though other states have increased access. More from the Guardian\u2019s Carter Sherman in the full story here: Lee Zeldin, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the environmental protection agency, said on X that a pipe bomb threat targeting his home \u201cwas sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message\u201d. He and his family weren\u2019t home, he said, and are safe. Zeldin added: \u201cWe are working with law enforcement to learn more as the situation develops. \u201cWe are thankful for the swift actions taken by local officers to keep our family, neighbors, and local community secure.\u201d Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose Keith Kellogg to serve as a special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, a newly created role as the two countries remain at war and the US\u2019s support for Ukraine will be a key decision for Trump\u2019s incoming administration. Kellogg previously served as a national security adviser to Trump and to former vice president Mike Pence in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cI am very pleased to nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cKeith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration. He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!\u201d The choice comes after reports last week that Trump was considering Richard Grenell for the role. Grenell served as intelligence chief during Trump\u2019s first term. More members of Trump\u2019s cabinet have emerged as subjects of bomb threats today. So far, those known to have had their residences targeted are: Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary and part of his transition team, whose home was threatened, Bronx outlet News 12 reported. Lee Zeldin, the environmental protection agency pick, who saw his Long Island home threatened, News 12 in Long Island reported. Matt Gaetz, the initial nominee for attorney general who has since withdrawn, had his Florida home targeted, various news reports said. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s UN ambassador choice, confirmed her home in New York was targeted. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary pick, whose home was targeted. Those targeted appear to be physically safe, and law enforcement has responded to check their homes for any devices or threats, several outlets have reported. The FBI has confirmed bomb threats and swatting incidents against Trump cabinet picks. In a statement, the agency said it is \u201caware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees\u201d and working with other law enforcement agencies to respond. \u201cWe take all potential threats seriously and, as always, encourage members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement,\u201d the statement said. Fox News has welcomed the dismissal of a defamation case brought by Ray Epps, a Donald Trump supporter who became the subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory about the January 6 attack. A Fox News Media statement referred to other dismissed lawsuits when it said: \u201cFollowing the dismissals of the Jankowicz, Bobulinski, and now Epps cases, Fox News is pleased with these back-to-back decisions from federal courts preserving the press freedoms of the first amendment.\u201d Epps, now 63, is a former US marine and ex-member of the Oath Keepers militia who traveled from Arizona to Washington on 6 January 2021, as Trump sought to overturn his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. Epps was eventually sentenced to probation for his role in the attack on Congress that ensued, a riot linked to nine deaths and over which Trump was impeached but acquitted. After becoming subject to claims he was a covert government agent who stirred Trump supporters to cause trouble, Epps was forced into hiding. At his own sentencing, Epps said: \u201cI have learned that truth is not always found in the places that I used to trust.\u201d He filed suit against Fox in July last year. The suit said: \u201cIn the aftermath of the events of January 6, Fox News searched for a scapegoat to blame other than Donald Trump or the Republican party. Eventually, they turned on one of their own.\u201d The suit cited Fox News hosts including Laura Ingraham and Will Cain but most prominently Tucker Carlson, who it said \u201cwas bluntly telling his viewers that it was a fact that Epps was a government informant. And they believed him.\u201d Carlson was not a target of the suit \u2013 a lawyer for Epps said he \u201cwas an employee of Fox when he lied about Ray, and Fox broadcast those defamatory falsehoods. Fox is therefore fully liable for Mr Carlson\u2019s statements.\u201d Carlson was fired by Fox in April 2023, shortly after it settled (for $787.5m) a defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the advancement of Trump\u2019s electoral fraud lie. Carlson has since flourished as an independent voice in far-right media, retaining influence with Trump as the president-elect prepares to return to power in January. Pete Hegseth, nominated to be Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary, was among several cabinet nominees and appointees of the president-elect who were targeted with bomb threats and so-called swatting on Wednesday, the Guardian has learned. A report also emerged that former congressman Matt Gaetz, who was briefly Trump\u2019s first choice for US attorney general but stood aside after eight days amid a sexual misconduct scandal, was also targeted. A spokesperson for Trump confirmed threats against some of his cabinet picks but did not initially give any names or say how many people had received threats. But Hegseth, the military veteran steeped in controversy over his conservative views after being selected, was understood to be among the number, according to two people familiar with the developments. Reports by the Trump transition team that multiple Trump appointees and nominees were targeted by bomb threats and swatting comes amid a season of heightened concerns about political violence \u2013 and following two assassination attempts against Trump himself. On 13 July, a shooter fired into the crowd during an open-air Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, injuring two attendees and killing one. Trump was grazed by the gunfire but emerged almost entirely uninjured. Two months later, on 15 September, a suspect was caught while pointing a gun toward Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago golf course, where Trump was golfing. He was apprehended the same day. Both incidents prompted the Trump and Harris campaigns to adopt heightened security for the duration of the race. After the Pennsylvania shooting, Trump frequently appeared at rallies behind bulletproof glass. Elise Stefanik, the congresswoman and Trump\u2019s appointee for ambassador to the United Nations, confirmed on X that there was a bomb threat at her home. \u201cThis morning, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, her husband, and their three year old son were driving home to Saratoga County from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence,\u201d her X post says. Law enforcement responded immediately, she noted, \u201cwith the highest levels of professionalism.\u201d Leavitt wrote that the threats transpired Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, and included bomb threats and swatting, which refers to false reports of a crime to prompt police raids on a person\u2019s home. Law enforcement \u201cacted quickly,\u201d wrote Leavitt, adding that \u201cPresident Trump and the entire Transition team are grateful for their swift action.\u201d Leavitt did not say who specifically was targeted. In a statement, Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt wrote that \u201cseveral\u201d of Trump\u2019s cabinet appointments had been targeted with bomb threats and swatting. \u201cIn response, law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted,\u201d wrote Leavitt. In case you missed it, Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is planning for appointees to receive immediate security clearances, bypassing FBI background checks when Trump takes office, per a Guardian exclusive. Hugo Lowell reports: Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is planning for all political appointees to receive sweeping security clearances on the first day and only face FBI background checks after the incoming administration takes over the bureau and its own officials are installed in key positions, according to people familiar with the matter. The move appears to mean that Trump\u2019s team will continue to skirt FBI vetting and may not receive classified briefings until Trump is sworn in on 20 January and unilaterally grant sweeping security clearances across the administration. Trump\u2019s team has regarded the FBI background check process with contempt for months, a product of their deep distrust of the bureau ever since officials turned over transition records to the Russia investigation during the first Trump presidency, the people said. Federal employees fear doxxing and retaliation after Elon Musk posted on social media the names and titles of multiple people who hold climate-related positions but who are not public figures, CNN has reported. Musk, who will co-lead an unofficial government body seeking to reduce spending \u2013 the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (DOGE) \u2013 with Vivek Ramaswamy, posted the names of the employees on X, prompting at least one of them to delete her accounts in fear of retaliation by Musk\u2019s followers. In a post, Hadas Gold, the author of the CNN story noted that she \u201cwas stunned when multiple experts in this field declined to speak to me on the record for fear of themselves becoming a target of Elon Musk.\u201d Also in Trump transition news: last night Trump announced he had nominated John Phelan, an investor and GOP megadonor who contributed to the Trump 2024 campaign, to be secretary of the Navy. \u201cJohn will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision,\u201d Trump wrote in a statement. \u201cHe will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else.\u201d Phelan has not served in the military. His nomination follows Trump\u2019s decision to pick Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality and rightwing ideologue who was investigated by police for an alleged sexual assault, to serve as the secretary of defense. The US has negotiated the release of three Americans from Chinese custody in a prisoner swap. It\u2019s a diplomatic win for the Biden administration, which has brought home more than 70 formerly imprisoned Americans abroad in the last four years, according to Politico, which first reported the exchange. The Americans, Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung, will be transferred to a medical facility for health screening. The negotiations follow the high-profile release of numerous Americans from Russian custody, including the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Trump also named several high level health officials to serve in his next cabinet. Jim O\u2019Neill was nominated to serve as Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy under Robert F Kennedy Jr, who was picked to lead the department. O\u2019Neill previously served in the HHS department under George W Bush, before working in Silicon valley, where he invested in several business ventures with PayPal chief executive Peter Thiel. \u201c[O\u2019Neill] will oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\u201d said Trump in a statement. ' Jay Bhattacharya, a physician and Stanford professor, was picked to lead the National Institutes of Health. Bhattacharya is a major critic of the US government\u2019s response to Covid-19, including lockdowns during the virus\u2019s peak. He later published a paper in October 2020 arguing that those who are less vulnerable to the virus should resume normal life. Trump has continued to build out his cabinet as concerns about his transition intensify. Late Tuesday, Trump tapped Jamieson Greer, a lawyer who worked under Trump\u2019s previous trade representative Robert Lighthizer, to serve as the next trade representative. If confirmed, Greer would oversee the trade deficit and work to expand \u201cexport markets everywhere\u201d, Trump said in a statement. Greer would likely oversee the implementation of Trump\u2019s plans to levy tariffs on Mexica, China and Canada. On Greer, Trump said: \u201cJamieson played a key role during my First Term in imposing Tariffs on China and others to combat unfair Trade practices, and replacing the failed NAFTA deal with USMCA, therefore making it much better for American Workers.\u201d The MOU was supposed to be signed weeks ago, before the election. Trump has already indicated he will sidestep standard transition processes, including, The Guardian has reported, by issuing security clearances to appointees without requiring FBI background checks. In refusing to sign a transition agreement with the DOJ regarding FBI background checks, the incoming Trump administration stands to forgo access to classified information from Biden administration officials. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about key Trump appointees avoiding the standard security clearance process \u2013 which will likely arise during senate confirmation hearings early next year. Good morning, US politics blog readers. US senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, blasted an agreement announced between Donald Trump\u2019s transition team and the Joe Biden White House last night as failing \u201cto answer key questions about national security threats and FBI vetting of nominees\u201d, thereby increasing \u201cconcerns about corruption\u201d. We\u2019ll have more details and also cover all the other politics news today, as it happens. Here\u2019s what\u2019s afoot: The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the incoming Trump and outgoing Biden administrations outlining some terms of the transfer of power departs from the norm in a few key ways, which is raising eyebrows on Washington. The Trump team said the transition will be privately funded and will not utilize \u201cgovernment buildings or technology [...] and will operate as a self-sufficient organization.\u201d Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff said the transition team \u201chas an existing ethics plan\u201d, which she said would be uploaded to the General Services Administration website. Warren called Trump\u2019s use of private funds \u201cnothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.\u201d She expressed \u201cconcerns of corruption\u201d. There is a fresh flurry of Trump appointments. Among those announced last night were John Phelan, an investor and Trump campaign donor, as his pick for secretary of the Navy, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health researcher who opposed Covid-19 lockdowns, to head the National Institutes of Health.",

      "bodyText": "The communications minister\u2019s office has apologised to multiple people harmed by the gambling industry after delaying long-awaited advertising reforms, admitting government action has taken \u201clonger than hoped\u201d. Emails seen by Guardian Australia shows Michelle Rowland\u2019s office \u201ccan\u2019t confirm a revised timeframe\u201d for when it will formally respond to a report from the late Labor MP Peta Murphy, which called for a total wagering ad ban some 18 months ago. \u201cI acknowledge the ongoing toll this is taking on you and others, and I\u2019m personally very sorry that we have not been able to secure an outcome thus far,\u201d a staffer for the minister said in an email. \u201cAs a general observation though, I would note that decisions of this type require the support of the PM and Cabinet \u2013 ie, it\u2019s not enough for a Minister to have formed a view.\u201d The staff member, who Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, was replying to a query from Mark Kempster, who has campaigned for wagering changes as part of the Alliance for Gambling Reform group. Kempster, who has battled gambling addiction, made a submission to Murphy\u2019s inquiry calling for all gambling advertising to be removed from Australian TV, and banning the targeting of customers with promotion material. Kempster wrote to Rowland\u2019s office on Monday, saying he \u201ccan not really fathom how this has been delayed again\u201d. His email came days after the government confirmed the gambling reforms would not be introduced this year \u2013 less than a week after Rowland herself had told the ABC in a television interview that she was planning on revealing Labor\u2019s plans by the end of 2024. \u201cThe effect the constant delays is having on all of us who gave evidence as Peta\u2019s inquiry is taking a massive toll on us. To wait up to 20 months for any type of response and actions surely can not be acceptable,\u201d Kempster wrote. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email On Wednesday, a staff member in Rowland\u2019s office responded, writing: \u201cYou\u2019re right that we had committed to finalising our decision and making a public announcement on online wagering advertising reform by the end of the year.\u201d \u201cAny changes to legislation, etc would then be introduced to Parliament at the earliest opportunity next year,\u201d the staffer wrote. \u201cHowever, it now seems as though we won\u2019t be in a position to do this and I can\u2019t confirm a revised timeframe. I appreciate that this is really frustrating and hard to understand.\u201d Rowland\u2019s staffer conceded \u201cthis process is taking longer than hoped\u201d but said the government was focusing on \u201censuring that reforms are effective and comprehensive\u201d, as well as building on previously-announced reforms. The staffer sent a near-identical email to another gambling harm advocate who also queried the government\u2019s delay. The government has not given a specific reason for not having yet responded to the Murphy report, but the sport minister, Anika Wells, said on Monday that sporting codes\u2019 financial viability was a factor in Labor concluding its proposed gambling ad cap \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to go\u201d. Rowland\u2019s staffer, in the email to Kempster, said they acknowledged \u201cthe ongoing toll this is taking on you and others, and I\u2019m personally very sorry that we have not been able to secure an outcome thus far.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted the offices of Rowland and Anthony Albanese for comment. In a statement, Rowland confirmed the legislation would not be introduced this year, and that the government was \u201ccontinuing to engage with relevant stakeholders.\u201d \u201cAs we have seen in the past bad policy designs leads to bad outcomes. It is important we take the time to get these reforms right,\u201d she said. Tim Costello, chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform, said in a press conference on Wednesday that the government should act. \u201cWithin the prime minister\u2019s power is the opportunity to simply say, we are implementing the Murphy report. Eighteen months on, this is a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes backbone to protect children in this nation against very powerful vested interests.

      "body": "<p>Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.</p> <p>Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.</p> <p>The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023.

      "bodyText": "Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog. Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X. The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook Facebook, reaching more than 44 million adults. Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google\u2019s search engine this year. Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: \u201cGoogle\u2019s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.\u201d Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content, forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit\u2019s stock market flotation in March this year. The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its takeover by Elon Musk in 2022 but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X launched by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta. The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog\u2019s annual report into the nation\u2019s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online. The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of electoral fraud in the UK. The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",

      "bodyText": "A female inmate remained handcuffed to a male prison officer while she had a mammogram, in an example of prisoners being denied their dignity while receiving NHS care, a watchdog has revealed. The incident is highlighted in a report by the Health Services Safety Investigation Body (HSSIB) into the difficulties prisoners can face when they leave jail to see a GP or visit a hospital. Some inmates are put on a long chain, with the prison officer guarding them staying just outside the room, while others are made to wait in cupboards for their appointments, it found. A government spokesperson said the report\u2019s findings, based on interviews with more than 120 prisoners, were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d, especially about problems experienced by female inmates. The prospect that prisoners will not have the same dignity and privacy during NHS appointments as other patients is a key reason why more than half do not attend those which occur outside prison. HSSIB found that \u201cdid not attend\u201d (DNA) rates for outpatient appointments during 2024 for those in prison \u201cwere high, at 43% and 48% for males and females respectively. This compares to a DNA rate in the general population of 26% for both sexes\u201d, it said. Female prisoners being escorted to an external appointment by either male or mixed teams of prison officers \u201ccan affect the patients\u2019 decision-making about whether to go or not, particularly for appointments that are for sensitive female clinics, such as obstetrics and gynaecology\u201d, it added. HSSIB identified a number of situations in which inmates can be deprived of their dignity when receiving NHS care outside: \u2022 male and female prisoners being seen handcuffed in public and wearing prison-issue clothing \u2022 prison guards remaining present during the clinical appointment \u2022 escorts to outpatient appointments being the opposite sex HSSIB was told by one unnamed national organisation that anxiety among patients about waiting to see a doctor or nurse with an inmate in the same room had led to \u201cpatients (prisoners) being made to wait in broom cupboards to avoid interaction with, or being seen by, other patients\u201d. One female prison which inspectors visited \u201chas made efforts to try to reduce privacy and dignity concerns by using side entrances at one of the hospitals and not taking the patient into the hospital until the appointment was about to start\u201d, to minimise interaction with other people waiting. Dr Miranda Davies, a senior fellow at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank and expert on prison healthcare, said: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that women in prison may not want to go to a hospital appointment with a male prison officer for an intimate health procedure. \u201cWomen in prison, just like those outside of prison, want to be treated with respect and feel listened to when they have concerns, and where this doesn\u2019t happen it ultimately puts women\u2019s health at risk.\u201d Research which Davies led, published in 2022, found that women in jail are almost twice as likely as the general population to miss an appointment for obstetric care \u2013 31% compared to 17%. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis is a deeply concerning report. \u201cWe are committed to improving care for every patient, including better addressing the specific needs of female prisoners and will work with NHS England to respond in due course.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2024.
