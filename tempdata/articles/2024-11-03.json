In an interview with Guardian Australia, Bowen said some Australians were open to nuclear energy but he was not concerned as there was a difference between people being open to it and agreeing to it. \u201cWhen you say to people, whether it\u2019s in a formal market research setting or a punter in the street setting, \u2018I don\u2019t object to nuclear, morally \u2026 but I object to it because it\u2019s so expensive, but probably even more importantly, because it takes so long, and we don\u2019t have time if we\u2019re going to wait the 20 to 30 years it would take, and that means more coal in the system and coal in the system longer, and even the Liberals aren\u2019t proposing to build new coal-fired power stations so they\u2019re just going to rely on these old ones longer, and that\u2019s blackouts\u2019 \u2013 then the support or openness evaporates.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, has promised more details of the opposition\u2019s proposal before the end of the year. He has rejected claims there would be a risk of an electricity shortage under its plan and said government and clean energy industry analysis of how much it would cost were inaccurate as they were not based on its full policy.",

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris dodged a question on Sunday on if she voted for California\u2019s Proposition 36, a controversial ballot measure that increases sentences for certain drug and theft crimes. \u201cI am not gonna talk about the vote on that because, honestly, it\u2019s the Sunday before the election and I don\u2019t intend to create an endorsement one way or the other,\u201d the US vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee, who votes in California, told reporters at a rally in Detroit. As San Francisco district attorney and later as California\u2019s attorney general, Harris\u2019s record on criminal justice has come under intense scrutiny, with her opponents saying she has a history of pivoting on criminal justice depending on the political circumstances. If passed, Proposition 36 would see people who fail to complete drug treatment jailed, increased punishments for some theft and drug crimes \u2013 including turning misdemeanors into felonies \u2013 and requires courts to warn people convicted of selling or providing illegal drugs to others that they can be charged with murder if they keep doing so and someone dies. The California legislature\u2019s non-partisan fiscal and policy adviser has said the measure will increase the state\u2019s criminal justice costs by requiring some people who now serve their sentences at the county level to serve them in state prison, and by increasing state court workloads. \u201cIn total, Proposition 36 would increase local criminal justice costs, likely by tens of millions of dollars annually,\u201d the adviser board has said. The measure has become a deeply divisive issue as major California cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, struggle to contain high rates of homelessness and drug addiction and attendant rates of crime. Beyond the ballot measure, the San Francisco mayor, London Breed, a Democrat, is in a difficult re-election fight against challengers who say she has allowed the city to spiral out of control. The moderate Democratic mayor faces four main challengers on the 5 November ballot, all fellow Democrats, who say Breed has squandered her six years in office. They say she allowed San Francisco to descend into chaos and blamed others for her inability to rein in homelessness and erratic street behavior, all while burglarized businesses pleaded for help. Crime data shows the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles saw a steady increase in shoplifting between 2021 and 2022, according to a study by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California. Across the state, shoplifting rates rose during the same time period but were still lower than the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, while commercial burglaries and robberies have become more prevalent in urban counties, the study says. Proposition 36 also represents a rollback of an earlier ballot measure, Proposition 47, that sought to decrease prison overcrowding by reducing some felonies to misdemeanors. Many law enforcement officials have blamed that 2014 initiative for increasing homelessness and crime in the state. Harris, in 2014, also declined to take a position on Proposition 47, and reportedly laughed when she was asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. She reversed that opinion in 2018 and now says she feels \u201cstrongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed\u201d. \u201cI just think we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior,\u201d Harris said last month during an interview on the podcast All the Smoke.

      "bodyText": "The pro-western incumbent Maia Sandu has won a second term in office in the Moldovan presidential election, preliminary results have shown, marking a significant boost for the country\u2019s EU aspirations and a clear rebuke to Moscow. The runoff election was seen as a crucial indicator of whether the country\u2019s long-term geopolitical alignment will be with Russia or Europe. The pro-western incumbent, Sandu, who has intensified the nation\u2019s efforts to break away from Moscow\u2019s influence, was facing the Kremlin-friendly political newcomer, Alexandr Stoianoglo, from the Socialist party, in the second round of voting on Sunday. With 98% of the ballots counted, Sandu led with 54.35%, the Central Election Commission said. With only parts of the country\u2019s diaspora vote still outstanding, analysts said that Sandu was all but guaranteed to win re-election. Early results indicated that the large Moldovan diaspora, accounting for about 20% of the electorate, had overwhelmingly voted for Sandu. The result will be a significant boost for Sandu and her long-term EU agenda. In her victory speech, delivered after nearly all votes were tallied, Sandu said that she had listened to the voices of her supporters and those of her opponent, Stoianoglo. She said that her primary goal for the coming years would be to serve as a president for all citizens. \u201cToday, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books... Freedom, truth, and justice have prevailed,\u201d she said. Sandu\u2019s position was weakened after a referendum she initiated, asking Moldovans whether they supported EU integration, that was passed by only the tiniest of margins on 20 October. The referendum was held alongside the first round of the presidential elections where Sandu received 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority. The election outcome will be welcomed in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state hoping to join the EU, re-elected a party viewed by most countries as increasingly Moscow-friendly and authoritarian. On Sunday night, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her re-election victory and the country\u2019s \u201cEuropean future\u201d. \u201cIt takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you\u2019ve faced in this election. I\u2019m glad to continue working with you towards a European future for Moldova and its people,\u201d von der Leyen wrote on X. The EU has promised a \u20ac1.8bn multiyear package for Moldova to help it on the accession path which the country officially began in June. Sandu has pledged to \u201cwork night and day\u201d to take Moldova into the EU by 2030. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moldova has gravitated between pro-western and pro-Russian courses. But under Sandu, a former World Bank adviser, the impoverished country has accelerated its push to escape Moscow\u2019s orbit as the war in neighbouring Ukraine continues. Both presidential election rounds as well as the EU referendum vote were marred by accusations of Russian interference. For months, Sandu and her allies have accused Russia and its proxies of leading a large-scale campaign involving vote-buying and misinformation to sway the election. Officials in the capital of Chi\u0219in\u0103u believe that Moscow invested approximately $100m (\u00a377.2m) before the first vote and had reportedly smuggled in some of the funds by \u201cmoney mules\u201d detained by police at the main airport while carrying bundles of \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,390) in cash. Sandu\u2019s team said it intensified efforts to prevent a repeat of what they described as a large-scale vote-buying scheme orchestrated by the Russian-backed fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor during the first round. \u201cMoldova has had a monumental task before it: just two weeks to stop a sprawling Kremlin-backed vote-buying scheme that proved effective in the twin vote on 20 October,\u201d said Olga Rosca, a foreign policy adviser to Sandu. Still, on Sunday, Sandu\u2019s national security adviser, Stanislav Secrieru, wrote on X that they were \u201cseeing massive interference by Russia in our electoral process \u2026 an effort with high potential to distort the outcome\u201d. \u201cCybersecurity agency reports the Central Election Commission\u2019s voter education site was temporarily down this morning due to a DDoS attack,\u201d Secrieru added. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the vote. \u201cWe resolutely reject any accusations that we are somehow interfering in this. We are not doing this,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The tight result of the EU referendum has weakened Sandu\u2019s standing, placing her in direct opposition to Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who exceeded expectations with 26% of the vote on the Party of Socialists\u2019 ticket. In last weekend\u2019s presidential debate, Sandu accused Stoianoglo of being a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d candidate for outside interests bent on seizing control of Moldova. Stoianoglo has denied working on behalf of Russia. In an interview with the Guardian in October, he claimed that he was in favour of joining the EU but boycotted the vote, calling it a parody. He has also declined to criticise the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and called for improved relations with Moscow. \u201cThe level of Russian interference in Moldova is highly exaggerated,\u201d he said, adding that he would seek a \u201creset of relations\u201d with Moscow. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has shocked many in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, which is just a few hours\u2019 drive from Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea port city of Odesa, and the Kremlin\u2019s shadow looms large.

It certainly led to some uneasy combinations soundtrack dance style. There was also inconsistency in how closely the theme was followed. Some celebrities slavishly dressed up as the musician in question, while others didn\u2019t.</p> <p>It was fun but felt a little gratuitous, presumably aimed at pulling in younger viewers. With Movies, Halloween, Blackpool and Musicals, we\u2019ve probably got enough theme weeks.

Sadly it didn\u2019t quite happen. Her 10th place finish matches his 2022 partner, <strong>Ellie Simmonds</strong>. In his debut series, he came sixth with <strong>Tilly Ramsay</strong>. Last year, he formed a dynamite all-male duo with <strong>Layton Williams</strong> and finished runner-up.</p> <p>His 2023 partner was watching from the studio audience tonight. Wonder if Nikita was vaguely tempted to pop a blonde wig on Layton and draft him in for the dance-off instead?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6727d75c8f0869c6d52e5763\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:05:04.051Z\">8.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sighs of relief from male celebs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Pete Wicks</strong> won\u2019t be the only one thanking his lucky stars tonight. <strong>Chris McCausland</strong>, <strong>Wynne Evans </strong>and <strong>Jamie Borthwick </strong>all scored fewer points than Montell last night and did well to stay out of the bottom two.</p> <p>After two dance-offs in the past three weeks, <strong>Shayne Ward</strong> will also have feared the worst. All of them need to mop their brows and knuckle down if they\u2019re going to make it to Blackpool.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6727d7388f080a1fc5f95b7c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:04:35.611Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pete Wicks did well not to bite the dust</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Freddie Mercury impersonator <strong>Pete Wicks</strong> was cut adrift at the bottom of the scoreboard by a long way last night. He was bottom of the pile by massive seven-point margin - the biggest gap of the series so far. Despite dancing in the slot of death, however, voting viewers rode to his rescue and the lion-maned, moustachioed TOWIE alumnus dodged the dance-off.</p> <p>Pete the wet otter can thank his popularity. He\u2019s proved amusingly dry-witted, formed a likeable partnership with <strong>Jowita Przystal </strong>(complete with showmance rumours) and fallen in love with dance, steadily improving each week - at least until last night\u2019s salsa setback. He\u2019s fortunate to outlast <strong>Sam Quek</strong>. She not only outscored him by seven points on Saturday but Pete is the lowest average scorer left in the field by fully three points - he averages 24, Sam 27. Lucky lad.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6727d71d8f0869c6d52e5760\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:04:06.852Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam\u2019s exit leaves a male-heavy field</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We started the series with a male-skewed field. Now the scales are further tipped. After the departures of <strong>Dr Punam Krishan</strong> and <strong>Sam Quek</strong> in consecutive weeks, only three female celebrities remain in the contest, alongside six males.</p> <p>At least the three women who do remain - <strong>Tasha Ghouri</strong>, <strong>Sarah Hadland</strong> and <strong>Montell Douglas </strong>- are the three highest scorers. We can count on at least one of them reaching the final, surely?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6727d6f38f080a1fc5f95b77\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:03:37.045Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam never quite hit her straps</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You might have thought that the legions of Swifties would save her. Sadly, they didn\u2019t vote in sufficient numbers. When <strong>Sam Quek</strong> was consigned to the dance-off against the far superior <strong>Montell Douglas</strong>, the result was all but guaranteed.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a curious contest for Sam. She had plenty of potential but never quite seemed to fulfil it. Lacking any performance background, she let nerves affect her, often making mistakes or losing her timing during routines. She also seemed to be harshly criticised by the judges, where others got away more lightly. As a hockey star-turned-sports presenter, she took it on the chin, refused to make excuses and trained hard alongside her pro partner <strong>Nikita Kuzmin</strong>, with whom she developed lovely chemistry.</p> <p>The highlights of Sam\u2019s seven-week stint were when she could play a character. Her Lara Croft paso doble in Movie Week and her Rocky Horror jive in the Halloween special were the only times her score climbed into the 30s. As a Liverpudlian, she\u2019ll be gutted to fall a fortnight short of Blackpool but she was, in her own words, \u201ctotally boss\u201d. Ta-ra, Samba Quekstep.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6727d6d78f0869c6d52e575e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:02:57.650Z\">8.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Will Amy return next week?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>No official word yet on whether much-loved Welsh pro <strong>Amy Dowden</strong> will be back from illness to partner <strong>JB Gill </strong>again next week but let\u2019s hope so.</p> <p>Her fellow professional <strong>Lauren Oakley</strong> did a brilliant job deputising this week and is always a joy to watch.

However, <strong>Montell Douglas</strong> being consigned to the dreaded dance-off was arguably the biggest surprise of the series so far.</p> <p>She scored three nines for Saturday\u2019s gorgeous Whitney waltz and was fourth on the scoreboard. Yet she clearly didn\u2019t get enough viewer votes, tumbling five places into the danger zone. Montell was always likely to edge out the weaker <strong>Sam Quek</strong> in the dance-off but she\u2019s the third highest scorer in the field, with a strong chance of reaching the final. An early exit would have felt deeply unjust.</p> <p>As an athlete and Gladiator, we can rely on her competitive fire to ensure she bounces back strongly. And hey, at least her partner <strong>Johannes Radebe</strong> got to lead that fierce Beyonc\u00e9-themed pro dance.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6727d6478f0869c6d52e575a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T20:01:24.791Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam and Nikita\u2019s last dance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the eliminated couple trip the light fantastic one last time to Go Your Own Way by Fleetwood Mac, the credits roll and their castmates crowd around.

Fun , frisky choreography as they fly around the floor. Then it segues into Hey Jude and confetti falls. Peace signs to finish. A crowd-pleaser.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Help! by the Beatles.

Either way, the song means a lot to Tasha Ghouri as an empowerment anthem. Emotional VT about social media trolling when she was on Love Island. Tasha has topped the leaderboard three times and become bookies\u2019 favourite to get the first perfect 40 of the series. Can she lure out Craig\u2019s 10 paddle here? A cool Couple\u2019s Choice routine, choreographed by Lukas McFarlane who has worked with P!nk herself. Contemporary lyrical in style, telling a story from the heart. Barefoot and beautiful. Maybe a bit too wafty, lacking P!nk\u2019s signature power and personality. Great lifts. She barely touched the floor for a while there. Powerful, full of feeling, stunning.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>What About Us by P!nk. The anthemic 2017 electro-pop chart-topper has politically charged lyrics about Trump\u2019s government failing the American people, told from the perspective of the unheard and forgotten.

Could it help secure a solo top spot for Jamie Borthwick too, after he\u2019s jointly topped the leaderboard for two weeks running? An apt choice because George was a huge EastEnders fan and often visited the set. Memorial clip of Heather Trott (RIP, sob). He was also half-Cypriot like Michelle Tsiakkas, so he\u2019s got a connection to them both. Giotsr and jukebox-ography. Terrible dad jeans but Jamie getting right into character. Decent job at oiling up his hips and nailing the tricky samba technique. Strange music-to-dance mismatch but entertaining and well executed. A Whamba of a samba.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Faith by George Michael. Conceived as a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll pastiche with growly vocals and a classic Bo Diddley beat, it was originally only two minutes long and never intended to be a single, just a snappy album track. When George changed his mind, he went back and extended it with a guitar solo.

Elements of The Bodyguard\u2019s film narrative in a story of love and loss. Montell says she\u2019s a Latin girl but her Viennese waltz three weeks ago was gorgeous and notched her first nine. The international version is the most exposing ballroom dance due to its slowness but she\u2019s showing control, precision and poise. For a powerhouse athlete, she brings effortless elegance, delicacy and softness to ballroom dances. Romantic mood and stylish. A slight stumble mid-routine, I thought, but strong finish and all-round gaw-jus. </p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>I Will Always Love You to Whitney Houston. It was first released by Dolly Parton 50 years ago as a farewell to her partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, expressing Dolly\u2019s decision to go solo. Impressively, she wrote Jolene on the same day. Whitney\u2019s 1992 cover version sold 24m copies worldwide, topped the UK chart for 10 weeks and became the bestselling single of all time by a female solo artist. Dolly famously declined to let Elvis Presley cover it when his manager Colonel Tom Parker demanded she sign over half the publishing rights. Dolly stood her ground and said: \u201cWhen Whitney\u2019s version came out, I made enough money to buy Graceland.\u201d Attagirl.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67267d468f080a1fc5f9534f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-02T19:29:52.968Z\">7.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Amy: </strong>9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points.

Madonna Louise Ciccone has Italian heritage, of course, so Vito Coppola is happy. He\u2019s been busy researching 1980s cha-chas so he can incorporate authentic period steps into the choreography. Admirable attention to detail. No cloak mishap like Madge at the Brits, thankfully. Whips it off to reveal a cone bra and leaps into Vito\u2019s arms. Fast and technically tricky, with lots of rotation, footwork and finesse. Party spirit and cracking characterisation. Maybe lacking a little in the leg action and fluidity at times but loads of va-va-voom. Woof, what a number.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Like a Prayer by Madonna. The 1989 dance-gospel single became infamous for its provocative music video, which featured a dream sequence of Madonna kissing a blank saint in church. The Vatican condemned it, TV stations banned it and religious groups organised a boycott of Pepsi, which used the song in an advert and subsequently cancelled their sponsorship deal with Madge. But hey, all publicity is good publicity.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-02T21:19:44.079Z\">at 9.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-672679188f0869c6d52e4f3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-02T19:11:49.530Z\">7.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: </strong>6, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 29 points.

He\u2019s a big rock fan and prefers being in ballroom hold, both factors which should help here. Looking suitably Gene Simmons-esque in facepaint and a studded, mirrored black outfit. Solo section to start with axe and drum kit action. He\u2019s been working hard on his posture, so needs to get his shoulders back and nail that frame. Fast, moody and full of attack with quick turns and sharp head movements. Much nearer than last week. A little bit of gapping and some footwork fluffs but pacy, swagger, a knee-slide and heaps of fun. A stomper of a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tango.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Rock and Roll All Nite by KISS. The glam-metal band\u2019s 1975 hit became their signature anthem and traditionally closes their concerts. It was inspired by Slade\u2019s Mama Weer All Crazee Now.

As a self-confessed tomboy, she\u2019s been finding the soppy acting awkward in training but you wouldn\u2019t know it as she strokes Nikita\u2019s hair and goes nose-to-nose.

One of her best, I\u2019d say.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>Love Story by Taylor Swift. This 2008 country pop single sold 18m copies worldwide.

Wynne Evans says he\u2019s struggled with his mental health and finds this song by his Welsh compatriot empowering and emotional. He\u2019s loosening up his hips for what\u2019s always a notoriously tricky dance for celebrity males. Wisely avoiding the sexy, sensual type of rumba. Instead it\u2019s dramatic and moody with controlled turns and spins. Light on his feet for a big lad. A slightly hammy but powerful routine with a surprise Strictly first at the end as Wynne takes over the vocals for a belting big note.</p> <p><strong>Song: </strong>This is My Life by Shirley Bassey. Not to be confused with Shirley Ballas. This 1968 anthem became one of her signature songs and is often her final encore at concerts. Burly Chassis was the first female artist to claim a UK top 40 album in seven consecutive decades. She\u2019s also the only singer to sing more than one Bond theme - three, in fact.

So who\u2019s in danger? It\u2019s perhaps the hardest dance-off to predict all series.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, everyone. You\u2019re pretty iconic yourselves. Our nifty nine pairings have made it into the contest\u2019s home stretch and now progress to the mercifully un-themed eighth live show, bidding to get through to Blackpool the following week. It airs next Saturday at 6.35pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to see who\u2019s sizzling and who\u2019s fizzling. In the meantime, you don\u2019t need me to tell you: keeeeeeep dancing! Have a lovely week. Goodnight all. DGPHOK says: \u201cCouples Choice is not ballroom or Latin. It seems to be a bye to the next week. Liked both dance off contestants, such a shame.\u201d Belette adds: \u201cYou absolutely have to buy in to it being a popularity contest, so if you\u2019ve in a soap or a \u2018reality\u2019 TV show you always stand a good chance. No other reason why Pete Wicks\u2019 salsa that wasn\u2019t really a salsa which, bless him, he knew he\u2019d made shed loads of mistakes in and looked bereft at the end, scored rightly the lowest but wasn\u2019t in the dance off. It\u2019s never been a dance competition.\u201d Sebnose says: \u201cFloppy dance and bad costume were major contributors to Sam\u2019s demise, I fear.\u201d ABH2018 adds: \u201cVery sorry to lose Sam and Nikita. I\u2019ve loved them and there were two or three I thought should have gone first. And I agree with Motsi that it\u2019s sad to lose another girl.\u201d girlpanic says: \u201cI\u2019m very sad to see either of those couples leave. Neither of them deserved to go this week. Sam definitely could have improved more and I think it was her lack of celebrity compared to some of the others that failed her a bit. Oh well, that\u2019s Strictly!\u201d Somersetlass adds: \u201cNot a surprise, and of course Mojo shouldn\u2019t have been in the dance-off, but I am gutted to lose Sam and Nikita. Love, love, love Nikita\u2019s tenderness, and Sam is just gorgeous.\u201d Let\u2019s take the temperature of your comments. joanieloves says: \u201cSorry to see Sam go,but it\u2019s got to that point of the show where every week from now on will be a close call.\u201d IvanTiger says: \u201cWell, let\u2019s try to forget Icon Week ever happened and put it in the bin..\u201d Tombo says: \u201cWere MoJo punished for dancing a waltz to a song that isn\u2019t in 3/4 time? If so, they only have themselves to blame..\u201d LekisP adds: \u201cWell that was disappointing. Sam was a great contestant. She really embodied the spirit of Strictly. I think Montell has more to give, she could make the final.\u201d For more hoofing action, you can now flip to BBC4 for Dance Passion: Swansea, which sees world-class dancers perform throughout the city. At 9pm, choose from new true-crime thriller Until I Kill You on ITV1, the finale of Showtrial on BBC1, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing on BBC2 or Generation Z on Channel 4. Film-wise, tonight\u2019s picks are Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (9pm on BBC3), The Shawshank Redemption (10pm on BBC2) and Anchorman (11.10pm on Film4). Stay classy, San Diego. The jury is out on whether this weekend\u2019s brand new theme worked. It certainly led to some uneasy combinations soundtrack dance style. There was also inconsistency in how closely the theme was followed. Some celebrities slavishly dressed up as the musician in question, while others didn\u2019t. It was fun but felt a little gratuitous, presumably aimed at pulling in younger viewers. With Movies, Halloween, Blackpool and Musicals, we\u2019ve probably got enough theme weeks. Do we really need another? Ukrainian pro Nikita Kuzmin would have been confident he could steer Sam Quek a few weeks further. Sadly it didn\u2019t quite happen. Her 10th place finish matches his 2022 partner, Ellie Simmonds. In his debut series, he came sixth with Tilly Ramsay. Last year, he formed a dynamite all-male duo with Layton Williams and finished runner-up. His 2023 partner was watching from the studio audience tonight. Wonder if Nikita was vaguely tempted to pop a blonde wig on Layton and draft him in for the dance-off instead? Pete Wicks won\u2019t be the only one thanking his lucky stars tonight. Chris McCausland, Wynne Evans and Jamie Borthwick all scored fewer points than Montell last night and did well to stay out of the bottom two. After two dance-offs in the past three weeks, Shayne Ward will also have feared the worst. All of them need to mop their brows and knuckle down if they\u2019re going to make it to Blackpool. Freddie Mercury impersonator Pete Wicks was cut adrift at the bottom of the scoreboard by a long way last night. He was bottom of the pile by massive seven-point margin - the biggest gap of the series so far. Despite dancing in the slot of death, however, voting viewers rode to his rescue and the lion-maned, moustachioed TOWIE alumnus dodged the dance-off. Pete the wet otter can thank his popularity. He\u2019s proved amusingly dry-witted, formed a likeable partnership with Jowita Przystal (complete with showmance rumours) and fallen in love with dance, steadily improving each week - at least until last night\u2019s salsa setback. He\u2019s fortunate to outlast Sam Quek. She not only outscored him by seven points on Saturday but Pete is the lowest average scorer left in the field by fully three points - he averages 24, Sam 27. Lucky lad. We started the series with a male-skewed field. Now the scales are further tipped. After the departures of Dr Punam Krishan and Sam Quek in consecutive weeks, only three female celebrities remain in the contest, alongside six males. At least the three women who do remain - Tasha Ghouri, Sarah Hadland and Montell Douglas - are the three highest scorers. We can count on at least one of them reaching the final, surely? You might have thought that the legions of Swifties would save her. Sadly, they didn\u2019t vote in sufficient numbers. When Sam Quek was consigned to the dance-off against the far superior Montell Douglas, the result was all but guaranteed. It\u2019s been a curious contest for Sam. She had plenty of potential but never quite seemed to fulfil it. Lacking any performance background, she let nerves affect her, often making mistakes or losing her timing during routines. She also seemed to be harshly criticised by the judges, where others got away more lightly. As a hockey star-turned-sports presenter, she took it on the chin, refused to make excuses and trained hard alongside her pro partner Nikita Kuzmin, with whom she developed lovely chemistry. The highlights of Sam\u2019s seven-week stint were when she could play a character. Her Lara Croft paso doble in Movie Week and her Rocky Horror jive in the Halloween special were the only times her score climbed into the 30s. As a Liverpudlian, she\u2019ll be gutted to fall a fortnight short of Blackpool but she was, in her own words, \u201ctotally boss\u201d. Ta-ra, Samba Quekstep. No official word yet on whether much-loved Welsh pro Amy Dowden will be back from illness to partner JB Gill again next week but let\u2019s hope so. Her fellow professional Lauren Oakley did a brilliant job deputising this week and is always a joy to watch. The three of them all collaborated on last night\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice number and there were lovely scenes of female friendship in the Clauditorium last night. We wish Amy all the best with her recovery and hope to see her back at JB\u2019s side soon. We\u2019ve seen mid-table celebrities plummet into the bottom two several times this series, notably in the cases of JB Gill and Shayne Ward (twice). However, Montell Douglas being consigned to the dreaded dance-off was arguably the biggest surprise of the series so far. She scored three nines for Saturday\u2019s gorgeous Whitney waltz and was fourth on the scoreboard. Yet she clearly didn\u2019t get enough viewer votes, tumbling five places into the danger zone. Montell was always likely to edge out the weaker Sam Quek in the dance-off but she\u2019s the third highest scorer in the field, with a strong chance of reaching the final. An early exit would have felt deeply unjust. As an athlete and Gladiator, we can rely on her competitive fire to ensure she bounces back strongly. And hey, at least her partner Johannes Radebe got to lead that fierce Beyonc\u00e9-themed pro dance. As the eliminated couple trip the light fantastic one last time to Go Your Own Way by Fleetwood Mac, the credits roll and their castmates crowd around. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Her pro partner Nikita Kuzmin tells Tess: \u201cI\u2019m just in awe of this girl. Sometimes they say it\u2019s about the journey, not the destination, but to me it\u2019s about the company. Sam, you are the most wonderful company I could\u2019ve had.\u201d Nicely said, sir. In her farewell speech, Sam Quek says: \u201cI\u2019m gutted. I just want to say thank you. I\u2019ve learned so much. Strictly has brought that spring in my step back. It\u2019s been an absolute joy. Nikita, you\u2019ve been key in helping me find that inner Sam that was there, who went a little bit quiet for maybe one or two years and has just come back. I\u2019m gutted because I do feel like I still have more to give. I\u2019m guilty of watching the competition and thinking \u2018How do they have that relationship as a celebrity and a dancer?\u2019 All I can say is, the time you spend with each other and what you bring out in each other. It really is, and it sounds dead cheesy, magical.\u201d For the fifth time this series - only Tom Dean vs Toyah Willcox has split the panel so far - head judge Shirley Ballas also would\u2019ve voted to save Montell and Jojo. The majority vote means that Sam Quek and Nikita Kuzmin become this year\u2019s sixth couple to depart the dancefloor. Montell and Jojo as well. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cI agree with Craig\u201d. Montell and Jojo, saying \u201cboth danced beautifully but they were better\u201d. I think the outcome is pretty clear but let\u2019s ask the awesome foursome who\u2019ll have the final say. Craig and Shirley both scored Montell two points higher than Sam last night, Motsi and Anton one point more. Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe now have another go at their waltz to I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston. The judges said last night that it had exquisite timing but Craig wanted it softer and lighter with a more consistent frame, kicking off a row with Shirley. It scored 35 points, six more than Sam, so she surely just needs to get through the routine without any major whoopsies. Sam Quek and her dance partner Nikita Kuzmin reprise their American smooth to Love Story by Taylor Swift. The judges said last night it was graceful, clean with fantastic lifts. An improvement on the mistake-littered routines of the past two weeks, even if it lacked flexibility and arm extensions. It scored 29 points, six fewer than Montell\u2019s waltz. Sam will need to show considerable improvement second time around and hope that Montell makes mistakes. All perfectly pleasant but there\u2019s only one Strictly K-Pop moment I care about. Altogether now: heeeey sexy lady! Oppa Ed Balls style! Musical interlude now from K-Pop boyband dearALICE. The UK-based five-piece was formed on BBC1 reality show Made in Korea: The K-Pop Experience and, in a spot of Beeb cross-promotion, this is their grand unveiling. The Alice stands for \u201cA Love I Can\u2019t Explain\u201d, apparently. Iain Crofts in Montreal writes: \u201cI\u2019m surprised how Pete Wicks\u2019s \u2018wet like an otter\u2019 remark has had such an enduring effect. If anyone on Strictly embodies the playful otter, it\u2019s Vito. The aquatic mammal that most reminds me of Mr. Wicks\u2019s stern demeanour is the walrus. However, when he has occasionally flashed a smile on Strictly, it\u2019s been lovely to see.\u201d More balcony chit-chat with the safe couples, all of whom seem shocked by the Montell result. Jamie Borthwick thinks he should have been in the bottom two. Dianne Buswell\u2019s parents met former glitterball winner Bill Bailey this week. To the hip, hop\u2026 Well, that\u2019s a shocker. Montell Douglas and her pro partner Johannes Radebe are consigned to the dance-off for the first time. She was joint fourth on the scoreboard, so that\u2019s an upset. Phew, frankly. So are Sarah Hadland and Wynne Evans. The dreaded crimson spotlight is back to do its dastardly thing. Let\u2019s find out who will face Sam Quek in the dance-off. Hold tight. Shirley talks a baffled Claudia through some fundamentals, then relives her \u201cruckus\u201d with Craig over Montell\u2019s frame. Let\u2019s agree to disagree, darlings. \u201cGood morning\u201d and \u201cwakey wakey\u201d say Claud and Motsi, rather brilliantly, as Craig tells her he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d if Sam has never danced before. Loosen up that spine, Ms Quek. Oops, they did it again. The judges sashay into the Clauditorium for a closer inspection of last night\u2019s dances. Let\u2019s hope Mummy Shirley and Daddy Craig don\u2019t start bickering again. If they do, I\u2019m stomping off upstairs to play my tapes. Well, that Beyonc-slayed. If you liked it, then you should\u2019ve put a ring on it. Slinky space age outfits for the girls. Lauren Oakley looking fabulous in a wig and stealing some of the limelight off our leading man. The male dancers join in with the horse-riding country and western segment in fringed stetsons. Must be tricky to see where they\u2019re going under those. Health &amp; Safety nightmare. In case you were wondering why Beyonc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t on the Icons Week bill last night - well, she has won 32 Grammys, the most of all time - here\u2019s your answer. She\u2019s been bagsied by the pros for their group number. It\u2019s set to a medley of Ms Knowles-Carter\u2019s greatest hits and led by one of our favourites, Johannes Radebe. Choreographed by the respected Beth Honan, there are nods to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s videos, power ballad moves and plenty of sass. Jojo looking frankly resplendent in leather coat, silver Bacofoil trousers, high heels, sparkly top and a bejewelled cowboy hat. Just your average Sunday night outfit, then. Who run the world? Jojo. He\u2019s living his best life out there. In a Children In Need VT, Anton du Beke and the Strictly pros visit Motion Dance Control in Barry, South Wales. What a cracking charity. It\u2019s the dance she\u2019s been dreading but something tells me she\u2019ll be good at it. Pete and Jowita have otters named after them. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the blog post. Up in the Clauditorium with the happy couples who are safely through, Shayne Ward says his confidence has been boosted by dodging the dance-off. JB Gill is beaming after a challenging week \u2013 and has now officially beaten his JLS bandmate Aston Merrygold #justiceforAston. No great surprise, I suppose. Sam Quek and Nikita Kuzmin must dance again for survival. They were second from bottom last night, joint with the popular Chris McCausland, so perhaps that was to be expected. He was rock bottom of the scoreboard by some distance but the TOWIE alumnus has been saved by the public vote. Which means we could be in for a dance-off surprise. That\u2019s a welcome result. JB Gill not only deserved to go through for that leaderboard-topping Couple\u2019s Choice but it means his regular partner Amy Dowden will get the chance to dance again. Well done to fellow pro Lauren Oakley, who did a terrific job stepping in for a week. Definitely deserves a celebrity partner next year. He doesn\u2019t need Help! this week. Hold onto your dictionaries, open at the word \u201cicon\u201d. It\u2019s time to find out who\u2019s safe and who ain\u2019t. The paddle-raising judging panel are in situ. They\u2019ll have a decision to make later. At least they\u2019ve removed those terrible wigs to do it. Nobody wants to be sent home by Claudia\u2019s Auntie Joan. Our top 10 couples wait to hear their fates. Freddie Mercury\u2019s moustache quivers anxiously. George Michael nervously scratches his designer stubble. Madonna tries not to have someone\u2019s eye out with her cone bra. A rewind of Saturday night\u2019s Icons Week action on-screen now. Couple\u2019s Choices from Tasha Ghouri and JB Gill clock up the 10s! Sarah Hadland takes it to cha-cha-church! Shayne Ward dresses up like my Sergeant Pepper grinder! Hey, who needs those smoke-filled sliding doors on Stars In Their Eyes? Here\u2019s our presenting pair, so let\u2019s compare their couture. Tess Daly is in white bodice and trousers. Claudia Winkleman is in chic black with beaded neckline and pocket details. Poppies present and correct in both cases. Claud wins, making it another clean sweep for La Winkle this weekend. Roll clap-along credits. Five of these couples have left us. Who will become the sixth in around 35 minutes time? See if you can guess from the sadness behind their smiles. Buckle up, ballroom watchers. We\u2019re about to go back to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Tonight\u2019s musical guests are K-Pop\u2019s latest big boyband, the oddly named dearALICE. Who from the name alone, sound to me more like goth rockers than teenyboppers. Pretty sure I saw them at Reading Festival in the 90s. Anyway, just five minutes to wait now\u2026 Majestic new nature series Asia on BBC1 approaching its end right now. Lovely to hear the reassuringly familiar whispery tones of Sir David Attenborough again - 98 years young and still the don. The mudskippers, sea bunnies and baby whales have been my highlights so far. That army of sea snakes might slither its way into my dreams tonight, though. It\u2019s a mere 10 minutes until we go from wildlife to waltzes. Any last dance-off predictions? Tonight\u2019s pro group dance is a Beyonc\u00e9 medley, with Johannes Radebe channelling his inner Sasha Fierce as the Icons Week routine\u2019s protagonist. Expect high heels, sassy moves and full fabulosity. Fifteen minutes until glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 A pack of four celebrities scored around the 30-mark last night, leaving them in the bottom half of the leaderboard on a high-scoring night - namely Sam Quek, Chris McCausland, Wynne Evans and Jamie Borthwick, who were all marked between 29 and 31 points. Along with Pete Wicks, this foursome in particular will be making \u201cphone hand\u201d gestures and hoping that viewer votes keep them clear of the dance-off. It\u2019s just 20 minutes until glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 We saw seven more maximum scores handed out last night - three 10s for JB Gill, three for Tasha Ghouri and one for Sarah Hadland. Somehow reassuring that Craig Revel Horwood\u2019s perfect paddle remains mothballed. It\u2019s 25 minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 After last night\u2019s live show, salsa-ing Freddie Mercury impersonator Pete Wicks was cut adrift at the bottom of the leaderboard by a massive seven-point margin - the biggest gap of the series so far. Will voting viewers ride to his rescue? If so, will we see another dance-off shocker? It\u2019s less than half an hour until we get our first clues\u2026 Icons Week is about to claim its first ever victim. Good evening and welcome to the latest elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your virtual dance partner for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as the sixth celebrity is sent home, bowing out at the precise midway mark of the contest. Following last night\u2019s high-scoring live show paying fancy-dressed tribute to music icons, our 10 surviving pro-celebrity pairs will be whittled down to nine. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote. Tonight the bottom two will perform again for survival. So who\u2019s in dance-off danger? Pete Wicks was bottom of the leaderboard by a long way. Sam Quek and Chris McCausland were joint second from bottom but will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Shayne Ward or Wynne Evans could be at risk. It\u2019s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and a pinch of mild mickey-taking. So snuggle up, hunker down and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for conversational fireworks. I\u2019ll contempo-waft down there whenever I can to see what you\u2019re all saying and report on your comments. Buckle up, ballroom-watchers. Nearly time to staaaaaart iconic eliminating! Phew, what a show. Faintly ridiculous but highly entertaining \u2013 in large part thanks to your excellent running commentary. That concludes tonight\u2019s twinkle-toed, badly bewigged liveblog action but meet you back here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll unleash the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so feel free to give me a follow or say hi. Thanks for watching along with me, as always. Hope to see you right back here tomorrow but in the meantime, it\u2019s the traditional exhortation: keeeeeep dancing! Goodnight. Over on Twitter (I refuse to call it X), Rita Griffin writes to me: \u201cI didn\u2019t know Jeffrey Dahmer was an icon, Craig.\u201d Finally, on Shayne Ward\u2019s Beatles quickstep, Somersetlass says: \u201cSome fun reminders of the Beatles films there. I rather liked it. Shayne for a change wasn\u2019t outshone by Nancy and had some great footwork.\u201d eiwrite says: \u201cThat was a bit odd where Nancy whipped off Shayne\u2019s jacket to reveal - the same outfit underneath! Why?!\u201d paperview adds: \u201cIf cockapoos could vote, Shayne would win every week.\u201d On Tasha Ghouri\u2019s emotive Couple\u2019s Choice, G1adys says: \u201cJust when you thought it might be safe to like CC, the bare feet are back.\u201d LazyMillennial says: \u201cI know Tasha has danced before, and I\u2019m too burned out to fully buy into the background of Couple\u2019s Choice dances, but I loved that. Exactly what I like to see in contemporary dance.\u201d Jennifera030 adds: \u201cNot my favourite kind of dance but that was one hell of a lift halfway through. I think it might have killed Aljaz off.\u201d On Jamie Borthwick, Shazza2704 says: \u201cWasn\u2019t fussed on that. Was more Chesney Hawkes than the late, great George Michael.\u201d Pancake01 adds: \u201cYou see, this is what I feared. I think Jamie did a really good dance, but it was overshadowed by me thinking that he looked like a shit George Michael. Why couldn\u2019t he just do the dance as him?\u201d On Montell Douglas\u2019 Whitney waltz, Somersetlass says: \u201cPure elegance and class. As an athlete, Montell knows her body well, but that had real fluidity and grace, and I was glued to her, rather than to Johannes. Shout-out to the singer too - good on Motsi for mentioning her.\u201d Lidoswimmer adds: \u201cI was bracing myself for the Whitney song, which I can\u2019t abide, but that was really nice and understated version by Dave and the band. The dance was a bit too understated, though, I thought.\u201d On JB Gill, ihema says: \u201cLauren is an amazing dancer but I think it\u2019s telling that I found myself watching JB all the time. Quite magnetic to the eyeballs.\u201d Aine183 says: \u201cWow. If I hadn\u2019t known who the pro was in JB\u2019s dance, I couldn\u2019t have told.\u201d 02022020 adds: \u201cLovely moment between Amy and Lauren. Ah, Amy all emotional now about everything she\u2019s suffering. Getting teary.\u201d On Sarah Hadland\u2019s cha cha, ABH2018 says: \u201cThank goodness. I\u2019m not a Madonna fan but I liked that. Sarah has amazing pins and a little weep for Miranda (please may we see her on the Friday panel?).\u201d 1991fab says: \u201cSarah was so good. Best one so far and fitted the theme most!\u201d EastofStratford adds: \u201cI suppose now Gorka has gone to the Clauditorium in the sky, Vito gets first dibs on the shiny plastic trousers. Though if he does many more moves like that, Vicky Gill will need to buy a puncture repair kit.\u201d On Chris McCausland\u2019s KISS tango, PsychedelicAmphibian says: \u201cI\u2019m a massive Kiss fan but there\u2019s no way Rock &amp; Roll All Night is a tango!\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cI assume that Chris hasn\u2019t been able to see anyone dance a tango before (or any other dance) so whilst there were a few niggles, I maintain that he\u2019s still a dance marvel and great entertainer.\u201d joanieloves adds: \u201cStill amazed by Chris. And fingers crossed we\u2019ll get to see his Couple\u2019s Choice dance (the only time you\u2019ll hear me say that).\u201d On Sam Quek\u2019s American smooth, Somersetlass says: \u201cSam was light as a feather there. Rather a lovely Taylor Swift song and super-romantic characterisation.\u201d wtrukus adds: \u201cI love Sam and Nikita but I didn\u2019t like that song or that dance. Or her wig.\u201d On Pete Wicks, Jagadox says: \u201cGreat Freddie impression from Pete. The dance, not so much. Will the judges mark for entertainment value?\u201d On Wynne Evans, joanieloves says: \u201cVery emotional from Wynne and more male dancing content than most rumbas. Well done!\u201d FascinatingFlamenco adds: \u201cThe dance had a bit too much \u2018fling\u2019 for me - overdramatic to the point of eyeroll. Just WOW on the singing of the last line. He\u2019s got an amazing voice - loved that.\u201d On the Icons Week theme, Gardener_Maidhc says: \u201cReally not liking this Theme week so far. Just song/dance mismatch clashes. Grr.\u201d MrsLofty says: \u201cThis is quite fun but I so want to watch a week with, well, just dancing. Appropriate costumes, music, Am I hoping for too much?\u201d RichIrwinTN says: \u201cI loved it. I love Bruno Mars and I love JB. I think 15 Grammys and doing Super Bowl (more than once) means a modern icon.\u201d fihema adds: \u201c'Does P!nk really qualify as an icon? I\u2019d say very definitely and internationally. All she has done for girls, for the autistic community, LGBTQ+, PETA, the Prince\u2019s Trust, UNICEF, Save the Children and more - even body-positivity and self-acceptance. Yeah. She\u2019s an icon.\u201d TheMathDiva says: \u201cI wish the judges wouldn\u2019t argue and shout over each other (by that I mean disrespect Craig\u2019s opinion). It isn\u2019t entertaining or constructive.\u201d whistledownthewind says: \u201cOnly Sir Lenny Henry can do a greatest hits of his whole career whilst reading out the terms and conditions for Strictly. Bravo!\u201d A swift straw poll of your comments. Dunntalkin says: \u201cAnton is Rod Stewart? I thought he was Nicola Sturgeon.\u201d TeeDubyaBee says: \u201cWait, Anton\u2019s icon is Robin Askwith?\u201d JenAiMarre says: \u201cAnton is channelling Paul Calf.\u201d Poppieshen adds: \u201cAnton has really come from Spinal Tap, hasn\u2019t he? He\u2019ll be turning it up to 11 before the evening\u2019s out.\u201d TV viewers can now flip to BBC2 for The Cure Night. At 9pm, there\u2019s Scandi-drama Justice: Those Who Kill on BBC4 or Alex Edelman: Just for Us on Sky Comedy. At 9.10pm, rather amusing new gameshow Romesh Ranganahan\u2019s Parents\u2019 Evening starts on ITV1. It\u2019s fairly slim pickings film-wise but at 9pm, choose from Predator on Film4, Cliffhanger on 5Action or Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason on 5Star. At 11.10pm, there\u2019s The Godfather Part II on Film4 or Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery on 5Star. Yeah, baby! I\u2019m sure you all got it but Shirley Bassey\u2019s three Bond themes were Goldfinger, Diamonds Are Forever and Moonraker (where she was a late replacement for Johnny Mathis). Hope that trivia teaser didn\u2019t leave you shaken or indeed stirred. They\u2019re the most coveted awards in the Elstree and Borehamwood environs. Here are this week\u2019s gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: JB Gill\u2019s street-commercial party or Sarah Hadland\u2019s Ciccone cha-cha. Worst dance: Pete Wicks by some margin. Best music choice: The Whitney waltz was a moment and the vocals were on-point. Worst music choice: Lots of music vs dance style mismatches. KISS and Queen did Chris and Pete no favours. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence they ended up down the bottom. Best outfit: Montell\u2019s midnight blue waltz frock was gorgeous. Honourable mention for Michelle\u2019s samba frock. Worst outfit: Anton looked like a mid-life crisis dinner lady. Jamie Borthwick had borrowed Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s dad jeans. Best judges\u2019 comment: Anton telling poor Vito \u201cOne word: wedgie\u201d to which Vito replied \u201cIt\u2019s really pulling.\u201d Also enjoyed Motsi\u2019s: \u201cI almost cried, then turned around, saw Craig and it was over.\u201d Hated the unedifying Craig vs Shirley spat, though. Worst VT: Dead heat between Shayne\u2019s Beatles tour and Wynne\u2019s random visit to the Cardiff Principality Stadium. Lovely to see Miranda Hart visiting Sarah in the training room. Such fun. Best Claudia quip: Spoilt for choice. There was Anton-baiting, Dave Arch-fancying and Vito-wrangling but the prize goes to: \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. Where\u2019s Jedward? They might be coming.\u201d JB Gill and Tasha Ghouri jointly top the standings \u2013 great routines but also showing how tricky it remains to judge the Couple\u2019s Choice category \u2013 with Sarah Hadland in third spot. Pete Wicks is bottom by quite some margin, with Chris McCausland and Sam Quek joint second bottom. As always, though the viewer vote helps decide who\u2019ll be consigned to the dreaded dance-off. Wynne Evans and Shayne Ward might also fear the red light of doom. \u201cKeeeeeep dancing!\u201d chorus the swaying Tess and Claud. Icons. As everyone peels off their fancy dress and mops their brow, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight\u2019s routines get recapped on-screen. Who was top of the pops and gets your vote? Who was a cloth-eared flop and definitely doesn\u2019t? Prop shop mayhem ensues. Vito and Nikita keep going too early, which Claudia handles like a long-suffering older sister. Remember to vote for your favourites if you don\u2019t want any dance-off shockers tomorrow. Judges\u2019 scores for Shayne and Nancy: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. His highest, top half of the table. Judges\u2019 comments for Shayne and Nancy: Craig says \u201clittle bit of gapping, needed neater footwork but light, bright and dynamite, darling\u201d. Motsi says \u201chot, fast, rhythmical and entertaining\u201d. Shirley says \u201cbounced back well and fighting to stay, lovely memories, springs in your feet, frame better\u201d. Anton concludes \u201clovely togetherness, this was the best of you, super movement, your best dance\u201d. Nines all round? A sentimental Scouse 10 from Shirley? The double dance-off survivors close the show. This is Nancy\u2019s third week seven Strictly quickstep, previously scoring scoring 33 and 34 points with Will Mellor and Rhys Stephenson. At least, having sold 600m albums and changed the face of music, the Fab Four fit the \u201cicons\u201d criteria. Shayne Ward has lots of family in Liverpool, so is keen to do the city justice. Mop-top hair and a Sergeant Pepper-style jacket which comes off early. Nancy wearing Flavia\u2019s wig. Up on the the balls of his feet, close connection with their ribcages glued together. Fun , frisky choreography as they fly around the floor. Then it segues into Hey Jude and confetti falls. Peace signs to finish. A crowd-pleaser. Song: Help! by the Beatles. John Lennon wrote the1965 chart-topper\u2019s lyrics to express his stress after the band\u2019s rapid rise to superstardom. This is the third Strictly quickstep to it, following Jessie Wallace (\u201cYou ain\u2019t my muvva!\u201d \u201cYes I am!\u201d) and Ed Balls (real name Edwardian Testicles). Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Joint top with JB. Aljaz, out of breath but emotional, says it\u2019s his favourite story he\u2019s ever told on Strictly. \u201cI used to love Barry Gibb,\u201d deadpans Aljaz, who\u2019s been on very funny form tonight. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Motsi says \u201cpowerful dance, powerful words, you made a difficult dance look easy\u201d. Shirley says \u201cbeautiful beyond words\u201d. Anton says \u201cI didn\u2019t notice Aljaz once, you were exquisite, you made it personal and just lovely\u201d. Craig concludes \u201celevation, extensions, fantastic storytelling, a triumph, darling\u201d. Tens incoming but will there be four of them? Does P!nk really qualify as an icon? Either way, the song means a lot to Tasha Ghouri as an empowerment anthem. Emotional VT about social media trolling when she was on Love Island. Tasha has topped the leaderboard three times and become bookies\u2019 favourite to get the first perfect 40 of the series. Can she lure out Craig\u2019s 10 paddle here? A cool Couple\u2019s Choice routine, choreographed by Lukas McFarlane who has worked with P!nk herself. Contemporary lyrical in style, telling a story from the heart. Barefoot and beautiful. Maybe a bit too wafty, lacking P!nk\u2019s signature power and personality. Great lifts. She barely touched the floor for a while there. Powerful, full of feeling, stunning. Song: What About Us by P!nk. The anthemic 2017 electro-pop chart-topper has politically charged lyrics about Trump\u2019s government failing the American people, told from the perspective of the unheard and forgotten. It was later covered by the late Liam Payne. RIP. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 7, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 31 points. Mid-table. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Shirley says \u201chit all the technical elements but lacked connection, dance as a unit\u201d. Anton says \u201cOK but not great, lots to like but not your best\u201d. Craig says \u201clove a hip-roll, darling, a bit pointed and spiky, needed body rhythm but feet and presentation were brilliant\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cit was cool not loud and you did that well\u201d. Bit harsh, I thought. Sevens and eights? The song was an early solo number one for George Michael. Could it help secure a solo top spot for Jamie Borthwick too, after he\u2019s jointly topped the leaderboard for two weeks running? An apt choice because George was a huge EastEnders fan and often visited the set. Memorial clip of Heather Trott (RIP, sob). He was also half-Cypriot like Michelle Tsiakkas, so he\u2019s got a connection to them both. Giotsr and jukebox-ography. Terrible dad jeans but Jamie getting right into character. Decent job at oiling up his hips and nailing the tricky samba technique. Strange music-to-dance mismatch but entertaining and well executed. A Whamba of a samba. Song: Faith by George Michael. Conceived as a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll pastiche with growly vocals and a classic Bo Diddley beat, it was originally only two minutes long and never intended to be a single, just a snappy album track. When George changed his mind, he went back and extended it with a guitar solo. Swimmer Adam Peary danced a samba to it three series ago. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Jojo is tearful with pride. \u201cShe feels like Luba Mushtuk in my arms,\u201d he says. Bless that man. Protect him at all costs. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Anton says \u201clove watching you do ballroom, pure joy, exquisite timing, as lovely as you\u2019ve danced\u201d. Craig says \u201cI wanted it softer and lighter, frame was in and out\u201d. Shirley swaps places with Motsi to disagree and Craig calls her \u201cCousin It\u201d. Motsi says \u201cmummy and daddy are fighting, that dance was made for you, you gave it love, respect and passion\u201d. Well. Pick the bones out of that. Nines? This could be an emotional one because Montell Douglas buried her grandfather to this song when she was 10 years old. Elements of The Bodyguard\u2019s film narrative in a story of love and loss. Montell says she\u2019s a Latin girl but her Viennese waltz three weeks ago was gorgeous and notched her first nine. The international version is the most exposing ballroom dance due to its slowness but she\u2019s showing control, precision and poise. For a powerhouse athlete, she brings effortless elegance, delicacy and softness to ballroom dances. Romantic mood and stylish. A slight stumble mid-routine, I thought, but strong finish and all-round gaw-jus. Song: I Will Always Love You to Whitney Houston. It was first released by Dolly Parton 50 years ago as a farewell to her partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, expressing Dolly\u2019s decision to go solo. Impressively, she wrote Jolene on the same day. Whitney\u2019s 1992 cover version sold 24m copies worldwide, topped the UK chart for 10 weeks and became the bestselling single of all time by a female solo artist. Dolly famously declined to let Elvis Presley cover it when his manager Colonel Tom Parker demanded she sign over half the publishing rights. Dolly stood her ground and said: \u201cWhen Whitney\u2019s version came out, I made enough money to buy Graceland.\u201d Attagirl. Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Amy: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Joint highest score of the series. Lovely moment of pro bonding between Amy and Lauren on the balcony. Amy tearful with pride. No, you\u2019re crying. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Amy: Craig says \u201ctwo moments where you got out of sync but commercial is your thing, brilliant\u201d. Motsi says \u201ccame out of your shell and it all came together, swag, brought the jam\u201d. Shirley says \u201csensational, bring that flexibility and fluidity to all your dances\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cyou\u2019re a great technical dancer but park that and dance, we want this freedom\u201d. Nines, even a ten? Not just a new dance style for JB Gill but a new partner, with home-grown pro Lauren Oakley stepping in for Amy Dowden while she recovers from being taken ill last week. JB is keen to do Amy proud as she cheers him on from the balcony and this should suit his boyband background. It\u2019s commercial meets streetdance and hip-hop. Lots of groove and synchronisation. Barber\u2019s chairs to start, channeling Bill Bailey. Some jacket-ography and baseball-ography. This is great. Sharp, swaggering, tight side-by-side, tricks and jumps. A belter. Song: A Bruno Mars medley. You know, the iconic Bruno Mars? Oh. Real name Peter Gene Hernandez, the Hawaii-born retro R&amp;B popper has sold 130m records worldwide and notched eight US chart-topping singles. Dog lovers also might be interested to learn that he owns a Rottweiler called Geronimo. This medley includes his hits 24K Magic, Locked Out Of Heaven and his vocals on Mark Ronson\u2019s Uptown Funk. Aljaz busts out a bit of Blue\u2019s All Rise there on the balcony. Brought to you in association with Mother\u2019s Pride thick sliced bread. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 9, 9, 9, 10 for a total of 37 points. Top of the pops at the halfway point. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Motsi says \u201cthis was iconic, whole package made sense, tight steps, on-point and rhythmical, rolling like Tina\u201d. Shirley says \u201cstraightened legs fantastic, natural turn-out, all gorgeous, just needs fluidity and flexibility\u201d. Anton says \u201cspeechless, I\u2019m blown away, it was so brilliant, love your legs, best dance tonight\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cthe cape went better with you than Madonna, you worked hard, a powerhouse performance\u201d. Two nines and two 10s, perhaps? After jointly topping last week\u2019s leaderboard with the first Argentine tango of the series, Sarah Hadland is off to cha-cha-church. Madonna Louise Ciccone has Italian heritage, of course, so Vito Coppola is happy. He\u2019s been busy researching 1980s cha-chas so he can incorporate authentic period steps into the choreography. Admirable attention to detail. No cloak mishap like Madge at the Brits, thankfully. Whips it off to reveal a cone bra and leaps into Vito\u2019s arms. Fast and technically tricky, with lots of rotation, footwork and finesse. Party spirit and cracking characterisation. Maybe lacking a little in the leg action and fluidity at times but loads of va-va-voom. Woof, what a number. Song: Like a Prayer by Madonna. The 1989 dance-gospel single became infamous for its provocative music video, which featured a dream sequence of Madonna kissing a blank saint in church. The Vatican condemned it, TV stations banned it and religious groups organised a boycott of Pepsi, which used the song in an advert and subsequently cancelled their sponsorship deal with Madge. But hey, all publicity is good publicity. Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 6, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 29 points. Same as Sam Quek. Shirley\u2019s microphone crackling is becoming annoying. Are we blaming that Cher meets Brian May wig? Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: Craig says \u201csidestep was out of time, needs to be smoother and less stompy but you travelled well across the floor and frame improving\u201d. Motsi says \u201cmore comfortable, great spine and head movements, felt like a little bit of paso fusion\u201d. Shirley says \u201cpoly-rhythms, Viennese crosses and closed feet fantastic, staccato timing off the charts, much better\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cmarvellous, mistake at end but a joy to watch\u201d. Can Chris McCausland bounce back after finishing joint bottom last week with that misfiring samba? \u201cIf they make us dance first again, I\u2019m having words,\u201d joked Chris this week. He\u2019s a big rock fan and prefers being in ballroom hold, both factors which should help here. Looking suitably Gene Simmons-esque in facepaint and a studded, mirrored black outfit. Solo section to start with axe and drum kit action. He\u2019s been working hard on his posture, so needs to get his shoulders back and nail that frame. Fast, moody and full of attack with quick turns and sharp head movements. Much nearer than last week. A little bit of gapping and some footwork fluffs but pacy, swagger, a knee-slide and heaps of fun. A stomper of a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tango. Song: Rock and Roll All Nite by KISS. The glam-metal band\u2019s 1975 hit became their signature anthem and traditionally closes their concerts. It was inspired by Slade\u2019s Mama Weer All Crazee Now. The original recording included the road crew\u2019s handclaps and even the sound of them zipping up their jackets. Judges\u2019 scores for Sam and Nikita: 6, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 29 points. Enough to make her safe? Judges\u2019 comments for Sam and Nikita: Motsi says \u201csome hiccups the last two weeks but this was much better, lost some flexibility and breath but on the way up\u201d. Shirley says \u201cgrace, charm, nice footwork but extend and stretch those arms from your core\u201d. Anton says \u201cbeautiful footwork, clean lifts but a stiff upper back in hold\u201d. Craig concludes \u201cyou had a hockeystick strapped to your back, lacked movement and wow factor but fantastic lifts\u201d. Sevens incoming? Sam Quek is a big Swiftie and saw the Eras tour at Anfield. Telling a Romeo &amp; Juliet story, let\u2019s hope this isn\u2019t a Shakespearean tragedy. Sam looking romantic in a coral pink corset, contrasting with last week\u2019s burlesque black Rocky Horror one. As a self-confessed tomboy, she\u2019s been finding the soppy acting awkward in training but you wouldn\u2019t know it as she strokes Nikita\u2019s hair and goes nose-to-nose. Rise and fall, lots of lifts and spins, elegant extensions. She needs to maintain frame but it wobbles a bit. A nice bit of business with a sheet. Cutesy but rather lovely. One of her best, I\u2019d say. Song: Love Story by Taylor Swift. This 2008 country pop single sold 18m copies worldwide. Not bad, considering Swift wrote it on her bedroom floor in approximately 20 minutes, inspired by her crush on an unsuitable boy. The Guardian once ranked it the second best Swift single, behind Blank Space. Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 7, 7, 8, 8 for a total of 30 points. Sincere chat about self-acceptance and self-worth from Wynne and Katya on the balcony. Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Anton says \u201cbest ending ever, improve your spatial awareness but marvellous\u201d. Craig says \u201cover-attacked it and emotion overtook you, inconsistent hand-shaping but overall very good\u201d. Motsi says \u201clove your passion but slightly unbalanced and finish your moves\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cexecuted steps and timing superbly, hiccup in the middle but have it your all\u201d. Sevens? An eight for the singing? The fifth rumba of the series now. Wynne Evans says he\u2019s struggled with his mental health and finds this song by his Welsh compatriot empowering and emotional. He\u2019s loosening up his hips for what\u2019s always a notoriously tricky dance for celebrity males. Wisely avoiding the sexy, sensual type of rumba. Instead it\u2019s dramatic and moody with controlled turns and spins. Light on his feet for a big lad. A slightly hammy but powerful routine with a surprise Strictly first at the end as Wynne takes over the vocals for a belting big note. Song: This is My Life by Shirley Bassey. Not to be confused with Shirley Ballas. This 1968 anthem became one of her signature songs and is often her final encore at concerts. Burly Chassis was the first female artist to claim a UK top 40 album in seven consecutive decades. She\u2019s also the only singer to sing more than one Bond theme - three, in fact. Bonus point if you can name all three. I\u2019ll tell you the answer after the show. The Comic Relief stalwart makes this week\u2019s Clauditorium cameo, reading out the voting smallprint in a variety of different voices. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 4, 6, 6, 6 for a total of 22 points. Dance-off danger? The moustache is real, allegedly. Well, it is Movember. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Shirley aka Cher says \u201cembraced the character well, made a lot of mistakes but carried on like a trooper\u201d. Anton aka Bet Lynch says \u201cstarted strongly but plateaued and went wrong in the partner work\u201d. Craig aka Barry Gibb says \u201cterrible shame, lacked rotation and fluidity, timing was out, stompy but loved the lifts\u201d. Motsi aka Tina Turner concludes \u201cJowita is the bravest on Strictly, threw yourself around, great job\u201d. Sixes, do we think? Pete apologises for mistakes and Jowita reassures him it\u2019s OK. The king of TOWIE is dancing to Queen and hoping not to bite the dust. After last week\u2019s Joker number, taking on a character should help him again. He\u2019s got the Freddie Mercury moustache and yellow biker jacket but has he got his showmanship? Opens wirh some Live Aid ey-ohs. Jowita Przystal has incorporated so many spectacular lifts that Pete dubbed it \u201cCirque De Salsa\u201d in training. Lots of tricks and intricate arm movements. Lacking a little coordination for the constant motion required and makes some mistakes but heaps of fun with cracking lifts. It was Pete\u2019s 36th birthday yesterday and that wasn\u2019t a bad way to celebrate. Song: Another One Bites The Dust by Queen. The 1980 funk-rock number is credited as Queen\u2019s best-selling single, shifting over 7m copies. John Deacon\u2019s bassline was inspired by hanging out with Chic and he played virtually all the instruments on the track. It was Michael Jackson who suggested they release it as a single, during a backstage conversation with Freddie Mercury after a Queen concert. It was used in early cuts of Rocky III before later being replaced by Survivor\u2019s Eye Of The Tiger. Montell Douglas looking fab-ew-lous as Whitney Houston and Pete Wicks rather suits being Freddie Mercury. And he\u2019s first out too. Our 10 couples come out to wave hello. All manner of fancy dress up on that staircase. KISS face-paint! Freddie Mercury\u2019s moustache! George Michael\u2019s Ray-Bans! It\u2019s a little like a primary school dress-up day. The paddle-raising quartet make their grand entrance and they\u2019ve full embraced the Icons theme. Motsi Mabuse is Tina Turner, Shirley Ballas is Cher, Craig Revel Horwood is resplendent as a Bee Gee and Anton Du Beke is Claudia\u2019s Auntie Joan. Here come our presenting pair, so time for the traditional sartorial smackdown. Tess Daly is in a midnight blue tuxedo suit. Claudia Winkleman is in black sparkly dress. Claud wins. Clap along! Wave goodbye to the five couples we\u2019ve lost! Bet you\u2019ve forgotten at least one of them. Probably Nick or Tom. Cue the traditional tension-building VT package. At least it\u2019s not Halloween horror-themed this time. First of several squillion mentions of the word \u201cicon\u201d instead. Plump cushions, fill nibbles bowls and charge glasses. We\u2019re about to go over live to Elstree Studios\u2026 Tonight\u2019s nine routines include not one but two Couple\u2019s Choices, from JB Gill and Tasha Ghouri. Elsewhere it\u2019s a pleasingly equal split of Latin and ballroom, including the fifth rumba of the series from Wynne Evans. Just five minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Numberwang just winding up on BBC1. Maybe its sheer exposure or Stockholm syndrome but I\u2019m starting to faintly enjoy it. Mere minutes to wait now\u2026 As the contest gets serious, eliminations are getting tougher to call. After surviving two dance-offs in the past three weeks, Shayne Ward is the bookies\u2019 tip for the chop, with Wynne Evans second favourite. JB Gill and Sam Quek are next in the running. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess and all to dance for. It\u2019s 10 minutes until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 Tonight is the midway milestone of the contest - the seventh live show out of 13 - with the annual trip to Blackpool Tower Ballroom in just a fortnight. You can almost smell the fish, chips and donkey dung of the pleasure beach. Nobody wants to miss out on the seaside special but which two couples will? Not long now until choreographic kick-off\u2026 With two themed weeks in a row, producers are certainly keeping BAFTA-winning costume designer Vicky Gill busy. Tonight we can look forward to our celebrities dressing up as Freddie Mercury, the Beatles, George Michael and Madonna among others. It\u2019ll be like a festival bill comprised solely of tribute acts. Fifteen minutes until glittery go-time\u2026 Tick them off when you spot them on-screen! Take a drink for each! Get startled by fireworks and wake up on the sofa with a crumpled face! Here\u2019s your 10-point spotter\u2019s guide for tonight: Literally everyone is called a music icon, even Dave Arch Vito Coppola gives endearingly incomprehensible balcony interview to Claudia Shirley Ballas whips out her tiny shoes or tells the audience to \u201clisten, you might learn something\u201d This year\u2019s first of many mentions of the B-word (Blackpool) BBC graphics department and Guardian liveblogger struggle slightly with stylisation of the name P!nk Craig criticises somebody\u2019s sticky-up thumb or \u201cspotting\u201d during spins A celebrity gets a surprise visit from elderly grandparent/cute kid/supportive partner in the training room Topical mention of \u201cfireworks in the ballroom\u201d Anton makes a series of grunts, groans, beeps and whistles instead of a critique Craig continues to be a great big tease by refusing to whip out his 10 paddle until Blackpool Amy isn\u2019t the only Strictly pro in the wars. Ukrainian dancer Nadiya Bychkova broke her thumb in rehearsals on Wednesday, after she fell and landed on her hand. Despite the painful injury, she will still appear on the balcony tonight and has been cleared by medics to continue taking part in group numbers. Phew. Twenty minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 We were all worried about much-loved pro Amy Dowden last week, when she collapsed backstage after the live show and was rushed to hospital, forcing her to miss Sunday\u2019s results show. The good news is that Amy is doing much better and was well enough to appear on the It Takes Two couch last night However, fellow professional Lauren Oakley replaced her in rehearsals this week and will partner JB Gill tonight. Hopefully it\u2019s for one week only, as everyone is optimistic that Amy will be back to dance with JB next time. It\u2019s 25 minutes until the clock strikes Strictly\u2026 Tonight\u2019s all-new Icons Week follows hard on the cha-cha heels of last week\u2019s Halloween spooktacular. Why not space the theme weeks out? With five special shows out of 13 - Movies, Halloween, Blackpool, Musicals and now Icons - there\u2019s still scope to keep them a couple of weeks apart. It will be a relief to return to normality next Saturday. There\u2019s also been some eyebrows raised about what constitutes \u201cIcon\u201d status. Do P!nk and Bruno Mars really qualify, as tonight\u2019s bill suggests? What no Rolling Stones or David Bowie? Whither Amy Winehouse and Prince? Still, it\u2019s time to idolise the pop greats, celebrate the classic songs and see who\u2019ll deliver a legendary performance themselves. Half an hour until the music madness commences\u2026 Strictly is celebrating its midway mark with a brand new themed week. But will it be a hit like Movies and Musicals? Or a divisive hotch-potch like Around The World and BBC 100? Good evening and welcome to week seven of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your long-distance dance partner for tonight\u2019s show, paying tribute to some of the most influential musicians of all time. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as our 10 surviving pro-celebrity pairings come over like Stars In Their Eyes with added sequins. Last weekend\u2019s Halloween spooktacular was the highest scoring ever. Sarah Hadland and Jamie Borthwick jointly topped the scoreboard, while Dr Punam Krishan was packed off home in a pumpkin-shaped carriage. Our top 10 pro-celebrity pairs now hit the Elstree Studios dancefloor again, channelling pop legends and bidding to make it through to the business end of the competition. As always, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote and the bottom two duos will dance for survival on Sunday night. So who\u2019s in danger? It\u2019s perhaps the hardest dance-off to predict all series. A bunch of mid-table celebrities - the likes of Shayne Ward, Pete Wicks, Wynne Evans, JB Gill and Sam Quek - all need to raise their game to secure safety. It\u2019s showtime at 6.30pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and gratuitous lip. So draw the curtains against the fireworks, turn the thermostat up a notch and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for dance discussion. I\u2019ll foxtrot down there when I can to take the temperature and report on your reactions. How many times will we hear the words \u201cicon\u201d and \u201ciconic\u201d tonight? The mind frankly boggles. Nearly time to staaaart iconoclastically dancing!",

The Trump campaign, which many Democrats believe is setting the stage for a series of legal challenges to poll results, also said in an email that the Des Moines Register poll and a subsequent New York Times swing state poll that found Harris ahead in four of the seven states, is \u201cbeing used to drive a voter suppression narrative against President Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cSome in the media are choosing to amplify a mad dash to dampen and diminish voter enthusiasm,\u201d the statement added. Last week, Trump said: \u201cPennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before\u201d but did not provide evidence for the claim. A Harris campaign official said that the \u201ccheating\u201d claim was an example of how Trump was trying to sow doubt in the electoral system because he was afraid he would lose. The claims come as a federal judge plans to rule on whether Iowa officials can continuing trying to remove hundreds of potential noncitizens from its voting rolls despite critics saying the effort could keep recently naturalized citizens from voting. North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, a Republican, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that he is confident that Trump is \u201cgoing to confidently win Iowa\u201d. Asked if Trump has a problem winning over women voters, Burgum said: \u201cI\u2019d be surprised, completely shocked if that comes anywhere close to being the fact in Iowa.\u201d Burgum pointed to national polling which shows Harris and Trump tied. \u201cI think that\u2019s the feeling that I get on the ground. It\u2019s a very tight race. It\u2019s going to be decided on Tuesday,\u201d Burgum added. But speaking to MSNBC, Maryland governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, said the Des Moines Register poll putting Harris ahead Iowa, but still within margins of error, \u201clines up with what we\u2019re seeing on the ground\u201d, particularly among women voters. Moore continued: \u201cWe\u2019re watching an energy that I think has not been there for a while, where we continue to see where women understand firsthand, what is at stake, that they understand the dynamics and the distinctions between these two candidates literally could not be more stark about when you\u2019re talking about a future vision for the country.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2024. An earlier version referred to Iowa as a \u201ctypically red state\u201d. Further text has been added to clarify that Barack Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012, before Donald Trump\u2019s two victories in 2016 and 2020.",

      "bodyText": "Well, something definitely happened there. But what exactly? There is an affectionate joke about good, punchy Australian sports writing, which basically involves saying Here\u2019s The Thing, right, then spelling out exactly what The Thing is in 800 brutally frank words, pounding The Thing into submission, shaking hands with The Thing, then, ideally, going off for a quick drink with The Thing. What was the thing here? Trapped energy. Drift. Ennui. A good goal by Mois\u00e9s Caicedo. The death-football of late-stage capitalism. Casemiro lying down a lot, often to surprisingly good defensive effect. Manchester United and Chelsea did at least produce something recognisable in the course of this 1-1 draw, specifically a game of two halves, one of them muddled and almost surreally tedious; the other muddled and blessed with a 10-minute spell where things actually happened. The first half in particular was an extraordinary spectacle simply for its listlessness. It started quite well. Old Trafford always has that Christmassy feeling at kick\u2011off. Whatever the surrounding weather there is always energy in the ground for the team, and early on there was a familiar sense of will pushing down from the stands.

Fortunately, the staff member was not injured. But she has been left deeply shaken,\u201d Russell wrote. She added that in the previous 48-hour period, more than 50 children had reportedly been killed in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a focus of Israeli military operations over the past month.</p> <p>\u201cThe attacks on Jabaliya, the vaccination clinic and the Unicef staff member are yet further examples of the grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Russell said.</p> <p>\u201cTaken alongside the horrific level of child deaths in north Gaza from other attacks, these most recent events combine to write yet another dark chapter in one of the darkest periods of this terrible war.\u201d</p> <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied responsibility for the reported attack on Sheikh Radwan, which is in northern Gaza to the west of the Jabaliya camp.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware of a claim about the harm to Palestinian civilians at the Sheikh Radwan vaccination centre in the northern Gaza Strip. Contrary to what was claimed, a preliminary investigation reveals that there was no strike by IDF forces in the area at the time in question,\u201d an IDF statement said.</p> <p>The weekend\u2019s inoculation campaign was intended to give more than 100,000 Palestinian children under the age of 10 a second dose of polio vaccine, made necessary by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/16/gaza-sees-first-polio-case-in-25-years-as-un-calls-for-mass-vaccinations\">an outbreak of the virus</a> reported in July. It had been postponed in late October because of Israeli bombardment.</p> <p>This weekend, the IDF agreed to suspend its strikes to allow the vaccinations to go ahead in northern Gaza except in the besieged areas in the northern governorate: Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya.</p> <p>Approximately 15,000 children under 10 are estimated to be in the excluded area and therefore will not receive the inoculation, threatening the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign, which requires at least 90% of all children in every district to be vaccinated to be sure of stopping the spread of the polio virus.</p> <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said that 58,604 children had been vaccinated on Saturday, the first day of the campaign.

      "bodyText": "A polio vaccination centre and the car of a UN aid official involved in this weekend\u2019s vaccination campaign came under fire despite a promised \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in Israeli bombardment, the UN has said. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the UN child support and protection agency, Unicef, said: \u201cAt least three children were reportedly injured by another attack in the proximity of a vaccination clinic in Sheikh Radwan while a polio vaccination campaign was under way.\u201d She added that the personal car of a Unicef employee working on the polio vaccine campaign \u201ccame under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter. \u201cThe car was damaged. Fortunately, the staff member was not injured. But she has been left deeply shaken,\u201d Russell wrote. She added that in the previous 48-hour period, more than 50 children had reportedly been killed in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a focus of Israeli military operations over the past month. \u201cThe attacks on Jabaliya, the vaccination clinic and the Unicef staff member are yet further examples of the grave consequences of the indiscriminate strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Russell said. \u201cTaken alongside the horrific level of child deaths in north Gaza from other attacks, these most recent events combine to write yet another dark chapter in one of the darkest periods of this terrible war.\u201d The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied responsibility for the reported attack on Sheikh Radwan, which is in northern Gaza to the west of the Jabaliya camp. \u201cWe are aware of a claim about the harm to Palestinian civilians at the Sheikh Radwan vaccination centre in the northern Gaza Strip. Contrary to what was claimed, a preliminary investigation reveals that there was no strike by IDF forces in the area at the time in question,\u201d an IDF statement said. The weekend\u2019s inoculation campaign was intended to give more than 100,000 Palestinian children under the age of 10 a second dose of polio vaccine, made necessary by an outbreak of the virus reported in July. It had been postponed in late October because of Israeli bombardment. This weekend, the IDF agreed to suspend its strikes to allow the vaccinations to go ahead in northern Gaza except in the besieged areas in the northern governorate: Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya. Approximately 15,000 children under 10 are estimated to be in the excluded area and therefore will not receive the inoculation, threatening the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign, which requires at least 90% of all children in every district to be vaccinated to be sure of stopping the spread of the polio virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) said that 58,604 children had been vaccinated on Saturday, the first day of the campaign. The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the reported strike on the Sheikh Radwan clinic as \u201cextremely concerning\u201d, saying it had happened \u201cwhile parents were bringing their children to the life-saving polio vaccination in an area where a humanitarian pause was agreed to allow vaccination to proceed\u201d. \u201cA WHO team was at the site just before,\u201d Ghebreyesus said on the X social media platform. \u201cThis attack, during humanitarian pause, jeopardises the sanctity of health protection for children and may deter parents from bringing their children for vaccination. These vital humanitarian-area-specific pauses must be absolutely respected.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon on Sunday, where he said that Hezbollah must be pushed back beyond the Litani River, with or without a ceasefire deal in place, and that the Iran-backed group must be prevented from re-arming. \u201cWith or without an agreement, the key to returning our (evacuated) residents in the north safely to their homes is to keep back Hezbollah beyond the Litani, to strike its every attempt to rearm, and to respond forcefully against all action against us,\u201d Netanyahu said during a visit to the border. The river is roughly 30km (20 miles) inside Lebanon from the border with Israel. The Israeli army said Hezbollah had fired about 60 rockets across the Lebanese border on Sunday, some aimed at the occupied Golan Heights, others at the western Galilee area. The IDF said most of the projectiles were intercepted and those that got through Israeli defences fell in open areas, causing no casualties on this occasion. The IDF, meanwhile, issued evacuation warnings to Lebanese residents in some areas of the ancient city of Baalbek and said that buildings being used by Hezbollah militants would be targeted imminently. The death toll from Israeli attacks on Lebanon has now climbed to 2,897 and the number of injured to 13,150 since October 2023, including 30 dead and 183 injured in the past 24 hours, the Lebanese health ministry said.",

We need to start over and I\u2019m begging for help. Please help us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The town\u2019s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/we-were-trapped-like-rats-spains-floods-bring-devastation-and-despair\">ferocious floods</a> that rank as the deadliest in Spain\u2019s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown.</p> \n<p>Luj\u00e1n said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets.</p> \n<p>The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luj\u00e1n bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region\u2019s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,\u201d Luj\u00e1n <a href=\"https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/telediario-fin-de-semana/alcalde-aldaia-valencia-guillermo-lujan-estamos-cabreadisimos-desolados-dana/16313667/\">told</a> the broadcaster RTVE. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we\u2019ll see. It might be heartbreaking.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town\u2019s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.europapress.es/comunitat-valenciana/noticia-alcaldesa-paiporta-describe-situacion-desesperante-hay-zonas-acceso-coches-cuerpos-20241102153416.html\">told</a> the news agency Europa Press. \u201cEverything is very difficult.\u201d</p> \n<p>Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/it-was-a-trap-flood-alert-came-too-late-for-residents-of-paiporta-spain\">many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground</a>.</p> \n<p>In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedav\u00ed, mayors <a href=\"https://www.elmundo.es/comunidad-valenciana/2024/10/31/6723b06721efa0c6338b4585.html\">described</a> feeling <a href=\"https://www.levante-emv.com/horta/2024/11/01/dana-valencia-sos-sedavi-temor-infecciones-111094978.html\">abandoned</a> by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia\u2019s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation.</p> \n<p>The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year\u2019s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a \u201crollercoaster\u201d for the 17,000 residents.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see sadness, which is logical given that we\u2019ve lost our town,\u201d Amparo Fort told reporters. \u201cBut on the other hand, it\u2019s heartening to see the response that we\u2019ve had from everyone \u2026 there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.\u201d</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/spain-floods-disaster-5000-more-troops-drafted-in-to-deal-with-aftermath\">10,000 troops and police would be deployed</a> to help with what he described as \u201cthe worst flood our continent has seen so far this century\u201d.</p> \n<p>He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. \u201cI\u2019m aware that the response we\u2019re mounting isn\u2019t enough. I know that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can\u2019t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.</p>",

Please help us.\u201d The town\u2019s 33,000 residents were among many in the region grappling with the aftermath of the ferocious floods that rank as the deadliest in Spain\u2019s modern history. The number of people missing remains unknown. Luj\u00e1n said his town was in desperate need of heavy machinery to clear out the vehicles and debris piled up along the streets. The municipality had yet to confirm the extent of the devastation, leaving Luj\u00e1n bracing for the worst. Aldaia has one of the region\u2019s most visited shopping centres, with a vast underground car park that on Tuesday filled with water in a matter of minutes. \u201cRight now, the upper part of the centre is devastated and the lower level is a terrifying unknown,\u201d Luj\u00e1n told the broadcaster RTVE. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to find. We want to be cautious, but we\u2019ll see. It might be heartbreaking.\u201d In Paiporta, the mayor, Maribel Albalat, described the situation as desperate. Days after the town\u2019s ravine overflowed, unleashing a deluge of water that wreaked havoc on the 29,000 inhabitants, parts of the town remain inaccessible, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because there are bodies, there are vehicles with bodies and these have to be removed,\u201d she told the news agency Europa Press. \u201cEverything is very difficult.\u201d Albalat said the number of deaths had climbed to 70 in the small town and was expected to climb in the coming days, as access was secured to underground garages. On Tuesday, in the absence of any sign that this storm would be different from any other, many people had gone down to their garages to move their cars to higher ground. In flooded towns such as Alfafar and Sedav\u00ed, mayors described feeling abandoned by officials as people scrambled to shovel mud from their homes and clear streets. In some areas, people were still trying to secure an electricity supply or stable phone service. On Friday, the catastrophic images from these municipalities led to a show of solidarity, as thousands of volunteers from less-affected areas trekked to the hardest hit carrying shovels, brooms and food supplies. On Saturday, thousands more turned up at Valencia\u2019s City of Arts and Sciences, which had been hastily converted into the nerve centre of the clean-up operation. The mayor of Chiva, where on Tuesday nearly a year\u2019s worth of rain fell in eight hours, said the situation was a \u201crollercoaster\u201d for the 17,000 residents. \u201cYou see sadness, which is logical given that we\u2019ve lost our town,\u201d Amparo Fort told reporters. \u201cBut on the other hand, it\u2019s heartening to see the response that we\u2019ve had from everyone \u2026 there is a real, human wave of volunteers, particularly young people.\u201d S\u00e1nchez said 10,000 troops and police would be deployed to help with what he described as \u201cthe worst flood our continent has seen so far this century\u201d. He acknowledged that help had been slow in reaching where it was most needed. \u201cI\u2019m aware that the response we\u2019re mounting isn\u2019t enough. I know that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know there are severe problems and shortages and that there are still collapsed services and towns buried by the mud where people are desperately looking for their relatives, and people who can\u2019t get into their homes, and houses that have been buried or destroyed by mud. I know we have to do better and give it our all.\u201d Scientists say the human-driven climate crisis is increasing the length, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe, experts have also said.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. With the US election just two days away, Donald Trump\u2019s staff are said to be feeling confident about his chances, even though the polls show him and Kamala Harris are essentially tied \u2013 and after a shock survey this weekend placed Harris ahead in Iowa. Meanwhile, there has been an extraordinary surge in donations to political parties from gambling companies linked to horse racing. And we look at whether the Australian dream of owning a house is being replaced by the convenience of well-designed apartments \u2013 or if we\u2019re getting high-density living all wrong. Australia Insomnia | A push in the care sector to count sleepovers as breaks could result in \u201cnightmare\u201d 28-hour shifts without penalty rates, unions have warned.

Morality police | Amnesty International has called on authorities in Iran to release a student who was arrested after stripping to her underwear in what the organisation described as a protest against harassment relating to the country\u2019s strict dress code. Kremlin meddling | Moldovans are going to the polls for a second-round vote to choose between the incumbent pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, and a Russia-friendly challenger, amid claims of vote-buying and misinformation. Full Story Will young voters in swing states decide the US election? On the eve of election day, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign is making a special effort to reach out to young voters. So how important will they be? In this episode of Full Story, the Guardian\u2019s democracy reporter, Alice Herman, travels to rallies, campuses and college bars in the critically important swing state of Wisconsin. There she gets a sense of whether young voters can choose their country\u2019s next president. In-depth Political donations made to Australia\u2019s major parties by gambling lobby groups linked to horse racing have surged more than 600% in the past decade, new analysis shows, as the debate over whether to implement a total ban on gambling advertising rages on in Canberra. The figures, reported to the Australian Electoral Commission and analysed by the parliamentary library, show donations from the biggest gambling companies involved in horse betting to the major parties have increased from $66,650 in 2013-14 to $488,000 in 2022-23. Not the news Are dating apps safe? We\u2019re all familiar with stories of cyberflashing and dates gone wrong, but there\u2019s another risk as well: addiction to the apps themselves. An Observer investigation has found that UK dating apps are increasingly pushing users to buy extras that have been likened to \u201cgambling products\u201d and can cost hundreds of pounds a year. As a former employee of Match Group, which owns Tinder and Hinge, told the paper: \u201cAll they care about is revenue, finding as many ways as possible to lure people to a paid feature.\u201d The world of sport Surface intact | India\u2019s A team have been cleared of ball-tampering and will escape any sanction, after initially appearing to be accused of causing scratches in a match against Australia A.

The way it\u2019s been handled sensibly shows an element of forethought, which perhaps other appointments haven\u2019t had. That gives me some confidence and hope.</p> <p>\u201cOver the coming months we\u2019ll be dipping back into the Sporting coaching staff and the team to bolster the squad. So keeping relationships cordial and Amorim happy are important.\u201d</p> <p>Amorim, for whatever words are worth in football, has said he will not return to Lisbon for a spot of January poaching, although it is no&nbsp;secret that a gaggle of his backroom staff are expected to join&nbsp;him in Manchester.</p> <p>The king is \u2026 well, he never quite obtained royal status, did he?

Ideally, they\u2019d have replaced him after the FA Cup final win, but it would have been a very unpopular move and would have heaped a lot of pressure on any new manager.\u201d Last Wednesday night, a Carabao Cup thrashing of Leicester under United\u2019s interim leader, Ruud van Nistelrooy, lifted the club\u2019s mood. \u201cMaybe it was relief,\u201d Siobhan says. \u201cBut there was a bounce physically when you saw the players come out.\u201d There was a visible buoyancy to Van Nistelrooy on Sunday, too, as he dashed around his technical area dressed as the school\u2019s trendy humanities teacher. He is desperate to stay on in some capacity but is equally desperate to enjoy what is in effect a three\u2011game testimonial. In a week\u2019s time, though, Van Nistelrooy will hand over a sizable task to Amorim. A decade of overpayment and underperformance, of misinformed mis-step after mis\u2011step, will require some undoing. For Arun, the key is that Amorim carves out \u201csome sort of identity, a philosophy that he sticks to\u201d, saying: \u201cThis season, for me, is a bit of a write-off already. I don\u2019t mind where we finish if we get that identity.\u201d Bobby, who sees positives in the way United and Sporting have negotiated the terms of Amorim\u2019s job swap, says: \u201cI suspect he\u2019s got a lot of problems to solve, and a lot of fires to fight from day one. The way it\u2019s been handled sensibly shows an element of forethought, which perhaps other appointments haven\u2019t had. That gives me some confidence and hope. \u201cOver the coming months we\u2019ll be dipping back into the Sporting coaching staff and the team to bolster the squad. So keeping relationships cordial and Amorim happy are important.\u201d Amorim, for whatever words are worth in football, has said he will not return to Lisbon for a spot of January poaching, although it is no secret that a gaggle of his backroom staff are expected to join him in Manchester. The king is \u2026 well, he never quite obtained royal status, did he? Long live the king. When he arrives.",

The continent of Asia covers almost a third of the planet\u2019s land area, and encompasses desert, forest, mountains and frozen wilderness. It is also the most populous continent, forcing humans and animals to coexist \u201cin the most remarkable ways\u201d.

We see the \u201cflamboyant\u201d moorish idol fish \u2013 which will be better known to some viewers as the droll Gill from Finding Nemo \u2013 as it congregates in large numbers and is then hunted down by sharks. If watching with children, it might be wise not to point out that the resulting melee resembles a minion buffet. There are baby sperm whales, who are learning coordination skills by chasing mangrove seeds through the water; the adults sleep upright, and look like stray statues that have escaped from Easter Island. There are manta rays, with five-metre spans, which take themselves off to \u201ccleaning stations\u201d, where other sea creatures treat them to the equivalent of a marine spa day.</p> <p>It is a televisual wonder.

The creatues are bioluminescent lava lamps, blobbing around in the blackened depths, communicating in what scientists suspect to be a secret light code that only they can see. As we roam the waters of Asia, sweeping around the planet, the awe builds and builds. \u201cMeet the sea bunny,\u201d says Attenborough, introducing a creature that is half Pok\u00e9mon, half cake fail, and though it may look cute, is one of nature\u2019s great survivors, putting predators off in a number of innovative ways. It is slow and unthreatening, and its favourite food is the toxic blue coral, which in turn makes it poisonous to anything that tries to eat it.</p> <p>I sometimes wonder if an Attenborough documentary acts as a kind of Rorschach test for viewers. Do you prefer to marvel at a fish and a snake collaborating as they combine their unique skills to hunt for food, or to endure the grim spectacle of a section on the northern fur seal, the adult males of which would not be out of place in the chaos of Mad Max? In this episode, my heart belongs to the dusky-gilled mudskipper, a resident of the mangroves with endless entertainment value, and the owner of those grasping belly fins. Despite being a fish, in the loosest possible sense, it scoffs at the idea of a primary mode of transport, walking on land, jumping through the air and skipping across the water. It is about 5cm long, but it looks like a dinosaur. Its courtship ritual is a lovely display of choreographed romance, with waving and dancing, and its name should be up in lights.</p>    <p>As ever, the \u201chow we made it\u201d finale is almost as good as the animal antics. This time, we learn how to go about filming the Indonesian Throughflow, the largest movement of water on the planet, a swirling, churning clash of currents, as if someone has pulled the plug out of a massive bath.

Here, the rampant industrialisation of the planet has tweaked delicate ecosystems, rather than ravaged them: see an Israeli power station that pumps out water that is 10C warmer than the surrounding seas. While there is little mention of what those heated waters have done on a larger scale, it does point out that it has accidentally benefited the pregnant female dusky sharks that now gather in the area.

      "bodyText": "The new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has said the Partygate scandal was \u201coverblown\u201d as she rejected the need to \u201cchurn over\u201d everything that went wrong with previous Tory prime ministers. Badenoch won the party leadership on Saturday and said she was going to be \u201chonest\u201d about what went wrong in the party under her predecessors. However, speaking on BBC One\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, the new party leader said Boris Johnson was a \u201cgreat prime minister\u201d and that he had fallen into a \u201ctrap\u201d of breaking Covid rules that should never have been introduced. Badenoch said she had resigned during Johnson\u2019s premiership because of \u201cserious issues\u201d but not because of the Partygate scandal, which was \u201coverblown\u201d. Asked whether the public was wrong to be upset about Partygate, when Johnson and others in Downing Street did not stick to the Covid rules they introduced, Badenoch said: \u201cNo, they were not wrong to be upset about Partygate. The problem was that we should not have criminalised everyday activities the way that we did. People going out for walks, all of them having fixed-penalty notices, that was what ended up creating a trap for Boris Johnson.\u201d Badenoch acknowledged Tory mistakes in government, saying: \u201cWe need to be honest, that we got things wrong.

Maybe Palmer to Chelsea was like that too? Except I suspect that City wouldn\u2019t mind having him in the squad now.\u201d</p> <p>I agree. Palmer is best with a blank canvas, and Pep doesn\u2019t really do those. That said, Palmer could still have played from the right for City and scored 20+ goals a season.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T16:29:44.272Z\">at 4.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-67279d348f080a1fc5f95961\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-03T15:58:30.349Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Full time: Tottenham 4-1 Aston Villa</strong></p> <p>Spurs, who were 1-0 down at half-time, blew Aston Villa <em>away</em> in an electric second half.

The focus will be on United, as it tends to be when they\u2019ve just sacked another manager, but it\u2019s probably a bigger game for Chelsea. A win would take them fourth in the table*, five points behind the leaders Liverpool, and set them up for an even bigger game at home to Arsenal next weekend.</p> <p>All logic says Chelsea won\u2019t be title contenders until next season at the earliest, although this isn\u2019t a club that cares much for logic. And they have Cole Palmer, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ANY7Ez4g2Y\">imagination and brilliance</a> are making even the most level-headed neutral get carried away.</p> <p>Even so, if you offered Enzo Maresca a fourth-place finish he\u2019d surely take it. Ruben Amorim certainly would. United \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 have had a desperate start to the season, yet the imperfections of the other big teams provide a soup\u00e7on of hope. If United win today they\u2019ll be only three points behind Chelsea and four behind Arsenal. Funny old game.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>4.30pm.</p> <p><em>* Third if Aston Villa don\u2019t win at Spurs in the 2pm game.

      "bodyText": "Okay, that\u2019s it for today. Thanks for your company and emails \u2013 goodnight. Bruno Fernandes\u2019s reaction I always look at the goalkeeper before facing them. Last season he did something differently [when he saved Fernandes\u2019s penalty] so I changed the way I wanted to kick the ball and I was successful. Every week is challenging at this club. We all know Erik has gone and it\u2019s not good for anyone \u2026 when a manager leaves you have to look in the mirror first because it means the team is not doing well. Everyone is involved but only one person pays because it\u2019s easier to get rid of a manager than 15 players. I spoke with Erik and apologised to him if there was something I could have done better for him. I feel really disappointed that he\u2019s gone. I wasn\u2019t scoring goals which is a big thing for me and the team and I feel a big responsibility because of that. [On Ruben Amorim] I\u2019ve spoken with him a couple of times when I went to watch Sporting. I watch all their games because it\u2019s my team there and I know how they play. But we don\u2019t know what the manager will do because we have different players here. For now we have to do our best for Ruud; he deserves that. David Hytner\u2019s report from Old Trafford I still think this was the highlight of the game With 12 points from 10 games, this is Man Utd\u2019s worst start to a league season since the dog days of Big Ron in 1986-87. That was a real shocker. After taking 30 points from the first 10 games in 1985-86, United picked up eight the following season. The updated Premier League table Fernandes\u2019s corner doesn\u2019t beat the first man, and that\u2019s the end of that. A poor game came to life when Bruno Fernandes put Man Utd ahead from the penalty spot in the 70th minute. The outstanding Moises Caicedo equalised soon after with a cracking volley, and both teams had a chance to win it in a frantic finale. The result lifts Chelsea above Arsenal and into fourth. Even so, when the dust settles they will probably reflect on a missed opportunity. Maybe they\u2019re doing it already; maybe there is no dust. 90+6 min United break, Garnacho gets round the back on the left and hammers a low cross that is superbly cut out by Caicedo at the near post. Zirkzee was waiting behind him to score. United have one last corner\u2026 90+5 min Palmer twists Casemiro inside out on the edge of the area and drives a shot that is blocked. 90+4 min: No red card for Martinez I\u2019m a bit surprised at that. It was a really poor tackle, both cynical and nasty. Maybe it didn\u2019t clear the 2024-25 VAR High Bar, who knows. Jackson and Amad were all booked for the post-foul nonsense. 90+4 min: VAR check! This could well be a red card from Martinez. He scraped his studs across the knee of Palmer, who had lobbed the ball over him and was away. Now the players on both sides are having a bit of aggro. 90+3 min Martinez is booked for a really poor tackle on Palmer. I\u2019d like to see that again as it looked high as well as cynical. 90+1 min Four minutes of added time. The last quarter of the game has been a lot of fun. 90 min: Great chance for Fernandes! What an opportunity to win it! Fernandes\u2019s little through pass to Zirkzee was intercepted and deflected back to him on the edge of the area. He controlled the ball deftly on the chest, only to smash an overexcitable volley into orbit. 89 min: So close from Garnacho! The game is very open now, almost ragged. Lindelof keeps Chelsea penned in with a good header down to Garnacho on the left side of the area. The ball bounces up awkwardly, almost behind Garnacho, who swishes a terrific shot that only just clears the crossbar. 87 min Mudryk sees Palmer this time, backheeling the ball into his path on the left wing when that Chelsea corner is only half cleared. Palmer hammers a low cross that is well held by the diving Onana. 87 min Fernandes gets back to make an important tackle on Mudryk and concede a corner. For a split second Mudryk had the chance to find the unmarked Palmer on the edge of the area; I don\u2019t think he saw him. 86 min One small plus for Man Utd today is that Bruno Fernandes is starting to look himself after a really poor start to the season. He\u2019s not perfect, by any means, but can you imagine the state of United without him in the last few years. 84 min A gorgeous volleyed backheel from Fernandes releases Zirkzee, who doesn\u2019t have the pace to beat the last man Fofana. Zirkzee does well to keep the ball but the attack eventually peters out. As Gary Neville says on Sky, Hojlund has been waiting for an opportunity like that for 83 minutes. Chelsea break and Casemiro is booked for a foul on Neto. He then gives somebody a ferocious brollocking; I think it was a teammate but I\u2019m not certian. 84 min: Man Utd substitutions Joshua Zirkzee and Victor Lindelof replace Rasmus Hojlund and Manuel Ugarte. Lindelof has gone straight into midfield. 82 min While Chelsea aren\u2019t exactly banging the door down, they do look the likelier winners. Pedro Neto has been particularly lively since moving across to the right. When Madueke is good, he\u2019 very very good, but I do wonder if Chelsea would be even stronger with Neto on the right and either Sancho or Nkunku on the left. 81 min \u201cI get really annoyed when penalties are given for these \u2018fouls\u2019,\u201d says Pete Tomlin. \u201cWhat, exactly, are goalkeepers supposed to do? \u201cThat contact was NOWHERE near enough to knock a player off his feet. Keepers have got to be allowed to make challenges without fear of giving away penalties. Referees, players, supporters, etc have also got to get away from thinking that any contact at all instantly means penalty!\u201d Doesn\u2019t the impact of the touch depending on the speed at which the forward is running and also their body position? I haven\u2019t had chance to scrutinise this decision but, while I agree with your point about the groupthink around contact, in real time I thought it was a foul. 78 min Garnacho\u2019s cross shot deflects behind for a corner after United win the ball high up the field. It wasn\u2019t a great effort in truth so he\u2019ll take the corner. 77 min The nature of live blogs is such that you rarely mention the blue-collar workers, but Caicedo has been terrific every time I\u2019ve seen Chelsea this season. After a difficult first year at Chelsea he is starting to look like, well, Moises Caicedo. 76 min: Great chance for Chelsea! A loose ball deflects towards Jackson in the United area. He\u2019s covered by De Ligt so knocks it back to Enzo Fernandez on the edge of the area. Onana is in no man\u2019s land but an unusually flustered balloons his shot over the bar. Moises Caicedo equalises with a belter. He was probably the best player on the pitch before the goal and he certainly is now. A corner from the right, won by Neto, was headed away to the edge of the area by Casemiro. Caicedo took a couple of steps back and rifled a volley that went through the legs of Mudryk and beat Onana to his right. Pick that out! 73 min: Man Utd substitution Amad Diallo on, Marcus Rashford off. 72 min: Chelsea substitution Enzo Fernandez and Mykhailo Mudryk have replaced Romeo Lavia and Noni Madueke. Bruno Fernandes sends Sanchez the wrong way and slides on his knees in delight! It\u2019s been a dog of a game but this would be a big win for United. The chance came when Casemiro pinged an angled cross into the area from the right. Fofana got under the ball, allowing Hojlund to pull away, control the ball at the far post and then knock it away from the diving Sanchez. 68 min: Penalty to Man Utd! Hojlund gets to a 55/45 ball a split second before Sanchez, who dives at his feet and brings him down. Hojlund was moving away from goal and Sanchez didn\u2019t really need to commit. 68 min \u201cFollowing Spurs\u2019 modern take on Zemanlandia isn\u2019t easy,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cbut both Chelsea and Manchester United are lethargic. It\u2019s like the players woke up this morning and thought: \u2018Ugh, November\u2026\u201d and pulled their blankets over their heads.\u201d 67 min Rashford is penalised for a challenge on Neto, slaps the ground in frustration and is booked. 65 min: Chance for Man Utd! Fernandes breaks down the right, moves into the area and lays the ball back to Garnacho. He\u2019s totally unmarked, 10 yards out, but he snatches at the shot and kicks the ball into the ground, allowing Sanchez to make an easy save. That\u2019s United\u2019s best chance of the game. 64 min A panel on the Sky Sports coverage reminds us that only Southampton (7) have scored fewer than Man Utd\u2019s 8 Premier League goals this season. In some games they\u2019ve missed excellent chances; today, not so much. Cucurella\u2019s long-range shot is blocked, then Neto\u2019s daisycutter is comfortably saved by Onana. 63 min A reminder that, when Chelsea last won at Old Trafford, Juan Mata was in a blue shirt (and scored the only goal), Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafa Benitez were the managers and the list of players involved included Fernando Torres, Wayne Rooney, Nathan Ake, Petr Cech and, er, Jonny Evans. 59 min Fernandes takes the corner short to Rashford on the left edge of the area. He cuts across the outrushing Palmer and belts a shot that is too close to Sanchez. Even so, Sanchez did well to hold it as it came through a crowd and bounced in front of him. 58 min Ugarte drives a terrific long pass out to Rashford on the right. His early cross bounces awkwardly at the far post and is studded behind for a corner by James. 55 min: Just wide from Pedro Neto! Palmer curls a simple pass across to field to Neto. He scurries towards the backpedalling Dalot, uses the overlapping Cucurella by not using him and whistles a cross shot just wide of the far post. That was a pretty good effort. 54 min Chelsea have some great attacking options on the bench including Christopher Nkunku and Joao Felix. United have a few injuries but they can turn to Amad Diallo and/or Joshua Zirkzee if they want. 52 min This is the highlight of the game so far. 51 min Casemiro, who scored a screamer in the week, has a shot from 25 yards that is blocked by Colwill. 49 min A slow start to the second half. It feels like this game is Chelsea\u2019s to win; United are working hard but their lack of confidence going forward is increasingly apparent. 46 min Peep peep! Chelsea substitution Marc Cucurella is on for Malo Gusto, so Reece James has moved across to right-back. Half-time reading \u2018You want loyalty, go get yourself a dog.\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s also a popular Swedish cop series called Beck,\u201d says Tony Clifton. \u201cFact. A mate of mine in Sweden met a woman online who told him she was into Beck. He thought she meant the musician. Nope.\u201d And she wasn\u2019t into that TV nonsense either. A frantic, sometimes scruffy first half ends goalless. Chelsea played the more cohesive football without creating many clear chances. In fact neither keeper had a really difficult save to make, though Noni Madueke and Marcus Rashford did hit the woodwork. See you in 15 minutes for more 21st century blood and thunder. 45+2 min: Rashford hits the bar! Fernandes, 30 yards out to the left of centre, clips a lovely angled pass over the Chelsea defence. Rashford meets it 10 yards out eight yards out and slides a sidefoot volley off the top of the bar. That\u2019s the last kick of the half. 45+1 min Palmer\u2019s free-kick is headed away by Casemiro. 45 min Dalot is booked for flattening Pedro Neto just outside the area on the left wing. There will be two minutes of added time. 44 min Palmer curls the free-kick beyond the far post, where Madueke (I think) knocks it dangerously back across goal. United eventually scramble the ball clear. 42 min Palmer improvises brilliantly on the halfway line to wrongfoot both Rashford and Casemiro and move into space. Ugarte decides he has to take a yellow card for the team and bundles Palmer over 30 yards from goal. \u201cThat\u2019s the best moment of the half,\u201d says Gary Neville\u2019s of Palmer\u2019s delicious touch. 39 min \u201cDocumentary idea: when Pep met Beck,\u201d says Paul Griffin. Face to face interview, covering POMO v tiki-taka, Catalan independence v Cambridgeshire independence, Messi and Xavi v Alan Kimble, and Steve Claridge and physical threats in half time team talks v data in half time team talks. Music by Beck (the other one).\u201d It took me a sentence and a half to realise you were talking about John Beck and not, you know, Beck Beck. 38 min There\u2019s a load of pushing and shoving in the wall, which delays the free-kick by over two minutes. Eventually Fernandes clips a tame effort into the wall; moments later, Sanchez kicks away Garnacho\u2019s cross from the byline. 36 min Sanchez makes an excellent save from Hojlund, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted as the referee had already given United a free-kick for a foul by Gusto on Ugarte just outside the D. Gusto is booked. 35 min Palmer collects a poor pass from Ugarte in the centre circle and moves all the way to the edge of the area, United\u2019s defenders backpedalling nervously. Eventually he drives a low shot that is again blocked by De Lgt. 34 min The corner is taken short and eventually swung deep. Onana drops the ball and is relieved to grab it at the second attempt. 33 min The relentless Gusto wins another corner, this time off Casemiro. Chelsea have certainly been the smoother side, though there isn\u2019t much in the game overall. 31 min Caicedo is penalised for a late tackle on Fernandes. The referee gives him a warning rather than a card. 30 min Palmer has time to turn on the halfway line and move \u2013 he doesn\u2019t run, don\u2019t be so vulgar \u2013 into space. He squares the ball to Gusto, who finds the overlapping Madueke, who in turn wins a corner. The corner is too close to Onana. 28 min \u201cWhen he appeared seemingly from nowhere, spent ages letting his knee repair, then started scoring a billion goals for a brilliant United side, van Nistelrooy was an easy man to dislike,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAnd he looked awkward and gangly and weird. We all grow up, and he comes across like a thoughtful, intelligent guy. That\u2019s fine. But how has he turned into such a handsome fella? That picture of him at the top of the feed is amazing! And before anyone suggests it\u2019s the restorative power of a beard and glasses, why doesn\u2019t that work for me? Anyway, back in the rare, but not unprecedented, position of hoping for a United win. Because Chelsea could be a rival for Liverpool. Whereas United, well, we all know\u2026\u201d I\u2019m sure all Arsenal fans will share your sentiments. The oddity of Van Nistelrooy\u2019s career is that, while he was utterly deadly for his first three seasons, United often weren\u2019t. In fact they won only one league title in his five years at the club, by far their worst run under Sir Alex Ferguson after their breakthrough in 1992-93. 27 min Hojlund delays a through ball to Garnacho, who is then flagged offside. It looked a straightforward decision in real time but replays suggest it was really close, so I\u2019m not sure why the assistant put his flag up. 25 min Gusto finds himself on the left side of the United area in open play. He knocks the ball infield to Jackson, who tries to lob the ball over the last defender but gets too much on it. 24 min Garnacho curls straight at Sanchez from the edge of the area after a rapid United break. It was on his weaker left foot, hence the. 22 min Rashford beats Gusto with a dizzying flip-flap and slides a low cross that is kicked away by Sanchez at the near post. The rebound comes quickly to Fernandes, who doesn\u2019t have time to adjust his body position and shoots over the bar. Hojlund thought he was fouled off the ball, and in the area, by Colwill in the build up. I\u2019m not sure he was; more importantly the Stockley Park Massive aren\u2019t interested. 19 min Onana plays a very dangerous pass to Casemiro, facing his own goal on the edge of the area. Caicedo (I think) is on him like a shot and Casemiro is relieved to see his clearance/pass deflect off Caicedo and loop over the bar. I\u2019ll say it again: John Beck\u2019s Cambridge did not have this problem. Not once, not ever. 18 min Chelsea are starting to dominate possession in their slow-slow-slow-quick style. After a promising, patient move, Neto\u2019s deep cross is headed away well by Martinez at the far post. 16 min \u201cBurberry,\u201d is the subject of Joe Pearson\u2019s email. \u201cIn defence of Gary, that \u2018Open Spaces\u2019 ad was pretty cool.\u201d What are you all talking about? Hang on, are you the crew? IS SOMETHING BRILLIANT HAPPENING? 14 min: Madueke hits the post! Palmer\u2019s inswinging corner is headed against the outside of the near post by Madueke, barely four yards from goal. Fofana was behind him and would have had a better chance, although Madueke was entitled to go for it. The ball ran loose to Colwill, who hit the side netting and was then wiped out by Martinez. VAR isn\u2019t interested. 13 min Chelsea are starting to look dangerous, particularly in transition. Madueke plays in the underlapping Gusto, whose cross is put behind for a corner by Martinez. 11 min Casemiro is playing as the right-sided central midfielder, which means he\u2019s directly up against Cole Palmer. I guess Ruud van Nistelrooy values Casemiro\u2019s experience and intelligence over Ugarte\u2019s mobility. 9 min The first opening for Chelsea. A risky square pass from Casemiro is nicked by Caicedo, who slides it quickly forward to Palmer in the area. He tries to discombobulate De Ligt with a body swerve or 12 but De Ligt keeps his eyes on the prize (well, the ball) and blocks Palmer\u2019s eventual shot. 6 min \u201cFour words,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cCole Palmer: Burberry advert.\u201d One word. Eh? 5 min United are pressing with intent and have won the ball high up the field on a couple of occasions. No openings for either side though. 3 min Man Utd have started with Mazraoui at left-back rather than Dalot, and Rashford on the left wing for now. Reece James is at left-back for Chelsea, which means there are four natural right-backs on the field. See, some people do want to be Gary Neville when they grow up. Man Utd (4-2-3-1) Onana; Dalot, de Ligt, Martinez, Mazraoui; Casemiro, Ugarte; Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford; Hojlund. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Sanchez; Gusto, Fofana, Colwill, James; Caicedo, Lavia; Madueke, Palmer, Pedro Neto; Jackson. 1 min After a lusty rendition of Take Me Home United Road, Rasmus Hojlund has the first kick of the match. United are kicking from left to right on the gogglebox. The captains Bruno Fernandes and Reece James lead their teams onto the field. I didn\u2019t realise that the last Chelsea manager to win at Old Trafford was\u2026 Rafa Benitez, back in May 2013. Ruud van Nistelrooy scored a few goals against Chelsea back in the day. He also forced one of the great Premier League saves from Carlo Cudicini in January 2003. A lot has been written about Erik ten Hag this week, but nothing better than this forensic piece by Tim de Lisle. It\u2019s full of great lines, shrewd analysis and original observations. It wasn\u2019t just the results. Ten Hag\u2019s team had less of an identity after 26 months than Unai Emery\u2019s Villa or Ange Postecoglou\u2019s Spurs had in six. He often sent out a team that you just knew would get overrun in midfield. His substitutions seldom made them better: he managed to overturn the proud United tradition of the Fergie-time winner, losing more PL games to goals in 90+ minutes than all his predecessors put together. A reminder of the teams Man Utd (4-2-3-1) Onana; Mazraoui, de Ligt, Martinez, Dalot; Ugarte, Casemiro; Rashford, Fernandes, Garnacho; Hojlund. Substitutes: Bayindir, Lindelof, Zirkzee, Diallo, Evans, Wheatley, Amass, Fletcher, Fitzgerald. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Sanchez; Gusto, Fofana, Colwill, James; Caicedo, Lavia; Madueke, Palmer, Pedro Neto; Jackson. Substitutes: Jorgensen, Cucurella, Adarabioyo, Badiashile, Fernandez, Mudryk, Joao Felix, Nkunku, Veiga. Referee Robert Jones. Match report: Tottenham 4-1 Aston Villa Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s pre-match thoughts It\u2019s been a week of mixed emotions \u2013 Erik leaving, taking over, Wednesday\u2019s game and how it went. There\u2019s been no contact [with Ruben Amorim]. It\u2019s been communicated to the players that I\u2019ll be in charge until next Sunday and then the new manager will take over. That means we can focus on trying to win the next three games. From the archive A League Cup meeting, instantly forgettable were it not for one of football\u2019s greatest-ever juxtapositions of beauty and the beast. Ron Harris had many qualities, but subtlety was not one of them. Here he is heaving into view from way out, belabouring George Best\u2019s ankles with a proper old-school reducer. It\u2019s a textbook piece of uberviolence \u2013 a vicious sliding tackle perfectly timed and executed, as graceful as brutality can ever get \u2013 but it was all for naught. Best ignored Chopper\u2019s galoot-isms, somehow retained his balance \u2013 despite being kicked almost horizontal in mid-air \u2013 and continued his run. Beauty and the beast. As the willowy, long-haired Best sashays round the keeper and calmly slots home, as androgynous as you like, Harris, bloated with testosterone, picks himself heavily off the turf. This pass, though. I just can\u2019t get enough. Read Jacob Steinberg on the quietly impressive Enzo Maresca This is a process and not the story of one man reviving a sinking ship. The bigger point is Maresca has fitted into Chelsea\u2019s structure. He has collaborated with the sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, and judging him solely on results is reductive. The more pertinent question is whether Maresca is improving his players, finding common ground with the recruitment team and working productively across a set-up implemented by Stewart and Winstanley. So far the answer is yes. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about football to throw around words like \u2018tactical discipline\u2019 and whatnot but watching Cole Palmer now you get the sense that he would\u2019ve never flourished as much under Pep, no?\u201d says Phil Podolsky. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Pep is Tony Pulis exactly but you know what I mean, right? Which reminds me what you once wrote about RvN\u2019s move to Madrid \u2013 that it was a rare transfer that was beneficial for all the three parties involved. Maybe Palmer to Chelsea was like that too? Except I suspect that City wouldn\u2019t mind having him in the squad now.\u201d I agree. Palmer is best with a blank canvas, and Pep doesn\u2019t really do those. That said, Palmer could still have played from the right for City and scored 20+ goals a season. Full time: Tottenham 4-1 Aston Villa Spurs, who were 1-0 down at half-time, blew Aston Villa away in an electric second half. John Brewin has all the details. Ruud van Nistelrooy will manage United for three more games, all at Old Trafford, while Ruben Amorim serves his notice at Sporting Lisbon. Read Jonathan Wilson on Ruben Amorim In Amorim, United finally have one of the thrusting pups of European management, somebody who drew interest from both Liverpool and Manchester City. Not only that, but there is an obvious similarity to [Sir Alex] Ferguson in that in a league that is essentially a duopoly, he took a third force to the title. Ruud van Nistelrooy makes three changes from the side that walloped Leicester in the Carabao Cup. Andre Onana returns in goal, with Altay Bayindir dropping to the bench, while Noussair Mazraoui and Rasmus Hojlund replace Victor Lindelof and Joshua Zirkzee. Enzo Maresca, who made 11 changes for the Carabao Cup tie at St James\u2019 Park, makes 11 more: it\u2019s the same team that started against Newcastle in the Premier League a week ago. We interrupt the Manchester United news cycle to bring you an association football match from Old Trafford: United v Chelsea in the Premier League. The focus will be on United, as it tends to be when they\u2019ve just sacked another manager, but it\u2019s probably a bigger game for Chelsea. A win would take them fourth in the table*, five points behind the leaders Liverpool, and set them up for an even bigger game at home to Arsenal next weekend. All logic says Chelsea won\u2019t be title contenders until next season at the earliest, although this isn\u2019t a club that cares much for logic. And they have Cole Palmer, whose imagination and brilliance are making even the most level-headed neutral get carried away. Even so, if you offered Enzo Maresca a fourth-place finish he\u2019d surely take it. Ruben Amorim certainly would. United \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 have had a desperate start to the season, yet the imperfections of the other big teams provide a soup\u00e7on of hope. If United win today they\u2019ll be only three points behind Chelsea and four behind Arsenal. Funny old game. Kick off 4.30pm. * Third if Aston Villa don\u2019t win at Spurs in the 2pm game. You can follow that with John Brewin.",

      "bodyText": "Giles Richards\u2019 report is here on Verstappen\u2019s masterclass win in S\u00e3o Paulo so that means that is all from me today. Thank you for joining me on what was one of the most chaotic F1 races I have ever seen! Join us back here in three weeks time for what will surely be a decisive race in Las Vegas. A disappointed Norris after his lowest finish when starting from pole this season: The wet start is just a bit of a gamble. It was a tough day, I did my best. I made some mistakes. I have faith in the team in what they say and they trust me. [The pit stop] was just unlucky. It\u2019s a rule that every driver disagrees with at one point. [Max] drove well. But he got lucky. Christian Horner speaks after Verstappen\u2019s victory: Incredible performance from him. One of his very best. It was a big day for the championship. I never expected to win that. I thought it would be good if we could get the near podium. I think in the wet and in the dry he is the best in the world at the moment. I don\u2019t think I have seen [Verstappen] that animated on the podium. It is also a testament to the behind the scenes. Everyone in Milton Keynes does not give up. Max is invaluable. That is a championships drive. To stand up and shine like that today, it marks him out with some of the greats now. He is always trying to get maximum out of the car. Final standings: Max Verstappen (Red Bull) Esteban Ocon (Alpine) Pierre Gasly (Alpine) George Russell (Mercedes) Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) Lando Norris (McLaren) Yuki Tsunoda (RB) Oscar Piastri (McLaren) Liam Lawson (RB) Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Sergio P\u00e9rez (Red Bull) Oliver Bearman (Haas) Valtteri Bottas (Sauber) Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin) Zhou Guanyu (Sauber) Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) Franco Colapinto (Williams) Nico H\u00fclkenberg (Haas) Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) Our top three chat happily together, rehashing the race before they go out on the podium to loud cheers. That is quite rare, you usually get one or two grumpy faces who are upset they have lost and opt to stay silent before going on stage. The top three speak after the race. Verstappen on his win: My emotions today were a rollercoaster. Starting in P17 I knew it would be a very tough race. We stayed out of trouble, made the right calls, we stayed calm and we were flying. It was very hard to pass around here with the new tarmac. I knew I had to go for it. Ocon: After a difficult season, what a day. Someone very important to us said: \u2018In the rain, the cars are almost equal.\u2019 I am so happy to be on the podium. The car was extremely difficult on the dry and I felt that ease when it rained. Gasly: It\u2019s incredible for the whole team. We have had a tough season but in this conditions anything is possible. Two cars on the podium, I don\u2019t think anyone would have had that on their bingo card. Everyone should be very proud today. Russell finishes fourth and Leclerc fifth. Norris finishes in sixth but that may change after the investigation for that start issue on the grid. Awful day for McLaren. Verstappen\u2019s arms are outstretched on his car before he runs to his team to hug them all. He finished 19sec ahead of second place and his run of 10 GPs without a win ends. He can win his fourth title in Las Vegas if he beats Norris there. What a statement win for the Dutchman and Red Bull. It is a masterclass of how to race in the wet after starting in P17. Alpine get second and third on the podium with Ocon and Gasly and the team celebrates wildly. Lap 65/69: Another fastest lap for Verstappen. This might be one of his best races of the season, given how far back he was. P\u00e9rez bails after trying to get past Hamilton. Alonso tells his radio that he will finish the race for the mechanics but that his back is in pain and that the \u201cbouncing is not normal\u201d. Lap 62/69: Norris\u2019 radio tells him that Piastri have a penalty so to get as close to Leclerc but Norris interrupts to tell him that is what he is trying to do. He sounds quite frustrated. Lap 61/69: Alpine have two and three in the podium right now. They will jump from ninth to sixth in constructers standings. They have also not done a pit stop. Lap 59/69: Ten laps to go! Verstappen well in front as he once again hits another fastest lap. He is 10.5sec in front. A masterclass from him if this stays as is. McLaren is having a day to forget as Norris and Piastri are stuck in sixth and seventh. Lap 56/69: That incident between P\u00e9rez and Lawson has been noted by the FIA as they did touch. Lawson says to his team that P\u00e9rez drove into the side of him. Lap 55/69: P\u00e9rez tries again against Lawson and they\u2019re wheel to wheel but again he can\u2019t find the speed. The Mexican then goes wide and Hamilton overtakes him. Lap 54/69: P\u00e9rez desperate to overtake Lawson into ninth but the rain makes it impossible even though he is on the inside. He keeps trying the move though. Lap 52/69: Verstappen is being told to find a bit of water because one of his front tyres is at peak heat and it needs to be cooled down. He still leads by almost 7sec. Lap 51/69: Piastri is under pressure by Tsunoda and the two go head to head but the McLaren driver has the inside and just manages to keep his spot. Lap 50/69: Leclerc is comfortable with his tyres and his pace and Norris is struggling to overtake. He is constantly going wide on turns which is obviously cutting into his time. Lap 49/69: Verstappen has just marked up three fastest laps in a row. Unreal. Lap 46/69: Piastri makes way for his teammate Norris who us now at sixth. He now looks to take over Leclerc and Russell. Leclerc has been noted for joining the track unsafely at Turn 4 \u2013 another infringement. Lap 45/69: Fastest lap for Verstappen at 1:22.876. Lap 44/69: Alonso goes wide at Turn 12 and is on the grass. Lap 43/69: Remember, Verstappen was in P17 at the beginning and he now leads by 1.5sec. Ocon in second and Gasly. Norris still in seventh after that disastrous restart with Piastri, Russell and Leclerc ahead of him. Lap 43/69: Norris straight out in the first corner and Verstappen takes the lead! It all kicked off at the restart. Lap 42/69: Leclerc\u2019s radio tells him there may be more rain at the end of the race. The safety car is ending and Verstappen is weaving around, trying to get some heat under his tyres. Lap 41/69: Norris\u2019 radio tells him to stay off the white lines. It seems that\u2019s where a lot of the cars are slipping. The safety car is still out there so no change in the positions yet. Lap 40/69: Ocon still leading with Verstappen behind. Norris in fifth. Lap 39/69: Sainz is in the barriers! Safety car is out and sadly his race is done. The front of the car is pretty badly damaged. Lap 38/69: Norris tells his radio that if the weather stays as it is then it will be those tyres until the end. Lap 37/69: Tsunoda\u2019s pace has seemingly disappeared. He is down to eighth and is struggling against Hamilton. Lap 36/69: Bearman goes spinning off and into the barriers in an unforced error. Yellow flag goes up but he gets back onto the track in 16th and last place. It has been a bit of a tough race for him. Lap 35/69: Ocon 2sec ahead of Verstappen. Hamilton back into the top 10 but the view shows us he is basically driving into a wall of water. Lap 34/69: Norris goes wide! But he recovers quickly and gets ahead of Russell for a few moments before the Mercedes man recovers. Leclerc also goes wide but gets back on very quickly. The tyres are cold and no one can get a proper grip. Lap 34/69: Bearman has gone off the grass but it\u2019s green flag and Ocon speeds away. Verstappen tries to overtake him right from the beginning. Lap 33/69: We are back on the track. It has been such an eventful race and we are not even halfway yet. Reminder it is a rolling start with the safety car. Red flag: The FIA confirms that it will be a rolling start for the restart. Black flag for Hulkenberg. He is disqualified for receiving assistance after his crash. This is the first black flag on the grid since the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. Red flag: There have been so many infringements that when this race ends, there is a good chance that the order will change. We get a replay of Russell finding out there was a red flag from his radio. \u201cFuck, I said it.\u201d He clearly regrets stopping earlier. Red flag: The drivers are now out and regrouping while the red flag is out. Race control note an earlier Hamilton/Lawson incident and are investigating. They have also made note of Hulkenberg for receiving assistance when he should not have. Lap 33/69: Hamilton says his tyres feels like boats. The red flag means Ocon, Verstappen and Gasly, who haven\u2019t pitted in this race, can change their tyres. Norris says to his team: \u201cI guess everyone can just change their tyres for free now.\u201d Lap 32/69: Colapinto had just been in the pit but he slides and crashes hard. So much debris flies. He is OK, though. We get a cut to the Williams mechanic who has his head in his hands. Bad day for the team. The red flag goes up, of course. Lap 32/69: We hear on Ocon\u2019s radio that the rain is decreasing in 1-2mins. The safety car is still out there. Lap 31/69: Ocon has a 7sec lead over Verstappen. He opts not to pit and is maybe thinking that he will stay behind the safety car for visibility. Lap 30/69: Norris goes for the move on Russell and he gets up to the fourth. The Mercedes man was so slow and he took his chance. Safety car now out. Lap 29/69: Piastri gets a 10sec penalty for causing a collision. Ocon is now leading with Verstappen right behind him. Lap 28/69: A virtual safety car is out with Hulkenberg beached. Ocon passes Tsunoda for third and Russell says the conditions are red flag worth. Russell and Norris go to pit. They thought they were going to get a cheap pit stop but the safety car ended at the wrong time. The conditions are brutal now. It\u2019s hard to see the cars on the screen so I can\u2019t imagine how it is on the track. Lap 27/69: It is pouring now. Leclerc is stuck behind the Hamilton and it looks like that decision to pit may have not been the right one. Lap 26/69: Lawson down to ninth after off the track. Verstappen goes up to fifth. Lap 25/69: Ferrari make the first call. Leclerc pits for another set of intermediates. He comes back out in 13th. Lap 24/69: Just under 14sec between Norris and Verstappen. Ocon tries to get by Tsunoda, who will be keen for his first podium finish. Lap 23/69: Verstappen on Leclerc to his team: \u201cHe was squeezing me onto the white line, not leaving a car\u2019s width.\u201d Lap 22/69: Confirmation that it is in fact 69 laps not 70 because of the mess at the beginning. Verstappen has a bit of snap as he slides but he recovers. Lap 21/70: Russell is saying he is struggling with his brakes. Verstappen tries to overtake but Leclerc but defends well. He didn\u2019t go too far into the inside but just manages to go enough and remains in fifth. Lap 20/70: Norris just over 1sec behind Russell. He is told to keep his tyres alive as they expect more heavy rain. Hamilton tells his team that his car is not driveable. Lap 19/70: Sainz overtakes Hamilton who just goes to wide on a turn. Bearman also overtakes the seven-time champion on the inside, who is now down to 15th. Lap 18/70: Hulkenberg says on his radio how slippery it is. Russell is having a better middle sector than Norris so far and the McLaren car is getting splashed everytime he gets close to the Mercedes. Lap 18/70: More rain is coming apparently in about 15mins. Let\u2019s see if it will be as bad as yesterday\u2019s qualifying. Lap 17/70: Norris is telling his team that he is struggling to overtake Russell and that the car is \u201cso slow on the straight\u201d. Lap 16/70: Hamilton is chasing Colapinto and is hoping for a better exit to pass the newbie. Lap 15/70: Tsunoda in third is only 2sec ahead of Verstappen. Lap 14/70: Verstappen now up to sixth. He has the benefit with those new intermediate tyres which is maybe why he is finding more grip than his opponents. Lap 13/70: Norris still stuck behind Russell. Confirmation as well that no penalty for those four drivers during the race. Will be decided after. Lap 12/70: Wow! Colapinto challenges Hamilton at Turn One and he wins. The Mercedes man was on the grass moments ago and is really struggling to cool his tyres. He is down to 13th. Lap 11/70: Bearman asks his team why hs has got a penalty, saying that nothing happened to Colapinto. Lap 10/70: Verstappen up to seventh! He passes the McLaren man with ease at the inside at Turn One. Piastri did not think he would commit but the defending champion is racing with no fear. Lap 9/70: Hamilton is really struggling. Says on the radio that his car is bouncing. Lap 8/70: Confirmation that Bearman gets a 10sec penalty for starting a collision with Colapinto. Lap 7/70: We get confirmation that Norris, Russell, Tsunoda and Lawson do get starting infringements. No word on penalties yet. Verstappen is speeding and looking to take over Norris\u2019 McLaren teammate Piastri. The Dutchman is currently the fastest on the track. Lap 6/70: Verstappen gains another place, this one on Alonso. Lap 5/70: Verstappen up to ninth! And Norris now 0.9s behind Russell. Lap 4/70: We hear from Verstappen\u2019s radio that the rain will only last 2-3 minutes. The gap between Norris in 2nd and Verstappen in 10th in just over 9sec. We get a brief yellow flag for Oliver Bearman who drops now to 17th. Lap 3/70: Drivers are reporting heavy rain in the final sector of the track. So much spray. Lap 2/70: Verstappen passes Hamilton after the first corner of the lap and he is now in 10th. That was so easy for him. Hamilton does not look comfortable in the car at all. Russell still leads with Norris behind him. Lap 1/70: Russell immediately makes a move and gets to the front. Everyone makes it through in the beginning without any hits. But P\u00e9rez almost gets stuck in the mud but he manages to get out quickly. Formation lap: All OK for that second attempt. We are now off for real! OK, we get another formation lap and we\u2019re off again. Let\u2019s see if everyone can stay on the track this time. Still unsure as to whether Norris will be found guilty and if so, if he will be penalised. Also, Norris was the first to go, but others followed him. Are they all found guilty? Verstappen was one of the drivers who did not leave the grid after the aborted start. He thought everyone at the front should have waited to go after the aborted start. There is now a wait for Norris. The McLaren driver is now being investigated for a starting procedure infringement for going after the aborted start. The replay shows there was no green light and he went ahead anyway. There is a lot of confusion as to what is going on right now. Some of the drivers just remained where they were on the grid when an aborted start was announced while others took another lap \u2026 what a mess. Race control confirms we get an aborted start and the drivers get another formation lap. Stroll is now out of his car and they are trying to get his car away. Formation lap: Stroll completely locked-up the rears at Turn Four, fails to break and ends up in the wall. Yikes! He\u2019s now in the gravel after trying to turn the car around. The leading cars are now at the start line but surely we will be delayed here. Off they go for the formation lap! We are underway at Interlagos. The starting grid. We\u2019re inching nearer to the start! We start with a lovely rendition of the Brazilian national anthem at Interlagos and the drivers are undergoing their final preparations. Norris\u2019 race engineer tells Sky Sports that they do \u201cnot have any concerns\u201d regarding the weather. It feels dry, it feels quite bright and hot now. Whether or not the track will dry out for the race start, I\u2019m not sure. Potentially there\u2019s more weather on the way, but I don\u2019t really want to give away too much what we think the weather is going to do. Ferrari have changed Carlos Sainz\u2019s power unit and gearbox and now the Spaniard will start the race from the pit lane. Albon releases his own statement after not being able to race due to damages his car: Today is a tough one to swallow when qualifying was coming along nicely. We don\u2019t know what caused the crash but we\u2019ll look into it, apologies to everyone in the garage, this was a race where anything could happen and I felt we could have done something great. The FIA has just confirmed that Verstappen will still start in P17 despite Albon not racing. Everyone else will move up one place but the Dutchman remains because of his penalty. It will be interesting to see how Red Bull and Verstappen\u2019s mindset once the pit lane opens. Verstappen was extremely frustrated after his qualifying exit and Christian Horner said it was \u201cthe second day in the row that we have had late calls\u201d. Alex Albon will not race for Williams after damage was sustained to his car during qualifying due to the weather conditions. Albon progressed to Q3 and was up in second position when he lost control of his car for the first corner and crashed into the barriers causing damage to all four corners. Full team statement below. It was a nightmare qualifying session for Verstappen and Red Bull in Brazil. The Dutchman and his teammate Sergio Perez went down in Q2 after a late red flag caught them out following a Lance Stroll crash. Verstappen was visibly angry about the delay in throwing the red flag because he felt it had lets others to knock him out of the top 10. It\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s ridiculous. If a car hits a wall it needs to be a straight red flag, I don\u2019t know why it has to be 40-seconds for a red flag to come out. A review of the session shows it did not make a difference to Verstappen, who will start all the way down in P17 given he has a five-place grid penalty. Norris, on the other hand, secured pole position after scraping by in the first session. He was in the drop zone before jumping up to 15th and was the final car to progress. Here are the full results: Lando Norris (McLaren) 1:23.405sec George Russell (Mercedes) +0.173 Yuki Tsunoda (VCARB) +0.706 Esteban Ocon (Alpine) +1.070 Liam Lawson (VCARB) +1.079 Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) +1.120 Alex Albon (Williams) +1.252 Oscar Piastri (McLaren) +1.281 Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin) +5.593 Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) - no time ELIMINATED IN Q2 Valtteri Bottas (Kick Sauber) Max Verstappen (Red Bull) Sergio P\u00e9rez (Red Bull) Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) Pierre Gasly (Alpine) ELIMINATED IN Q1 Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Oliver Bearman (Haas) Franco Colapinto (Williams) Nico Hulkenberg (Haas) Zhou Guanyu (Kick Sauber) S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s current weather forecast may leave much to be desired but it certainly won\u2019t dampen our spirits on what may be the most important race of the year. Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen leads McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris by 44 points and the two have been at odds due to the defending champion\u2019s aggressive driving style despite reportedly being good friends. All eyes will be on the two today to see if there is any movement at the top. It would also be silly to discount Ferrari. After going back-to-back in Austin and Mexico City, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz are in good form and will want to continue their hot streak. The race time was moved up to 3.30pm GMT/12.30pm BRT but before we get to that let\u2019s see how qualifiers went.",

      "bodyText": "Senior Labour MPs have expressed their frustration at the lack of black representation in No 10 as the Conservatives elected Kemi Badenoch as their new leader. Labour sources said the WhatsApp group for Labour MPs of colour contained some furious messages from those who believe the party is not doing enough to represent black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups at the top of government. One senior Labour frontbencher said it was a \u201cserious embarrassment and a blind spot in No 10\u201d that there were no senior black staff members at the very centre of a Labour government, when the Conservatives have elected a black woman as their leader. They said there were a few people of colour among senior Downing Street staffers, including the deputy chief of staff Vidhya Alakeson and the policy adviser Rav Athwal, but they were struggling to think of any senior black advisers in Starmer\u2019s team. They said Labour was \u201cnowhere near electing a woman leader or a black leader but both is totally unthinkable at the moment\u201d. There is also frustration that there is no race relations adviser in No 10 at the moment \u2013 in contrast to under some Conservative administrations. Other concerns include the party\u2019s response to Badenoch becoming leader, with some believing it would have been better to have an MP of colour leading the response on the broadcast rounds instead of the party chair, Ellie Reeves. A record 89 minority ethnic MPs were elected to parliament overall in July 2024, according to research by the thinktank British Future, with a record number from Labour. However, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, is the only black cabinet minister in Starmer\u2019s government. The first Labour cabinet in 14 years also only has two ministers of Asian descent \u2013 Shabana Mahmood, one of the UK\u2019s first Muslim female MPs, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary. Some Labour MPs would have liked to see black women such as Chi Onwurah and Florence Eshalomi given ministerial roles, and have also raised the fact that no Asian MPs got their jobs back after resigning over the issue of Gaza. No 10 was approached for comment. It is understood there are advisers in No 10 with responsibility for community relations and that the party chair would always be the most appropriate minister to have on the broadcast round for a party politics response to a new leader.

      "bodyText": "No woman in 2024 can be surprised to learn that Donald Trump is a misogynistic bully. In 2016, he defeated Hillary Clinton, who would have been America\u2019s first female president, despite having boasted that as a celebrity you could \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d. His administration rolled back women\u2019s rights by decades in redefining domestic abuse and sexual assault. The supreme court justices he appointed overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Last year, a jury found that he had sexually abused E Jean Carroll in the 1990s, despite his ongoing denials. Yet his remark on Thursday that he would protect women \u201cwhether the women like it or not\u201d was still striking. It was not a promise but a threat. It echoed the language of a gangland boss assuring you that your business will be just fine. But it also, and most obviously, recalled the words of a controlling husband or boyfriend who knows what is best for you. It is not merely that he thinks that women\u2019s rights are expendable: he and his supporters are coming for them. Those comments have further ignited discussion of whether women can win this election for Kamala Harris. But the gender gap has in large part been a race gap. Women have favoured the Democratic candidate in every presidential race since 1996 \u2013 but white women have done so only once. They are the single largest electoral bloc, making up about 30% of voters. More white women voted for Mr Trump than Ms Clinton in 2016 \u2013 and most white women (53%) backed him last time. In contrast, 95% of black women and 61% of Hispanic women backed Joe Biden. This time, there are signs that white women may be moving towards Ms Harris. One September poll put her support in that group at 42%, compared with 40% for Mr Trump. Women were credited with preventing the \u201cred wave\u201d that many had predicted in 2022\u2019s midterms, after the sweeping away of abortion rights. The repercussions for women\u2019s lives are becoming only more widespread, deeply felt and glaring with time.

Young women increasingly identify as liberal, and put abortion at the top of their concerns (while for women overall, it comes a close second to the economy and inflation). A generational gender gap is increasingly seen internationally. But some evidence suggests that younger male Trump supporters are less likely to vote. There may still be shy Trump voters not reflected in the polls. But there are certainly scared potential Harris voters who do not want the men in their lives to know.

We can all see that Donald Trump is even more unstable and more unhinged, and now he wants unchecked power, and this time \u2026 there will be no one there to stop him.\u201d</p> <p>They have little in common as people or politicians, but as they campaigned in swing states and elsewhere in the final week before the presidential election, both the vice-president and former president converged on a unifying message to their supporters: America is at a turning point, and if I lose, the country will not be the same.</p> <p>It was in Harris\u2019s speech on Tuesday evening, held at the same Washington DC park from which Trump addressed his followers who would go on to storm the Capitol on January 6. \u201cThis election is more than a choice between two parties and two different candidates. It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American, or one ruled by chaos and division,\u201d she said.</p> <p>And it was laced throughout the conversation on Thursday evening in a suburb of Phoenix, where Trump sat down with a fawning Tucker Carlson, the conservative commentator. \u201cShe\u2019s dumb as a rock, and you can\u2019t have that,\u201d he said of Harris. \u201cWe love our country too much. You can\u2019t have it, we just went through four years of it. You can\u2019t have any more. A country can only take so much.\u201d</p> <p>The sentiment now seems certain to be on the minds of tens of millions of Americans who will vote on Tuesday. In past elections, the world\u2019s third-most-populous country has selected its next leader while its troops were fighting overseas, its economy had collapsed and, most recently, it was in the grips of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/08/coronavirus-pandemic-trump-biden-strategy-experts\">a global pandemic</a>. No external factors exist with any similar severity this year, and yet, in interviews at campaign events in Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona this week, many Democratic and Republican voters expressed a belief to the Guardian that the country stands on a precipice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lies all the time, tells them what they want to hear,\u201d retired steelworker Kevin Hinckley, 68, said of Trump as he left Harris\u2019s rally in Ann Arbor. \u201cHe\u2019s so mean, he\u2019s an awful person, pretty awful. I just hope he doesn\u2019t make it. God forbid if he does.\u201d</p> <p>Fueling much of this mood is Trump himself, who has preserved his position atop the Republican party for the better part of a decade. Big promises and dire threats have been a hallmark of his campaign style ever since he entered politics in 2015, but this year, voters are heading to the polls cognizant of what it\u2019s like having him in the White House.</p> <p>His four years in office ended with Biden defeating him and Trump spending weeks looking for ways to keep the Democrat from entering the White House anyway, which culminated in his supporters\u2019 violent and unsuccessful attempt on January 6 to stop Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory.</p> <p>Far from backing away from his involvement in the riot, Trump has instead talked about pardoning those convicted of the attack, mulled acting as \u201ca dictator\u201d on his first day back in office, and lately taken to referring to his political adversaries as \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, against whom he might send the military.</p> <p>Intellectuals with ties to Trump have authored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/01/project-2025-key-proposals\">a rightwing blueprint</a> to remake the US government called Project 2025. The former president denies having anything to do with it, but Harris argues the plan could do perhaps-irreversible damage to America\u2019s institutions, if it is followed.</p> <p>With the three supreme court justices he appointed having already supported a ruling protecting presidents from prosecution for official acts while also throwing out the constitutional right to abortion guaranteed by Roe v Wade, Harris\u2019s supporters believe Trump would spend the next four years sending the country into uncharted political territory, from which it might not emerge the same.</p> <p>\u201cI see this is really critical if we want to hold on to democracy. I really see it as sort of an existential election in that sense,\u201d said Jamie Taylor, 62, a retiree waiting to hear from Harris in Ann Arbor.</p> <p>She feared a second Trump administration \u201cwould be more fascist. So, I do think that he will carry through on his promises to really gut the civil service and put in loyalists. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll quite do the mass deportations the way that he\u2019s claimed, but I think he will do some sort of mass deportation in a way that\u2019s pretty harmful to families and probably the economics of the country. I think he\u2019ll continue to do things that \u2026 break the law.\u201d</p> <p>To his supporters, it\u2019s the opposite: Trump is the only man to fix what ails the country, from the immigrants who enter from Mexico to the consumer prices that have risen under Biden\u2019s term. \u201cOn issue after issue, Kamala broke it and I will fix it,\u201d he declared in Green Bay.</p> <p>The day prior, in Saginaw, Michigan, his running mate, the Ohio senator JD Vance, warned that if Harris wins, manufacturing jobs would be taken away from the state and go to China. Drug cartels would be free to enter from Mexico, bringing with them fentanyl that they would disguise as candy, he said.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the crash of 1929, and us, we\u2019re thinking maybe \u2026 to leave the country. We don\u2019t want to be around here to see them go back to the chaos,\u201d said Xavier Bartlett, a high school student who, at 17, attended the speech even though he was not yet old enough to vote.</p> <p>\u201cCivil war\u2019s going to break out,\u201d added 33-year-old fast-food worker Thomas Powell. If such a thing were to happen, and he doubted it would, Bartlett said it would be because Trump\u2019s supporters thought Tuesday\u2019s election was rigged.</p> <p>Standing on a busy road outside the recreation center where Vance spoke was Carol Kubczak, a volunteer with the Republican US Senate candidate Mike Rogers\u2019 campaign.</p> <p>Amid the honks of passing cars whose drivers spotted the Trump signs she and others were carrying, Kubczak, 67, described how she broke with the Democratic party and voted for Trump in 2016, but kept her choice a secret from her family. She is now barely on speaking terms with her sister because of it.</p> <p>\u201cIf, God forbid, [Harris] gets in, I really don\u2019t believe there will be any more free elections,\u201d Kubczak said.</p> <p>In the audience for Trump\u2019s Green Bay speech was Steve Wallace, a former professor turned community college administrator who reckoned that no one he works with knows about his political leanings. Dressed in a red Maga shirt, the 62-year-old said he had voted Republican for decades and that Trump\u2019s politics fit right in with his libertarian-tinged view of how the government should be run.</p> <p>He had already gotten in his ballot to help Trump win Wisconsin, but didn\u2019t share in the predictions of dire consequences if Harris is elected.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t see much change. I think it\u2019d be more divisive,\u201d he said, predicting that a Harris administration would be similar to that of Barack Obama, who many Republicans in Wisconsin believe continues to hold sway in Biden\u2019s White House.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be brighter days, there\u2019ll be dark days.

Greggs confirmed on Sunday that the celebrity chef and cookbook author had agreed to star in its inaugural Christmas promotion, in which Lawson will purr over such delicacies as vegan festive bakes.

Lawson said: \u201cAs a longtime fan of Greggs, and especially their sausage rolls, I\u2019m thrilled to be collaborating with them to celebrate the return of the iconic Christmas menu.\u201d The promotion will bring together two British household names known for their associations with former chancellors of the exchequer. The TV chef is the daughter of the late former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson, while one of his successors, George Osborne, suffered one of the most chastening moments of his political career when he dared to take on Greggs. Osborne announced plans to apply VAT to hot baked goods in his infamous \u201comnishambles\u201d budget of 2012, eventually abandoning a measure dubbed the \u201cpasty tax\u201d after heated opposition from Greggs and others. The first glimpses of the Greggs advert feature Lawson, known for her indulgent dishes and sensual turn of phrase, in paroxysms over Greggs\u2019 Christmas menu. Lawson, whose net worth has been estimated at more than \u00a315m, is shown returning to a home featuring a Christmas tree bedecked with Greggs baubles, before describing the \u201crapturous riot of flavour\u201d of the chain\u2019s festive bake. She says: \u201cSucculent filling, creamy sauce, all wrapped up in the flakiest of flaky pastries, in one or both hands, say hello to the Greggs festive bakes,\u201d before taking a bite of one. In the final scene, viewers are shown a kitchen table laden with items from the Greggs Christmas menu, ending with a platter of vegan festive bakes. The festive bake costs \u00a31.95, about 15% of the current retail price of Lawson\u2019s 2020 cookbook, Cook, Eat, Repeat: Ingredients, Recipes, and Stories, depending on the bookshop. Greggs\u2019 courtship of Lawson continues a recent strategy of pairing its no-nonsense baked goods with the finer things in life. Last month, it launched its first champagne bar in which customers can wash down steak bakes with a \u00a375 glass of Louis Roederer Cristal. The bar opened in Fenwick\u2019s store in Newcastle, the city where Greggs has its headquarters, on 24 October and will remain open until the end of December. It follows the first Greggs \u201cfine dining\u201d bistro at the same location last year, which served its popular festive bake alongside duck fat roasties, smoked pancetta, chestnuts and sprouts to more than 8,000 customers over a single month. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2024. An earlier version said that George Osborne had announced plans in his 2012 budget to apply VAT to \u201chot takeaway food\u201d; that should have said hot baked goods.",

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves has been criticised over a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d to raise \u00a3900m from online casinos in her first budget as chancellor, amid concerns about the Labour party\u2019s ties to the \u00a311bn-a-year gambling sector. Both the Liberal Democrats and Derek Webb \u2013 one of Labour\u2019s largest donors \u2013 questioned the chancellor\u2019s rejection of proposals to double remote gaming duty (RGD), levied on online games of chance, from 21% to 42%. The policy, initially proposed by the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank, was among measures under consideration by Treasury officials. It also had support from the Liberal Democrats, who wanted to use the money raised \u2013 estimated at up to \u00a3900m \u2013 to fund health and social care. But Labour, which has previously faced scrutiny over longstanding financial and personal ties to the gambling industry, ultimately decided not to include the sector among \u00a340bn of tax increases that included a change of policy on family farms and employer national insurance contributions. The UK\u2019s 21% rate of tax on online gaming will remain below that levied in multiple European countries, as well as states in the US, Australia and Canada. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said the omission \u201craises serious questions for the Labour government about why they failed to act on this issue. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly worrying that the chancellor is targeting family farms, GPs, hospices and small businesses while letting the big gambling companies off the hook.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, had earlier said a duty rise was an obvious choice for a government \u201cwho wants to tackle our social problems\u201d. Reeves also came under fire from the leading Labour donor Derek Webb, a former casino game inventor who now backs campaigns calling for tougher regulation and taxation of gambling. Webb, who is Labour\u2019s fifth-largest backer and also donates to the SMF, said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed there\u2019s been another missed opportunity to constrain the greed of the online gambling sector. \u201cIt\u2019s also a missed chance \u2026 to win popularity with the wider public, rather than with narrow detrimental business interests,\u201d he said, a reference to a pre-budget poll that showed broad support for increasing gambling taxes. The government has said gambling taxes, including RGD, will be reviewed with a view to simplifying them. But sources among those campaigning for higher RGD highlighted that Labour and Reeves have ties to the \u00a311bn-a-year gambling sector. The Coates family behind Bet365 have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to Labour and to Keir Starmer\u2019s party leadership campaign. Rachel Reeves\u2019s constituency office accepted a combined \u00a330,000 from Richard Flint, a former chief executive of Leeds-based Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, and Neil Goulden, then a director of Gamesys, the owner of Virgin Games and Rainbow Riches Casino. The chancellor has also previously written of a friendship, stretching back to their teenage years, with Michael Dugher, the former Labour MP who now chairs the gambling industry lobby group, the Betting &amp; Gaming Council (BGC). Grainne Hurst, the chief executive of the BGC, said: \u201cWe have been clear: any duty rises now would have hit customers, prevented growth, risked jobs and bolstered the unsafe, unregulated gambling black market. \u201cGovernment has listened to the BGC and our members, got the balance right and rejected calls from anti-gambling prohibitionists,\u201d said Hurst, a former Ladbrokes executive.

Eager to introduce audiences to less well-known European works, Maggie and Julian staged a series of 11 continental plays at the Greenwich Studio theatre to full houses and glowing reviews over a period of seven years. The scripts were mostly new translations by Julian, while Maggie took charge of the staging and much of the set design. In 1994 she won an outstanding achievement award from Time Out magazine for her work as artistic director on that year\u2019s season of plays, which included the satirical Erasmus Montanus by Ludvig Holberg. German by birth, Maggie also staged a run of successful German classics at the Young Vic Studio in London, which led to regular productions for London drama schools between 1990 and 2007. Maggie was born in Nuremberg to William Graffam, an American pastor in the Lutheran church, and Susanne Lange, a parish worker from the Ruhr. The eldest of seven children, she spent her childhood between the US and Germany and her formative teenage years in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where her father became a pastor to the German community. At 18 she returned to Germany to study English and German literature at the University of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, where she had her first experience of acting and directing and where she also met Julian, an aspiring actor. They married in 1978. In 1980 Maggie worked for four years as a lektorin (a native speaker providing conversation with students) in the German department at Goldsmiths, University of London, where one of her tasks was to produce the department\u2019s annual German-language play. Once that role came to an end, she took on various part-time translation jobs until in 1986 her professional theatre career began when she set up her own Rude Mechanicals theatre company in the mid-80s before going on to the Greenwich Studio theatre and company, which she and Julian bought from its previous owners, a trio of actors.

      "body": "<p>It took more than 20 minutes and eight dropped WhatsApp calls to finally connect with Farida Algoul in Gaza. Internet service is not reliable anywhere in the territory, including in the provisional co-working space in the city of Deir al-Balah, where she and 50 or so others work remotely.</p> <p>An English teacher by training, Algoul splits her time between a makeshift classroom in a tent, where she teaches for free, and a table in this cafe turned workspace where she translates documents from Arabic to English. Over the grainy video call, other freelancers who had been forcibly displaced to the central Gazan city could be seen working alongside her, all of them vying for the coveted internet connection.</p> <p>Algoul spends six hours a day in that co-working space completing assignments received via Upwork, a freelance work marketplace. It is one of three free-to-use workspaces set up by Hope Hub, an initiative started in a tent in Rafah a few months into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war\">Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza</a>. She earns $200 a month, with Upwork taking 10% and currency exchange companies another 20 to 30%. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/no-one-is-coming-to-save-them-blackouts-hide-horrors-of-siege-of-north-gaza\">\u2018No one is coming to save them\u2019: blackouts hide horrors of siege of north Gaza</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEverything is devastation around us,\u201d Algoul said. \u201cThis has diminished the economic opportunities for people in Gaza. I\u2019m looking for a job for eight months. I evacuated alone without my parents. I did not have any income to support me. I just open my laptop and go to work as a freelancer.\u201d</p> <p>Algoul, like so many others, has been left with few other options to work. Israel\u2019s 17-year <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/israel-opt-israel-must-lift-illegal-and-inhumane-blockade-on-gaza-as-power-plant-runs-out-of-fuel/\">land and sea blockade of Gaza</a> has long limited economic opportunities within the strip, among the reasons why at least <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/papp/news/freelancing-state-palestine\">12,000 workers</a> in the territory have turned to online freelance work for income, according to the UN. In the aftermath of 7 October 2023, Israel\u2019s bombardment of the already besieged strip has rendered <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/war-propels-unemployment-close-80-cent-and-shrinks-gdp-835-cent-gaza-strip#:~:text=Since%20hostilities%20erupted%20in%20October,has%20reached%2032%20per%20cent.\">jobs nearly nonexistent</a>, according to an assessment by the International Labor Organization. </p>    <p>Meanwhile, a year of airstrikes has decimated Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, making the two resources freelancers depend on \u2013 a strong internet connection and reliable electricity \u2013 hard to come by. When internet service is available, it\u2019s slow or unstable. Electricity comes and goes. </p> <p>Then there\u2019s the matter of their safety. Algoul and other workers who spoke to the Guardian said they take on considerable risk when they make their way to co-working spaces or ad-hoc internet hotspots on the street.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers in Gaza live under the constant fear of airstrikes,\u201d said Algoul, who has lost 300 members of her family over the last year. \u201cThis kind of problem, no one around the world experiences. This situation is just in Gaza.\u201d</p>    <p>Before Algoul could say more, she was interrupted by a flurry of movement. She said she had to cut the call short. Parts of the city were being bombed and everyone in the co-working space was being told to leave. Algoul, who had evacuated from the north of Gaza and left her parents behind, didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d go. But she\u2019d be fine, she said assuredly. She was just afraid for the safety of the children she taught.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to work in this environment,\u201d Algoul said. \u201cAfter one minute, I don\u2019t know if I will not exist, [if] I will be a martyr.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019d rather risk my life to work\u2019</h2> <p>When Waleed Iky talks to potential clients on Upwork or Mostaql \u2013 a popular freelancing platform in the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 he doesn\u2019t always tell them that he lives in Gaza. Iky, an entrepreneur who started a one-man marketing operation, said he worries clients might see his situation or even his background as a liability.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s risky for business to work with us sometimes,\u201d Iky said. \u201c[Sometimes] the clients know and support. If they don\u2019t, we don\u2019t mention it. We do our best for it to not affect our work.\u201d</p> <p>Disruptions to work are unavoidable, Iky said. He graduated from the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) just two months before the war began and spent the first five months of Israel\u2019s assault evacuating to cities he and his family were told would be safe from airstrikes. One of those towns, Al-Zahra, crumbled around him.</p> <p>\u201cThey destroyed the whole city,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty-four buildings collapsed in front of our eyes. For my family it was a hard night.\u201d</p> <p>During those few months, Iky and his family focused on simply staying alive. Starting his business again was the furthest thing from his mind. But now, like Algoul, he works out of Hope Hub. He currently has two clients through Upwork for whom he does marketing.</p> <p>Leaving the tents where many of the freelancers have sheltered is dangerous. There\u2019s often no telling when or where bombs will be dropped, whether they\u2019ll be shot at or otherwise attacked. But for Iky, it\u2019s better than sitting around waiting for the next bomb to go off.</p> <p>\u201cI decided to get back online,\u201d Iky said. \u201cWhen I got back to work, my psychological health got better. Staying home and not doing anything, not doing what you love, it\u2019s killing more than my muscles. I\u2019d rather work and risk my life to work than stay at home.\u201d</p>    <p>For many clients, it\u2019s been business as usual, regardless of the difficulties of workers living in Gaza under bombardment. One potential client asked Iky if he\u2019d be comfortable working with an Israeli organization. He told them he would not. They decided not to hire him. Others offer little flexibility around the deadlines they set for Iky\u2019s projects.</p> <p>\u201cSome of them are abroad who don\u2019t understand the struggle we have,\u201d Iky said.</p> <p>The freelancers have to take turns charging their laptops, in an effort to not use too much electricity. An hour of charging his laptop buys Iky four to five hours of work. When the electricity is out, he\u2019ll try to send his clients updates over WhatsApp or go to a nearby cafe and pay for internet.</p> <p>Even when they do manage to work, many freelancers have difficulty accessing their earnings. Bank branches and ATMs have been destroyed, PayPal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/24/paypal-palestine-ban-us-congress-\">has stopped providing</a> its services to all Palestinians in the occupied territories and currency exchange shops charge a fee of anywhere from 15 to 30% depending on the demand. Iky, one of the fortunate few with a bank account, often opts to wait to withdraw any money to avoid paying exorbitant fees.</p> <h2>Unstable internet and airstrikes</h2> <p>Iky is one of more than 1,300 freelancers and students who have used Hope Hub\u2019s flexible workspaces across Gaza, Egypt and now Lebanon since Salah Ahmad, who is from Gaza, and his co-founder Fady Issawi launched the initiative in January 2024. While other co-working spaces have since opened up, Hope Hub was the first to begin operating during the war and remains one of the few that is free to use. Because of the limited resources, Hope Hub divides the day into four timed shifts \u2013 the first one for remote workers, the second two for freelancers and the last for students.</p> <p>Ahmad had been working with freelancers since at least 2020 when he opened his first co-working space, which offered mentorship and training for remote workers in partnership with international universities and organizations. But he, like hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, was forced to leave his life and his dreams behind after 7 October. The building that once housed his nearly 11,000 sq ft (1,022 sq metre) workspace was hit by airstrikes twice, he said, completely destroying the company he and his team had built. Videos of the office before and after the strikes show debris and shattered glass where sleek and contemporary conference rooms and cafes once stood. Ahmad was displaced four times before he finally reached Rafah, which he and others were told would be a safe area.</p> <p>It was there, in the Tal al-Sultan refugee camp, that he started Hope Hub with five people working out of a tent. He wanted to help people restart their companies or, at the very least, find something to fill their time and drown out the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/oct/17/i-hate-the-night-life-in-gaza-amid-the-incessant-sounds-of-war\">noise of drones buzzing around them</a>.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people feel that it is very difficult to do nothing and just wait in an area that is being bombed every minute. You just wait to die in the next bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are trying to survive.\u201d</p> <p>He and Issawi began <a href=\"https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/hopehub_for_gaza_coworking_space_for_freelancers_in_gaza\">raising funds</a> to expand Hope Hub. They searched for the most cost-effective ways to provide electricity in such a tenuous situation. They rented a former cafe and bought solar panels, tables and chairs. Access to the internet was harder to manage. Palestine\u2019s major telecom provider, Paltel, was not operational at the time. Its offices and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/03/1229402063/gaza-communications-cell-phone-internet-service-blackouts-paltel\">80% of its 500 cell towers</a> had been destroyed. Ahmad initially relied on a wireless connection from a local provider focused on international aid organizations based in Gaza. It was expensive and complicated, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F01%2FYYMMDDVideoTitle_Copy_01.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F01%2FRita_request.mp4\" data-alt=\"Person shows off solar panels on a red roof\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F01%2FYYMMDDVideoTitle_Copy_01.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F01%2FRita_request.mp4\">Interactive</a> <figcaption>With the winter coming, the solar panels that power Hope Hub will become less reliable. Source: Salah Ahmad</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t encouraged to provide internet to initiatives or individuals at the time, as internet networks were being targeted [by Israel],\u201d he said.</p> <p>After three months of relying on unstable wireless internet and several conversations with Palestine\u2019s ministry of communications and digital economy, Ahmad was able to secure high-speed internet lines from Paltel. Hope Hub opened up a second location in Deir al-Balah in April and a third in Khan Younis in May. By the end of May, however, Israel began its invasion into the designated safe area of Rafah. The cafe that housed the original Hope Hub location was destroyed, and Ahmad once again evacuated.</p> <p>\u201cWe were able to move our equipment with minimal losses, but the [cafe] owner lost everything,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the Hope Hub locations still standing, electricity remains limited, and the internet connection, while faster than most everything else available in Gaza, can still be unstable. With the winter coming, the solar panels that power Hope Hub will be less reliable.</p> <h2>\u2018My right as a student is to complete my studies\u2019</h2> <p>Othman Shbeir was supposed to graduate with a computer science degree from IUG last year. But classes were put on hold for months. Now, he walks two hours every day to get to Hope Hub, where he takes classes online. There isn\u2019t a place for him to finish his studies any closer to where he lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only choice I have,\u201d Shbeir said. \u201cI have to do this because we need to get money. We live in a disaster with high prices. We need to make a living for us. We have to continue achieving our life goals. Life doesn\u2019t stop for us. Life didn\u2019t stop at war. Life has to continue.\u201d</p> <p>There are many areas without co-working spaces at all. There, students turn to internet cafes or huddle around what they call \u201cstreet internet\u201d \u2013 a makeshift hotspot they pay for per hour in the middle of the street. They sit out in the open, risking being targeted, while they finish their assignments or watch online lectures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/military-officers-conscientious-objector-status-gaza\">\u2018I had to get out\u2019: the US military officers filing for conscientious objector status over Gaza</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shbeir has more questions than answers. He doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be able to graduate. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be attacked while walking to Hope Hub. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to get a job once he does graduate. But he knows he needs to graduate in order to get a job. Though he\u2019s held several internships, local organizations that need data scientists like him aren\u2019t willing to hire someone without a degree.</p> <p>Other students in Gaza face the same obstacles. Aya Esam is in her final year of dental school. But as a student, she and her classmates have to finish clinics before they can graduate. They don\u2019t know when it will be safe enough for the university to conduct in-person trainings or when they would be able to leave Gaza to finish trainings elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a big dreamer in Gaza,\u201d Esam said. \u201cThis is my right as a human in this life to complete my studies. I used to have a dream about my future.\u201d</p> <p>For the future generation of would-be computer scientists, doctors and freelancers, aspirations have been replaced by worries about where they will get their next meal, Algoul said. For many of the 50 students who pile into the education tent she has set up, learning English is a matter of survival. They want to be able to appeal to people abroad to send food or donate money, she said. Still, she isn\u2019t giving up.</p> <p>\u201cDespite everything, <em>wallah</em>, I continue to find ways to inspire hope and resilience not just for myself but for the community around me,\u201d Algoul said. \u201cWe will teach the world what resilience means.\u201d</p>",

In the aftermath of 7 October 2023, Israel\u2019s bombardment of the already besieged strip has rendered jobs nearly nonexistent, according to an assessment by the International Labor Organization. Meanwhile, a year of airstrikes has decimated Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, making the two resources freelancers depend on \u2013 a strong internet connection and reliable electricity \u2013 hard to come by. When internet service is available, it\u2019s slow or unstable. Electricity comes and goes. Then there\u2019s the matter of their safety. Algoul and other workers who spoke to the Guardian said they take on considerable risk when they make their way to co-working spaces or ad-hoc internet hotspots on the street. \u201cWorkers in Gaza live under the constant fear of airstrikes,\u201d said Algoul, who has lost 300 members of her family over the last year. \u201cThis kind of problem, no one around the world experiences. This situation is just in Gaza.\u201d Before Algoul could say more, she was interrupted by a flurry of movement. She said she had to cut the call short. Parts of the city were being bombed and everyone in the co-working space was being told to leave. Algoul, who had evacuated from the north of Gaza and left her parents behind, didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d go. But she\u2019d be fine, she said assuredly. She was just afraid for the safety of the children she taught. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to work in this environment,\u201d Algoul said. \u201cAfter one minute, I don\u2019t know if I will not exist, [if] I will be a martyr.\u201d \u2018I\u2019d rather risk my life to work\u2019 When Waleed Iky talks to potential clients on Upwork or Mostaql \u2013 a popular freelancing platform in the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 he doesn\u2019t always tell them that he lives in Gaza. Iky, an entrepreneur who started a one-man marketing operation, said he worries clients might see his situation or even his background as a liability. \u201cIt\u2019s risky for business to work with us sometimes,\u201d Iky said. \u201c[Sometimes] the clients know and support. If they don\u2019t, we don\u2019t mention it. We do our best for it to not affect our work.\u201d Disruptions to work are unavoidable, Iky said. He graduated from the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) just two months before the war began and spent the first five months of Israel\u2019s assault evacuating to cities he and his family were told would be safe from airstrikes. One of those towns, Al-Zahra, crumbled around him. \u201cThey destroyed the whole city,\u201d he said. \u201cTwenty-four buildings collapsed in front of our eyes. For my family it was a hard night.\u201d During those few months, Iky and his family focused on simply staying alive. Starting his business again was the furthest thing from his mind. But now, like Algoul, he works out of Hope Hub. He currently has two clients through Upwork for whom he does marketing. Leaving the tents where many of the freelancers have sheltered is dangerous. There\u2019s often no telling when or where bombs will be dropped, whether they\u2019ll be shot at or otherwise attacked. But for Iky, it\u2019s better than sitting around waiting for the next bomb to go off. \u201cI decided to get back online,\u201d Iky said. \u201cWhen I got back to work, my psychological health got better. Staying home and not doing anything, not doing what you love, it\u2019s killing more than my muscles. I\u2019d rather work and risk my life to work than stay at home.\u201d For many clients, it\u2019s been business as usual, regardless of the difficulties of workers living in Gaza under bombardment. One potential client asked Iky if he\u2019d be comfortable working with an Israeli organization. He told them he would not. They decided not to hire him. Others offer little flexibility around the deadlines they set for Iky\u2019s projects. \u201cSome of them are abroad who don\u2019t understand the struggle we have,\u201d Iky said. The freelancers have to take turns charging their laptops, in an effort to not use too much electricity. An hour of charging his laptop buys Iky four to five hours of work. When the electricity is out, he\u2019ll try to send his clients updates over WhatsApp or go to a nearby cafe and pay for internet. Even when they do manage to work, many freelancers have difficulty accessing their earnings. Bank branches and ATMs have been destroyed, PayPal has stopped providing its services to all Palestinians in the occupied territories and currency exchange shops charge a fee of anywhere from 15 to 30% depending on the demand. Iky, one of the fortunate few with a bank account, often opts to wait to withdraw any money to avoid paying exorbitant fees. Unstable internet and airstrikes Iky is one of more than 1,300 freelancers and students who have used Hope Hub\u2019s flexible workspaces across Gaza, Egypt and now Lebanon since Salah Ahmad, who is from Gaza, and his co-founder Fady Issawi launched the initiative in January 2024. While other co-working spaces have since opened up, Hope Hub was the first to begin operating during the war and remains one of the few that is free to use. Because of the limited resources, Hope Hub divides the day into four timed shifts \u2013 the first one for remote workers, the second two for freelancers and the last for students. Ahmad had been working with freelancers since at least 2020 when he opened his first co-working space, which offered mentorship and training for remote workers in partnership with international universities and organizations. But he, like hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, was forced to leave his life and his dreams behind after 7 October. The building that once housed his nearly 11,000 sq ft (1,022 sq metre) workspace was hit by airstrikes twice, he said, completely destroying the company he and his team had built. Videos of the office before and after the strikes show debris and shattered glass where sleek and contemporary conference rooms and cafes once stood. Ahmad was displaced four times before he finally reached Rafah, which he and others were told would be a safe area. It was there, in the Tal al-Sultan refugee camp, that he started Hope Hub with five people working out of a tent. He wanted to help people restart their companies or, at the very least, find something to fill their time and drown out the noise of drones buzzing around them. \u201cA lot of people feel that it is very difficult to do nothing and just wait in an area that is being bombed every minute. You just wait to die in the next bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are trying to survive.\u201d He and Issawi began raising funds to expand Hope Hub. They searched for the most cost-effective ways to provide electricity in such a tenuous situation. They rented a former cafe and bought solar panels, tables and chairs. Access to the internet was harder to manage. Palestine\u2019s major telecom provider, Paltel, was not operational at the time. Its offices and 80% of its 500 cell towers had been destroyed. Ahmad initially relied on a wireless connection from a local provider focused on international aid organizations based in Gaza. It was expensive and complicated, he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t encouraged to provide internet to initiatives or individuals at the time, as internet networks were being targeted [by Israel],\u201d he said. After three months of relying on unstable wireless internet and several conversations with Palestine\u2019s ministry of communications and digital economy, Ahmad was able to secure high-speed internet lines from Paltel. Hope Hub opened up a second location in Deir al-Balah in April and a third in Khan Younis in May. By the end of May, however, Israel began its invasion into the designated safe area of Rafah. The cafe that housed the original Hope Hub location was destroyed, and Ahmad once again evacuated. \u201cWe were able to move our equipment with minimal losses, but the [cafe] owner lost everything,\u201d he said. In the Hope Hub locations still standing, electricity remains limited, and the internet connection, while faster than most everything else available in Gaza, can still be unstable. With the winter coming, the solar panels that power Hope Hub will be less reliable. \u2018My right as a student is to complete my studies\u2019 Othman Shbeir was supposed to graduate with a computer science degree from IUG last year. But classes were put on hold for months. Now, he walks two hours every day to get to Hope Hub, where he takes classes online. There isn\u2019t a place for him to finish his studies any closer to where he lives. \u201cIt\u2019s the only choice I have,\u201d Shbeir said. \u201cI have to do this because we need to get money. We live in a disaster with high prices. We need to make a living for us. We have to continue achieving our life goals. Life doesn\u2019t stop for us. Life didn\u2019t stop at war. Life has to continue.\u201d There are many areas without co-working spaces at all. There, students turn to internet cafes or huddle around what they call \u201cstreet internet\u201d \u2013 a makeshift hotspot they pay for per hour in the middle of the street. They sit out in the open, risking being targeted, while they finish their assignments or watch online lectures. Shbeir has more questions than answers. He doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be able to graduate. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be attacked while walking to Hope Hub. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to get a job once he does graduate. But he knows he needs to graduate in order to get a job. Though he\u2019s held several internships, local organizations that need data scientists like him aren\u2019t willing to hire someone without a degree. Other students in Gaza face the same obstacles. Aya Esam is in her final year of dental school. But as a student, she and her classmates have to finish clinics before they can graduate. They don\u2019t know when it will be safe enough for the university to conduct in-person trainings or when they would be able to leave Gaza to finish trainings elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a big dreamer in Gaza,\u201d Esam said. \u201cThis is my right as a human in this life to complete my studies. I used to have a dream about my future.\u201d For the future generation of would-be computer scientists, doctors and freelancers, aspirations have been replaced by worries about where they will get their next meal, Algoul said. For many of the 50 students who pile into the education tent she has set up, learning English is a matter of survival. They want to be able to appeal to people abroad to send food or donate money, she said. Still, she isn\u2019t giving up. \u201cDespite everything, wallah, I continue to find ways to inspire hope and resilience not just for myself but for the community around me,\u201d Algoul said. \u201cWe will teach the world what resilience means.\u201d",

I mean, what in the world is this?\u201d</p> <p>Pushed by conservative-leaning organizations such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nra\">National Rifle Association</a> and the Congressional Sportsmen\u2019s Foundation (CSF), these \u201csportsmen\u2019s bills of rights\u201d view hunting as a cultural tradition and are meant to counter proposals to limit hunting and fishing.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pre-emptive safeguard against the anti-sportsman agenda,\u201d said Mark Lance, CSF\u2019s south-eastern states senior director. The CSF and the the NRA apply that term to what they consider extremist animal-rights campaigns to end all hunting, epitomized by former Humane Society CEO Wayne Pacelle\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>The CSF drafted language for many of the measures nationwide, including Florida\u2019s, along with the International Order of T Roosevelt, a hunting advocacy group named after the former president and hunting enthusiast Theodore Roosevelt. The CSF is also <a href=\"https://congressionalsportsmen.org/news/csf-organizes-conservation-groups-in-opposition-to-colorado-proposition-127/\">fighting a Colorado proposal</a> that would eliminate hunting for mountain lions.</p> <p>These campaigns to change constitutions have been effective at ballot boxes around the nation. Florida could <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/History_of_right_to_hunt_and_fish_constitutional_amendments\">become the 24th state</a> and the last in the south-east to add hunting and fishing rights to its constitution. While Vermont was long the only state to constitutionally protect hunting and fishing rights \u2013 it did so for more than 200 years \u2013 these measures proliferated after Alabama residents approved one in 1996. To date, only one has failed, in Arizona. But in Guest\u2019s analysis, \u201cthis is the one that\u2019s the sloppiest\u201d of other recent measures in states like North Carolina and Utah.</p> <p>Guest and the Sierra Club Florida chapter director, Susannah Randolph, both said the amendment\u2019s nebulous language, particularly the \u201ctraditional methods\u201d part, could harm wildlife populations and conservation efforts. There is no legal definition of traditional methods in court, Guest said. Nor is it defined in the amendment.</p> <p>Advocates say this vagueness might enable worst-case-scenario possibilities, including use of steel-jaw leghold traps, which are considered cruel and outlawed in more than 100 countries; using hounds to hunt bears and other game, which is banned or restricted in several states; and more relaxed killing limits. A <a href=\"https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/qualifying-hunting-and-fishing-as-the-preferred-means-of-managing-wildlife-a-potentially-dangerous-ballot-initiative-that-provides-little-protection-to-hunters-and-fishermen/\">Florida Bar analysis</a> also suggests that organized hunts are likely to become more common if the amendment passes. Others worry amendment 2 would backpedal on Florida\u2019s 1995 gillnet ban, a constitutional amendment that outlawed commercial fishing nets that entangle marine mammals<strong> </strong>such as dolphins. Despite this concern, amendment 2 cannot repeal or impede the gillnet ban, Guest said, because both amendments can be applied in tandem.</p> <p>But it\u2019s unclear how courts could interpret such language. Guest pointed out that, in Wisconsin, the constitutional right to hunt and fish was upheld to support wolf hunting after the species was delisted from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/endangeredspecies\">Endangered Species</a> Act. Florida wildlife advocates fear the same reasoning would apply to the black bear. On the other hand, Ryan Byrne, a managing editor at the nonpartisan website Ballotpedia, noted that courts have decided states can still regulate hunting and fishing in previous lawsuits.</p> <p>Still, some Florida conservationists and activists think that amendment 2 could empower individuals to do what they please and ignore existing regulations.<strong> </strong>While the amendment does reiterate the authority of the state wildlife-management agency, the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC), the constitutional preference for hunting and fishing would mean there was no guarantee FWC\u2019s authority would win out, said Devki Pancholi, a third-year University of Florida law student and vice-president of the local Animal Legal Defense Fund chapter. Courts will typically refer to the most recent amendment when resolving constitutional disputes.</p> <p>The amendment\u2019s vagueness is strategic.<strong> </strong>A CSF document distributed at a National Rifle Association convention and obtained by the NoTo2.org campaign suggested that \u201cby using a vague term like \u2018traditional methods\u2019, it will be up to state agencies to determine what they include in their season as \u2018traditional methods\u2019,\u201d such as trapping. The NRA\u2019s lobbying arm has also published <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150508093801/https://www.nraila.org/issues/hunting-and-conservation/right-to-hunt-fish-amendments/\">recommended language</a> for state constitutional amendments to protect the right to hunt and fish.</p> <p>Florida law already codifies hunting and fishing as statutory rights, which proponents of the constitutional measure argue can be easily reversed. Yet there have not been any significant attempts to outlaw hunting and fishing in the state.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to change the statutory right to fish and hunt in Florida, you would need 61 house reps and 21 state senators to vote \u2026 to make hunting and fishing illegal,\u201d said Chuck O\u2019Neal, chair of the NoTo2.org political action committee. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen, not in this state.\u201d Melo and the state senator Jason Brodeur, the Republican lawmakers who introduced the bill in 2023, did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.</p> <p>Still, Lance, the CSF south-east regional senior director, argues that even without direct criminalization attempts in Florida, threats exist on a national scale. \u201cWe want to be ahead of attacks to hunting and fishing in Florida before it\u2019s too late,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The bill\u2019s supporters point to a <a href=\"https://sos.oregon.gov/admin/Documents/irr/2022/013dbt.pdf\">failed 2021 Oregon ballot proposal</a> that sought to redefine hunting and fishing as animal abuse as a leading example of nationwide threats.</p>    <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a backhanded way to try to regulate hunting and fishing,\u201d said Lane Stephens, a lobbyist who represents the Southeastern Dog Hunters Association, among others.</p> <p>Stephens added that the attempt was aligned with the mission of the Humane Society, which contributed nearly $10,000 to the NoTo2.org campaign.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want [animal-rights activists]<strong> </strong>trying to run something in our constitution or in state law that would limit our abilities to hunt and fish,\u201d Stephens said, adding that many of Florida\u2019s incoming urban residents don\u2019t understand or agree with the hunting and fishing heritage Floridians enjoy.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s up to FWC to decide when we have a season and what that season looks like.\u201d</p> <p>But Pancholi, the law student, and others question some of the procedures behind the measure getting on the ballot and FWC\u2019s involvement with it. The bill was fast-tracked through the state legislature, O\u2019Neal pointed out, with fewer hearings in the statehouse and senate than usual. And the FWC, which is responsible for regulating fish and wildlife, may be the measure\u2019s most significant supporter.</p> <p>In September, the FWC <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/FLFFWCC/bulletins/3b6d284\">sent out a memo</a> on official letterhead, written by its chair, Rodney Barreto. It directed those with questions about the amendment to a Yes on 2 campaign communications director. Barreto is also vice-chair of the Yes on 2 campaign and sits on the board of the Fish &amp; Wildlife Foundation of Florida, which contributed $250,000 to the Vote Yes on amendment 2 political action committee. The FWC commissioners Steven Hudson and Preston Farrior contributed $10,000 and $15,000, respectively, to the Yes on 2 campaign as well. Commissioners are gubernatorial appointees.</p> <p>According to Florida law, government agencies are required to provide public notice in a public meeting before formally endorsing a ballot measure, but FWC did not hold public discussions about its position before announcing its support.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what I could tell, I wasn\u2019t able to find any meeting notes,\u201d Pancholi, the law student, said. Neither could the Guardian. If true, \u201cthat would be a violation of the law\u201d, she added. The FWC did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment by press time.</p> <h2>Conservation and science at odds</h2> <p>Yes on 2 supporters are united by a strong belief that hunters and anglers are the original conservationists.</p> <p>\u201cHunting is a means of conservation by which animal populations remain under control,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cWe need to make decisions based on the science and the data, and not on emotions.\u201d</p> <p>Yet scientists have argued that the amendment could do exactly the opposite, placing hunting and fishing higher than other management methods such as habitat restoration, raising vulnerable species in captivity for release, or \u201cbag limits\u201d that restrict the kind and number of animals people can kill or keep. Such an approach appears at odds with the basics of wildlife management, said Edward Camp, a professor of fisheries and aquaculture governance at the University of Florida.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it influence how the best management advice is selected?\u201d Camp said. \u201cThat\u2019s, I think, at the heart of the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Amendment 2 may prioritize hunts as the solution to human-wildlife conflicts instead, pushing other scientific methods to the backseat. After a 2015 bear hunt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/26/florida-ends-black-bear-hunt-after-two-days\">killed nearly 300 bears over the span of just two days</a>, for example, several Florida counties allocated money for <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/weather/2017/06/27/wildlife-officials-release-money-for-bear-proof-trash-cans/\">bear-proof trash bins</a> that helped reduce human-bear encounters.</p> <p>Guest, the environmental lawyer, predicts that \u201cthe focus will be more on consumption of wildlife and less on conservation\u201d.</p> <p>Ballotpedia\u2019s Byrne noted the widespread notion that ballot measures, regardless of topic, are sometimes \u201creally just to stoke a cultural issue and try to affect turnout\u201d.</p> <p>With a much-publicized abortion measure also on the ballot in Florida and increasingly politicized judiciaries, Guest said the sportsmen\u2019s bills of right are part of a national movement to advance the political agenda of the far right.</p> <p>\u201cThe constitution is the social contract,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be more cautious in the way we write it.\u201d</p>",

Following the accident, more than a thousand people took to Facebook to mourn Grizzly No 399\u2019s death, with some calling her a queen and others calling her an ambassador for her species. \u201cGrizzly bear #399 captivated people around the world, inspiring many to learn about the conservation of this important species,\u201d Hilary Cooley, the US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s grizzly bear recovery coordinator said in a statement, adding: \u201cWe received an outpouring of appreciation for #399 and aimed to honor these sentiments in handling her remains.\u201d Andrea Zaccardi, carnivore conservation legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called Grizzly No 399 a \u201cYellowstone icon\u201d in a statement. \u201cTragedies like this highlight why we need to maintain federal protections for bears and do more to ensure their safety from cars and other threats,\u201d she said. Between 2009 and 2023, there have been 49 grizzly bear deaths due to vehicle collisions in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cV13\u201d was the code name used by those who attended the monumental court proceedings that followed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/uk-and-irish-survivors-of-2015-bataclan-attack-tell-court-how-they-escaped-death\">2015 Paris terror attacks</a> in which 130 people died and 350 were injured. V13 (vendredi 13) stands for Friday the 13th (of November). The date is engraved on our collective memory: on an unusually balmy autumn evening, carefree youth out celebrating the weekend ahead were massacred in a series of coordinated shootings claimed by Islamic State. The target, it has often been said, was a way of life, the insouciance of <em>terrasse</em> culture and rock concerts, just as the Charlie Hebdo massacre months earlier had been an attack on a way of thinking, on freedom of expression.</p> <p>Amid the vast cultural production line that the deadly attacks spawned \u2013 memoirs, testimonies, documentaries, fiction, film, not to mention the new Museum and Memorial of Terrorism, scheduled to open in 2027 \u2013 Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re\u2019s <em>V13</em> holds a special place. It chronicles the high-security trial that was unique in its scope and length. Opening on 8 September 2021, it unfolded over 10 months in a room within Paris\u2019s Palais de Justice that was purpose-built to accommodate some 2,380 plaintiffs, 350 or so lawyers, and the media. An author, screenwriter and film-maker, Carr\u00e8re sat on the uncomfortable press benches to cover it for French magazine <em>L\u2019Obs</em>, and was one of the few who had the dedication and stamina to witness all sessions.</p> <p><em>V13: Chronicle of a Trial</em> is the full-length version of his weekly columns. The trial opened with the testimonies of those who lost a loved one, or an arm, a leg, their sleep, sanity or simply the will to live. Together with this litany of loss came a gruesome forensic examination of the shootings \u2013 the mud of splintered flesh; the deathly silence; the hellish four hours of those kept hostage in the Bataclan concert hall, with the constant fear of imminent death. Also the trembling voice of a seasoned policeman quoting the assailants\u2019 justification: \u201cYou can blame your president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He\u2019s bombing our brothers in Syria and Iraq, we\u2019re here to pay you back.\u201d But there are other stories of kindness, altruism and the strange intimacy of comforting a dying stranger. As victims take to the stand, we delve into their trauma or their unexpected resilience. \u201cWe live in a victim society, one which is happy to confuse the status of victim and hero,\u201d Carr\u00e8re reflects. And yet, he adds, all these young people strike him as heroes.</p> <p>The killers all died \u2013 except for Salah Abdeslam, that is, who was recruited as a suicide bomber but bailed out at the last minute \u2013 so the 14 accused were mostly accomplices in the planning, facilitating and execution of the attacks. The trial only fleetingly addressed intelligence failings, acknowledged by the secret services themselves. Its ambition lay elsewhere: to acknowledge the traumatic memories of the victims and to scrutinise every detail that led to the massacre as well as the motives, personalities and routes of radicalisation of the accused. And \u201cto form a collective narrative\u201d, as one of the victims put it, when asked by the court about his expectations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Among the victims there were those who tried to understand the jihadists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Among the victims were those who tried to understand the jihadists. Nadia Mondeguer, an Egyptian mother, who lost her daughter, Lamia, concluded her gripping testimony by addressing the defence lawyers: \u201cDo your job, do it well. I mean it.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/fathers-of-forgiveness-the-extraordinary-friendship-formed-in-the-shadow-of-the-bataclan\">Georges Salines</a> advocates for a restorative justice that seeks dialogue between victims and perpetrators. His daughter, Lola, died at the Bataclan, yet he found the strength to co-author a book with Azdyne Amimour, the father of one of the suicide bombers. Others, such as Antoine Leiris, a bereaved husband and author of the book <em>Vous n\u2019aurez pas ma haine</em><em> </em>(<em>You Will Not Have My </em><em>Hat</em><em>e</em>), which then became a slogan, refused to look for vengeance, wanting only \u201ca fair trial\u201d.</p> <p>So did the trial succeed in delivering restorative justice? Has it fostered any <em>rapprochement</em> or understanding between victims and perpetrators? The then prime minister, Manuel Valls, vented righteous indignation (\u201cUnderstanding is already justifying\u201d), to which Carr\u00e8re responds by quoting philosopher Baruch Spinoza: \u201cDo not weep; do not wax indignant. Understand.\u201d Carr\u00e8re\u2019s pared-down, forensic style reflects this fine balancing act between ordering facts and spinning them into a narrative, between empathy and critical thinking, engaging with an adversary\u2019s stance and making moral judgments.</p> <p>Matters turn more political when Hollande is called to the stand \u2013 a legal aberration incidentally, since he is neither victim nor accused. Carr\u00e8re concedes the point made by defence lawyer Olivia Ronen when she addresses Hollande on an issue of chronology: he admits France struck Syria prior to the threats issued by Islamic State. Drawing an equivalence between terrorism and supposed state terrorism in this way forms a recognisable strategy \u2013 namely a \u201crupture defence\u201d. But is it fair to call into question the authority of the justice system itself?</p>    <p>Defence lawyer Isa Gultaslar similarly argued that it is not fanaticism that pushed so many youths into the hands of the IS, but a legitimate anger against Assad\u2019s regime and France\u2019s military interventions in Syria. But can the attacks be requalified as war crimes rather than an act of terrorism?

      "bodyText": "\u201cV13\u201d was the code name used by those who attended the monumental court proceedings that followed the 2015 Paris terror attacks in which 130 people died and 350 were injured. V13 (vendredi 13) stands for Friday the 13th (of November). The date is engraved on our collective memory: on an unusually balmy autumn evening, carefree youth out celebrating the weekend ahead were massacred in a series of coordinated shootings claimed by Islamic State. The target, it has often been said, was a way of life, the insouciance of terrasse culture and rock concerts, just as the Charlie Hebdo massacre months earlier had been an attack on a way of thinking, on freedom of expression. Amid the vast cultural production line that the deadly attacks spawned \u2013 memoirs, testimonies, documentaries, fiction, film, not to mention the new Museum and Memorial of Terrorism, scheduled to open in 2027 \u2013 Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re\u2019s V13 holds a special place. It chronicles the high-security trial that was unique in its scope and length. Opening on 8 September 2021, it unfolded over 10 months in a room within Paris\u2019s Palais de Justice that was purpose-built to accommodate some 2,380 plaintiffs, 350 or so lawyers, and the media. An author, screenwriter and film-maker, Carr\u00e8re sat on the uncomfortable press benches to cover it for French magazine L\u2019Obs, and was one of the few who had the dedication and stamina to witness all sessions. V13: Chronicle of a Trial is the full-length version of his weekly columns. The trial opened with the testimonies of those who lost a loved one, or an arm, a leg, their sleep, sanity or simply the will to live. Together with this litany of loss came a gruesome forensic examination of the shootings \u2013 the mud of splintered flesh; the deathly silence; the hellish four hours of those kept hostage in the Bataclan concert hall, with the constant fear of imminent death. Also the trembling voice of a seasoned policeman quoting the assailants\u2019 justification: \u201cYou can blame your president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. He\u2019s bombing our brothers in Syria and Iraq, we\u2019re here to pay you back.\u201d But there are other stories of kindness, altruism and the strange intimacy of comforting a dying stranger. As victims take to the stand, we delve into their trauma or their unexpected resilience. \u201cWe live in a victim society, one which is happy to confuse the status of victim and hero,\u201d Carr\u00e8re reflects. And yet, he adds, all these young people strike him as heroes. The killers all died \u2013 except for Salah Abdeslam, that is, who was recruited as a suicide bomber but bailed out at the last minute \u2013 so the 14 accused were mostly accomplices in the planning, facilitating and execution of the attacks. The trial only fleetingly addressed intelligence failings, acknowledged by the secret services themselves. Its ambition lay elsewhere: to acknowledge the traumatic memories of the victims and to scrutinise every detail that led to the massacre as well as the motives, personalities and routes of radicalisation of the accused. And \u201cto form a collective narrative\u201d, as one of the victims put it, when asked by the court about his expectations. Among the victims were those who tried to understand the jihadists. Nadia Mondeguer, an Egyptian mother, who lost her daughter, Lamia, concluded her gripping testimony by addressing the defence lawyers: \u201cDo your job, do it well. I mean it.\u201d Georges Salines advocates for a restorative justice that seeks dialogue between victims and perpetrators. His daughter, Lola, died at the Bataclan, yet he found the strength to co-author a book with Azdyne Amimour, the father of one of the suicide bombers. Others, such as Antoine Leiris, a bereaved husband and author of the book Vous n\u2019aurez pas ma haine (You Will Not Have My Hate), which then became a slogan, refused to look for vengeance, wanting only \u201ca fair trial\u201d. So did the trial succeed in delivering restorative justice? Has it fostered any rapprochement or understanding between victims and perpetrators? The then prime minister, Manuel Valls, vented righteous indignation (\u201cUnderstanding is already justifying\u201d), to which Carr\u00e8re responds by quoting philosopher Baruch Spinoza: \u201cDo not weep; do not wax indignant. Understand.\u201d Carr\u00e8re\u2019s pared-down, forensic style reflects this fine balancing act between ordering facts and spinning them into a narrative, between empathy and critical thinking, engaging with an adversary\u2019s stance and making moral judgments. Matters turn more political when Hollande is called to the stand \u2013 a legal aberration incidentally, since he is neither victim nor accused. Carr\u00e8re concedes the point made by defence lawyer Olivia Ronen when she addresses Hollande on an issue of chronology: he admits France struck Syria prior to the threats issued by Islamic State. Drawing an equivalence between terrorism and supposed state terrorism in this way forms a recognisable strategy \u2013 namely a \u201crupture defence\u201d. But is it fair to call into question the authority of the justice system itself? Defence lawyer Isa Gultaslar similarly argued that it is not fanaticism that pushed so many youths into the hands of the IS, but a legitimate anger against Assad\u2019s regime and France\u2019s military interventions in Syria. But can the attacks be requalified as war crimes rather than an act of terrorism? Carr\u00e8re\u2019s understanding stops short when Abdeslam, after deploring the fact that many Muslims were killed in the attacks, demands that dialogue be left open, a claim as embarrassing as Adolf Eichmann\u2019s proposal for a reconciliation committee between Jewish survivors and Nazi perpetrators. Hannah Arendt\u2019s legacy hovers over V13. But \u201cthe banality of evil\u201d, the notion she coined, doesn\u2019t really apply to jihadism. For jihadism, evil is not to be silenced, nor responsibility dispersed in a faceless bureaucracy. Rather, it is about the glorification of sadism, as IS propaganda has sadly shown. Carr\u00e8re\u2019s account adds to the commemorative dimension of the trial, its elegant prose bringing back to life those who died, often through an unexpected detail. When it attends to the victims\u2019 suffering, the strength and humanity Carr\u00e8re brings out makes for a reading experience that is at once humbling and invigorating. With each historical crisis, the law and the judiciary need to reinvent themselves. Literature may contribute to that process. As Carr\u00e8re compares the courtroom rituals with the liturgy of a \u201cmodern church\u201d, where \u201csomething sacred\u201d takes place, he adds a small piece to the puzzle.

The Jewish Chronicle later retracted the story and fired the journalist who wrote it. The prime minister\u2019s office on Friday said no one who worked for Netanyahu has been questioned or detained, but on Saturday did not deny that the leak may have originated from his office. Dozens of other leaks related to ceasefire and hostage release negotiations have appeared in media reports, it pointed out, without triggering investigations. The charges are understood to be related to the leaking of classified documents, negligence in handling the material, and using it to influence public opinion, as well as the improper hiring of an adviser without adequate security clearance. News of the arrests has been met with fury by the prime minister\u2019s detractors in the bitterly politically divided country. On Saturday night, thousands of people across Israel joined what are now weekly demonstrations in favour of a deal. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, wrote on X: \u201cWe have tough enemies abroad, but the danger from within and at the most sensitive decision-making centres shakes the foundations of the confidence of the citizens of Israel in the prosecution of the war, and in handling the most sensitive and explosive security issues.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Spanish state-owned shipbuilder is reportedly pressing the UK government for improved terms on a deal to supply the Royal Navy with three vessels, in talks that could prove key to rescuing the Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic. Navantia, owned by the Spanish government, is poised to buy Belfast-based Harland &amp; Wolff (H&amp;W) in a deal that could save up to 1,000 jobs. Talks have been taking place since H&amp;W went into administration in September, after the government refused to provide taxpayer-funded support to keep it going. Navantia is now understood to be trying to secure a better deal on its contract to build three Fleet Solid Support (FSS) ships, which supply navy vessels with dry goods such as food. The fate of 1,000 workers at four UK shipyards could rest on the Ministry of Defence (MoD) agreeing to more \u201crealistic terms\u201d, a source close to the Spanish company told Sky News, which first reported the story. The MoD received a 2.3% spending increase in last week\u2019s budget. Navantia has reportedly been providing H&amp;W with cash to fund its day-to-day operations while takeover talks continue. Parallel discussions between government officials in London and Madrid are reportedly critical to the deal, with the UK likely to demand that any renegotiation of the \u00a31.6bn FSS shipbuilding contract comes with job guarantees. H&amp;W is slated to build three FSS ships, which transport crucial supplies to aircraft carriers for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the civilian branch of the Royal Navy. Under the original plans, Harland &amp; Wolff and Navantia would each have fabricated sections of the ships in their yards in Appledore and C\u00e1diz, respectively. The sections would then have been joined together in Belfast. The future of the project was plunged into doubt when H&amp;W\u2019s main company was placed into administration last month. If Madrid and London can come to an agreement, a takeover deal could be announced within days, Sky News reported. H&amp;W has been looking for buyers for the companies operating its shipyards after government officials raised concerns that a \u00a3200m loan guarantee could result in taxpayer losses. In August, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, ruled out giving the loan guarantee, which had been announced by the previous Conservative government. Earlier this year, about 1,600 people were working across H&amp;W\u2019s businesses, which include shipyards in Devon and Scotland as well as Belfast. The Belfast yards alone employed as many as 20,000 people in their heyday and the yellow Samson and Goliath cranes installed in the 1970s still loom high on the city\u2019s skyline. The yard most famously built the Titanic ocean liner, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The Guardian has approached Harland &amp; Wolff and the MoD for comment. Navantia declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report from the Tottenham Stadium. John McGinn holds up some Villa hands: \u201cIt got loud. Probably as loud as I\u2019ve heard it as an away player. It\u2019s about staying positive. Spurs beat us 4-1 last season and we finished above them. They punished our mistakes. We had a chance at 2-1 to equalise. The third one was a mistake and then a great free-kick from the fourth.\u201d Two-goal Dom Solanke speaks to Sky: \u201cWe always believe we can score many goals. It all came together today in the second half. \u201cWe had to adapt to the way they were playing. At half-time we had time to regroup and discuss what we had to do. It\u2019s been a few games without one [goal]. I\u2019ve been trying to get one and I got two. Buzzing with it. Nice dink finish, I enjoyed that. \u201cWhen we are playing well we can score many goals and we showed that today We\u2019ve had some great games but haven\u2019t managed to do it the whole season but we think we\u2019re capable of it.\u201d One of the best days in Ange-ball lore, and one that came against the grain. Tottenham lifted themselves from a torpid first half and Dom Solanke\u2019s two goals were the difference. James Maddison, who began on the bench, completed a vintage session of the glory game. For Unai Emery, that can occasionally happen, though it is rare to see his teams lose control as they did. 90+8 min: What a turnaround for Spurs. They\u2019ve given Villa a right old chasing and Unai Emery has retreated to his bench, where he has assumed the rictus visage of someone asked to deliver bad news. That\u2019s a beauty from Maddison, a big, dipping swinger of a free-kick, Martinez caught cold, the wall bent round and there\u2019s the bullseye celeb. More smiles from Maddison. 90+5 min: Some afters once Diego Carlos fouls Solanke. Villa finding no way out here. Spurs seem the likelier. 90+3 min: Archie Gray is at full-back. Spurs press high, and Pau Torres is robbed by Solanke, who then wins a free-kick. Maybe not such a risk now, him and Johnson, with both on the scoresheet. 90+2 min: Villa dominating possession, looking for a way through. Spurs have defended well in this half, and that\u2019s despite a highly makeshift defence. 90 min: Spurs relief as a corner is cleared. Then exasperation as 10 minutes of added time arrives. Ange starts pacing. 89 min: Spurs defend a throw-in well. And then clear the ball when Bailey tries to cut inside. Porro is bouncing down to suggest he too has a knock. So many injuries in the Premier League at the moment. 88 min: Jeers as Kamara attempts to find Philogene with an ambitious diag. It rolls over the sidelines. 87 min: Espen gets in touch: \u201cWith the Wolves substitutions yesterday, and Ange today, I\u2019m starting to wonder if managers actually know more about this stuff than the fans.\u201d They sometimes get it right, right? 86 min: Maddison has a smile on his face. It may be a while until he finds a way back into the team. 84 min: The Spurs fans enjoying this. Though some of them may remember Brighton. They couldn\u2019t, could they? Seems unlikely, Villa are licking their wounds and have Club Bruges to face in midweek. 82 min: Seems Richarlison pulled a muscle in that breakaway goal. He\u2019s replaced by Maddison, who is accompanied by Archie Gray, the teenager who replaces Udogie. 80 min: Richarlison is down, and got hurt during the celebrations. Emery makes a triple sub: Philogene, Bailey and Kamara on, McGinn and Ramsey off. Tielemans off, too. Sarr seizes on Pau Torres\u2019 pass, and plays it wide to Richarlison, who patiently awaits the speeding Solanke to charge on and place beyond Martinez. 78 min: Villa wake up, and suddenly there\u2019s spaces in their defence to exploit as they chase an equaliser. 77 min: Ange stands, doing Ange. Hands in pockets. His team have been so much better in the second half, full of danger and creativity. 76 min: VAR in action\u2026was Solanke onside\u2026Konsa had played him on. That was such a Spurs goal. Sarr and Bissouma stroke the ball around, Onana is robbed. And suddenly an exchange of passes, Kulusevski plays the ball through and Solanke\u2019s finish is a beauty, right foot, dink, shades of a Hoddle finish. 73 min: Spurs pushing on here, Villa having to defend. Pau Torres steps out to rob Kulusevski, who has been quiet. 71 min: Rick Harris gets in touch: \u201cSeems a huge blunder from Big Ange not to have started with Timo Werner. Werner is probably the epitome of \u2018confidence player\u2019 and after his midweek goal and the shot that brushed the post I would have selected him just to see if he might go on a scoring run like he did in the Bundesliga and which persuaded Chelsea to sign him.\u201d No Timo, no Maddo. Risky business, Ange. 70 min: Rogers is muttering to himself. Maybe he should pal up with Son, also on the bench against his wishes. 69 min: Duran is on, even though Rogers didn\u2019t want to leave the field. 67 min: Rogers is surely done for the afternoon. And here comes Duran. I made a break, I run out yesterday Tried to find my mountain hideaway Maybe next year, maybe no go I know you\u2019re watching me every minute of the day, yeah I\u2019ve seen the signs end the looks, and the pictures They give your game away, yeah 66 min: Sarr, who can be very good on his day, smashes a long-range shot wide. Morgan Rogers is again injured. Sarr fell into him with the momentum of his shot. 64 min: All those injuries, and rejigs have slowed down what threatened to be a good game. It\u2019s there to be won by someone. 62 min: Mark Hooper: \u201cJohnson\u2019s first goal in over a month\u2019 is a bit harsh - he had 7 from 7 at the international break?\u201d The word was \u201calmost\u201d. And I don\u2019t know how to tell you this but 6 October to 2 November is almost a month. Time can be a harsh, cruel mistress. It\u2019s his first in five matches. 61 min: Onana down now with a head injury. But apparently fine to continue. 58 min: Matty Cash has an injury, and so does Morgan Rogers. As does Romero, who wants to go off. Ben Davies will be coming on. Cash goes off, Diego Carlos (once a Spurs target?) is on. Romero\u2019s boot is off. A foot injury? Micky van der Ven is in the crowd, wearing a black, Elon Musk-style cap. Kendall Roy maybe. 56 min: Spurs subs: Richarlison and Bissouma on, with Son and Bentancur off. Son doesn\u2019t look happy. \u201cWho? Me?\u201d Yes, you. Still, at least he provided that goal. Maddison? Not yet. 55 min: So, a set piece. How will Spurs manage this? They escape, only just. The ball comes out and McGinn thwacks wide. 54 min: Watkins felled by a combine harvester of a tackle by Porro. The first yellow card arrives. 52 min: Spurs suddenly fancy this. Son sends Udogie on, the ball finds Solanke who is backing up as he shoots. Martinez saves well. Then Spurs go straight back it, and Porro fires over. That\u2019s the power of an Ange paint-stripper at half-time. 50 min: Neither Tottenham striker could have missed. Johnson\u2019s first goal in almost a month. Emery is aghast at the defending. Son, down the left, and he finds space and the right ball. Son and Johnson are queuing up, and Johnson pokes home. He\u2019s onside. 48 min: Morgan Rogers down, and boos after he was clipped by Bentancur, The ref stops play. 47 min: Romero calls out as Watkins fouls him. No yellow given, though it was no worse than Bentancur\u2019s foul in the first 45. 46 min: No James Maddison, though he has been warming up. Half-time emails: Andy Flintoff: \u201cGive Vicario some credit - he\u2019d gone down to make a save from the flick on. It\u2019s not then his problem that it bounces straight to the Villa player to poke in.\u201d Kari Tulinius: \u201cThis is a test of my hypothesis that Ange\u2019s Spurs need adversity to perform to their potential. They certainly could do with a jolt of adrenaline. Mind you, they\u2019ve been so blunt that any improvement could also just be interpreted as a reversion to the mean.\u201d Yash Gupta: \u201cEven as a Spurs fan, it was clear Emery did well in difficult circumstances. Ozil was given stupid massive contract before him. He almost coached Arsenal to top four and Europa League trophy but Arsenal choked. Then Emery wanted Zaha in transfer window and Arsenal gave him Nicolas Pepe. Ramsey was allowed to leave as well instead of giving him a new contract. As for set-piece issues at Spurs, imo it is down to poor coaching and set-piece coach needs to be replaced for making Spurs players look like frozen dessert in both attacking and defending situations.\u201d Phil Grey: \u201cOnly half-time, but Villa have currently leapfrogged Arsenal. No prizes for spotting what the top 4 all have in common. And if Chelsea get at least a point at Old Trafford, it\u2019ll be the top 5.\u201d Joe Pearson: \u201cPrediction: Madison comes on and provides a bit of magic to get Spurs level. Then Emery sends on his not-so-secret weapon, Duran, to bang in the winner. Place your bets now!\u201d Spurs have been given something of a lesson in control and not being in possession for the sake of it. Villa sat deep, waved off the tepid Tottenham attack, then once Onana had almost scored, took advantage of Spurs\u2019 jigsaw tendencies. 45 min: Unai Emery, despite his team\u2019s control, isn\u2019t happy. Ange just does Ange. Only one minute added on. 43 min: Bentancur fancies a dig. He fires over, and nobody else seems to think he had much of chance with that. That reflects how bereft of ideas Spurs have been. 42 min: Brennan Johnson on the burst, but Villa go on a dangerous counter, with Watkins given a clear sight on goal. Perhaps Romero puts him off but he\u2019s gottae score there. What would Duran do? 41 min: Joe Pearson gets in touch: \u201cI wonder if the Spurs fans were booing their defense, or because they thought Vicario was fouled. Or maybe they are just still in the Halloween mood and channeling their inner ghosts.\u201d Let\u2019s have it right, Vicario just fell over. 40 min: Bentancur throws in a very ropey tackle on Onana, and isn\u2019t booked. Onana has been doing a lot of good, strong work. 39 min: David Bertram gets in touch: \u201cBias villa fan here. Love your work on the pod. Rogers cost 8m. What a signing.\u201d No doubt. On the pod tomorrow, and will nick that. 38 min: \u201cKeeper,\u201d calls Martinez. Too easy, mate. Almost cruel on Ange. 37 min: Another Spurs corner, conceded after Cash comes to the rescue. 36 min: Tottenham get a corner. Villa clear with ease. That\u2019s the way to do it. 34 min: Is it odd to wonder how someone from the country of rugby \u2013 both codes \u2013 and Aussie Rules is so bad at arranging set pieces? These events are often procedural, with margins to be squeezed. Vicario looked a solid keeper at the start of last season, now he\u2019s entering Dracula and crosses territory. Sam Allardyce will be turning in his gravy boat. 33 min: That was a cheap goal to concede. Spurs do give them away, mind. Chaotic, and Rogers seized on a loose ball that should have been cleared. Spurs concede from a corner shocker. Porro flicks on Digne\u2019s\u2019 kick and Rogers pokes home. Boos from the home fans\u2026 29 min: Onana hits the post, climbing so high to head down, and Vicario can only smuggle behind. Villa suddenly stepping it up. 27 min: A series of fouls going in. Spurs look liklier, if nothing like likely. 25 min: Villa free-kick now. Tielemans\u2019 hit is straight at Vicario. Spurs can attack, with Johnson the target, but offside. 24 min: Udogie asked to go on the overlap but succeeds only in knocking over Onana. Spurs dominating but it\u2019s sterile domination. 22 min: Another Bentancur long-ranger. Better but still wide. 21 min: Chris Walker: \u201cAm a bit confused, is this genius Unai Emery the same Unai Emery that was sacked at Arsenal a few years ago for basically being useless?\u201d To be fair to Emery, he inherited a mess. 20 min: Udogie wins a corner from Onana\u2019s tackle. Headed away, Sarr shoots, and Johnson tries to redirect it. Had he beaten Martinez, the offside flag would surely have been waved. 18 min: Bentancur shoots. Dreadful. 17 min: Short corner taken, a waste of time, though Spurs almost set up an attack by snaffling possession. 16 min: Villa go on the attack, with Rogers, McGinn and Tielemans. Udogie breaks up the move, and Kulusevski sends Johnson away, the ball slightly overhit. A corner will have to do. 15 min: McGinn fouled by Bentancur; that briefly wakes the crowd from their slumber. 14 min: We\u2019re veering dangerously into the territory of intriguing tactical battle here. This has been largely awful. 13 min: Porro is fouled, and Tottenham have a free-kick in a dangerous position. Who will hit it? Son sends it in, Solanke heads over. 10 min: Villa patient once more, trying to tempt out that Tottenham defence. And not really succeeding in doing so. 8 min: Lots of zip, not much quality. Son seems to be pinned to the left flank. Bentancur attempt to find Son but the skipper misreads the ball. 7 min: Porro fancies a dig as the ball bounces to him. His shot sets off into the stand. Worth a try? Probably not. 6 min: Kulusevski is robbed by a combo of Cash and McGinn but Spurs stay on the offensive. 4 min: Close! Tielemans ball across goal, Watkins can\u2019t get there, and mostly thanks to Dragusin\u2019s heavy breathing. Next, Udogie nails Cash with a high foul. 3 min: Villa go on the attack, and McGinn sets up Rogers, whose shot is poor and miles over. 2 min: Villa are always willing to be patient. Sarr is chased down and robbed but the ball is back with Spurs before Son is tackled by Matty Cash. 1 min: It\u2019s Tottenham who high press first, and Emi Martinez is forced into an error. Tottenham already flooding midfield. Manly hug and banterous laughter between Ange and Unai, two football men and true. The teams are in the tunnel, the PA system is revving up and the players hit the field. A short word on the dropped word from James Maddison from Ange: \u201cIt\u2019s just what we need today. But there\u2019s no doubt that Madders will be coming on today.\u201d Unai Emery spoke to Sky: \u201c\u201cMy first message I am sending everyone is \u2018I want to break our levels always higher\u2019. I am dreaming and I want to work to try and get my dreams. \u201cMy dream is to get the best possible at the club I am at and the targets that we have. To play in Europe, to play in the Champions League - my dream is to be a winner as a coach in the Champions League. Hopefully with Aston Villa. \u201cThe Premier League is very difficult to win because at the moment there are three teams who are being consistent - Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. But, here Leicester won and when Leicester won the Premier League it was very difficult and maybe impossible. This is the reason in football it is not impossible. You can dream and you can work hard to try and get it.\u201d Tottenham full-back Destiny Udogie spoke to Sky: \u201cWhen you get a win it always changes the mood in the dressing room and adds confidence so we are happy for that win [against Man City] and focused on today\u2019s game. \u201cVan de Ven is a huge loss for us but we are all together as a team. Villa are a great team, honestly. We\u2019re ready to give our best and hopefully, we are going to win.\u201d Villa skipper John McGinn spoke to Sky: \u201c\u201cWe\u2019ve got a good recent record in London. It feels nice to be back here but in the last couple of wins here we\u2019ve had to work for it. They\u2019ve probably deserved to win on a couple of those occasions so we need to be ready today. \u201cTo get the three points we need to work, to run. Tottenham make you run a lot so we\u2019re ready to do that. Spurs aren\u2019t an easy team to play against, for most of the league, they\u2019ve had their ups and downs this season but they bring a big threat. \u201cFrom our point of view we are quite happy Van de Ven is missing. We need to be at our best, they\u2019re a team that will be competing up the top of the table come the end of the season.\u201d Spurs will be full of cheer after their midweek defeat of Manchester City in the Carabao Cup Ange makes four changes from the team that lost at Crystal Palace last week, with Son coming back in and James Maddison dropped to the bench. Micky van de Ven misses out with his hamstring problem as Radu Dragusin comes in. Pape Sarr is in ahead of Yves Bissouma and partners Rodrigo Bentancur. Mikey Moore is on the bench and let\u2019s hope to see him off the bench. Last week at Selhurst was no fun for the youngster. Unai Emery opts for the orthodoxy of Jhon Duran on the bench, and Ollie Watkins starting. Tottenham: Vicario, Dragusin, Udogie, Romero, Kulusevski, Johnson, Porro, Sarr, Bentancur, Solanke, Son. Subs: Forster, Davies, Gray, Bissouma, Bergvall, Maddison, Moore, Werner, Richarlison Aston Villa: Martinez, Cash, Konsa, McGinn, Tielemans, Digne, Torres, Onana, Rogers, Ramsey, Watkins. Subs: Olsen, Maatsen, Carlos, Mings, Kamara, Philogene, Buendia, Bailey, Duran Injury list and form guide: Tottenham Doubtful Romero (muscle), Son (muscle), Spence (groin), Werner (groin) Injured Odobert (hamstring, unknown), Van de Ven (hamstring, 23 Nov) Suspended None Form LWWLWL Leading scorer Johnson, Son 3 Aston Villa Doubtful None Injured Barkley (muscle, 23 Nov) Suspended Non Form WWDDWD Leading scorer Watkins 5 Should be a good one, this. With Tottenham beating Manchester City in midweek and Aston Villa on such a good run in general, it\u2019s two clubs with optimism flowing through them. Though optimism can be readily punctured at Spurs. And Aston Villa, have won three of their five Premier League matches at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, including each of the last two, say the stattos. Can Unai Emery outfox Ange-ball? It\u2019s highly possible, you know. Villa can go third in the table if they win, while Spurs can climb to seventh. Kick-off at 2pm, join me.",

      "body": "<p>Behold the steelier, sturdier, more structured version of Angeball. From opting for the power of Pape Matar Sarr over the silkiness of James Maddison in midfield, to finding the right motivational words when all looked lost at half-time, this was a good day for Tottenham\u2019s romanticist of a manager.</p> <p>Ange Postecoglou\u2019s substitutions were spot-on, his tactics proved far more effective than Unai Emery\u2019s anti-football approach, and Aston Villa, their legs heavy after being given the runaround by Sarr, simply had no response to a stirring comeback from Spurs in the second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/nov/03/tottenham-v-aston-villa-premier-league-live\">Tottenham 4-1 Aston Villa: Premier League \u2013 live reaction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end it felt like a victory for earning the right to play. While Villa set out to spoil, carving out a lead when a set-piece routine led to Morgan Rogers scoring just after the half hour, Spurs married their creativity with a physical edge. Their second goal, claimed by Dominic Solanke with a delightful dink over Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, was a case in point: Dejan Kulusevski\u2019s glorious through\u2011ball had created the opening but it was significant that the move began with Ben Davies forcefully dispossessing Ollie Watkins and Sarr overwhelming Villa with one of many bursts through the middle.</p> <p>\u201cWe accept the result,\u201d Emery said, making no excuses after seeing his side miss the chance to go third. There were too many mistakes from Villa, who looked jaded despite resting players during their midweek <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/30/aston-villa-crystal-palace-carabao-cup-match-report\">defeat against Crystal Palace</a> in the Carabao Cup, and Spurs pounced.</p> <p>Brennan Johnson equalised early in the second half, Solanke added a quickfire double after fine work from Sarr, and there was even time for Maddison, who remained on the bench until the 82nd minute, to round off the scoring with a gorgeous free-kick deep into added time.</p> <p>Not that Postecoglou, whose team rose to seventh, was getting carried away. He was criticised after the insipid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/crystal-palace-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">1-0 defeat at Palace</a> last week, since when Spurs have knocked Manchester City out of the Carabao Cup and made a mockery of Villa\u2019s top-four aspirations. \u201cYou don\u2019t fall off cliffs and you don\u2019t fall off mountains within a week,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the same process.\u201d</p> <p>Progress here was measured by whether Spurs could grind with Emery\u2019s streetwise team. Postecoglou had adjusted his tactics accordingly, Maddison sacrificed for the double bolt of Sarr and Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield, but it was attritional at first.</p> <p>Spurs were restricted to hopeful efforts from distance and the crowd\u2019s anxiety was palpable. Everyone could see what Villa wanted to do. They were happy to disrupt play with a series of niggly fouls and there was no sign of their signature high line. Emery had no desire to give Son Heung-min and Johnson space to run behind on the flanks.</p> <p>The half played out in predictable fashion, Villa biding their time before winning a corner in the 30th minute. Cue panic. Cue Austin MacPhee, Villa\u2019s set-piece coach taking centre stage. The first ball was cleared but it came back to Lucas Digne. He lifted in a high cross, Amadou Onana headed against the woodwork and Spurs scrambled the ball behind.</p>    <p>The pressure grew, Villa pressing at an obvious weakness, Rogers pinning Guglielmo Vicario to his line. The goalkeeper was blocked off and Spurs cracked when Digne delivered an inswinging cross to the near post. Vicario stopped Bentancur from scoring an own goal but Rogers smashed the rebound into the net.</p> <p>There was not much conviction to Spurs\u2019 appeals for a foul on Vicario. The concession unnerved them and they could have fallen further behind, only for Watkins to scuff wide from an inviting position.</p> <p>It was a pivotal miss. Spurs raised the pace after the break and they levelled in the 49th minute. Son\u2019s cross from the left was a beauty, Pau Torres and Ezri Konsa taken out of the game as Johnson arrived at the far post to convert.</p> <p>Emery urged calm. The action was frenetic, though, and Mart\u00ednez had to save well from Solanke. Cristian Romero injured himself in the process of cleaning out Rogers.</p> <p>With Radu Dragusin deputising for the injured Micky van de Ven, Spurs played with their second-choice centre-back pairing after Ben Davies came on for Romero. Emery introduced Jhon Dur\u00e1n on for Rogers. Postecoglou had brought on Richarlison for Son, who looked unimpressed with the idea that he was being protected after his recent injury problems.</p> <p>But while Son muttered to himself on the bench Spurs found a second wind. As the minutes ticked away, Davies stepped out to challenge Watkins. Sarr drove forward, linking with Johnson before Kulusevski flummoxed Villa with a reverse pass to Solanke, who beat Mart\u00ednez with a cool finish.</p> <p>Spurs had the clarity and belief. They went for Villa again, Sarr intercepting a loose pass from Torres and finding Richarlison, who crossed for Solanke to score again.</p> <p>Emery was slumped in the dugout by the time Maddison bent in the fourth. Spurs were rampant, Villa overrun.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Behold the steelier, sturdier, more structured version of Angeball. From opting for the power of Pape Matar Sarr over the silkiness of James Maddison in midfield, to finding the right motivational words when all looked lost at half-time, this was a good day for Tottenham\u2019s romanticist of a manager. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s substitutions were spot-on, his tactics proved far more effective than Unai Emery\u2019s anti-football approach, and Aston Villa, their legs heavy after being given the runaround by Sarr, simply had no response to a stirring comeback from Spurs in the second half. In the end it felt like a victory for earning the right to play. While Villa set out to spoil, carving out a lead when a set-piece routine led to Morgan Rogers scoring just after the half hour, Spurs married their creativity with a physical edge. Their second goal, claimed by Dominic Solanke with a delightful dink over Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, was a case in point: Dejan Kulusevski\u2019s glorious through\u2011ball had created the opening but it was significant that the move began with Ben Davies forcefully dispossessing Ollie Watkins and Sarr overwhelming Villa with one of many bursts through the middle. \u201cWe accept the result,\u201d Emery said, making no excuses after seeing his side miss the chance to go third. There were too many mistakes from Villa, who looked jaded despite resting players during their midweek defeat against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup, and Spurs pounced. Brennan Johnson equalised early in the second half, Solanke added a quickfire double after fine work from Sarr, and there was even time for Maddison, who remained on the bench until the 82nd minute, to round off the scoring with a gorgeous free-kick deep into added time. Not that Postecoglou, whose team rose to seventh, was getting carried away. He was criticised after the insipid 1-0 defeat at Palace last week, since when Spurs have knocked Manchester City out of the Carabao Cup and made a mockery of Villa\u2019s top-four aspirations. \u201cYou don\u2019t fall off cliffs and you don\u2019t fall off mountains within a week,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the same process.\u201d Progress here was measured by whether Spurs could grind with Emery\u2019s streetwise team. Postecoglou had adjusted his tactics accordingly, Maddison sacrificed for the double bolt of Sarr and Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield, but it was attritional at first. Spurs were restricted to hopeful efforts from distance and the crowd\u2019s anxiety was palpable. Everyone could see what Villa wanted to do. They were happy to disrupt play with a series of niggly fouls and there was no sign of their signature high line. Emery had no desire to give Son Heung-min and Johnson space to run behind on the flanks. The half played out in predictable fashion, Villa biding their time before winning a corner in the 30th minute. Cue panic. Cue Austin MacPhee, Villa\u2019s set-piece coach taking centre stage. The first ball was cleared but it came back to Lucas Digne. He lifted in a high cross, Amadou Onana headed against the woodwork and Spurs scrambled the ball behind. The pressure grew, Villa pressing at an obvious weakness, Rogers pinning Guglielmo Vicario to his line. The goalkeeper was blocked off and Spurs cracked when Digne delivered an inswinging cross to the near post. Vicario stopped Bentancur from scoring an own goal but Rogers smashed the rebound into the net. There was not much conviction to Spurs\u2019 appeals for a foul on Vicario. The concession unnerved them and they could have fallen further behind, only for Watkins to scuff wide from an inviting position. It was a pivotal miss. Spurs raised the pace after the break and they levelled in the 49th minute. Son\u2019s cross from the left was a beauty, Pau Torres and Ezri Konsa taken out of the game as Johnson arrived at the far post to convert. Emery urged calm. The action was frenetic, though, and Mart\u00ednez had to save well from Solanke. Cristian Romero injured himself in the process of cleaning out Rogers. With Radu Dragusin deputising for the injured Micky van de Ven, Spurs played with their second-choice centre-back pairing after Ben Davies came on for Romero. Emery introduced Jhon Dur\u00e1n on for Rogers. Postecoglou had brought on Richarlison for Son, who looked unimpressed with the idea that he was being protected after his recent injury problems. But while Son muttered to himself on the bench Spurs found a second wind. As the minutes ticked away, Davies stepped out to challenge Watkins. Sarr drove forward, linking with Johnson before Kulusevski flummoxed Villa with a reverse pass to Solanke, who beat Mart\u00ednez with a cool finish. Spurs had the clarity and belief. They went for Villa again, Sarr intercepting a loose pass from Torres and finding Richarlison, who crossed for Solanke to score again. Emery was slumped in the dugout by the time Maddison bent in the fourth. Spurs were rampant, Villa overrun.",

      "bodyText": "We are now closing this blog but you can read our report on today\u2019s developments in Gaza here. Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry has submitted a letter to the UN, signed by 52 countries and two organisations, calling for a halt in arms deliveries to Israel. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, told a press conference in Djibouti, where he was attending a Turkey-Africa partnership summit: We have written a joint letter calling on all countries to stop the sale of arms and ammunition to Israel. We delivered this letter, which has 54 signatories, to the UN on 1 November. We must repeat at every opportunity that selling arms to Israel means participating in its genocide. Fidan said the letter is \u201can initiative launched by Turkey\u201d. Among the signatories was Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Algeria, China, Iran and Russia, with the two organisations being the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called on the UN to impose an arms embargo on Israel, which he said would be an \u201ceffective solution\u201d to end the war. Erdo\u011fan has been a vocal opponent of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. He has accused Israel of genocide, called for it to be punished in international courts and criticised western nations for backing the country\u2019s military assault. Palestinian medics said at least 31 people were killed by Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip on Sunday. Nearly half of those killed by the Israeli military were reported to have been in northern Gaza, including in Beit Lahiya and Jabalia. Other deadly Israeli airstrikes were reported in Gaza City and the southern city of Khan Younis. At least 43,341 Palestinian people have been killed and 102,105 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said an Israeli strike killed three people near the southern city of Sidon. \u201cThe Israeli enemy\u2019s raid on Haret Saida resulted in an initial death toll of three people killed and nine others injured,\u201d Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said. The Israeli military called for the evacuation of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, warning that it was poised to strike Hezbollah targets there and in nearby Douris. A polio vaccination centre and the car of UN aid official involved in this weekend\u2019s vaccination campaign came under fire despite a promised \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in Israeli bombardment, the UN said. Rachael Cummings, the team lead and health specialist from Save the Children International, has warned that apocalyptic scenes are unfolding in northern Gaza. She was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said: We are seeing the apocalypse now unfolding in the north of Gaza. People are being constantly bombarded with aerial attacks and of course, we know that the food and the water is not sufficient. The convoys of food and water are being denied into the north \u2026 It is absolutely catastrophic. A renewed Israeli assault was launched on the northern part of the Strip last month, with the Israeli military saying it was to stop Hamas fighters regrouping there. The blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, however, have led to accusations that Israel is committing the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders but many people have stayed as there is nowhere safe to flee the relentless bombardments. The Israeli army has previously ordered residents to flee towards the so-called \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d of al-Mawasi, even though it has been targeted in deadly airstrikes and is severely overcrowded. An Israeli court is considering whether to lift a gag order on a case surrounding suspected leaks of classified information from an associate of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Associated Press has the following report: Israeli media reports say the case concerns the leak of classified information to two European media outlets by an adviser who may not have been formally employed and did not have security clearance, without naming the individual. Netanyahu said the person in question \u201cnever participated in security discussions, was not exposed to or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\u201d The leaked documents are said to have formed the basis of a widely discredited article in the London-based Jewish Chronicle \u2014 which was later withdrawn \u2014 suggesting Hamas planned to spirit hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, and an article in Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper that said Hamas was drawing out the talks as a form of psychological warfare on Israel. Israeli media and other observers expressed skepticism about the articles, which appeared to support Netanyahu\u2019s demands in the talks and absolve him of blame for their failure\u2026 A court document confirmed that an investigation by police, the military and the Shin Bet internal security agency is underway and that a number of suspects have been arrested for questioning. It said the affair poses \u201ca risk to sensitive information and sources\u201d and \u201charms the achievement of the goals of the war in the Gaza Strip.\u201d The court will decide on Sunday whether to lift a gag order on other details of the case. The special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has said that Palestinian children living in areas that Israel unlawfully occupies are being targeted by Israeli forces in \u201cmany depraved ways\u201d. She shared a video on X showing schoolchildren in the Jaber neighborhood of Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, unable to reach Haj Ziad Jaber school because of barbed wire blocking their access. Albanese wrote: Look at the totality of Israel\u2019s conduct, in the totality of the land it unlawfully occupies, against the totality of the Palestinian people living there. And when you see how children, in particular, are targeted in so many depraved ways - through killing, maiming, starving, torture, terror, depriving them of schools, dreams, future, hope - you see the destructive mind and intent at work, in the realisation of a plan that comes from afar. Last week, Albanese said the UN should consider suspending Israel as a member state due to its continuing \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinians. You can read more on her comments in this piece. Palestinian medics have said at least 31 people were killed by Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip on Sunday, increasing an earlier death toll of 23 (see earlier post at 10.05). Nearly half of those killed by the Israeli military were reported to have been in northern Gaza, where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been conducting an intense month long assault. A polio vaccination centre and the car of UN aid official involved in this weekend\u2019s vaccination campaign came under fire despite a promised \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d in Israeli bombardment, the UN has said. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the UN child support and protection agency Unicef, said: \u201cAt least three children were reportedly injured by another attack in the proximity of a vaccination clinic in Sheikh Radwan, while a polio vaccination campaign was under way.\u201d She added that the personal car of a Unicef employee working on the polio vaccine campaign \u201ccame under fire by what we believe to be a quadcopter\u201d. \u201cThe car was damaged. Fortunately, the staff member was not injured. But she has been left deeply shaken,\u201d Russell wrote. Read the full report here Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said three people were killed and nine others wounded in an Israeli strike Sunday on Haret Saida, a densely populated area near the southern city of Sidon. \u201cThe Israeli enemy\u2019s raid on Haret Saida resulted in an initial death toll of three people killed and nine others injured,\u201d the ministry said. Agence France-Presse reports that the strike was not preceded by an Israeli evacuation warning. At least seven Palestinians, including children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Sunday, health officials told Reuters. There are mounting concerns over whether the Israeli government\u2019s ultimate war aims in Gaza include territorial expansion, as the IDF\u2019s siege on the northern part of the territory \u2013 under sweeping evacuation orders - intensifies. Here is an extract from a report by my colleagues Malak A Tantesh and Julian Borger, who explore these concerns further: The IDF says it is hunting Hamas militants but suspicions are growing that Israel is putting into practice a blueprint it had officially distanced itself from, known as the \u201cgenerals\u2019 plan\u201d. The plan, named after the retired senior officers promoting it, was intended to depopulate northern Gaza by giving the Palestinians trapped there an opportunity to evacuate and then treating those that stayed as combatants, laying total siege. The government insisted the plan had not been adopted, but some IDF soldiers in Gaza, as well as Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, say it is being implemented on a daily basis, but with a major difference: the Palestinians in northern Gaza were not given a realistic chance to evacuate. They are trapped. You can read the full story here: At least 43,341 Palestinian people have been killed and 102,105 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Of those, 27 Palestinians were killed and 86 injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period, the ministry said. Gaza\u2019s health ministry has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. Here are some of the latest images coming out of Gaza from the newswires: Israeli forces have detained at least 16 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank since last night, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees and the Prisoners\u2019 Society said. According to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, the detentions were carried out in Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, Salfit and Tubas. It is estimated that at least 11,500 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. The commissioner general of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which provides shelter, education, medical services, food and water to Palestinian refugees, has said that banning the agency from operating within Israel and occupied East Jerusalem will deprive Palestinian children of learning in the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d. Philippe Lazzarini, in a statement posted to X, said this deprivation of education will increase the likelihood of children becoming radicalised and exploited into joining armed groups, as well as increasing poverty levels. \u201cWithout Unrwa, the fate of millions of people will hang by the thread. Instead of focusing on banning Unrwa or finding alternatives, the focus should be on reaching an agreement to end this conflict,\u201d Lazzarini wrote. \u201cThis is the only way to prioritize the return to school for hundreds of thousands of children, currently living in the rubble. It\u2019s time to prioritise children and their future.\u201d Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has left nearly all of the territory\u2019s population in poverty, with quality of life indicators such as health and education knocked back 70 years, the United Nations development agency said in a report last month. Since the war began last October, schools have been bombed in Israeli attacks or turned into shelters for displaced people, leaving Gaza\u2019s estimated 625,000 school-age children unable to attend classes. Lazzarini said that until last October Unrwa provided learning to over 300,000 children, but now they are losing a second year of education. The Palestinian education ministry said it has begun to launch virtual schools and open schools in the occupied West Bank to students in Gaza, saying it is determined to provide as much education as possible, even if it is from inside \u201cdilapidated tents\u201d. Last week, 92 Israeli MPs voted for a measure to ban Unrwa\u2019s activities in Israel while only 10 voted to oppose the measure. A second bill severed diplomatic relations with the agency. You can read more about the passing of the bill and its effects here. The Israeli military called for the evacuation of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, warning that it was poised to strike Hezbollah targets there and in nearby Douris. \u201cFor your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate these buildings and those adjacent to them immediately and stay away from them for a distance of no less than 500 meters within the next four hours,\u201d the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X. Israel has broadened its deadly airstrikes in recent weeks to bigger urban hubs in Lebanon, like the town of Baalbek, home to about 80,000 people, after initially targeting smaller border villages in the south, where the IDF says Hezbollah conducts operations. More than 2,100 people in Lebanon have been killed in Israel\u2019s war on the country over the past five weeks, and 1.2 million others displaced by Israeli attacks, according to Lebanese officials. The UN has said many people forced to flee Lebanon (many of whom have gone to Syria) have slept overnight in their vehicles, facing harsh conditions as they search for safety. Al Jazeera has been told by medical sources that Israeli attacks have killed 23 people in Gaza, including 13 in the northern part of the territory, since dawn. The Guardian is yet to independently verify these figures. Medics said at least 13 Palestinians were killed in separate attacks on houses in Beit Lahiya and Jabalia, the largest of the enclave\u2019s eight historic refugee camps and the focus of the Israeli army\u2019s renewed assault on northern Gaza. The rest of the Palestinian people were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City and the southern areas, according to Reuters. Palestinian officials have said an Israeli drone strike on a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio injured six people, including four children, on Saturday. The Israeli military has denied responsibility. Dr Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza health ministry, told the Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early on Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a UN delegation left the health facility. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef expressed alarm over reports that the clinic was hit during the vaccination drive. Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for Unicef, said: The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated. Today\u2019s attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6am to 4pm. The polio campaign began on 1 September after the WHO confirmed in August that a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, the first such case in the territory in 25 years. The first round of the vaccine campaign in early September successfully reached 559,000 children under 10 years old. The vaccines were able to be administered due to local \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to fighting in Gaza agreed by Israel and Palestinian groups (while these temporary pauses were generally stuck to in certain areas in Gaza, there were reports of Israeli airstrikes killing Palestinian people in others). The second phase of the drive began yesterday having been postponed last month due to relentless Israeli airstrikes in northern Gaza, mass displacement of Palestinians and a lack of access in the region (you can read this story to find out more). A Bangladeshi worker, Mohammad Nizam, 31, was killed in an airstrike in Lebanon on Saturday afternoon, Dhaka\u2019s foreign ministry has said. Nizam was killed in the airstrike as he stopped at a coffee shop on the way to work in Beirut, Bangladesh\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon, Javed Tanveer Khan, said. Mohmmad Jalaluddin said his younger brother Nizam had lived in Beirut for more than a decade, and had not been among the estimated 1,800 Bangladeshis who had registered for an evacuation flight home. \u201cWe want to bury him in our ancestral home, and are now waiting for the government\u2019s response,\u201d Jalaluddin told Agence France-Presse (AFP). But senior Bangladeshi foreign ministry official Shah Mohammad Tanvir Monsur said it was challenging to arrange a flight into Beirut. Monsur said: With the ongoing war, there are hardly any flights from Lebanon to Bangladesh. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to repatriate our citizens who have registered to return home. The foreign ministry estimates that between 70,000 and 100,000 of its nationals are working in Lebanon, many as labourers or domestic workers. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Israel\u2019s ongoing wars on Gaza and Lebanon. The entire Palestinian population in northern Gaza is at \u201cimminent risk\u201d of dying from disease, famine or \u201congoing bombardments\u201d by the Israeli military, the head of the United Nations children\u2019s agency (Unicef), Catherine Russell, has warned. In a statement issued yesterday, Russell said that in the past 48 hours alone, over 50 children had reportedly been killed in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza\u2019s eight historical refugee camps, where deadly Israeli airstrikes destroyed two residential buildings sheltering hundreds of people. Israel severely restricted aid to Gaza in October, allowing in only about a third of the humanitarian assistance that entered the previous month. Russell said: Civilians and civilian structures, including residential buildings, as well as humanitarian workers and their vehicles, must always be protected in accordance with international humanitarian law. Displacement or evacuation orders do not permit any party to the conflict to regard all individuals or objects in an area as military targets; nor do they exempt them from their obligations to distinguish between military and civilian objectives, be proportional and take all feasible precautions in attacks. Yet these principles are being flaunted over and over again, leaving tens of thousands of children killed, injured, and deprived of essential services needed for survival. Attacks on civilians, including humanitarian workers, and what remains of Gaza\u2019s civilian facilities and infrastructure must stop. Her comments come as Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reported this morning that at least nine Palestinian people were killed in Israeli airstrikes targeting two homes in Jabalia and Beit Lahiya, also in northern Gaza, as well as the southern city of Rafah. The Israeli military launched an intense assault in northern Gaza on 6 October, claiming it was trying to stop Hamas fighters from regrouping. But many civilians have been killed in the attacks, with residents saying Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people and targeted residential areas. Residents in the north, under sweeping evacuation orders, say they feel trapped as there is nowhere safe for them to flee to due to the relentless Israeli attacks there. Here are some of the other key developments: American B-52 bombers have arrived in the Middle East, the US military has confirmed. \u201cB-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers from Minot Air Force Base\u2019s 5th Bomb Wing arrived in the US Central Command area of responsibility,\u201d the military command for the Middle East and surrounding countries said in a post on social media. The US \u2013 Israel\u2019s biggest arms supplier and diplomatic ally - announced on Friday evening that it was sending the bombers, fighter and tanker aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the Middle East. \u201cShould Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj Gen Pat Ryder said. The Israeli military said about 10 rockets were fired from Lebanon at northern Israel after air raid sirens were sounded in the Haifa Bay and Galilee areas. Some of the rockets were intercepted while others struck open ground. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Israeli military launched a series of airstrikes on southern Lebanon overnight, including the town of Zawtar al-Sharqiya in the Nabatieh district, according to reports. Israeli naval forces captured a senior Hezbollah operative in north Lebanon, an Israeli military official said on Saturday. The operative appears to be a Lebanese sea captain. Earlier, Lebanese authorities said it was investigating whether Israel was behind the capture of a sea captain who was taken away by a group of armed men who had landed on the coast near the northern town of Batroun on Friday. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has released the following statement on the US\u2019s military support to Israel amid its deadly wars in Gaza and Lebanon: \u201cOngoing events in Lebanon &amp; Gaza have resulted in the martyrdom of 50,000 ppl in the last year, mostly women &amp; children\u2026 The US that claims to be an advocate of human rights, supports &amp; is complicit in those crimes. Plans &amp; weapons used are from the US.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amnesty International has called on authorities in Iran to \u201cimmediately and unconditionally\u201d release a female student who was arrested after stripping to her underwear in what the organisation described as a public protest against harassment relating to the country\u2019s strict dress code. The incident took place after the woman, who has not been identified, reportedly had a confrontation with members of the Basij paramilitary force who ripped her headscarf and tore at her clothes inside Tehran\u2019s prestigious Islamic Azad University. Videos posted to social media appear to show the woman removing her clothes and walking out on to the street in her underwear. A second video appears to show the woman being bundled into a car by men in plainclothes. The student media outlet Amir Kabir newsletter said the woman had been harassed by a Basij member for not wearing a headscarf. Under Iran\u2019s mandatory dress code, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. The media outlet also alleged that she was beaten during the arrest and on Saturday said that information about the woman\u2019s condition and whereabouts was unavailable. Amnesty International Iran called for an \u201cindependent and impartial\u201d investigation into the allegations of abuse. \u201cIran\u2019s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the university student who was violently arrested after she removed her clothes in protest against abusive enforcement of compulsory veiling by security officials,\u201d it said on social media. \u201cPending her release, authorities must protect her from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure access to family and lawyer.\u201d Iran\u2019s conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident, saying that the student had worn \u201cinappropriate clothes\u201d and had \u201cstripped\u201d after being told by security guards to comply with the dress code. In a report that cited \u201cwitnesses\u201d, it said that security guards had spoken \u201ccalmly\u201d with the student and denied reports that their actions had been aggressive in any way. The incident comes more than two years after Iran was rocked by nationwide protests after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach of the dress code. The protests, during which some women defied authorities to cast off their headscarves, were later violently curbed by authorities. With contributions from Agence France-Presse and Reuters",

It recently emerged in published freedom of information data that at least 20 cases have been in the system for more than a decade, with the oldest waiting nearly 17 years, and a further 19 cases are between 10 and 16 years old. The Guardian tracked down three people who have been stuck in the system for years and asked them about the reality of a life in perpetual limbo. Virginia Wairimu The 51-year-old, who lives in Birmingham, fled Kenya in 2019 after being attacked because she is a lesbian. Wairimu said she was brought up in a staunchly Christian family and was pressured into marrying a man, who was violent and sexually abusive towards her. \u201cI was successful in my career and became a travel consultant running my own safari company. I fled my marriage taking my young daughter with me and adopted another child. I met a woman in 2015 and we fell in love,\u201d she said. She and her partner survived by concealing their relationship, but eventually they were outed. Wairimu received threats on her phone, such as \u201cPeople like you don\u2019t deserve to live\u201d and \u201cWe need to eliminate you\u201d. After she was assaulted to \u201ccure\u201d her of being a lesbian she knew she had to flee. As soon as she arrived in the UK she claimed asylum. The Home Office rejected her claim saying they did not believe she was a lesbian and that even if she was she could return home and live discreetly. Wairimu has to present herself regularly at immigration reporting centres and could be arrested at any time. \u201cEvery time I go to report I prepare myself in case the Home Office detains me. I make sure people know I\u2019m going to report and I write any phone numbers I might need if I\u2019m detained on a piece of paper, as they confiscate your phone when they detain you. The night before I go to report I lie in bed thinking: \u2018Will this be the last night I\u2019ll sleep in this bed?\u2019 Sampson* Sampson has been battling to stay in the UK after fleeing torture in his home country in west Africa more than 16 years ago. His case was refused despite providing medical reports of his torture scars. \u201cI have seen so many different home secretaries come and go. I remember when Theresa May was home secretary and there was a scheme to reward Home Office staff with vouchers for a strong performance, including winning cases against asylum seekers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat made me feel very bad.

Angela Eagle, the minister for borders, security and asylum, said officials had been forced to find more private accommodation for new arrivals and blamed the backlog of tens of thousands of cases built up under the last government. The government\u2019s decision to open asylum hotels despite Keir Starmer\u2019s pledge that he would close them have been condemned by the Tories and Reform. In Labour\u2019s election manifesto, Starmer said he would \u201cend asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds\u201d. On Thursday, it emerged that hundreds of people had been removed from the Bibby Stockholm barge and put into hotels across the country. Asylum seekers were also seen moving into two hotels, in Berkshire and Greater Manchester, after the Home Office received \u201cministerial approval\u201d to use them. In her first public comments on the development, Eagle said ministers had no choice but to make the temporary move after discovering nearly 120,000 unprocessed asylum claims after Labour took power.

Labour is acutely aware that keeping asylum seekers in hotels can quickly become a toxic issue. During last summer\u2019s riots, several hotels were targeted by far-right activists. The latest figures from June show there were nearly 30,000 migrants living in more than 250 hotels at a cost of \u00a34.2m a day. Since then, more than 15,000 people seeking asylum have arrived across the Channel, the majority of whom will have to be housed in hotels. At the same time, the asylum backlog \u2013 the number of people claiming asylum whose cases were yet to be processed \u2013 soared over the final months of the Conservative government. Figures show that there were 118,882 people in the backlog by the end of June 2024 compared with 27,000 in 2018. After Labour scrapped the Rwanda policy, analysis by the Refugee Council found that the backlog was expected to be 118,063 in January 2025 \u2013 59,000 cases lower than if the last government had continued with the same policies. In effect, the majority of asylum decisions from March 2023 onwards had been stopped under the previous government\u2019s Illegal Migration Act. To restart processing, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, laid a statutory instrument that ended the retrospective nature of the act\u2019s provisions, so that the Home Office could start clearing cases. In the long term, Cooper is seeking homes of multiple occupancy, family properties, former care homes and student accommodation to house asylum seekers. Turning back to hotels to house asylum seekers in the short term is fraught with risk. Far-right elements targeted hotels housing asylum seekers during the recent unrest. During the last parliament, constituents\u2019 anger against asylum hotels provoked a backlash against Tory MPs, and proved to be a rallying point for Reform. After reports last week that more hotels would be opened, the shadow home secretary, James Cleverly, said: \u201cThe Tory government closed 150 asylum hotels and had flights ready to go to Rwanda. \u201cBut Labour scrapped our deterrent on day one and are now reopening asylum hotels costing upwards of \u00a34m every day \u2013 and breaking yet another promise they made to the British people.\u201d The Home Office is planning to deliver \u00a3200m of additional in-year savings in 2024-25 and \u00a3700m savings against 2024-25 levels during the 2025-26 financial year on asylum costs. These measures taken together would represent a saving of more than \u00a34bn across 24-25 and 25-26 compared with the previous trajectory of spending.",

      "bodyText": "The firefighter\u2019s hose that rears up like a serpent, hissing and spitting at the start of Steve McQueen\u2019s Blitz turns out to be its most chaotic, unpredictable character. Elsewhere this is a handsomely honeyed, well-managed affair, ticking off the homefront genre boxes even as it uncovers crookery and racism in the wings. It\u2019s 1940, the bombs are falling on London and nine-year-old evacuee George (Elliott Heffernan) has embarked on the kind of old-school boy\u2019s adventure that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Children\u2019s Film Foundation production. He\u2019s mixing with colourful cockneys, violent bobbies and wise air raid wardens, toiling to work his way back to his mum (Saoirse Ronan in a pencil-sketch of a role). McQueen\u2019s pedigree \u2013 first as a Turner Prize-winning artist, latterly as the creator of such spacious, quietly radical projects as Occupied City and the Small Axe series \u2013 naturally invites us to read deeper meanings into Blitz\u2019s strait-laced design. But simplicity sometimes has an honest worth of its own. What the film-maker has built for us here is the cinematic equivalent of an Anderson shelter: basic, sturdy and unfussy. It\u2019s there if we need it and have nowhere else to go. In UK and Irish cinemas now; on Apple TV+ from 22 November",

But he\u2019s been frustrated at how little Baltimore politicians are engaging with the topic. He says they often say they are unable to comment on the crisis due to the city\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/baltimore-take-drug-distributors-jj-trial-over-opioids-2024-09-16/\">ongoing lawsuits</a> against pharmaceutical companies and drug distributors.</p> <p>\u201cAt times, it feels as though the lawsuits have been used as an opportunity to avoid talking about a public health crisis that isn\u2019t exactly good PR for the city,\u201d Hullinger says.</p> <p>Local candidates in other overdose hotspots, such as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAQmEKiKw8HjTw0RZg-CU4S1W1cbNg_iK7u2PybzpAQ/edit?tab=t.0\">San Francisco</a>, are taking a similar approach to Harris and Trump, and promising crackdowns. Still, crackdowns do nothing to help with addiction.</p> <p>\u201cTargeting the supply without addressing the demand actually increases the risk and leads to more overdoses,\u201d says Marino. For people who are dependent on opioids, losing access to a reliable supply could mean they look to more unfamiliar, dangerous sources.</p> <p>Frederique notes that since the beginning of the prescription opioid overdose crisis, a chain reaction of crackdowns have made the drug supply increasingly dangerous.</p> <p>Prescription opioid restrictions did not stop people from using opioids, but \u201cdid send people to the underground heroin supply, which was cheaper\u201d, says Frederique. Heroin crackdowns led to illicit fentanyl, fentanyl crackdowns led to fentanyl analogues. Now that those, too, have been criminalized, nitazenes, a class of synthetic opioid that can be up to 40 times more potent than fentanyl, are already circulating in the US, as the Guardian<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/opioid-crisis-nitazenes-fentanyl\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/opioid-crisis-nitazenes-fentanyl\">has previously reported</a>.</p> <p>Access to overdose-reversal drugs, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441910/\">such as naloxone</a>; <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/03/05/opioid-addiction-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-restrictions/#:~:text=According%20to%20NIDA%2C%20patients%20using,to%20those%20not%20receiving%20medication.\">opioid cessation drugs, such as methadone</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395918302135\">drug testing services</a> is proven to drastically reduce the risk of overdose fatalities.</p> <p>Frederique and Marino advise voters to push politicians to put more resources into these proven strategies, but have different ideas about whether voters care enough to do so.

He says they often say they are unable to comment on the crisis due to the city\u2019s ongoing lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies and drug distributors. \u201cAt times, it feels as though the lawsuits have been used as an opportunity to avoid talking about a public health crisis that isn\u2019t exactly good PR for the city,\u201d Hullinger says. Local candidates in other overdose hotspots, such as San Francisco, are taking a similar approach to Harris and Trump, and promising crackdowns. Still, crackdowns do nothing to help with addiction. \u201cTargeting the supply without addressing the demand actually increases the risk and leads to more overdoses,\u201d says Marino. For people who are dependent on opioids, losing access to a reliable supply could mean they look to more unfamiliar, dangerous sources. Frederique notes that since the beginning of the prescription opioid overdose crisis, a chain reaction of crackdowns have made the drug supply increasingly dangerous. Prescription opioid restrictions did not stop people from using opioids, but \u201cdid send people to the underground heroin supply, which was cheaper\u201d, says Frederique. Heroin crackdowns led to illicit fentanyl, fentanyl crackdowns led to fentanyl analogues. Now that those, too, have been criminalized, nitazenes, a class of synthetic opioid that can be up to 40 times more potent than fentanyl, are already circulating in the US, as the Guardian has previously reported. Access to overdose-reversal drugs, such as naloxone; opioid cessation drugs, such as methadone; and drug testing services is proven to drastically reduce the risk of overdose fatalities. Frederique and Marino advise voters to push politicians to put more resources into these proven strategies, but have different ideas about whether voters care enough to do so. Frederique says that voters \u201cabsolutely\u201d care about this issue and that they \u201cwant and deserve a real plan that puts health and saving lives first. Most Americans agree that the drug war has failed.\u201d Marino, on the other hand, has found that it\u2019s more politically popular to focus on immigration and drug interdiction. Hullinger is also \u201dunsure where the [opioid] crisis ranks among voters\u2019 priorities\u201d. He says voters do care about the state of Baltimore\u2019s drug scene, \u201cbut not always for the right reasons. Many people, for example, consider drug users public nuisances, and they demand that the city does more to \u2018clean up\u2019 their neighborhoods.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s your report from Tom Garry at Leigh Sports Village. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave this live blog today. Thanks very much for joining, always a pleasure never a chore. Millie Turner was named the player of the match and politely tells the interviewer it was a draw and not \u201ca big win for Manchester United\u201d, as the interviewer said. \u201cIt feels a lot different this season,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep calm and just see where it takes us.\u201d And she reveals the POTM award is going straight on her mantlepiece. Does Slegers want the permanent job? Now that\u2019s a question she doesn\u2019t seem so comfortable asking. Some ducking and diving and fair enough. Slegers is with the BBC for a post-match chat: We created really good momentum and that\u2019s why we\u2019re disappointed. We wanted to be ruthless in both boxes\u2026 a lot of positives but we\u2019re disappointed we didn\u2019t get all three points. The players want to play a certain type of football. It\u2019s the Arsenal way, we call it. On goalscorer Russo: Alessia is a fantastic player but I see her working really hard every day. She\u2019s fantastic to work with. Skinner gets his United players in a big huddle on the pitch after the final whistle. He\u2019ll be delighted with the character they showed this afternoon. As for Arsenal, they\u2019ll be happy with their performance, if not the result. The signs under Ren\u00e9e Slegers have been good, for sure. That\u2019s it. The finale of that game did not disappoint, with chances at both ends. Manchester United have salvaged a point and kept their unbeaten WSL record this season intact in the process. Alessio Russo\u2019s goal against her former club looked like it had deservedly clinched all three points for Arsenal. But after a number of changes from Marc Skinner, United found a route back into it, via Melvine Malard\u2019s deft header from a corner. 90 min + 5: United are finishing the game strongly, with Geyse really impressive since coming onto the right flank. She\u2019s got dazzlingly fast feet. Can they conjure up a final chance? 90 min + 3: Tullis-Joyce clutches on gratefully after a Williamson header at goal. 90 min + 2: United have shown far more adventure and endeavour since scoring \u2013 but don\u2019t write off Arsenal. They\u2019ve got themselves a corner. It\u2019s a record LSV attendance of 8,348 for this game, the PA have just announced. Six minutes of added time. Nice. 89 min: United will actually feel they can nick all three points. Another corner from the right is swung in by George but Van Domselaar claims this one well under pressure. 88 min: McCabe is lucky not to be sent off! She should really have picked up two yellow cards in quick succession, the first for a foul and then for some afters with Geyse \u2013 she kicked the ball away in that fracas too. Tetchy stuff. 86 min: Arsenal have to put their hurt pride behind them and find another goal from somewhere. They\u2019re pushing forward again. It would help to have Russo still on the pitch right about now, wouldn\u2019t it? 84 min: This would be a robbery, let me tell you. But United won\u2019t care. They can! Would you believe it? It\u2019s flicked home Malard from the corner! In classic Manchester United fashion, the two substitutes combine from the corner, with Williams rising to get the first header and Malard flicking it in with the top of her head past a helpless goalkeeper. Incredible. 82 min: Geyse wins United a corner. They couldn\u2019t\u2026 could they? 81 min: United are at least getting up the pitch a little now, helped by the hold-up play and physicality of Malard, as well as Le Tissier\u2019s drive. 80 min: There\u2019s a furrowed brow from Leah Williamson and some complaints from the Arsenal coaching staff following a hefty challenge from Williams. Williamson ended up flying into the dugout after that. 78 min: Terland and Bizet are replaced by Geyse and Rachel Williams. And there\u2019s a mixed reception from the United fans as Russo is replaced for Arsenal by Blackstenius. I must say I find that change odd. Russo has been the best player on the pitch. 77 min: The crowd aren\u2019t happy after a rare United foray forward is halted in its tracks by a challenge on Terland. There\u2019s very little for the hosts to cheer about. Skinner is readying Geyse on the bench. 75 min: Someone tell United they actually need a goal. They\u2019re still sitting so deep. 73 min: It\u2019s the Arsenal fans who are making themselves heard at LSV. \u201cMeado!\u201d they chant, serenading the England star after a nifty turn. 72 min: Arsenal work it brilliantly from back to front, with Fox continuing to make the kind of sniping out-to-in runs that have troubled United all afternoon. Williamson has been a Rolls Royce bringing the ball out from the back. 70 min: Very little has changed since the goal. It\u2019s still endless Arsenal pressure with United just about hanging on defensively. The goal that separates the two sides: 66 min: Marc Skinner looks pensive in the United dugout and well he might. His team just haven\u2019t had the answers to Arsenal today. 65 min: United are fortunate, in a sense, that the goal has come with time left on the clock. They\u2019ll still believe they can forge a way back into the game. It had to be her! Alessia Russo finally gets her goal \u2013 although she doesn\u2019t celebrate very much, just a smile and a nod. It was another flowing Arsenal move, with a superb cut-back by Fox, who had picked up Caldentey\u2019s ball in space, with Russo stroking it home from close-range. Understatement of the day: 61 min: United need to change things, so Skinner is bringing on Riviere and Malard. That\u2019s another underwhelming display from Ella Toone, who is going off with a face like thunder. Mannion also trudges off. 60 min: Le Tissier gives it away cheaply but then doggedly wins it back to keep her side level. Fair play to her. 59 min: McCabe sends it in left footed and Arsenal keep it alive, piling on the pressure now with United camped inside their own 18-yard area. It just never stops. All hands on deck. 57 min: Turner is booked for a blatant shirt-tug on Russo, who was steaming down the right and into the box. Can Arsenal capitalise with this set-piece opportunity? 55 min: Walti unleashes a powerful left-footed pile-driver which is not far away at all. Arsenal are getting closer. 54 min: McCabe\u2019s cute backheel sets away Foord, racing down the left flank. United don\u2019t fully clear it and are right under the cosh here. 52 min: Mead, wearing No 9 on her back but playing as a scheming inside-right forward, has already made an impact off the bench. I don\u2019t think Maanum was playing particularly poorly but it just shows the quality in this Arsenal squad. 50 min: That\u2019s Russo\u2019s fourth or possibly fifth effort of the game, this time heading straight at Tullis-Joyce. She coud have got more power on that. 49 min: There\u2019s just no rest for United here. Every time they win it back, they\u2019re met with a vicious press. Arsenal have started the second half with intent. 47 min: Slick stuff again from Arsenal, a neat move which ends with Russo spinning and shooting just wide. Her miss is greeted with ironic United cheers. Second half: What does the next 45 minutes have in store? The United fans at LSV will be desperate for more attacking fluency from their side, with Ella Toone particularly disappointing in that first half. Her old mucker Alessia Russo has been Arsenal\u2019s, and arguably the game\u2019s most threatening player. Both teams have introduced half-time substitutes, with Simi Awujo coming on for United and Beth Mead for Arsenal. The home team have taken off Naaslund while Maanum is sacrificed for the visitors. Interesting. This could be tasty. A reminder of today\u2019s full fixture list with plenty more action to enjoy. 0-0 at the break. United\u2019s defence has held out. Arsenal will be bemused that they\u2019ve not found a way through, albeit Tullis-Joyce hasn\u2019t made a serious save of note. United need to far more in forward areas to trouble the Gunners\u2019 goal. 45 min: Arsenal are asking lots of questions \u2013 and one of those is of referee Kirsty Dowle, with McCabe adamant she was pulled back in the box. 43 min: The chances have dried up ever since I wrote that the game needs a goal. Sorry. 40 min: Le Tissier has been waving her arms around in defence, trying to direct her players with United struggling to play through Arsenal right now. 39 min: United\u2019s shape has looked more like a 4-2-4 at times, which explains why Arsenal are getting so much joy down the flanks. The Gunners\u2019 system looks far more fluid, with the likes of Maanum and Ford drifting dangerously into the channels. 36 min: Tullis-Joyce does well in the United goal. It was an awkward piece of handling, probably from her own player\u2019s touch, George. 34 min: We need a goal in this game. Arsenal look far more likely to break the deadlock, but United are not lacking in effort or desire. Terland does eventually get a headed chance away at goal, meeting Bizet\u2019s deep cross. Van Domselaar makes a straightforward stop. 31 min: Clinton is perhaps trying too hard, or are Arsenal just marshalling her well in midfield? She\u2019s been caught in possession a couple of times. 30 min: Big headed chance for Terland. No? Well, the whistle has gone but I\u2019m not quite sure what for. Offside or a small shove? Hmm. At the other end, Maanum skews an effort over the bar. End to end now. 28 min: Maanum is at the centre of everything good Arsenal are doing\u2026 but her touch just eludes her at the vital moment there, trying to collect a Kim Little pass. 27 min: Turner again clears for United! But no woman of an Arsenal persuasion was ready to turn home that ball in the six-yard box. Maanum then directs a header just wide. The BBC commentators are rightly saying that Arsenal have turned the screw and are now right on top. 25 min: Sensational play by Maanum, teasing down the left and sending in a tantalising cross that is begging to be nodded home. Turner takes no chance for United and flicks it over her own crossbar. 23 min: Aoife Mannion shields well for United, a vital piece of defending to keep out McCabe. 22 min: Clinton is bemused as a throw-in decision goes against her and United. Lisa Naalsund has played a couple of lovely diagonal passes. With almost 20 minutes on the clock it\u2019s still really hard to call this one. Arsenal have offered more quality in possession and have probably had the better chances through Russo, but United are being backed by a very healthy home crowd at Leigh Sports Village and have shown flashes of how dangerous they can be. They need Clinton to be more involved. 17 min: United have become a bit purposeless on the ball and Arsenal\u2019s mobile and industrious front players are trying to take advantage. United look much better when they go more direct. 15 min: It\u2019s quite mad that neither Toone nor Russo have scored a goal in the WSL yet this season. That could well change today. 13 min: Russo is looking dangerous. She\u2019s gone close again, working it onto her stronger right foot and sending it just over the bar, via a vital Millie Turner deflection. Two big chances for the England striker already. 11 min: Just as Charles says that, Arsenal are coming more into the game. They\u2019ve got a good free-kick position here, which McCabe sends into a great area but nobody can meet. Arsenal fan Charles Antaki gets in touch on email with a prediction: A loss unless Leah Williamson and Beth Mead recapture their best form \u2013 they were pretty poor in the England game (though not the only ones, to be sure). Williamson especially seems to have lost the sureness of her touch, which is a worry given the excellence of her passing, especially the incisive ones that open up chances. In the team as a whole, Mariona Caldentey sometimes looks a bit puzzled by the wastefulness of those around her; not a great start. 8 min: And it\u2019s Russo who goes close for the visitors after smartly picking up a loose throw, tuning into an alarming amount of space and whizzing it just wide. 6 min: Toone lines up a shot from distance but she never really got hold of it. There are some boos for her old mate Alessia Russo, who left United for Arsenal of course. 4 min: A bit slicker and quicker from United and Gabby George wins a corner for his overlapping efforts down the left. The kick is high and deep and Turner heads it off a defender for another corner, which \u2026 is well defended by Arsenal. 3 min: Arsenal have started slightly more confidently on the ball, with Caldentey trying to turn away from trouble a couple of times, albeit it\u2019s been a slow start to the game with a succession of throw-ins. Here we go, here we go, here we go. The two teams are out and we\u2019re almost ready to rock. Where\u2019s your money? The draw looks favourite to me. Toone, Russo, Mead, Williamson, Clinton, Le Tissier \u2026 there\u2019s lots of Lionesses interest in the two teams today. Ren\u00e9e Slegers isn\u2019t keen on looking too far ahead as she speaks to the BBC before the game. \u201cFor me it\u2019s only about this game here and now, I just wanna play the game against Manchester United.\u201d Classic interim speak. Celin Bizet will be an interesting one to watch for United today. She\u2019s been deployed at right-back at times this season but looks set to return to a more familiar forward-thinking role on the wing this afternoon. Her deliveries into the box and a telepathic understanding with Elisabeth Terland have been a big part of United\u2019s strong start to the campaign. If men\u2019s football is more your bag, there are some good reads on the website about Arsenal and Manchester United\u2019s struggles. I particularly enjoyed these two. Here\u2019s the Arsenal perspective on today\u2019s game, with interim head coach Ren\u00e9e Slegers providing some much needed balance and momentum after a shaky start to the campaign. Manchester United have conceded only just goal in the WSL this season \u2013 by far the best defensive record in the division. And today\u2019s game will be head coach Marc Skinner\u2019s 100th game in charge of United. \u201cI feel there\u2019s been a lot of growth in that time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really proud to represent Manchester United. I want to be successful here for another 100 games and to do that we\u2019ve got to win games, so although it\u2019s a fantastic milestone for me personally, I\u2019m hungrier than I\u2019ve ever been. \u201cWe\u2019ve started the season fantastically well but we\u2019re going to face a team that could either be wounded and really want to show that, or a team that we could hopefully try and take advantage of, but they\u2019re going to be very difficult to play against.\u201d Manchester United: Tullis-Joyce; Turner, Le Tissier, Mannion, George; Naaslund, Janssen, Clinton; Toone, Bizet, Terland. Subs: Middleton-Patel, Riviere, Awujo, Ladd, Miyazawa, Watson, Geyse, Malard, Williams Arsenal: Van Domselaar; Fox, Williamson, Catley, Walti; Caldentey, Little, McCabe, Maanum; Foord, Russo. Subs: Zinsberger, Codina, Reid, Kuhl, Cooney-Cross, Mead, Kafaji, Hurtig, Blackstenius If Arsenal surprised a few people because of their slow start to this WSL season, then Manchester United have been surprise packages for all the right reasons this term. So there\u2019s no shortage of talking points as the two lock horns at Leigh Sports Village in today\u2019s early kick-off. The visitors are looking for a third win from three games under interim head coach, Ren\u00e9e Slegers, who by all accounts has brought \u201cnew energy\u201d to Arsenal after the departure of Jonas Eidevall. United, meanwhile, are unbeaten, albeit having played just four games to the Gunners\u2019 five; they do arguably have one of the league\u2019s most in-form and exciting players in England\u2019s Grace Clinton, as well as on-song striker Elisabeth Terland. It\u2019s all set up for a cracking contest, which kicks off at 12.30pm UK time. We\u2019ll run through the confirmed lineups in the next post. Stay tuned.",

It was only the \u00adsecond goal United have \u00adconceded so far this season. Russo was booed by the home fans on her \u00adsecond \u00adappearance back at Leigh Sports \u00adVillage since her 2023 free transfer to Arsenal, and went close to another goal with a downward header soon afterwards.</p> <p>The introduction of the England \u00adforward Beth Mead as a half-time sub\u00adstitute shifted the balance of the match in Arsenal\u2019s favour. Yet, later in the game, it was the hosts\u2019 \u00adsubsti\u00adtutes who were key to finding the leveller, as Rachel Williams flicked on for Malard to head in.</p> <p>\u201cI would probably say that they feel like they should have won the game,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s on them, but they didn\u2019t. And you\u2019ve got to take the point where you take the point. We weren\u2019t our best today. But I\u2019m really happy that we\u2019ve taken the point.</p> <p>\u201cI felt we dug in and we stuck in. And then you ride that luck and we believe in ourselves to create chances, albeit from a set piece, but we know Arsenal have struggled on those. So we took our chance and we moved on with a point. It wasn\u2019t our best \u00adattacking display, but I\u2019m really happy with the \u00addefensive \u00addisplay. We leave the game in a \u00adpositive frame and lots to learn. I\u2019m happy with the way that we\u2019ve achieved the point.\u201d</p>    <p>They achieved it with a significant element of gratitude towards the \u00adcentre-backs Maya Le Tissier and \u00adMillie Turner, as well as the goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who had produced two strong saves to keep Arsenal at bay before Lia \u00adW\u00e4lti\u2019s \u00adfizzing strike clipped the outside of a post.

      "bodyText": "Marc Skinner, the Manchester United head coach, admitted his team rode their luck as they struck late to maintain their unbeaten start to the Women\u2019s Super League campaign with a draw against an improving Arsenal side who produced arguably their best display of the campaign. The more frustrated looks on the faces of the Arsenal players, supporters and staff at full time summed up the visitors\u2019 control of large parts of the second half, after the France forward Melvine Malard\u2019s goal eight minutes from time denied them their third win from three games under the interim head coach, Ren\u00e9e Slegers. Earlier, the former United striker Alessia Russo had haunted her old club with a second-half goal to put the visitors in front. It was only the second goal United have conceded so far this season. Russo was booed by the home fans on her second appearance back at Leigh Sports Village since her 2023 free transfer to Arsenal, and went close to another goal with a downward header soon afterwards. The introduction of the England forward Beth Mead as a half-time substitute shifted the balance of the match in Arsenal\u2019s favour. Yet, later in the game, it was the hosts\u2019 substitutes who were key to finding the leveller, as Rachel Williams flicked on for Malard to head in. \u201cI would probably say that they feel like they should have won the game,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s on them, but they didn\u2019t. And you\u2019ve got to take the point where you take the point. We weren\u2019t our best today. But I\u2019m really happy that we\u2019ve taken the point. \u201cI felt we dug in and we stuck in. And then you ride that luck and we believe in ourselves to create chances, albeit from a set piece, but we know Arsenal have struggled on those. So we took our chance and we moved on with a point. It wasn\u2019t our best attacking display, but I\u2019m really happy with the defensive display. We leave the game in a positive frame and lots to learn. I\u2019m happy with the way that we\u2019ve achieved the point.\u201d They achieved it with a significant element of gratitude towards the centre-backs Maya Le Tissier and Millie Turner, as well as the goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who had produced two strong saves to keep Arsenal at bay before Lia W\u00e4lti\u2019s fizzing strike clipped the outside of a post. It felt like an Arsenal goal was coming and it arrived eventually when Russo\u2019s clinical low finish across goal brought the 1,200 travelling fans to their feet. Watched by Sarina Wiegman, neither side produced their best football in the opening 45 minutes, but the England head coach may well have been impressed by the passing range displayed by Turner, who was making her 150th appearance for United. The centre-back was presented with a framed shirt before the game by United\u2019s sporting director, Dan Ashworth, who similarly made a presentation to Skinner on the occasion of his 100th game in charge. With this result United missed the chance to go top for a few hours, but it keeps them unbeaten from their first five league games and they remain two points better off than Arsenal. Slegers, who has been told she will remain in interim charge for at least a further four games until the next international break at the end of November, saw a lot of things in Arsenal\u2019s display to be pleased with. \u201cPerformance-wise there was a lot of positives but then again, the disappointment was only one point,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they [the players] feel like, over the full game, we were better than United and we should have gotten the three points. But it\u2019s constructive. They all feel very motivated and they take a lot of positives from the performance. \u201cWhen we came back from this international break we had a meeting with the players and got their input: what in our football do we want to develop, what do we want to focus on, what do we think will bring our game to the next level?. Coaches and players together have worked on this. \u201cWe spoke about intensity, ruthlessness in the boxes, communication and we could all see that was good on the pitch today. If we keep on building, I am positive about the block of games ahead of us.\u201d This was the first time this season when United had faced one of the top three sides from last season, and undoubtedly their toughest test so far. Skinner was understandably pleased with the way his team battled to a draw but Arsenal will have travelled back to north London in the knowledge they appeared to be a stronger team, which will give Slegers hope they can return to happier times in the coming weeks.",

She also appeared in play anthology series such as Armchair Theatre and Drama \u201961, and had roles in two popular drama series of the 70s: as Clemency in the prison drama Within These Walls and as Sister Young in Angels, about student nurses in a London hospital.</p> <p>Nadia often broadcast to the Caribbean on the BBC Overseas Service (later the World Service). As well as being an announcer she was a reader in the literary programme <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire/caribbean-voices/\">Caribbean Voices</a> in 1953. This later led to an offer to present Woman\u2019s Hour on the BBC Light Programme station in 1964. She said: \u201cIt was for one week only but it was exciting and I really enjoyed myself.\u201d</p> <p>As a singer during the \u201cfolk revival\u201d of the 60s, Nadia appeared in the acclaimed Grief and Glory TV series in 1967, and at folk clubs and concerts, often accompanying herself on the guitar. Her most popular recording was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEuOmiLqbk\">Long Time Boy</a>, which she wrote under the name Eva Dayne, released on Parlophone in 1960. Her 1970 album Earth Mother was partly recorded at the 1969 Edinburgh festival.</p>    <p>However, when Nadia first travelled to Britain from her native Belize, it was not to pursue a career in entertainment, but to support the war effort. One of the three children of Kathleen (nee Fairweather) and Albert Cattouse, she was born in what was then British Honduras, a crown colony in central America. Her father was a civil servant who, after his retirement, entered politics and became the deputy prime minister. Her mother was a school teacher and griot \u2013 a traditional storyteller.</p> <p>During the second world war, volunteers from across the British empire were called upon to join the armed services but, until 1943, a \u201ccolour bar\u201d prevented black Caribbean women from enlisting. As soon as this obstacle was removed, Nadia was among the first group to join the ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service). After basic training in Jamaica, she arrived in Britain in June 1944 and was sent to Edinburgh for specialist training as a signals operator. She had a wonderful time: \u201cThere was no racial tension, only a great deal of camaraderie and local hospitality.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving the ATS, Nadia trained as a school teacher in Glasgow before returning to British Honduras in 1949. However, having experienced \u201cfreedom\u201d from colonial rule, she found life there oppressive. She told the TV Times in 1970: \u201cI think you can contribute wherever you are in the world. Sometimes if you go home, you contribute less. Any talent you have can shrivel up with restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Britain in 1951, she studied sociology at the London School of Economics, paying her way by working in a kitchen and as a telephone receptionist. She was also seconded to work for the Colonial Office, looking after newly arrived Caribbean migrants, and helping them find accommodation. Early experience as a performer came through the Commonwealth Students\u2019 Drama Group. When I interviewed Nadia in 1989, she told me: \u201cAt first I did acting and singing for fun, and to help pay my way through college. Eventually it crystallised into a professional career.\u201d</p>    <p>One of Nadia\u2019s earliest television roles was in the BBC drama-documentary A Man from the Sun (1956), which focused on the lives of Caribbean settlers in postwar Britain. She acknowledged the existence of a small but important group of liberal-minded white producers and writers at the BBC who succeeded in making programmes with black casts or themes. She said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for them, we wouldn\u2019t have worked.\u201d She added that it wasn\u2019t always easy: \u201cOthers had this fixed idea that, if you were American, you were better than anyone who came from the Caribbean. Our accents bothered them. Usually we could use our intelligence to guide ourselves through.\u201d</p> <p>In the 50s Nadia befriended the Trinidadian activist Claudia Jones, who had been persecuted in America for her political beliefs. In 1959 Jones pulled together a group of black artists, including Nadia, to launch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2014/aug/24/notting-hill-carnival-the-early-years\">first West Indian carnival in Britain</a>, at St Pancras Town Hall in north London. It took to the streets of Notting Hill in 1966.</p> <p>When she reflected on her career, Nadia felt that some of the early productions she appeared in were made possible because \u201cthere was goodwill and serious attempts to create drama for us. Others ignored us, or said things like Enoch Powell, which put a threat over us. In the 1960s Powell\u2019s speeches led to hostility and attempts to either pretend we weren\u2019t here, or make sure we weren\u2019t visible.\u201d</p> <p>By the mid-80s Nadia was living quietly in semi-retirement in south-west London.

      "body": "<p>Once fresh-faced new kids on the block, now more like a favourite uncle and aunt, Yo-Yo Ma and Kathryn Stott have been making sweet music together for 40 years. A cause for celebration, yes, but there was sadness in the air tonight too, as the British pianist has decided to hang up her hat as a performing musician. This handsomely curated programme was by way of her final hurrah.</p> <p>At the heart of the matter were two of the great cello sonatas: Shostakovich\u2019s neurasthenic outpouring from 1934 and Franck\u2019s fully sanctioned arrangement of his hyper-romantic A major violin sonata from 1888. Both works demonstrated the performers\u2019 instinctual and intimate way of working together, each tilted slightly back, their heads almost touching.</p> <p>Ma\u2019s burnished timbre brought an intense beauty to the Shostakovich, his effortless legato probing the Largo to bring out its feeling of infinite sorrow. Stott\u2019s meaty tone and insistent rhythms drove the demonic Allegro, its sinister mood heightened by Ma\u2019s skeletal glissandi. Urgent, and occasionally exuberant, this was classy playing of the highest order.</p> <p>The Franck, too, was a thing of wonder, the musicians\u2019 flexible approach calm and expansive, with plenty of firepower held in reserve. Stott, in particular, took no prisoners, executing some ferociously demanding leaps and runs.

      "bodyText": "Once fresh-faced new kids on the block, now more like a favourite uncle and aunt, Yo-Yo Ma and Kathryn Stott have been making sweet music together for 40 years. A cause for celebration, yes, but there was sadness in the air tonight too, as the British pianist has decided to hang up her hat as a performing musician. This handsomely curated programme was by way of her final hurrah. At the heart of the matter were two of the great cello sonatas: Shostakovich\u2019s neurasthenic outpouring from 1934 and Franck\u2019s fully sanctioned arrangement of his hyper-romantic A major violin sonata from 1888. Both works demonstrated the performers\u2019 instinctual and intimate way of working together, each tilted slightly back, their heads almost touching. Ma\u2019s burnished timbre brought an intense beauty to the Shostakovich, his effortless legato probing the Largo to bring out its feeling of infinite sorrow. Stott\u2019s meaty tone and insistent rhythms drove the demonic Allegro, its sinister mood heightened by Ma\u2019s skeletal glissandi. Urgent, and occasionally exuberant, this was classy playing of the highest order. The Franck, too, was a thing of wonder, the musicians\u2019 flexible approach calm and expansive, with plenty of firepower held in reserve. Stott, in particular, took no prisoners, executing some ferociously demanding leaps and runs. From brooding dales to sunny uplands, synchronicity and balance were immaculate, as was the palpable sense of unanimity of purpose. There were bon bons to open, including Faur\u00e9\u2019s Berceuse, tastefully understated. Ma\u2019s phrasing was exquisite, Stott\u2019s touch soft as a featherbed. A rapt account of Nadia Boulanger\u2019s Cantique proved a fitting tribute to the great French pedagogue who was one of Stott\u2019s first mentors as well as the teacher of Ma\u2019s college professor (she also taught Aaron Copland, Philip Glass and Burt Bacharach). Most remarkable was their playing of Arvo P\u00e4rt\u2019s Spiegel im Spiegel.

Like Biden, Harris has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war\">called for a ceasefire</a> in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Harris has repeatedly said the US will always support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, and has rebuffed activist calls to support an arms embargo on the country. However, she has been more vocally critical of Israel\u2019s conduct during the yearlong conflict that has killed 43,000 Palestinians and deeply divided her party.

He has not ruled out withdrawing from Nato, and even suggested he might step back from other alliances.</p> <p><strong>Russia-Ukraine war: </strong>With many of his supporters opposed to continuing the flow of US aid to Ukraine, Trump has vowed to \u201cfundamentally re-evaluate\u201d the country\u2019s approach.

At home, he has advocated for an aggressive response to pro-Palestinian protests, suggesting he would strip foreign students of their visas if they express antisemitic or anti-American sentiment.</p> <p><strong>China: </strong>In a second term, Trump has said he would take an even stronger stand against China, though he has praised its president, Xi Jinping, and has not said whether he would send troops if China invaded Taiwan.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Kamala Harris</strong><strong> on climate</strong><strong> and energy policies</strong></h2> <p>Harris has said unequivocally that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis\">climate crisis</a> is caused by human activity and represents an existential threat to the nation and the planet.</p> <p><strong>Climate programs: </strong>As vice-president, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s signature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/biden-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> legislation that marked the country\u2019s most significant effort yet to combat the climate crisis. The law made major investments in renewable energy as part of the administration\u2019s overall aim to dramatically reduce the US\u2019s planet-heating emissions by the end of the decade.

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offer two starkly different visions for the country with much at stake \u2013 from pocketbook economic issues and reproductive rights to the strength of the country\u2019s global alliances and existential questions about the future of American democracy and the planet. As they compete for the White House, both candidates have laid out their plans in speeches, campaign ads and media interviews. Most of it amounts to a wish list, sketched out in broad strokes and lacking concrete details about how they would be implemented or paid for. A number of Trump\u2019s proposals raise legal questions, while some of Harris\u2019s would probably require Democratic control of Congress. * * * Kamala Harris policies on the economy On the top issue for voters this election, Harris is tied to the Biden administration\u2019s record on the economy \u2013 for better or worse. But she has proposed her own set of targeted economic plans to lower costs. Inflation: While the overall economic picture has brightened in recent months, Harris has said she agrees with Americans that prices are \u201cstill too high\u201d after several years of significant inflation. Harris says she wants to build up the \u201copportunity economy,\u201d, focused on the middle class, with plans to combat price gouging, boost housing development, aid first-time homebuyers, expand tax credits for parents and expand Medicare to cover in-home senior care. Taxes: Harris has pledged to cut taxes for tens of millions of middle- and low-income families, while saying she supports tax breaks for entrepreneurs and small business owners. She also backs a proposal championed by Trump to eliminate taxes on tips. Harris has called for the corporate tax rate to be raised to 28%, up from 21%. Trade: Harris is expected to maintain the Biden administration\u2019s approach, relying on tariffs and export controls to boost domestic competitiveness with China. On the campaign trail, she has also touted the Biden administration\u2019s ambitious investments in infrastructure and renewable energy. Donald Trump policies on the economy Trump continues to tout his pre-pandemic record. Inflation: Much of Trump\u2019s inflation-reduction plan hinges on his vow to slash energy costs by expanding oil and gas drilling and deregulation, though economists say his plans for sweeping tariffs and mass deportations could actually raise costs. He has also been highly critical of high interest rates, the Federal Reserve\u2019s main inflation-fighting tool. Trump said recently that he thinks the president should have a say in decisions made by the Fed, which traditionally operates independently from politics. Taxes: In a second term, he has vowed to extend and expand a suite of tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, while pledging to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% for companies that make their products in the US. He has also said he would exempt Social Security benefits and overtime pay, in addition to tips, from income taxes. Trade and tariffs: Trump has called himself as the \u201ctariff man\u201d, casting such taxes as the answer to the country\u2019s myriad economic problems, from revitalizing a sagging auto industry to bringing down the high cost of childcare. The former president has suggested an across-the-board levy of perhaps 10% and up to 20% on virtually all foreign-made goods, as well as slapping tariffs of 60% \u2013 or more \u2013 on goods from China, an approach the Economist called a \u201cprotectionist nightmare\u201d. He has said he would ask Congress for the authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the US. * * * Kamala Harris policies on abortion Harris was a vocal proponent of reproductive rights before she became the nominee, assailing Trump and Republicans for creating a \u201chealthcare crisis\u201d that has led to the preventable deaths of women seeking abortion care. Roe v Wade and abortion bans: As a candidate, she has called on Congress to pass legislation to restore the protections of Roe v Wade, which the supreme court overturned in 2022. Doing so would reinstate the Roe-era status quo, in effect blocking states from banning abortion before fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. As president, Harris has vowed she would veto any nationwide abortion ban. IVF: Harris has pledged to protect the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare, including access to contraception and other fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). She has also touted efforts by the Biden-Harris administration to safeguard access to medical abortion and protect women who cross state lines to access the procedure. Donald Trump policies on abortion Trump has alternately bragged about his role appointing three supreme court justices whose votes were decisive in overturning Roe while also complaining that bans on abortion in Republican-controlled states may hurt him electorally. Roe v Wade and abortion bans: Trump has said abortion access should be left to the states, and has vowed that as president he would not sign a national abortion ban. (Weeks before making that pledge, he refused to say whether he would veto such a ban.) IVF: He has also said that if he wins he would make IVF free for women, though has provided few specifics and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation that would protect the treatment. Abortion pills: Project 2025, the 900-page conservative blueprint for the next Republican president, suggests using a 19th-century anti-vice law to ban the mailing of abortion pills, which account for two-thirds of US abortions. Because this law is already on the books, a President Trump could enforce it without congressional action. Trump has said \u201cgenerally speaking\u201d he would not enforce the law, but had previously expressed an openness to curbing access. * * * Kamala Harris policies on democracy Harris has called Trump a \u201cfascist\u201d seeking a return to \u201cunchecked power\u201d. She staged her closing argument at the Ellipse, the precise spot from which Trump had fomented a violent assault on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Harris has warned that Trump would arrive in office with an \u201cenemies list\u201d and has called his violent rhetoric against political opponents \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. Reform: Harris has said that she is willing to eliminate the filibuster to codify abortion rights, a reform many Democrats believe would help ease some of the legislative gridlock in Congress. Voting rights: As vice-president, she led the push to pass federal voting rights legislation, but the effort stalled. Donald Trump policies on democracy Election denialism: Trump has never stopped fully repeating the lie that his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden was marred by fraud. He has refused to say whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election, and he and his allies are already laying the groundwork to deny an electoral defeat. In comments that have alarmed experts and scholars, Trump has threatened to jail his political opponents and turn the military against US citizens. He has also pledged to pardon defendants convicted for their roles in the January 6 attack, which he recently called a \u201cday of love\u201d. Trump, meanwhile, is facing federal charges over his attempt to overturn the results of the election, including his actions related to the violent Capitol assault. Trump, who has signaled his intention to surround himself with loyalists, has said he would retaliate against his political opponents, threatening to use the justice department to prosecute Democratic lawyers, elections officials, donors and even voters. This would be a sharp break from Democratic norms in the United States, where federal law enforcement is supposed to be apolitical. * * * Kamala Harris policies on border security and immigration Harris has sought to flip the script on immigration, one of her biggest political vulnerabilities. Border security: During a visit to the border in September, she laid out a plan to enact stricter penalties for people who attempt to claim asylum between lawful ports of entry. Arrests of people for crossing the southern border reached record levels during the early years of the Biden administration, but have fallen sharply since he implemented an asylum clampdown. As vice-president, Harris was tasked with addressing the root causes of migration. Trump and Republicans blame her for the situation at the border, describing it as overrun as a result of Biden\u2019s overly lenient immigration policies. Immigration reform: A former California senator, Harris has long championed comprehensive immigration reform, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, especially those who were brought to the US as children. Donald Trump policies on border security and immigration Immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue. In a second term, he has vowed to go much further than he did four years ago. Deportation: He has promised to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in US history, a policy that would face logistical, legal and financial hurdles while tearing apart families and unleashing fear throughout immigrant communities. He has said he would reinstate several controversial policies from his first term, including the Remain in Mexico program, Title 42 and a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority nations. He has vowed to rescind programs that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation, including children, while revoking the legal status of potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the US under the federal temporary protected status program. Trump has also suggested he would end birthright citizenship for the US-born children of undocumented immigrants \u2013 a proposal that experts say is unlikely to prevail in court \u2013 and impose \u201cideological screenings\u201d for immigrants. Anti-immigrant sentiment: Beyond his policy, Trump has used his rhetoric to stoke fear of immigrants, claiming that the country was being \u201cinvaded\u201d and amplifying rightwing lies about immigrant populations in places like Springfield, Ohio, where Haitians have become targets of threats and vitriol since the former president repeated a false rumor about the community. He has also echoed Adolf Hitler, saying that immigrants coming to the US were \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d. He recently said record levels of migration under the Biden administration had turned the US into a \u201cgarbage can\u201d. * * * Kamala Harris on foreign policy Global alliances: Harris\u2019s approach to foreign policy has hewed closely to the president\u2019s, with an emphasis on maintaining the US\u2019s global alliances, especially Nato. Russia-Ukraine war: She has fully aligned herself with the Biden administration\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, pledging unyielding support for the nation as it battles to repel Russian forces from its territory. Harris has repeatedly attacked Putin\u2019s \u201cbrutality\u201d and warned that Trump would force Ukraine to \u201csurrender\u201d to Russia. Middle East crisis: In the Middle East, Harris again has been broadly supportive of the administration\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s widening war, which began in Gaza and now includes Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. Like Biden, Harris has called for a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023.

He has claimed that he will end the nearly three-year war on his first day in office, but offered no details on how he might accomplish this.

His flattery of Vladimir Putin and complicated history with Ukraine \u2013 he was impeached in 2019 for withholding aid as a means of pressuring his president for \u201cdirt\u201d on Biden \u2013 suggest the proposal would probably entail Ukraine giving up some of its territory captured by Russia.

The broadcaster\u2019s advertising sales arm, Sky Media, will have to recompense business partners such as Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery, after discovering earlier this year that it had miscalculated what it owed them. Sky Media sells advertising space on its own channels as well as those owned by other major media organisations. Earlier this year, the division discovered that it had significantly underestimated what it was supposed to have paid to the owners of those other channels since 2017, according to the Sunday Telegraph, which first reported the story. The errors began before the company\u2019s \u00a330bn takeover by the American TV company Comcast but continued afterwards, Sky confirmed. The reimbursements are understood to have been properly accounted for but not specifically referenced in public filings. Some staff have left the business as a result of the costly gaffe, the Telegraph reported. A Sky Media spokesperson said: \u201cWhen we became aware of an issue in relation to payments to partners, we acted decisively, conducted a thorough review process, proactively notified all partners, and are in the process of fully reimbursing them. We have made the necessary internal changes to prevent this recurring.\u201d The mistake shines an unflattering light on Sky\u2019s competence relative to the UK\u2019s other leading vendors of TV advertising minutes: Channel 4 and ITV. In 2015, Sky Media held off a challenge from Channel 4 to secure the rights to handle the \u00a3250m-a-year ad sales business for Channel 5, which had been bought by Viacom the previous year. Both Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global, formed by the 2019 merger of CBS and Viacom, could review their contracts with Sky after receiving reimbursements, the Telegraph reported. In 2015, when Sky Media won Viacom\u2019s business, Andrew Griffith, Sky\u2019s finance chief and the managing director of the company\u2019s commercial businesses, said the deal was proof of the value of products such as its localised ad targeting technology AdSmart. \u201cThis is a big deal in terms of the validation of [ad] formats like AdSmart,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy has Viacom gone with Sky rather than another player?

The Sky Media division was run until September last year by Patrick Behar, who left to become the global chief executive of the audience analysis business Kantar Media. There is no suggestion his departure was associated with the payment miscalculation, which is understood to have been uncovered earlier this year by Sky Media, which informed its partners proactively.

In Australia, when a user makes an allegedly defamatory post or review on Google or Facebook it is usually the user that faces legal action for defamation. But a landmark 2021 high court ruling in Dylan Voller\u2019s case against news outlets \u2013 over comments on their social media pages relating to the young Indigenous man\u2019s mistreatment in Don Dale youth detention centre \u2013 has also held that the page that hosts a defamatory comment, such as news pages on Facebook, can also be held liable. The tech companies are occasionally taken to court in Australia. Google was forced to pay former deputy NSW premier John Barilaro more than $700,000 in 2022 over hosting a defamatory video, and the company was ordered to pay $40,000 in 2020 over search results linking to a news article about a Melbourne lawyer, which was later overturned by the high court. Last week, Google began rolling out changes to Maps in the United States, with its new AI, Gemini, allowing people to ask Maps for places to visit or activities to do, and summarising the user reviews for restaurants or locations. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Google also began rolling out AI overviews in search results to Australian users last week that provide summaries of search results to users. Meta has recently commenced providing AI-generated summaries of comments on posts on Facebook, such as those posted by news outlets. Michael Douglas, a defamation expert and consultant at Bennett Law, said he expected to see some cases reach court as AI was rolled out into these platforms. \u201cIf Meta sucks up comments and spits them out, and if what it spits out is defamatory, it is a publisher and potentially liable for defamation,\u201d he said. \u201cNo doubt such a company would rely on various defences. It may argue \u2018innocent dissemination\u2019 under the defamation acts, but I am not sure that the argument would get very far \u2013 it ought to have reasonably known that it would be repeating defamatory content.\u201d He said they might rely on new \u201cdigital intermediaries\u201d provisions in defamation laws in some states, but that AI might not be in the scope of the new defences. Prof David Rolph, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Sydney, said an AI repeating allegedly defamatory comments could be a problem for the tech companies, but the introduction of the serious harm requirement in recent defamation reforms may reduce the risk.

I\u2019m here as a mother \u2026 Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations. \u2026We must vote, and we need you.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>    <p>The pop phenom endorsed the Democratic nominee just minutes after the presidential debate in September between Harris and Trump. In an Instagram post published to her 283 million followers, Swift <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C_wtAOKOW1z/\">said</a>: \u201cI will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election \u2026 I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Bruce Springsteen</h2>    <p>At a Harris rally last month in Philadelphia, \u201cthe Boss\u201d performed his 1978 song The Promised Land and <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bruce-springsteen-john-legend-kamala-harris-philadelphia-1235145327/\">said</a>: \u201cNow, I understand folks have different opinions about things, but this election is about a group of folks who want to fundamentally undermine our American way of life \u2026 On November 5, I\u2019m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \u2013 and I urge all of you who believe in the American dream to join me.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Stevie Wonder</h2>    <p>The legendary singer endorsed Harris at the Democratic national convention (DNC), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhYMholxujk\">saying</a>: \u201cThis is a moment to tell your children where you were and what you did. \u2026 When we stand between history\u2019s pain and tomorrow\u2019s promises, we must choose courage over complacency.\u201d The 74-year old also appeared in a Harris ad alongside the filmdirector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee\">Spike Lee</a>.</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Willie Nelson</h2>    <p>Country-music original \u201coutlaw\u201d Nelson, 91, performed at Harris\u2019s Houston rally where Beyonc\u00e9 spoke.

She campaigned for Harris last month in Wisconsin. \u201cYou here in Wisconsin have the capacity to save the soul of this country, to really stand between us and a man who has said that he wants to be a dictator on day one, to stand between us and a man who said he wants generals more like Hitler\u2019s generals,\u201d Washington <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/kerry-washington-kamala-harris-olivia-pope-wisconsin/75885917007/\">said</a> to a gathering of Black women.</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</h2>    <p>The Veep star endorsed Harris by making a distinction between her fictional vice-presidential character, Selina Meyer, and Harris.

I am possibly much more like someone from the other party whose name I shall not even utter.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Jennifer Lopez</h2>    <p>Jennifer Lopez took to the rally stage in Las Vegas on Thursday to endorse Harris.

She said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, it was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character \u2026 There is no candidate in the history of the presidency that is more qualified and there is no job that Kamala Harris can\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Eminem</h2>    <p>The Detroit rapper and longtime critic of Donald Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1848885891663605776\">told</a> a Harris rally in his home town: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known. I think Vice-President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Megan Thee Stallion</h2>    <p>An early endorser, the rapper spoke in Atlantain July, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/07/30/megan-thee-stallion-kamala-harris-campaign-rally/74599637007/\">saying</a>: \u201cI want to start off by saying: hotties for Harris.\u201d Performing a compilation of hit songs, the 29-year-old singer said: \u201cWe about to make history with the first female president, the first Black female president.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Bad Bunny</h2>    <p>The Puerto Rican music star leapt on to Instagram straight after Hinchcliffe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/trump-rally-puerto-rico-voter-reaction\">racist remarks</a>.He <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/bad-bunny-instagram-trump-rally-garbage-rcna177869\">posted</a> about Harris criticizing Trump over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/oct/04/trump-throws-paper-towels-into-crowd-in-puerto-rico-video\">his handling</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/puerto-rico-donald-trump-visit-hurricane-maria\">relief efforts</a> after Hurricanes Irma and Maria that devastated the island territory in 2017, where she said: \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Samuel L Jackson</h2>    <p>Addressing a rally of more than 20,000 people in Atlanta last month, the Hollywood A-lister <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/samuel-l-jackson-kamala-harris_n_671b7747e4b0aa35532e4dcb\">said</a> that Harris was \u201crunning on a proven track record of fighting for the people, standing up to bullies, protecting the most vulnerable and taking on the toughest fights\u2026 That\u2019s the kind of president I can stand behind.\u201d</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p></p> <h2>Magic Johnson</h2>    <p>The former basketball star rallied for Harris in Flint, Michigan, <a href=\"https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/32368/magic_johnson_in_flint_our_black_men_we_got_to_get_them_out_to_vote_for_kamala_harris\">saying</a>: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019ve known Kamala for over 20 years.

Lizzo <a href=\"https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/20/its-about-damn-time-to-elect-harris-as-president-lizzo-says/\">fired back</a>: \u201cProud like Detroit; resilient like Detroit.

      "bodyText": "It is debatable what effect celebrity endorsements have on voters, but candidates always welcome them. Here are the highly contrasting groups of A-listers who have endorsed Kamala Harris and Donald Trump: Kamala Harris Beyonc\u00e9 The music megastar spoke at a Harris rally in her home town of Houston just days ago. To the 30,000-strong crowd, Beyonc\u00e9 said: \u201cI\u2019m not here as a celebrity, I\u2019m not here as a politician. I\u2019m here as a mother \u2026 Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what\u2019s possible with no ceilings, no limitations. \u2026We must vote, and we need you.\u201d Taylor Swift The pop phenom endorsed the Democratic nominee just minutes after the presidential debate in September between Harris and Trump. In an Instagram post published to her 283 million followers, Swift said: \u201cI will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election \u2026 I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\u201d Bruce Springsteen At a Harris rally last month in Philadelphia, \u201cthe Boss\u201d performed his 1978 song The Promised Land and said: \u201cNow, I understand folks have different opinions about things, but this election is about a group of folks who want to fundamentally undermine our American way of life \u2026 On November 5, I\u2019m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \u2013 and I urge all of you who believe in the American dream to join me.\u201d Stevie Wonder The legendary singer endorsed Harris at the Democratic national convention (DNC), saying: \u201cThis is a moment to tell your children where you were and what you did. \u2026 When we stand between history\u2019s pain and tomorrow\u2019s promises, we must choose courage over complacency.\u201d The 74-year old also appeared in a Harris ad alongside the filmdirector Spike Lee. Willie Nelson Country-music original \u201coutlaw\u201d Nelson, 91, performed at Harris\u2019s Houston rally where Beyonc\u00e9 spoke. Wearing a colorful Harris-Walz shirt, Nelson rallied the crowd with: \u201cAre we ready to say Madam President?\u201d Oprah Winfrey The billionaire multimedia executive and former talkshow host was a star of the DNC. Winfrey, who previously endorsed Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, swooped in, saying: \u201cSoon, and very soon, we\u2019re going to be teaching our daughters and sons about how this child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, two idealistic, energetic immigrants \u2026 grew up to become the 47th president of the United States.\u201d Julia Roberts In a new ad last month, the enduring Hollywood A-lister urged the spouses of male supporters of Donald Trump to vote for Harris, saying: \u201cIn the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know \u2026 Remember, what happens in the booth, stays in the booth. Vote Harris-Walz.\u201d Kerry Washington Washington once played the White House communications director on the ABC TV show Scandal. She campaigned for Harris last month in Wisconsin. \u201cYou here in Wisconsin have the capacity to save the soul of this country, to really stand between us and a man who has said that he wants to be a dictator on day one, to stand between us and a man who said he wants generals more like Hitler\u2019s generals,\u201d Washington said to a gathering of Black women. Julia Louis-Dreyfus The Veep star endorsed Harris by making a distinction between her fictional vice-presidential character, Selina Meyer, and Harris. Dreyfus said to MSNBC: \u201cNow, I do want to say one thing about the character I play on Veep\u2026 I play a very, shall we say, almost narcissistic, sociopathic, mega-maniacal type of person \u2026 I am not a Kamala Harris type. I am possibly much more like someone from the other party whose name I shall not even utter.\u201d Jennifer Lopez Jennifer Lopez took to the rally stage in Las Vegas on Thursday to endorse Harris. In a 13-minute speech, Lopez, who is Puerto Rican, railed against comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s racist remarks about Puerto Rico at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last weekend in New York. She said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, it was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character \u2026 There is no candidate in the history of the presidency that is more qualified and there is no job that Kamala Harris can\u2019t do.\u201d Eminem The Detroit rapper and longtime critic of Donald Trump told a Harris rally in his home town: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known. I think Vice-President Harris supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.\u201d Megan Thee Stallion An early endorser, the rapper spoke in Atlantain July, saying: \u201cI want to start off by saying: hotties for Harris.\u201d Performing a compilation of hit songs, the 29-year-old singer said: \u201cWe about to make history with the first female president, the first Black female president.\u201d Bad Bunny The Puerto Rican music star leapt on to Instagram straight after Hinchcliffe\u2019s racist remarks.He posted about Harris criticizing Trump over his handling of relief efforts after Hurricanes Irma and Maria that devastated the island territory in 2017, where she said: \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader.\u201d Samuel L Jackson Addressing a rally of more than 20,000 people in Atlanta last month, the Hollywood A-lister said that Harris was \u201crunning on a proven track record of fighting for the people, standing up to bullies, protecting the most vulnerable and taking on the toughest fights\u2026 That\u2019s the kind of president I can stand behind.\u201d Magic Johnson The former basketball star rallied for Harris in Flint, Michigan, saying: \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019ve known Kamala for over 20 years. Cookie [his wife] and I supported her run for attorney general back in the state of California, her run for senator, and now we support her as the vice-president but now the biggest moment for all of us, November 5, we have to do all we can to elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States.\u201d Usher The rapper said in Atlanta that he was endorsing Harris \u201cbecause she fights for everyone\u2019s rights, for freedom, and it doesn\u2019t matter where you [are] from \u2026 She has a vision for our country that includes everyone, a vision that supports small businesses, invests in our health, in our communities, and gives everyone a chance to get ahead.\u201d Lizzo Another Detroit native, the music star joined Harris there last month, jabbing at Trump\u2019s comment that if Harris wins, the \u201cwhole country will end up being like Detroit\u201d. Lizzo fired back: \u201cProud like Detroit; resilient like Detroit. We\u2019re talking about the same Detroit that innovated the auto industry and the music industry, so put some respect on Detroit\u2019s name.\u201d Tyler Perry The producer and actor endorsed Harris in Atlanta, Georgia, last month, saying: \u201cI stand here, full-throated, with my full chest, begging you, imploring you: let\u2019s get out and make Kamala Harris the 47th president of the United States.\u201d Perry also spoke of the exonerated Central Park Five, men whom Donald Trump once urged to be executed, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve watched him, from the Central Park Five to Project 2025 \u2026 and what I realized is that in this Donald Trump America, there is no dream that looks like me.\u201d Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator actor and former Republican governor of California endorsed Harris just days ago, saying: \u201cI will always be an American before I am a Republican.\u201d He said that if Trump wins, \u201cit will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful\u201d. LeBron James The four-time NBA champion endorsed Kamala Harris just days ago by posting a video showing racist, anti-Hispanic comments made by both Trump and Hinchcliffe. In his caption, the Los Angeles Laker wrote: \u201cWhat are we even talking about here?? When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!\u201d Cardi B Cardi B, who previously defended Harris from political misogyny, spoke at her rally in Milwaukee on Friday.

This week the Fair Work Commission will hear a case brought by the Australian Industry Group asking it to change the safety net for care industries to clarify that hours worked before or after a sleepover count as separate shifts. But unions including the Australian Services Union have warned that sleepovers \u2013 in which an employer requires an employee to be responsible for a particular client and sleep overnight at a premises away from their home \u2013 are not proper rest breaks. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The change would affect people like Bernie, a 58-year-old social worker in out-of-home care for children who has worked in that industry for 39 years. Bernie, who did not want her last name used, is paid a flat rate of $57 for an eight-hour sleepover, which is usually part of a total 20-hour shift, with eight hours worked the day before and four hours the day after.

      "body": "<p>Until recently, most evenings, after my toddler had finally fallen asleep, I would flop on the sofa, turn on Netflix, and watch episode after episode until either my exhaustion or my husband would call time on this pitiful sight. Turning the television off, I\u2019d experience a surge of self-disgust at how dry my eyes felt, and disappointment that the whole evening had disappeared. I would be momentarily stunned by my re-entry into a world in which there were no socially-awkward-but-brilliant private detectives, just a dishwasher that needed loading and a child who would be waking all too soon. I felt crushed by this return to my life (which was odd, because I am fortunate enough to like my life, most of the time).</p> <p>I find it very easy to watch too much TV \u2013 and very difficult to watch the right amount. What is the right amount? I\u2019ve been asking myself this question ever since I picked up an intriguing novel called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/10/butter-by-asako-yuzuki-review-novel-konkatsu-killer-kanae-kijima\">Butter, by Asako Yuzuki</a>, translated by Polly Barton, in which one of the characters asks herself that question.</p> <p>Reading in my too-short lunch break, or during my daughter\u2019s naps, or when I was supposed to be writing this column, was a very different experience from my TV binge. I savoured every page, slowing down to digest not only the delicious descriptions of meals but also the provoking conversations about food and appetite, how much is enough, what it means to eat what you want \u2013 and why we don\u2019t. The novel is about (among many other things) how and why we consume things \u2013 food, journalism, people \u2013 and what kind of consumption makes for a better life. As I came to understand the characters in this novel, I began to understand parts of myself in new ways, too.</p> <p>I started to think more about what was happening as I turned the TV on and my mind turned off \u2013 why I would plan to watch just one episode, but when I came to the end of it, I\u2019d find myself unable to stop. It was as if I had no space in my mind to make any other choice; I was gobbling up episodes without digesting them, without even chewing them over, swallowing each one whole.</p> <p>There is a way of consuming TV, and perhaps everything, that makes it very difficult to feel what the \u201cright amount\u201d is, because it is more about getting away from something, rather than digesting something. TV, like drugs or sex or Instagram, can be used in a way that is more about escaping one\u2019s own mind, rather than exploring and understanding something about humanity and ourselves. It makes me think of a man I once interviewed who was addicted to masturbating, to the point where it almost destroyed his otherwise apparently successful life. He would sit in his office until past midnight, unable to stop. The point was not to climax, but to avoid climaxing, to keep going, on and on and on and on, he explained. \u201cIt was about soothing, escaping \u2026 about being able to meet a need without having intimacy.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, we all need a little escapism every now and then. But if we escape ourselves completely, and for too long, we can lose touch with the ordinary, deeply meaningful moments of our day-to-day lives, such as cooking a nice meal for dinner. Butter is also the story of a woman who discovers her appetite \u2013 and not for food alone \u2013 after making herself a delicious dinner of rice with butter and soy sauce. I have been salivating for that meal ever since reading that passage, but I have not yet made it for myself. Why not?</p> <p>Between my child and my job and my quirky detective TV shows, I have not been very good at cooking. Eating has come to feel like something I do to survive, rather than something I enjoy. I\u2019ve lost my appetite \u2013 not in the sense of not being hungry, but in the sense of losing contact with a part of myself; my appetite for life.</p> <p>Of course, there is no fixed answer to the question \u201cwhat is the right amount?\u201d because it depends on your appetite. It is very easy to know when you\u2019ve had enough if you are in touch with your appetite and can listen to yourself, to acknowledge when your appetite is sated. This is key to building a better life, and it requires being in a particular kind of intimate contact with yourself; a kind of intimate contact that differs in every way from a masturbation addiction.</p> <p>Recently, I decided to have a night off from watching TV. I didn\u2019t turn it on and I was amazed by how much time I had. I tidied the kitchen and felt satisfied by the ordinary, everyday experience of contributing something useful to family life, rather than escaping it. I felt I wanted more evenings like that, and not so many lost in TV. But does it have to be all or nothing? Or can I stay in contact with my appetite and find my way to an amount that feels right?</p> <p>Before I sent this column to my editor, I made myself rice with butter and soy sauce.

The living-room curtain used to be a throw on an old sofa at her parent\u2019s house. \u201cWhen I find something I love, I look after it and keep reusing and reinventing it if I can,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the work was done it was such a relief to have all our things in the right places and not be living around dust, mess and chaos.\u201d Now her focus is on her sheepskin boot and slipper business, launched in 2021 next door to the house. Once a storage and tool shed, it\u2019s now a fully running workshop. \u201cBoth the house and the business are a work in progress, always evolving and changing\u201d, says Xanthe. \u201cAnd colours from the house do seem to be creeping into my designs, so both influence one another.\u2019\u2019 She smiles. xantheanna.uk",

      "body": "<p>Are middle-aged women absolute horndogs and does that make for good box office? That\u2019s what Grazia wondered recently, asking if the film industry is finally \u201c<a href=\"https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/nicole-kidman-sex-scenes-babygirl-thriller/\">embracing midlife sex</a>\u201d. This proposition turns on three films \u2013 two starring Nicole Kidman and one with Anne Hathaway. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jun/28/a-family-affair-review-nicole-kidman-zac-efron-netflix\">A Family Affair</a><em>,</em> Kidman is a writer who starts a relationship with her daughter\u2019s boss, a film star 16 years younger. In the imminent and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/30/babygirl-review-nicole-kidman-overwhelmed-by-lust-as-ceo-having-torrid-and-toxic-affair\">thigh-rubbingly anticipated Babygirl</a>, Kidman\u2019s character, a CEO called Romy, has a torrid affair with an intern. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/may/01/the-idea-of-you-review-anne-hathaway\">The Idea of You</a>, Hathaway\u2019s Sol\u00e8ne starts sleeping with a boyband star after taking her teen daughter to&nbsp;meet him.</p> <p>So, does this constitute a Milf renaissance? Arguably it\u2019s more of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/02/age-gap-movie-romcoms\">a cougar-naissance</a> (to be pedantic), but the point is that there are older women on screen expressing and acting on desire, and this is being represented as transgressive (in a titillating way), but also straightforwardly<em> </em>hot. Especially Babygirl. \u201cRarely do we see midlife women in explicit sex scenes like this,\u201d <a href=\"https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/nicole-kidman-sex-scenes-babygirl-thriller/\">Grazia reports</a> breathlessly, highlighting a scene where Romy masturbates alone after sex with her husband, as well as the playful BDSM dynamic between the leads.</p> <p>This hotness isn\u2019t confined to Hollywood. Miranda July\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/16/all-fours-by-miranda-july-review-larger-than-life\">All Fours</a>, published this spring, is an urgent, messy explosion of midlife lust. \u201cShe masturbates \u2026 approximately 10 times, has sex nine times,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/miranda-july-all-fours-novel-review.html\">The Cut enumerated</a> approvingly of its \u201chornier than a teenage boy\u201d heroine. Actually, though, TV got there first, just more stupidly. Something shifted irrevocably when the sitcom 30 Rock\u2019s fake show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqJNgAP2QnU\">Milf Island</a> was made flesh in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/milf-manor-reactionary-sexist\">horrifying form</a> of Milf Manor last year. The real version featured the eponymous Milfs seducing each other\u2019s adult sons, making it a show so disturbing (and just bad) that viewers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILF_Manor\">described it as \u201cpsychological torture\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Three films might not make a Milf moment, but three films, a novel and a Freudian nightmare of a TV show definitely do. Imagine \u2013 the rich, infinitely various tapestry of human sexuality is apparently so anything-goes, so off-the-wall, that some people even find (thin, conventionally beautiful) older women sexually desirable! Yay, I suppose? I hope it\u2019s not too ungrateful to express ambivalence about culture graciously bestowing fuckability upon us. It just sounds awfully hard work; the kind of endeavour that requires imagination, free time, a sense of adventure and a degree of athleticism that 45 minutes of Body Pump once a fortnight probably won\u2019t provide.</p> <p>Of course, women increasingly expressing and enjoying the possibility, energy, purpose and, yes, desire that post-reproductive life can bring is wonderful. But distorted through the prism of Hollywood, it becomes pressure; something else to put on your to-do list along with worming the cat and querying the standing charge on your water bill. (Neither of those are euphemisms for sex acts. I think.)</p> <p>And, speaking for (or possibly projecting on to) my hormonally depleted sisters, we\u2019re tired already with the basic business of being alive. Not so much Milf as MLF: mothers who are a little fatigued. The world is doing awful things and (OK, now I\u2019m definitely projecting) so are our bodies; please don\u2019t make us wear scratchy cystitis-inducing pants and learn a new BDSM vocabulary. Don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 here\u2019s Kidman on making Babygirl: \u201cThere were times when we were shooting where I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to&nbsp;orgasm any more. Don\u2019t come near me. I hate doing this. I don\u2019t care if I am never touched again in my life! I\u2019m over it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It sounds exhausting. Maybe what she needs, what we all need, is a trip to MLF Island? Come, take my hand, Nicole (actually don\u2019t&nbsp;\u2013 you don\u2019t want to be touched and I respect that). Come to MLF Island, where there will be nap pods, hammocks, Netflix, books, snacks and no obligation to wear a thong bikini.

      "bodyText": "Are middle-aged women absolute horndogs and does that make for good box office? That\u2019s what Grazia wondered recently, asking if the film industry is finally \u201cembracing midlife sex\u201d. This proposition turns on three films \u2013 two starring Nicole Kidman and one with Anne Hathaway. In A Family Affair, Kidman is a writer who starts a relationship with her daughter\u2019s boss, a film star 16 years younger. In the imminent and thigh-rubbingly anticipated Babygirl, Kidman\u2019s character, a CEO called Romy, has a torrid affair with an intern. In The Idea of You, Hathaway\u2019s Sol\u00e8ne starts sleeping with a boyband star after taking her teen daughter to meet him. So, does this constitute a Milf renaissance? Arguably it\u2019s more of a cougar-naissance (to be pedantic), but the point is that there are older women on screen expressing and acting on desire, and this is being represented as transgressive (in a titillating way), but also straightforwardly hot. Especially Babygirl. \u201cRarely do we see midlife women in explicit sex scenes like this,\u201d Grazia reports breathlessly, highlighting a scene where Romy masturbates alone after sex with her husband, as well as the playful BDSM dynamic between the leads. This hotness isn\u2019t confined to Hollywood. Miranda July\u2019s novel All Fours, published this spring, is an urgent, messy explosion of midlife lust. \u201cShe masturbates \u2026 approximately 10 times, has sex nine times,\u201d The Cut enumerated approvingly of its \u201chornier than a teenage boy\u201d heroine. Actually, though, TV got there first, just more stupidly. Something shifted irrevocably when the sitcom 30 Rock\u2019s fake show Milf Island was made flesh in the horrifying form of Milf Manor last year. The real version featured the eponymous Milfs seducing each other\u2019s adult sons, making it a show so disturbing (and just bad) that viewers described it as \u201cpsychological torture\u201d. Three films might not make a Milf moment, but three films, a novel and a Freudian nightmare of a TV show definitely do. Imagine \u2013 the rich, infinitely various tapestry of human sexuality is apparently so anything-goes, so off-the-wall, that some people even find (thin, conventionally beautiful) older women sexually desirable! Yay, I suppose? I hope it\u2019s not too ungrateful to express ambivalence about culture graciously bestowing fuckability upon us. It just sounds awfully hard work; the kind of endeavour that requires imagination, free time, a sense of adventure and a degree of athleticism that 45 minutes of Body Pump once a fortnight probably won\u2019t provide. Of course, women increasingly expressing and enjoying the possibility, energy, purpose and, yes, desire that post-reproductive life can bring is wonderful. But distorted through the prism of Hollywood, it becomes pressure; something else to put on your to-do list along with worming the cat and querying the standing charge on your water bill. (Neither of those are euphemisms for sex acts. I think.) And, speaking for (or possibly projecting on to) my hormonally depleted sisters, we\u2019re tired already with the basic business of being alive. Not so much Milf as MLF: mothers who are a little fatigued. The world is doing awful things and (OK, now I\u2019m definitely projecting) so are our bodies; please don\u2019t make us wear scratchy cystitis-inducing pants and learn a new BDSM vocabulary. Don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 here\u2019s Kidman on making Babygirl: \u201cThere were times when we were shooting where I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to orgasm any more. Don\u2019t come near me. I hate doing this. I don\u2019t care if I am never touched again in my life! I\u2019m over it.\u2019\u201d It sounds exhausting. Maybe what she needs, what we all need, is a trip to MLF Island? Come, take my hand, Nicole (actually don\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be touched and I respect that). Come to MLF Island, where there will be nap pods, hammocks, Netflix, books, snacks and no obligation to wear a thong bikini. Because I think perhaps the most transgressive, all-consuming, panting desire of my demographic is just that: the opportunity to read, watch telly, nap, snack, swim and chat undisturbed.

      "body": "<p>Acting was never an intentional addition to Matty Matheson\u2019s expansive repertoire. At 42, he\u2019s a bona fide, if unconventional, business mogul: chef, restaurateur and food YouTube big-leaguer. He runs 10 successful restaurants across Ontario. One in the US, another coming. Two fashion brands. There\u2019s his farm in Canada. A range of cookware. For years, he was a face of Munchies, Vice\u2019s food vertical. His YouTube channel has 1.5m subscribers. And there are his cookbooks, the third of which \u2013 <em>Soups, Salads, Sandwiches</em> \u2013 we\u2019re primed to discuss. The last two were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. \u201cThe first was my life through a culinary lens,\u201d he says. \u201cThe second, my ode to the great cookbooks: stock, bread, pickles, preserves.\u201d And this one? \u201cIt\u2019s things you make every day.\u201d Maybe chez Matheson:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4idkxlOrOXY\"> deep-fried waffle-breakfast-sandwich with mascarpone, freezer strawberry jam, fried egg and bacon</a> \u2013 not quite standard fare for most of us. He has a full- throttle approach to cooking, as he does to everything. \u201cYou only get one shot,\u201d is his motto, \u201cso why not? That\u2019s how I think about things. Whatever I do, I give my all.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s this attitude Matheson took when Christopher Storer \u2013 international smash-hit series <em>The Bear</em>\u2019s creator, co-showrunner, writer, and director \u2013 called out of the blue. Storer asked: would Matheson consult on his new show? They were prepping for the pilot. Matheson obliged. \u201cI came on as a consultant,\u201d he says, \u201cto share the realities of how people move, how people talk, how people think about food in restaurants. The high intensity moments. Uncompromising lifestyle.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fak has an important role in the show. I\u2019m able to cut tension, add some laughter and lightness </p> <footer> <cite>Matty Matheson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then came the offer of a part. Matheson mulled it over. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t want to act a chef, I knew that. Maybe this funny, sweet handyman\u2026\u201d Neil Fak was born. Three seasons later, he plays one of the show\u2019s most beloved characters. \u201cFak has an important role in the show. I\u2019m able to cut tension. Add some laughter and lightness. A breath every once in a while in all the high intensity.\u201d</p> <p>There are notes of Fak in Matheson. Much like the lovably feckless handyman he plays, he is warm, affable, gentle. On-screen and off, all that\u2019s good is a flurry of \u201csick\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d and \u201choly cows!\u201d His head fills my screen: moustache, thick-rimmed glasses, baseball cap; heavily tattooed shoulders protruding from a white sleeveless vest. He\u2019s Zooming from a Nashville hotel room, ahead of a day shooting his popular recipe videos. When the motion-sensor lights cut, he jigs around to entice them back on, not altogether successfully: Fak-like in flavour. \u201cI don\u2019t have a computer so I\u2019m talking to you from my phone\u201d he explains, \u201cwhich is shoved inside of my hat, inside my toilet-bag, to hold it in place.\u201d Mostly, they dress the same: Matheson often wears his own clothes on set. At aesthetics and sweet nature, however, the similarities end.</p> <p>He arrived in Tennessee direct from two weeks of Emmy engagements in Los Angeles; this year <em>The Bear</em> became the most-nominated comedy series for a single season in the awards\u2019 history. He lives in Ontario. <em>The Bear</em> is filmed in Chicago. Tomorrow, he\u2019s driving to Kentucky. It sounds\u2026 a lot? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replies. \u201cI do have a lot of different things going on. I\u2019m never anywhere longer than four or five days. It\u2019s hectic.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to articulate without making myself sound like a fucking asshole; everyone is busy. Everyone works. It\u2019s just, I am the thing in my work. I\u2019m the brand. So I\u2019m moved about: a goat on a rope, getting dragged around town.\u201d</p>    <p>Shepherding him is a small, tight-knit team, with bonds that go way back. His chief financial officer, Lisa, was a server at his first Toronto restaurant. \u201cWe have the sickest little crew. We got fucked up in our 20s. Had a blast. Now we fly around the world and make shit. There\u2019s no fluff. No VC money. No bullshit or board. Me and my friends \u2013 my partners, really \u2013 run the show. We\u2019re not some Hollywood thing: we\u2019re homegrown.\u201d</p> <p>Home is back in Fort Erie, on the US/Canada border, a 10-minute drive from the house he was raised in. \u201cBack in my day,\u201d he reminisces, \u201cit was factories, strip clubs, bingo halls, Chinese restaurants. Americans would come to party. I come from a very working-class family. Two brothers, a sister, loving parents.\u201d Both worked in factories. \u201cMy mom is a shit-shoveller; nothing was below her. She still works as a diner server, because she wants to, and loves the job. My parents instilled in me to never ask anyone for anything. It\u2019s embedded.\u201d</p> <p>His was a rural rearing. \u201cAll hanging out in the woods and BMX-ing, jumping in the river off train bridges and getting into trouble.\u201d What sort of trouble? \u201cJust stuff,\u201d he suggests, giggling coyly. \u201cYou know, small-town stuff: smashing cars into buildings and breaking shit, going to parties, getting into fights and running from cops\u2026 sometimes getting caught. Nights in jail cells. In cities, it\u2019s like: why are you on our block? Well, for us, it was: why are you in our woods? Then you\u2019d fight.\u201d</p> <p>Socially, Matheson thrived in high school. Academically, less so. \u201cI was the class clown,\u201d he says, \u201cthe funny guy. I wasn\u2019t into sports, or school, or anything. Just getting fucked up with my friends.\u201d He met his now-wife Trish in 10th grade. They have three children. \u201cShe\u2019s a real road-dog,\u201d he says, lovingly. \u201cA beast, a phenomenal mother and an amazing partner. There\u2019ve been really tough patches, but through the crazy times, we always loved each other more than not. She\u2019s my soulmate. My forever.\u201d</p> <p>Back then, term-times were spent in constant negotiation with teachers. \u201cI just wanted to pass,\u201d he explains, \u201cthe least I gotta do to get 50%. Even when in trouble with the principal I\u2019d haggle: you don\u2019t like me, I don\u2019t like you. If I fail, I\u2019ve gotta be here longer. I ain\u2019t gonna be a doctor or a scientist. I\u2019m not going to be anything. So get me out.\u201d</p>    <p>College wasn\u2019t on the cards. \u201cI was good with what my life would be: stay in Erie, work in the factory, get my truck and drive around. Drink beer and smoke smokes.\u201d Still, aged 18, he hankered for a stint in the city. \u201cCooking school was the only course I had the grades for. I thought I could do it.\u201d His grandfather was a chef, with a restaurant out east on Prince Edward Island. \u201cI loved going there as a kid. It\u2019s a romantic starting point, maybe, for storytelling about me and food, but honestly [cooking school] was just a means to get to Toronto and watch punk shows.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he thrived at Humber Polytechnic. \u201cI fell in love with cooking. And education, to be honest: I was finally good at something. I got confident.\u201d Kitchens made sense to him. \u201cI was getting good grades \u2013 I could make fucking stock, p\u00e2t\u00e9 and hollandaise; debone a quail and sharpen a knife. I had a knack, a natural ability. Well, until I stopped going.\u201d He dropped out a few weeks before graduation to go on tour with his friends\u2019 death metal band.</p> <p>Back in Toronto, he worked his way up through some of the city\u2019s top establishments. He made a name for himself, diploma-less. \u201cEither you can cook a restaurant\u2019s food,\u201d he says, \u201cor you can\u2019t. It\u2019s sink or swim. You can\u2019t fake it. And I swam: I was a very good line cook.\u201d</p> <p>Through his 20s, he worked and played hard. \u201cAll the industry clich\u00e9s are real,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of drinking and doing drugs. You finish work at 12.30am, 1am, then all of us go ripping around the city on bikes with backpacks full of beer, wine and vodka, going to our friends\u2019 bars, or last-calls at restaurants.\u201d He could feel his world expanding. \u201cPeople from every walk of life worked in these restaurants,\u201d he says. \u201cI really opened up to things. Growing up, I was friends with different circles, but it was a small town; variations of white kids. Now, I was going to underground jazz bars and hanging out with 50-year-old gay dudes. Eating Sri Lankan food for the first time. A pho. Vietnam!\u201d</p>    <p>It sounds fun, I suggest. He shrugs. \u201cIt was,\u201d he says, \u201cthe best times of my life. A group of friends you work hard with, in these pumping places, and every night is the Super Bowl. Professionally, he mostly held things together. \u201cEven at my craziest moments of drinking and drugs,\u201d he\u2019s certain, \u201cI always showed up for work. I could go hard until six, eight in the morning. As long as I got two or three hours sleep, I was good.\u201d He opened his first restaurant, Parts and Labour, aged 26. Critics raved. Punters, too. Work stepped up a gear \u2013 as did the partying: alcohol and cocaine, but not exclusively. \u201cLive like that for 10 years? You get kinda burnt.\u201d A heart attack: he was 29 years old.</p> <p>\u201cIt was after long years of going at it,\u201d he explains, \u201cI went to bed Saturday night, and woke up Sunday thinking I was having one. I went to the hospital: I\u2019d had a heart attack in my sleep.\u201d For two months, maybe three, he slowed down. Partied less. Cooled a little. \u201cBut after that? I turned it back up. I was spun out by it all, and went even harder for like a year. My friends banned me from their bars \u2013 they were looking out for me. All my drug dealers, too \u2013 they were my friends, my homies \u2013 so they cut me off. I put myself in different, difficult situations. I didn\u2019t want to be seen or embarrassed or anyone to know who I was. I stopped going where I was known, and started disappearing, fading into the sketch zone. Doing things and hanging out with people I wouldn\u2019t otherwise, to use [drugs]. By the end, it was affecting everything. I was a maniac.\u201d</p> <p>It took an intervention. The weekend of 12 November 2013. Friday lunchtime, Matheson, drunk, walked into his own restaurant and scrapped with his business partners. It got ugly. The next day, one suggested meeting for coffee. Matheson was driven to a house where a group of his nearest and dearest had gathered. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have friends who cared about me,\u201d he says, \u201cand I was in a place where I could listen. Then the miracle happened: I went to a meeting. I\u2019d never been to one before, never tried to get clean or sober. I found this family of sickos who were trying to get better. I loved it. And I haven\u2019t had a drip drop since.\u201d Deep breath. \u201cAnd from then it was like: what\u2019s the full potential? We get one life. We\u2019re not living for tomorrow \u2013 what can we do today?\u201d</p>    <p>Small steps, first. He made a list of all his debts and hung it in his and Trish\u2019s bedroom. \u201cI was adamant I\u2019d pay back all my friends, and drug dealers, and drug-dealer-friends: to never be dependent on anyone or anything.\u201d Vice\u2019s food output was in its infancy then. The timing was perfect. \u201cMy first video was making a cheeseburger, and I got $500. I made in a day what I used to make in a week. I was a chef, then every two, three weeks, I\u2019d do a video. I was good at it.\u201d He cleared all debts within a year. \u201cThen I had to figure out how to become completely independent and make the right decisions for myself. I saved a year\u2019s worth of bills and rent\u2026 From there, I quit everything, walked away from all the restaurants I was involved in, and started building this world.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>On set in Chicago,</strong></em> Matheson was tasked with bringing <em>The Bear</em> to life, initially, as an operation on the brink. \u201cWhen I showed up,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was a lot of food in the walk-in. Too many pans. Yo, I said, we gotta get rid. They wouldn\u2019t have the money. I worked with the set dec and prop team to pull things back: a couple of spoons. A few pots. Just enough jardini\u00e8re to get by.\u201d He advised on movement. \u201cThe way people navigate through the kitchen; how a chef would look at things; where your hands are; walking with purpose. How experienced chefs would know this, others wouldn\u2019t.\u201d As seasons \u2013 and menus \u2013 developed, precision felt no less pertinent: unrelenting, explosive, electric; a chorus of \u201cYes chef\u2019s\u201d and \u201c<em>Hands!</em>\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This ain\u2019t nothing compared to the fears and anxieties that I used to have, even if I still have lots of them </p> <footer> <cite>Matty Matheson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe kitchen is always set up so we could actually make everything on the menu, however briefly \u2013 if at all \u2013 it\u2019s caught on camera. The walk-ins stocked. The kit there. All the mise en place they\u2019d need for service. Just so anyone watching \u2013 anyone acting \u2013 felt it was real. Not just a bunch of carrots for show. Still, he\u2019s keen to make clear, \u201cI\u2019ve never worked in a kitchen like that one, so in trouble and divided. In fact, <em>The Bear</em> makes me even prouder of how we run our restaurants.\u201d</p> <p>It took a while to find his acting feet. \u201cI\u2019m unscripted, usually; I\u2019m not scared of standing in front of a camera riffing. Acting isn\u2019t like that. On the first season especially, everyone gave me so much support. Jeremy [Allen White] would run lines with me. Ayo [Edebri] would work through timings\u2026\u201d The advice flowed. \u201cEbon [Moss Bachrach] would tell me to have more dignity with a scene: stop acting, and be yourself. Find the character.\u201d Matheson offered up nuances to the cast of the restaurant world in return. \u201cIt was a really sweet reciprocal.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, that\u2019s how Jeremy Allen White sees it. First with plot. \u201cSo much of what happens in the kitchen,\u201d Allen White tells me, \u201ccomes from Matty. Things that may seem ludicrous are real things that have happened in his storied career. He shaped the bigger picture.\u201d Matheson\u2019s guidance is also central to Allen White\u2019s Emmy-winning performance. \u201cMy physicality, the pressure and high-stakes, camaraderie, Matty guided me. Early on, I asked him to interrupt me in a scene if anything I did looked strange or goofy. He did frequently, which was invaluable. When I felt uncomfortable, sometimes, being as emotional, or as physical, as the script called for, he could explain the reality.\u201d Fak\u2019s role has expanded through the seasons, as has Matheson\u2019s confidence. \u201cMatty oozes charisma,\u201d Allen White continues. \u201cYou want to be around him. To watch and laugh with him. He\u2019s grown so much in these last couple of years. It\u2019s clear why the writers have given him more. Plus, he\u2019s the greatest guy who\u2019ll do anything he can to promote success in others: in this industry, that\u2019s rare.\u201d</p>    <p>Few episodes of television are as perfect as \u201cFishes\u201d, <em>The Bear</em>\u2019s exhausting, exhilarating season-two flashback episode, which guest-starred a host of Hollywood heavyweights. At this year\u2019s Emmys, it alone gained nine nominations, winning four, including gongs for Jon Bernthal and Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cWe were all pinching ourselves,\u201d Matheson says, of filming it. \u201cWe\u2019d shoot a scene, then be like, woah: this is happening. We could feel it \u2013 once in a lifetime. During the fight scene at the end, I had to keep holding Bernthal back. Him flipping the table was nuts \u2013 he wasn\u2019t supposed to do that the way he did. It was filled with real glass and everything.\u201d It was shot over just four days on location. Two houses were rented: one for filming, another, where the cast relaxed between scenes. In season three, he and Lee Curtis are reunited in a particularly tender scene. She remembers shooting it fondly. \u201cWe spent five hours waiting for darkness,\u201d she tells me, \u201cand really got to know each other\u2026 a magic time that I will never forget.\u201d</p> <p>Matheson is enjoying the acting, for now. There\u2019ll be more Fak, definitely. \u201cMaking <em>The Bear</em> is like, the greatest,\u201d he says. \u201cFour years in, we love each other like siblings. I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019m great at acting, but I like doing it with these guys\u2026 And well, that\u2019s fire. I\u2019m doing a couple of auditions, because why not? Honestly, that\u2019s how I feel: I\u2019m self-sufficient. I\u2019m not doing it for fame, or money, it would be to do something cool that makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen,\u201d he adds, \u201call of this is also addiction. I\u2019ve an addictive personality \u2013 I\u2019m a drug addict and alcoholic. It\u2019s all void-filling and wanting and adding to the nothingness of our souls.\u201d It\u2019s why, Matheson believes, he does so much. \u201cThis ain\u2019t nothing compared to the fears and the anxieties I used to have, even if I still have lots of them. I have a beautiful family, and I can provide for them. That\u2019s the greatest thing in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Soups, Salads, Sandwiches by Matty Matheson (Murdoch Books, \u00a325).

      "bodyText": "Acting was never an intentional addition to Matty Matheson\u2019s expansive repertoire. At 42, he\u2019s a bona fide, if unconventional, business mogul: chef, restaurateur and food YouTube big-leaguer. He runs 10 successful restaurants across Ontario. One in the US, another coming. Two fashion brands. There\u2019s his farm in Canada. A range of cookware. For years, he was a face of Munchies, Vice\u2019s food vertical. His YouTube channel has 1.5m subscribers. And there are his cookbooks, the third of which \u2013 Soups, Salads, Sandwiches \u2013 we\u2019re primed to discuss. The last two were New York Times bestsellers. \u201cThe first was my life through a culinary lens,\u201d he says. \u201cThe second, my ode to the great cookbooks: stock, bread, pickles, preserves.\u201d And this one? \u201cIt\u2019s things you make every day.\u201d Maybe chez Matheson: deep-fried waffle-breakfast-sandwich with mascarpone, freezer strawberry jam, fried egg and bacon \u2013 not quite standard fare for most of us. He has a full- throttle approach to cooking, as he does to everything. \u201cYou only get one shot,\u201d is his motto, \u201cso why not? That\u2019s how I think about things. Whatever I do, I give my all.\u201d It\u2019s this attitude Matheson took when Christopher Storer \u2013 international smash-hit series The Bear\u2019s creator, co-showrunner, writer, and director \u2013 called out of the blue. Storer asked: would Matheson consult on his new show? They were prepping for the pilot. Matheson obliged. \u201cI came on as a consultant,\u201d he says, \u201cto share the realities of how people move, how people talk, how people think about food in restaurants. The high intensity moments. Uncompromising lifestyle.\u201d Then came the offer of a part. Matheson mulled it over. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t want to act a chef, I knew that. Maybe this funny, sweet handyman\u2026\u201d Neil Fak was born. Three seasons later, he plays one of the show\u2019s most beloved characters. \u201cFak has an important role in the show. I\u2019m able to cut tension. Add some laughter and lightness. A breath every once in a while in all the high intensity.\u201d There are notes of Fak in Matheson. Much like the lovably feckless handyman he plays, he is warm, affable, gentle. On-screen and off, all that\u2019s good is a flurry of \u201csick\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d and \u201choly cows!\u201d His head fills my screen: moustache, thick-rimmed glasses, baseball cap; heavily tattooed shoulders protruding from a white sleeveless vest. He\u2019s Zooming from a Nashville hotel room, ahead of a day shooting his popular recipe videos. When the motion-sensor lights cut, he jigs around to entice them back on, not altogether successfully: Fak-like in flavour. \u201cI don\u2019t have a computer so I\u2019m talking to you from my phone\u201d he explains, \u201cwhich is shoved inside of my hat, inside my toilet-bag, to hold it in place.\u201d Mostly, they dress the same: Matheson often wears his own clothes on set. At aesthetics and sweet nature, however, the similarities end. He arrived in Tennessee direct from two weeks of Emmy engagements in Los Angeles; this year The Bear became the most-nominated comedy series for a single season in the awards\u2019 history. He lives in Ontario. The Bear is filmed in Chicago. Tomorrow, he\u2019s driving to Kentucky. It sounds\u2026 a lot? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replies. \u201cI do have a lot of different things going on. I\u2019m never anywhere longer than four or five days. It\u2019s hectic.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to articulate without making myself sound like a fucking asshole; everyone is busy. Everyone works. It\u2019s just, I am the thing in my work. I\u2019m the brand. So I\u2019m moved about: a goat on a rope, getting dragged around town.\u201d Shepherding him is a small, tight-knit team, with bonds that go way back. His chief financial officer, Lisa, was a server at his first Toronto restaurant. \u201cWe have the sickest little crew. We got fucked up in our 20s. Had a blast. Now we fly around the world and make shit. There\u2019s no fluff. No VC money. No bullshit or board. Me and my friends \u2013 my partners, really \u2013 run the show. We\u2019re not some Hollywood thing: we\u2019re homegrown.\u201d Home is back in Fort Erie, on the US/Canada border, a 10-minute drive from the house he was raised in. \u201cBack in my day,\u201d he reminisces, \u201cit was factories, strip clubs, bingo halls, Chinese restaurants. Americans would come to party. I come from a very working-class family. Two brothers, a sister, loving parents.\u201d Both worked in factories. \u201cMy mom is a shit-shoveller; nothing was below her. She still works as a diner server, because she wants to, and loves the job. My parents instilled in me to never ask anyone for anything. It\u2019s embedded.\u201d His was a rural rearing. \u201cAll hanging out in the woods and BMX-ing, jumping in the river off train bridges and getting into trouble.\u201d What sort of trouble? \u201cJust stuff,\u201d he suggests, giggling coyly. \u201cYou know, small-town stuff: smashing cars into buildings and breaking shit, going to parties, getting into fights and running from cops\u2026 sometimes getting caught. Nights in jail cells. In cities, it\u2019s like: why are you on our block? Well, for us, it was: why are you in our woods? Then you\u2019d fight.\u201d Socially, Matheson thrived in high school.

Just getting fucked up with my friends.\u201d He met his now-wife Trish in 10th grade. They have three children. \u201cShe\u2019s a real road-dog,\u201d he says, lovingly. \u201cA beast, a phenomenal mother and an amazing partner. There\u2019ve been really tough patches, but through the crazy times, we always loved each other more than not. She\u2019s my soulmate. My forever.\u201d Back then, term-times were spent in constant negotiation with teachers. \u201cI just wanted to pass,\u201d he explains, \u201cthe least I gotta do to get 50%. Even when in trouble with the principal I\u2019d haggle: you don\u2019t like me, I don\u2019t like you. If I fail, I\u2019ve gotta be here longer. I ain\u2019t gonna be a doctor or a scientist. I\u2019m not going to be anything. So get me out.\u201d College wasn\u2019t on the cards. \u201cI was good with what my life would be: stay in Erie, work in the factory, get my truck and drive around. Drink beer and smoke smokes.\u201d Still, aged 18, he hankered for a stint in the city. \u201cCooking school was the only course I had the grades for.

And education, to be honest: I was finally good at something. I got confident.\u201d Kitchens made sense to him. \u201cI was getting good grades \u2013 I could make fucking stock, p\u00e2t\u00e9 and hollandaise; debone a quail and sharpen a knife. I had a knack, a natural ability. Well, until I stopped going.\u201d He dropped out a few weeks before graduation to go on tour with his friends\u2019 death metal band. Back in Toronto, he worked his way up through some of the city\u2019s top establishments. He made a name for himself, diploma-less. \u201cEither you can cook a restaurant\u2019s food,\u201d he says, \u201cor you can\u2019t. It\u2019s sink or swim. You can\u2019t fake it. And I swam: I was a very good line cook.\u201d Through his 20s, he worked and played hard. \u201cAll the industry clich\u00e9s are real,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of drinking and doing drugs. You finish work at 12.30am, 1am, then all of us go ripping around the city on bikes with backpacks full of beer, wine and vodka, going to our friends\u2019 bars, or last-calls at restaurants.\u201d He could feel his world expanding. \u201cPeople from every walk of life worked in these restaurants,\u201d he says. \u201cI really opened up to things.

You get kinda burnt.\u201d A heart attack: he was 29 years old. \u201cIt was after long years of going at it,\u201d he explains, \u201cI went to bed Saturday night, and woke up Sunday thinking I was having one. I went to the hospital: I\u2019d had a heart attack in my sleep.\u201d For two months, maybe three, he slowed down. Partied less. Cooled a little. \u201cBut after that? I turned it back up. I was spun out by it all, and went even harder for like a year. My friends banned me from their bars \u2013 they were looking out for me. All my drug dealers, too \u2013 they were my friends, my homies \u2013 so they cut me off. I put myself in different, difficult situations. I didn\u2019t want to be seen or embarrassed or anyone to know who I was. I stopped going where I was known, and started disappearing, fading into the sketch zone. Doing things and hanging out with people I wouldn\u2019t otherwise, to use [drugs]. By the end, it was affecting everything. I was a maniac.\u201d It took an intervention. The weekend of 12 November 2013. Friday lunchtime, Matheson, drunk, walked into his own restaurant and scrapped with his business partners. It got ugly. The next day, one suggested meeting for coffee. Matheson was driven to a house where a group of his nearest and dearest had gathered. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have friends who cared about me,\u201d he says, \u201cand I was in a place where I could listen. Then the miracle happened: I went to a meeting. I\u2019d never been to one before, never tried to get clean or sober. I found this family of sickos who were trying to get better. I loved it. And I haven\u2019t had a drip drop since.\u201d Deep breath. \u201cAnd from then it was like: what\u2019s the full potential? We get one life. We\u2019re not living for tomorrow \u2013 what can we do today?\u201d Small steps, first. He made a list of all his debts and hung it in his and Trish\u2019s bedroom. \u201cI was adamant I\u2019d pay back all my friends, and drug dealers, and drug-dealer-friends: to never be dependent on anyone or anything.\u201d Vice\u2019s food output was in its infancy then. The timing was perfect. \u201cMy first video was making a cheeseburger, and I got $500. I made in a day what I used to make in a week. I was a chef, then every two, three weeks, I\u2019d do a video. I was good at it.\u201d He cleared all debts within a year. \u201cThen I had to figure out how to become completely independent and make the right decisions for myself. I saved a year\u2019s worth of bills and rent\u2026 From there, I quit everything, walked away from all the restaurants I was involved in, and started building this world.\u201d On set in Chicago, Matheson was tasked with bringing The Bear to life, initially, as an operation on the brink. \u201cWhen I showed up,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was a lot of food in the walk-in. Too many pans. Yo, I said, we gotta get rid. They wouldn\u2019t have the money. I worked with the set dec and prop team to pull things back: a couple of spoons. A few pots. Just enough jardini\u00e8re to get by.\u201d He advised on movement. \u201cThe way people navigate through the kitchen; how a chef would look at things; where your hands are; walking with purpose. How experienced chefs would know this, others wouldn\u2019t.\u201d As seasons \u2013 and menus \u2013 developed, precision felt no less pertinent: unrelenting, explosive, electric; a chorus of \u201cYes chef\u2019s\u201d and \u201cHands!\u201d \u201cThe kitchen is always set up so we could actually make everything on the menu, however briefly \u2013 if at all \u2013 it\u2019s caught on camera. The walk-ins stocked. The kit there. All the mise en place they\u2019d need for service. Just so anyone watching \u2013 anyone acting \u2013 felt it was real. Not just a bunch of carrots for show. Still, he\u2019s keen to make clear, \u201cI\u2019ve never worked in a kitchen like that one, so in trouble and divided. In fact, The Bear makes me even prouder of how we run our restaurants.\u201d It took a while to find his acting feet. \u201cI\u2019m unscripted, usually; I\u2019m not scared of standing in front of a camera riffing. Acting isn\u2019t like that. On the first season especially, everyone gave me so much support. Jeremy [Allen White] would run lines with me. Ayo [Edebri] would work through timings\u2026\u201d The advice flowed. \u201cEbon [Moss Bachrach] would tell me to have more dignity with a scene: stop acting, and be yourself. Find the character.\u201d Matheson offered up nuances to the cast of the restaurant world in return. \u201cIt was a really sweet reciprocal.\u201d Certainly, that\u2019s how Jeremy Allen White sees it. First with plot. \u201cSo much of what happens in the kitchen,\u201d Allen White tells me, \u201ccomes from Matty. Things that may seem ludicrous are real things that have happened in his storied career. He shaped the bigger picture.\u201d Matheson\u2019s guidance is also central to Allen White\u2019s Emmy-winning performance. \u201cMy physicality, the pressure and high-stakes, camaraderie, Matty guided me. Early on, I asked him to interrupt me in a scene if anything I did looked strange or goofy. He did frequently, which was invaluable. When I felt uncomfortable, sometimes, being as emotional, or as physical, as the script called for, he could explain the reality.\u201d Fak\u2019s role has expanded through the seasons, as has Matheson\u2019s confidence. \u201cMatty oozes charisma,\u201d Allen White continues. \u201cYou want to be around him. To watch and laugh with him. He\u2019s grown so much in these last couple of years. It\u2019s clear why the writers have given him more. Plus, he\u2019s the greatest guy who\u2019ll do anything he can to promote success in others: in this industry, that\u2019s rare.\u201d Few episodes of television are as perfect as \u201cFishes\u201d, The Bear\u2019s exhausting, exhilarating season-two flashback episode, which guest-starred a host of Hollywood heavyweights. At this year\u2019s Emmys, it alone gained nine nominations, winning four, including gongs for Jon Bernthal and Jamie Lee Curtis. \u201cWe were all pinching ourselves,\u201d Matheson says, of filming it. \u201cWe\u2019d shoot a scene, then be like, woah: this is happening. We could feel it \u2013 once in a lifetime. During the fight scene at the end, I had to keep holding Bernthal back. Him flipping the table was nuts \u2013 he wasn\u2019t supposed to do that the way he did. It was filled with real glass and everything.\u201d It was shot over just four days on location. Two houses were rented: one for filming, another, where the cast relaxed between scenes. In season three, he and Lee Curtis are reunited in a particularly tender scene. She remembers shooting it fondly. \u201cWe spent five hours waiting for darkness,\u201d she tells me, \u201cand really got to know each other\u2026 a magic time that I will never forget.\u201d Matheson is enjoying the acting, for now. There\u2019ll be more Fak, definitely. \u201cMaking The Bear is like, the greatest,\u201d he says. \u201cFour years in, we love each other like siblings. I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019m great at acting, but I like doing it with these guys\u2026 And well, that\u2019s fire. I\u2019m doing a couple of auditions, because why not? Honestly, that\u2019s how I feel: I\u2019m self-sufficient. I\u2019m not doing it for fame, or money, it would be to do something cool that makes sense.\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d he adds, \u201call of this is also addiction. I\u2019ve an addictive personality \u2013 I\u2019m a drug addict and alcoholic. It\u2019s all void-filling and wanting and adding to the nothingness of our souls.\u201d It\u2019s why, Matheson believes, he does so much. \u201cThis ain\u2019t nothing compared to the fears and the anxieties I used to have, even if I still have lots of them. I have a beautiful family, and I can provide for them. That\u2019s the greatest thing in the world.\u201d Soups, Salads, Sandwiches by Matty Matheson (Murdoch Books, \u00a325).

      "body": "<h2>The Voice Inside by John Farnham</h2> <p><em>Memoir, Hachette, $49.99</em></p>    <p>Most Australians would assume they know everything they need to know about John Farnham, possibly our best living singer, given his living-legend status and <em>that</em> song\u2019s ubiquity. But Farnham is a man who prizes privacy and he has largely kept his cards close to his chest \u2013 until just three years ago, when he allowed film-maker Poppy Stockell to make a documentary about him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy talking about myself, I really don\u2019t,\u201d his new memoir, written with Stockell, opens. But what follows is a surprisingly fascinating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/28/john-farnham-opens-up-about-his-abusive-and-sexually-aggressive-first-manager\">and rather brave account</a> that gives us the first real window into the singer\u2019s mind. <em>\u2013 Sian Cain</em></p> <h2>Theory and Practice by Michelle de Kretser</h2> <p><em>Fiction, Text Publishing, $32.99</em></p>    <p>Theory is a swirling eddy that chews you up and spits you out: both exciting and intimidating, it can heighten our attention to the gulf between ideals and real-world actions. It\u2019s in this gap that Michelle de Kretser\u2019s new novel takes place. Narrated by a young woman living in St Kilda in the 1980s, it grapples with no less than jealousy, colonialism and racism, patriarchy, relationships, motherhood and the towering figure of Virginia Woolf \u2013 our intellectual, literary \u201cWoolfmother\u201d.</p> <p>Formally inventive, drily funny, this novel is a stellar accomplishment, artfully articulating the lived experience of the innocuous \u201cand\u201d of its title \u2013 a bridge that \u201cmakes the transition from theory to practice seem effortless\u201d (which is rarely, if ever, the case). <em>\u2013 Jack Callil</em></p> <h2>Highways and Byways by Jimmy Barnes</h2> <p><em>Memoir/short fiction, HarperCollins Australia, $45</em></p>    <p>In the Cold Chisel singer\u2019s fourth autobiographical book, which this time also includes some short fiction, Barnes revisits some previously told yarns, this time holding each gem up to the light for a more detailed, reflective inspection. He\u2019s a compassionate narrator, whether he\u2019s interrogating his own childhood or writing short stories about others.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>In the story Sacred Heart, pensioner Mary yearns for human connection but is too slow in opening the safety lock to catch a glimpse of the grocery delivery boy. And in Shirley Knott, about a Darlinghurst drag queen: \u201cCountry town prejudices had forced her to fight all her life. She had become hardened beyond belief by the time she learned to sew her own sequins on her first dress.\u201d <em>\u2013 Jenny Valentish</em></p> <h2>Squat by John Safran</h2> <p><em>Nonfiction, Penguin Australia, $36.99</em></p>    <p>When we were told John Safran had written a book about squatting in rapper Kanye West\u2019s mansion for a week, our first response was: of course he has. Our nation\u2019s most famous professional provocateur is back with a new book that opens with him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/22/my-week-at-kanyes-john-safran-on-his-time-squatting-in-the-rappers-mansion\">slipping into West\u2019s now-abandoned home</a> \u2013 but its about much more than that.</p> <p>Safran became interested in West after his spate of antisemitic outbursts in 2022, and uses that interest as a jumping off point to explore the history between Black and Jewish Americans. He interviews rabbis, pastors, Black Hebrew Israelites, Orthodox Jews, Holocaust deniers and more to tell a story that is \u2013 as always with Safran \u2013 far more complex and interesting than we first understood.<em> \u2013 SC</em></p> <h2>Tony Tan\u2019s Asian Cooking Class</h2> <p><em>Cookbook, Murdoch Books, $59.99</em></p>    <p>It is hugely ambitious to title a cookbook as \u201cAsian\u201d. Charmaine Solomon did it with The Complete Asian Cookbook in the 1970s, when cuisines from the continent were less known to white Australian audiences. But what makes this book by Tony Tan \u2013 a prolific Malaysian-born, Victoria-based writer, teacher and chef \u2013 so satisfying is his curiosity, reverence and respect for cuisines that are not of his Hainanese heritage.</p> <p>There are recipes, personal stories and historical context for nasi biryani, khao pad sapparot (Thai fried rice with pineapple) and b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n<strong> </strong>(Vietnamese rice noodle rolls). And there is playfulness, with dishes like whole-roasted char siu cauliflower or cheesecake with fermented tofu. The elegant, moody photography and food styling by Mark Roper and Lee Blaylock deserves a special mention too. <em>\u2013 Yvonne C Lam</em></p> <h2>Australian Gospel by Lech Blaine</h2> <p><em>Memoir, Black Inc, $36.99</em></p>    <p>Australian Gospel tells the story of two Australian families whose lives overlapped for decades: the Shelleys and the Blaines. It is a sensational tale that is close to home for author Lech Blaine, and it is to his enormous credit that he tells it with compassion, intelligence and wit.</p> <p>Australian Gospel is a captivating work of narrative nonfiction, at once a tremendously moving story of family life, and a profound meditation on family-making and the legacies of love, grief and trauma that get passed from one generation to the next. <em>\u2013 Catriona Menzies-Pike</em></p> <h2>Max Dupain by Helen Ennis</h2> <p><em>Biography, 4th Estate, $55</em></p>    <p>As an artist, Max Dupain was \u2013 and remains \u2013 that rare beast, a household name, primarily because he\u2019s the photographer behind the iconic Sunbaker (1938), which depicts a young man lying face-down on a beach. In this compassionate but not uncritical biography, Helen Ennis, Australia\u2019s pre-eminent writer on art photography, unmasks Dupain and discovers someone who was riddled with contradictions and doubt.</p> <p>Ennis is also the writer of the award-winning biography of Olive Cotton, who was a photographer of great ability herself and a childhood friend to Dupain, before becoming his first wife. Despite his phenomenal success, Dupain comes across as the more fragile of the two. Highly illuminating. <em>\u2013 Nigel Featherstone</em></p> <h2>Leave the Girls Behind by Jacqueline Bublitz</h2> <p><em>Fiction, Allen &amp; Unwin, $34.99</em></p>    <p>Unlike its title, Jacqueline Bublitz\u2019s second novel leaves no girls behind. Its ambition to weave together a string of girls across the past and the present \u2013 one missing, some dead, some ignored and others obsessed over \u2013 makes it initially a tough story to crack.</p> <p>But stick with it: Bublitz\u2019s flawed, amateur detective protagonist, Ruth, has such a strong personal stake in the investigation that its impossible not to get swept up in her enthusiasm. Beyond the tangle of the novel\u2019s opening pages is a smart, gripping (albeit deeply unsettling) read. <em>\u2013 Bec Kavanagh</em></p> <h2>The Thinning by Inga Simpson</h2> <p><em>Fiction, Hachette, $32.99</em></p>    <p>Fin Kelvin must travel from the Warrumbungles across the Pilliga in time for the solar eclipse and send a laser signal to her mother. Why? She has no idea. The world around Fin is changing too fast for her to make sense of anything.</p> <p>Inga Simpson\u2019s taut, melancholic thriller registers the profound losses of the climate crisis through the experience of a traumatised teenager. Simpson projects a vision of life on a planet on the brink of systems collapse that is terrifying but all too recognisable. It\u2019s a terrific read, attentive to the cosmic and the microscopic, with the action propelled by the competing energies of light and darkness. <em>\u2013 CMP</em></p> <h2>Unlovable by Darren Hayes</h2> <p><em>Memoir, Penguin, $36.99</em></p>    <p>The former Savage Garden frontman truly tells all here, writing about growing up in Queensland with a loving mother and an abusive father; about the insanities of fame during his time in Savage Garden; and his painful falling out with bandmate Daniel Jones. (Hayes\u2019s hurt and frustration about the way their band ended is palpable.)</p> <p>Throughout Hayes returns to the burden of homophobia and what it does to gay kids, which is painful and moving. In one chapter Hayes, who briefly married a woman, recounts calling Lifeline after realising he was attracted to men; in another he learns how to have gay sex from an STD clinic doctor, having believed his first \u201cvery vanilla\u201d same-sex encounter must have given him HIV. <em>\u2013 SC</em></p>",

Australian Gospel is a captivating work of narrative nonfiction, at once a tremendously moving story of family life, and a profound meditation on family-making and the legacies of love, grief and trauma that get passed from one generation to the next. \u2013 Catriona Menzies-Pike Max Dupain by Helen Ennis Biography, 4th Estate, $55 As an artist, Max Dupain was \u2013 and remains \u2013 that rare beast, a household name, primarily because he\u2019s the photographer behind the iconic Sunbaker (1938), which depicts a young man lying face-down on a beach. In this compassionate but not uncritical biography, Helen Ennis, Australia\u2019s pre-eminent writer on art photography, unmasks Dupain and discovers someone who was riddled with contradictions and doubt. Ennis is also the writer of the award-winning biography of Olive Cotton, who was a photographer of great ability herself and a childhood friend to Dupain, before becoming his first wife. Despite his phenomenal success, Dupain comes across as the more fragile of the two. Highly illuminating. \u2013 Nigel Featherstone Leave the Girls Behind by Jacqueline Bublitz Fiction, Allen &amp; Unwin, $34.99 Unlike its title, Jacqueline Bublitz\u2019s second novel leaves no girls behind. Its ambition to weave together a string of girls across the past and the present \u2013 one missing, some dead, some ignored and others obsessed over \u2013 makes it initially a tough story to crack. But stick with it: Bublitz\u2019s flawed, amateur detective protagonist, Ruth, has such a strong personal stake in the investigation that its impossible not to get swept up in her enthusiasm. Beyond the tangle of the novel\u2019s opening pages is a smart, gripping (albeit deeply unsettling) read. \u2013 Bec Kavanagh The Thinning by Inga Simpson Fiction, Hachette, $32.99 Fin Kelvin must travel from the Warrumbungles across the Pilliga in time for the solar eclipse and send a laser signal to her mother. Why? She has no idea. The world around Fin is changing too fast for her to make sense of anything. Inga Simpson\u2019s taut, melancholic thriller registers the profound losses of the climate crisis through the experience of a traumatised teenager. Simpson projects a vision of life on a planet on the brink of systems collapse that is terrifying but all too recognisable. It\u2019s a terrific read, attentive to the cosmic and the microscopic, with the action propelled by the competing energies of light and darkness. \u2013 CMP Unlovable by Darren Hayes Memoir, Penguin, $36.99 The former Savage Garden frontman truly tells all here, writing about growing up in Queensland with a loving mother and an abusive father; about the insanities of fame during his time in Savage Garden; and his painful falling out with bandmate Daniel Jones. (Hayes\u2019s hurt and frustration about the way their band ended is palpable.) Throughout Hayes returns to the burden of homophobia and what it does to gay kids, which is painful and moving. In one chapter Hayes, who briefly married a woman, recounts calling Lifeline after realising he was attracted to men; in another he learns how to have gay sex from an STD clinic doctor, having believed his first \u201cvery vanilla\u201d same-sex encounter must have given him HIV. \u2013 SC",

However, she\u2019s still undecided, so instead of backing anyone she rambles about her upbringing (\u201cI come from a little town called McCallister, Oklahoma, and we don\u2019t make up our minds fast \u2026 in fact, we got a saying: if you think the milk is spoiled, give it another sip\u201d), before attempting to vote by phone (which leads to her taking a picture of her \u201cred and curlies\u201d). A good, wacky celebrity impersonation in the Celerity Jeopardy mode.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYAqTB64Wik\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gYAqTB64Wik?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Later, he brings on Grant and Alyssa, \u201ca couple you can\u2019t believe are together,\u201d to discuss unlikely celebrity couples. Grant (Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez) is a loud, boorish, jock who teaches Soul Cycle classes at the tarmac of LaGuardia, while Alyssa (Jane Wickline) is a shy, nerdy wallflower currently getting her masters at Barnard in 18th century graveyards. Their characters are just heightened versions of their comedic actual personas, but they play off each other well.</p> <p>This was a decent enough Weekend Update on its own, but it lacks that big-time pre-election feel. It also seems odd that the biggest piece of election news from the last week \u2013 so-called comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s racist insults towards Puerto Ricans (along with Mexicans and Black people) at Trump\u2019s New York rally \u2013 brooked only one brief mention. One wonders if this was a case of Che, Jost and the rest of the writers not wanting to go after a fellow comedian.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObppTPdR6fo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ObppTPdR6fo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Next up is a PBS retrospective of classic 90s sitcom Family Bond. We get a clips from the show \u2013 about a single dad raising his kids with his sister \u2013 featuring appearances from Little Richard (Kenan Thompson), who was only supposed to guest star in one episode but decided to stick around and basically took over the program. Thompson is the best he has been in a long time as the brash, unpredictable, slightly psychotic musical icon. His delivery of the line \u201cI\u2019m sorry your goddamn dog died!\u201d is spit take worthy.</p> <p>Roan returns to the stage for her second performance, the country-tinged She Gets the Job Done, an appropriate anthem for this episode, and one which hopefully won\u2019t look like hubris come this time next week.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6QF-sRdU9g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v6QF-sRdU9g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Her performance is followed by a campaign ad for Harvey Epstein (Mulaney), a candidate running for New York City state assembly. He is, unsurprisingly having a very difficult time overcoming his unfortunate name and has to remind voters that \u201cI\u2019m a different guy.\u201d A one-joke sketch, but Mulaney\u2019s affable delivery makes it work. We get a nice and well-deserved card tribute to the late, great Teri Garr, the show wraps up.</p> <p>This star-studded episode made for a weird mixed bag. Mulaney was excellent as always and it boasted several of the best sketches of the season thus far, with not a single stinker in the bunch. Harris\u2019s cameo gave the night a huge sense of import, even if it didn\u2019t lead to any particularly memorable moment, while Tim Kaine of all people stole the whole show.</p> <p>With all that said, it still felt like SNL shirked its duty by not devoting more time to the election, and in particular Trump\u2019s disastrous week. There really should have been much more material aimed at that grotesque Madison Square Garden display.</p> <p>Regardless, come next Saturday, one way or another, we\u2019ll be living in a very different world (assuming the election results are known by then). Hopefully, SNL has something big planned.</p>",

Colin Jost hits at Trump for his series of blunders, debacles and overall weirdness from the past week \u2013 stumbling over his feet while trying to open a door (\u201cHe looks as drunk as I\u2019m going to be Tuesday night\u201d), his vow to \u201cprotect women whether they like it or not\u201d, and pretending to blow his microphone at a rally last night (\u201ceven more embarrassing, the microphone immediately tapped him on the back of his head\u201d). He brings on their first guest, Reba McEntire (Heidi Gardner), ostensibly there to endorse the president. However, she\u2019s still undecided, so instead of backing anyone she rambles about her upbringing (\u201cI come from a little town called McCallister, Oklahoma, and we don\u2019t make up our minds fast \u2026 in fact, we got a saying: if you think the milk is spoiled, give it another sip\u201d), before attempting to vote by phone (which leads to her taking a picture of her \u201cred and curlies\u201d). A good, wacky celebrity impersonation in the Celerity Jeopardy mode. Later, he brings on Grant and Alyssa, \u201ca couple you can\u2019t believe are together,\u201d to discuss unlikely celebrity couples. Grant (Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez) is a loud, boorish, jock who teaches Soul Cycle classes at the tarmac of LaGuardia, while Alyssa (Jane Wickline) is a shy, nerdy wallflower currently getting her masters at Barnard in 18th century graveyards. Their characters are just heightened versions of their comedic actual personas, but they play off each other well. This was a decent enough Weekend Update on its own, but it lacks that big-time pre-election feel. It also seems odd that the biggest piece of election news from the last week \u2013 so-called comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s racist insults towards Puerto Ricans (along with Mexicans and Black people) at Trump\u2019s New York rally \u2013 brooked only one brief mention. One wonders if this was a case of Che, Jost and the rest of the writers not wanting to go after a fellow comedian. Next up is a PBS retrospective of classic 90s sitcom Family Bond. We get a clips from the show \u2013 about a single dad raising his kids with his sister \u2013 featuring appearances from Little Richard (Kenan Thompson), who was only supposed to guest star in one episode but decided to stick around and basically took over the program. Thompson is the best he has been in a long time as the brash, unpredictable, slightly psychotic musical icon. His delivery of the line \u201cI\u2019m sorry your goddamn dog died!\u201d is spit take worthy. Roan returns to the stage for her second performance, the country-tinged She Gets the Job Done, an appropriate anthem for this episode, and one which hopefully won\u2019t look like hubris come this time next week. Her performance is followed by a campaign ad for Harvey Epstein (Mulaney), a candidate running for New York City state assembly. He is, unsurprisingly having a very difficult time overcoming his unfortunate name and has to remind voters that \u201cI\u2019m a different guy.\u201d A one-joke sketch, but Mulaney\u2019s affable delivery makes it work. We get a nice and well-deserved card tribute to the late, great Teri Garr, the show wraps up. This star-studded episode made for a weird mixed bag. Mulaney was excellent as always and it boasted several of the best sketches of the season thus far, with not a single stinker in the bunch. Harris\u2019s cameo gave the night a huge sense of import, even if it didn\u2019t lead to any particularly memorable moment, while Tim Kaine of all people stole the whole show. With all that said, it still felt like SNL shirked its duty by not devoting more time to the election, and in particular Trump\u2019s disastrous week. There really should have been much more material aimed at that grotesque Madison Square Garden display. Regardless, come next Saturday, one way or another, we\u2019ll be living in a very different world (assuming the election results are known by then). Hopefully, SNL has something big planned.",

With further heavy rain predicted, the race itself has been brought to 12.30pm local time/3.30pm UK time.</p> <p>After a host of crashes and five red-flag delays in qualifying, many teams have a huge task in repairing cars while, given conditions are expected to be difficult in the race, further drama is on the cards. In the wet weather, Lewis Hamilton, who usually revels in difficult conditions, took a shock exit in Q1, finishing 16th.</p> <p>The session opened once more in persistent rain, if nowhere near as severe as it had been on Saturday, with the entire field attempting to set times in case conditions deteriorated. It was delayed with a red flag when Williams\u2019 Franco Colapinto went off, losing the rear at Curva do Sol.</p> <p>With time already at a premium, given the race\u2019s early start, the delay cut further into the pre-race period. When running resumed, Norris just escaped elimination, coming home in 15th at the end of the session, while Verstappen had gone quickest. The British driver\u2019s title hopes had, for those few moments, been hanging in the balance.</p> <p>The rain had begun to ease in Q2 and the teams took to the intermediate tyres, but conditions remained enormously treacherous, with Carlos Sainz also losing control at turn two and hitting the barriers. Norris once more was threatened in the drop zone with five minutes on the clock and the track improving. The British driver quickly set a good time but late drama caught out Verstappen.</p>    <p>With the Dutchman 12th and yet to put in another quick lap, Stroll went off at Curva do Sol and the session was red-flagged after an approximately 40-second delay before ending with Verstappen unable to improve his place.</p> <p>He was furious the session had not been stopped immediately, potentially offering a chance to restart it and for him to complete a final lap. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cIf a car hits a wall it needs to be a straight red flag, I don\u2019t know why it has to be 40 seconds for a red flag to come out.\u201d</p> <p>In Q3, with the rain increasing, Fernando Alonso crashed out at Mergulho, just after Norris had set the quickest time. The rain then eased but Alex Albon suffered a major crash at turn one, causing the session to be stopped once more, with three minutes left. With time for two final laps Norris went hard, improving his time on both laps to claim pole with a 1 min 23.405sec lap, almost two-tenths up on Russell, who secured a strong second, while Norris\u2019s teammate Oscar Piastri locked up and dropped to eighth.</p> <p>McLaren had already enjoyed a strong opening to the weekend with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/02/norris-wins-brazil-gp-sprint-race-after-piastri-cedes-lead-under-team-orders\">Norris taking the win in the sprint race,</a> albeit one conceded by Piastri who had led for all but two laps. In so doing, they secured a one-two from Verstappen, who finished third but was given a penalty for failing to reach the minimum time under the VSC and was dropped to fourth. The 27-year-old has the grid penalty for taking a new engine in Brazil.</p> <p>The sprint victory continued Norris\u2019s comeback at Verstappen in the championship battle and was vital in once more edging closer to him. He took a further three points from his rival, closing the gap to 44-points with 112 available from one further sprint and the four races to come.</p> <p>Verstappen had looked strong in qualifying and will be optimistic he has a chance to at least come through the field in Sunday\u2019s race. He was comfortably quicker than the Ferraris in the sprint race and showed similarly strong pace in qualifying, but has a mountain to climb. Damage limitation is now the task, his aim to close down the gap to Norris and minimise the points differential.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Albon sixth for Williams and Alonso and Stroll were ninth and 10th for Aston Martin. Yuki Tsunoda was 11th for Red Bull, Valtteri Bottas 12th for Sauber, Sergio P\u00e9rez 14th for Red Bull and Sainz 15th. Oliver Bearman and Nico H\u00fclkenberg were 17th and 19th for Haas. Colapinto 18th and Guanyu Zhou 20th.</p>",

With further heavy rain predicted, the race itself has been brought to 12.30pm local time/3.30pm UK time. After a host of crashes and five red-flag delays in qualifying, many teams have a huge task in repairing cars while, given conditions are expected to be difficult in the race, further drama is on the cards. In the wet weather, Lewis Hamilton, who usually revels in difficult conditions, took a shock exit in Q1, finishing 16th. The session opened once more in persistent rain, if nowhere near as severe as it had been on Saturday, with the entire field attempting to set times in case conditions deteriorated. It was delayed with a red flag when Williams\u2019 Franco Colapinto went off, losing the rear at Curva do Sol. With time already at a premium, given the race\u2019s early start, the delay cut further into the pre-race period. When running resumed, Norris just escaped elimination, coming home in 15th at the end of the session, while Verstappen had gone quickest. The British driver\u2019s title hopes had, for those few moments, been hanging in the balance. The rain had begun to ease in Q2 and the teams took to the intermediate tyres, but conditions remained enormously treacherous, with Carlos Sainz also losing control at turn two and hitting the barriers. Norris once more was threatened in the drop zone with five minutes on the clock and the track improving. The British driver quickly set a good time but late drama caught out Verstappen. With the Dutchman 12th and yet to put in another quick lap, Stroll went off at Curva do Sol and the session was red-flagged after an approximately 40-second delay before ending with Verstappen unable to improve his place. He was furious the session had not been stopped immediately, potentially offering a chance to restart it and for him to complete a final lap. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cIf a car hits a wall it needs to be a straight red flag, I don\u2019t know why it has to be 40 seconds for a red flag to come out.\u201d In Q3, with the rain increasing, Fernando Alonso crashed out at Mergulho, just after Norris had set the quickest time. The rain then eased but Alex Albon suffered a major crash at turn one, causing the session to be stopped once more, with three minutes left. With time for two final laps Norris went hard, improving his time on both laps to claim pole with a 1 min 23.405sec lap, almost two-tenths up on Russell, who secured a strong second, while Norris\u2019s teammate Oscar Piastri locked up and dropped to eighth. McLaren had already enjoyed a strong opening to the weekend with Norris taking the win in the sprint race, albeit one conceded by Piastri who had led for all but two laps. In so doing, they secured a one-two from Verstappen, who finished third but was given a penalty for failing to reach the minimum time under the VSC and was dropped to fourth. The 27-year-old has the grid penalty for taking a new engine in Brazil. The sprint victory continued Norris\u2019s comeback at Verstappen in the championship battle and was vital in once more edging closer to him. He took a further three points from his rival, closing the gap to 44-points with 112 available from one further sprint and the four races to come. Verstappen had looked strong in qualifying and will be optimistic he has a chance to at least come through the field in Sunday\u2019s race. He was comfortably quicker than the Ferraris in the sprint race and showed similarly strong pace in qualifying, but has a mountain to climb. Damage limitation is now the task, his aim to close down the gap to Norris and minimise the points differential. Elsewhere, Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari, Albon sixth for Williams and Alonso and Stroll were ninth and 10th for Aston Martin. Yuki Tsunoda was 11th for Red Bull, Valtteri Bottas 12th for Sauber, Sergio P\u00e9rez 14th for Red Bull and Sainz 15th. Oliver Bearman and Nico H\u00fclkenberg were 17th and 19th for Haas. Colapinto 18th and Guanyu Zhou 20th.",

There is a lot of <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/britains-conservatives-are-warming-to-donald-trump/\">support in Tory circles for Donald Trump</a>. Even if many Conservative MPs want to concentrate on the comparatively small politics of UK living standards, jobs and tax rates, the wider Tory family \u2013 which goes beyond the party, into GB News, the Mail and Telegraph, and loud voices online \u2013 would sooner fixate on an ever-wilder array of enemies: Islam, multiculturalism, \u201cwoke\u201d universities, the civil service, \u201cidentity politics\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/09/culture-warriors-national-trust-populists-polarising-divisive\">the heretical National Trust</a>.</p> \n<p>The result is a remarkable asymmetry between the centre left and centre right.

Local GOP chapters and numerous outside organizations on the right have also held screenings, some in conjunction with <a href=\"https://shastascout.org/bethel-church-considers-launching-election-groups-partners-with-activist-laura-hobbs-to-sign-up-poll-workers/\">poll worker sign-up</a> initiatives and alongside <a href=\"https://x.com/schaykg/status/1814738778088743079\">Turning Point Action</a>, a group the Trump campaign has relied on for its voter registration and turnout efforts.</p> <p>Internal videos produced by Ziklag, obtained by the Guardian and Documented, detail Ziklag\u2019s 2024 election strategy, pledging $800,000 to \u201cfocus on rallying the church behind biblically based voting using Eric Metaxas\u2019 new documentary, Letter to the American Church\u201d. Organizations that partnered with Metaxas, including Turning Point Action and TPUSA Faith, were promised donations from Ziklag in this effort to engage evangelical voters.</p> <p>Ziklag and Turning Point USA did not return requests for comment.</p>    <p>In an email, Metaxas denied having \u201canything to do with the making of the LETTER film\u201d \u2013 although he stars in the movie and founded one of the companies that produced it. Metaxas rejected the term \u201cChristian nationalism\u201d, saying it was used to \u201cdemonize people who believe that we Christians are obliged to live our faith in every sphere, including the political\u201d.</p> <p>And he suggested that Bonhoeffer scholars and his critics were in fact the ones inciting political violence, not him.</p> <h2>\u2018Co-opted by extremists\u2019</h2> <p>Born in 1906 and raised in a family of intellectuals and academics, Bonhoeffer dedicated himself as a young man to theology and ministry. At 21, he wrote a dissertation exploring the idea of Christians\u2019 ethical and moral obligations to one another and society.</p> <p>But Bonhoeffer\u2019s prodigious academic career was cut short by the rise of Hitler\u2019s Nazi party.</p> <p>An early dissident, <a href=\"https://bonhoeffersociety.org/about/bonhoeffer/biography/\">Bonhoeffer wrote</a> in 1933 that the Hitler government\u2019s increasingly discriminatory and violent oppression of Jews was a \u201cproblem for the church\u201d, which he viewed as responsible for opposing such policies, even if they were not directed at Christians.</p> <p>His work in the following decade, with other dissenting clergy and networks of resisters, would eventually lead the regime to accuse him of aiding in a plot to assassinate Hitler. He was arrested in 1943 and hanged in 1945 in the Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp, leaving behind his letters from prison and numerous writings on ethics, morality and the role of Christians in a secular, modern society.</p> <p>Before he was executed, Bonhoeffer warned of the dangers of zealotry and groupthink \u2013 perils he believed societies face during times of political upheaval.</p> <p>\u201c[The] upsurge of power is so terrific that it deprives men of an independent judgement,\u201d wrote Bonhoeffer, \u201cand they give up trying \u2013 more or less unconsciously \u2013 to assess the new state of affairs for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Scholars of Bonhoeffer, and Bonhoeffer\u2019s living relatives, have argued that Bonhoeffer teaches Christians to reject nationalisms of all kinds.</p> <p>To their dismay, Christian nationalists have embraced Bonhoeffer, frequently invoking his participation in the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler as an example of moral courage. In this interpretation, Bonhoeffer is cast not as the contemplative theologian who agonized over his role in the antifascist resistance, but as a Christian warrior with the political leanings of a 21st-century American evangelical.</p> <p>Tobias Korenke, Bonhoeffer\u2019s great-nephew, has expressed frustration about the use of Bonhoeffer by the religious right, saying in a recent interview with Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper that Bonhoeffer\u2019s name had been \u201cco-opted by extremists\u201d.</p> <p>At its worst, this interpretation of Bonhoeffer has led to violence. Michael Bray, a pastor who was convicted for his role in bombing numerous abortion clinics in 1984 and 1985, cited Bonhoeffer as an inspiration. Paul Jennings Hill, an anti-abortion zealot who shot and killed a physician at an abortion clinic in 1994, too, <a href=\"https://www.christiancentury.org/article/2015-05/claims-bonhoeffer\">invoked Bonhoeffer</a>.</p> <h2>Metaxas\u2019s political evolution</h2> <p>One evangelical celebrity who has consistently and effectively worked to popularize Bonhoeffer on the right is Eric Metaxas, a Yale-educated talkshow host whose popular biography of Bonhoeffer helped introduce the historical figure to a broader audience in the US.</p> <p>Metaxas\u2019s 2009 book, Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, was marketed to Christians but achieved popular acclaim \u2013 serving as a biography and an inspirational history for readers familiar and unfamiliar with Bonhoeffer.</p> <p>To explain Bonhoeffer\u2019s participation in the resistance, Metaxas writes that God had called him to \u201cget his hands dirty\u201d.</p> <p>In turn the New York-based Metaxas, already an unusual east coast ambassador for conservative evangelicalism, achieved a new level of fame.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the rare figure in the evangelical world who was mixing it up with the culture shapers and the intellectuals in New York City,\u201d said John Fea, a historian who has documented the rise of contemporary Christian nationalism. \u201cAnd then the Bonhoeffer book came out, and that skyrocketed him.\u201d</p> <p>At the 2012 National Prayer Breakfast, an annual gala in Washington convening lawmakers and Christian faith leaders, Metaxas spoke about the genesis of his Bonhoeffer biography in a speech delivered with the cadence and occasional vulnerability of a stand-up routine.</p>    <p>Fifteen minutes into the 30-minute talk, Metaxas reflected on the book\u2019s widespread popularity, joking that \u201cit was read even by president George W Bush, who is intellectually incurious, as we\u2019ve all read. He read the book.\u201d</p> <p>Metaxas paused, turning to Barack and Michelle Obama, who were seated to his right. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d he added, and thrust a copy of the book into the hands of the president, who played along, smiling for a photo with the book.</p> <p>During the remainder of his speech, Metaxas became sharply political, railing in particular against abortion.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a Bonhoeffer moment,\u201d Metaxas declared, implicitly comparing abortion to the Holocaust and calling on Christians to intervene in the manner that many Germans did not.</p> <p>In the decade that followed, Metaxas\u2019s political evolution has turned even more dramatically to the right. In a 2016 column in the Wall Street Journal, he endorsed Donald Trump, acknowledging his reservations about the real estate mogul but writing that if Christians voted for Hillary Clinton, \u201cGod will not hold us guiltless,\u201d citing abortion as a top issue.</p> <p>Metaxas eventually embraced Maga politics fully, vowing to support Trump as the former president falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election had been stolen and attempted to overturn the results.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most horrible thing that has happened in the history of our nation,\u201d Metaxas told Trump on 30 November, in a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210102002101/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3MAz7Pvp_o\">since deleted </a>recording of a phone call between Metaxas and the former president that ran on Metaxas\u2019s show. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to die in this fight,\u201d he told Trump later in the call.</p> <p>Experts question the underpinnings of Metaxas\u2019s work on Bonhoeffer. A recent <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/stop-misusing-dietrich-bonhoeffer-to-support-political-violence-and-christian-nationalism\">petition</a> circulated by eight Bonhoeffer scholars, and signed by dozens of clergy and scholars of religion, argues that Metaxas \u201chas manipulated the Bonhoeffer story to support Christian Nationalism\u201d.</p> <p>It warns that in his social media posts and public appearances, Metaxas \u201cglorifies violence and draws inappropriate analogies between our political system and that of Nazi Germany\u201d.</p> <p>Barnett argues that Metaxas\u2019s book overstated Bonhoeffer\u2019s role in the plot to assassinate Hitler and that Metaxas \u201ctapped right into\u201d a \u201cmythology that Bonhoeffer was like the Lone Ranger, the Christian hero who fought the Nazis\u201d.</p> <p>In fact, the full extent of Bonhoeffer\u2019s role in the conspiracy has been disputed \u2013 and however closely involved he might have been in the plot, Bonhoeffer did not legitimize political violence in religious terms.</p> <p>\u201cHe did not justify his knowledge of the conspiracy on his being Christian \u2013 he just refused to do that, because he understood the dangers of that,\u201d said Barnett.</p> <h2>Blurred lines between religion and politics</h2> <p>In Letter to the American Church, Metaxas, who narrates much of the documentary-style film, and a roster of rightwing pastors and activists take the Bonhoeffer narrative a step further, casting liberals and Democrats as being as destructive as Nazis and calling on evangelicals to take action and oppose evil.</p> <p>They insist liberal teachings are destroying the family and religion in an effort to strip away freedoms from the American people. The speakers warn that if evangelicals do not rise up against ideas that they portray as evil, such as LGBTQ+ rights and women\u2019s rights, the country is headed for destruction.</p> <p>At the heart of their argument is Bonhoeffer.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Bonhoeffer effectively told the church that if we\u2019re going to see any effective change for the better, they needed to start taking action and getting political,\u201d Metaxas tells his audience in the film. \u201cHe said<strong> </strong>those who call themselves Christians have an obligation to God to get political if necessary, and to take a bold and likely dangerous stance against their own government.\u201d</p> <p>Letter to the American Church has partnered with influential rightwing organizations, including the pro-Trump Moms for America, the anti-LGBTQ+ Her Voice Movement, and Patriot Academy \u2013 a Christian nationalist group that seeks to rewrite the constitution \u2013 to promote the film and spread its message. The organization also partnered with Million Voices, an evangelical get-out-the-vote initiative, to launch a \u201cPledge to Vote\u201d campaign, aiming to see \u201c250,000 pledge to vote\u201d after seeing the movie.</p>    <p>The effort highlights how some tax-exempt religious organizations push the boundaries of legal restrictions on electioneering.</p> <p>Churches are banned from issuing endorsements or campaigning on behalf of a candidate, but they may be able to participate in the screenings without fear of incurring legal penalties, said Andrew Seidel, a constitutional attorney who specializes in first amendment and religious freedoms cases.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the ways that this Christian nationalist movement has started operating in the political space, is to create these kinds of movies and then push them out through churches,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite the timing of the screenings \u2013 which end on election day \u2013 and the film\u2019s ultra-political content, \u201cthe churches would all have, probably, some pretty credible deniability, if they said: \u2018Hey, we were just [given] a chance to run a movie we thought our folks would be interested in.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The Letter to the American Church tour officially ends on 5 November \u2013 but don\u2019t expect Bonhoeffer to go away anytime soon.</p> <p>A splashy feature film, Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin, is to debut in theaters across the US on 22 November. Bonhoeffer, the movie, features a star-studded cast of German actors and promises to be a captivating second world war drama. (Americans might recognize August Diehl, who plays the resistance theologian Martin Niem\u00f6ller, from his role in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds, or the 2010 thriller Salt.)</p> <p>Posters for the movie show Bonhoeffer carrying a gun. \u201cWith world-shattering stakes,\u201d the Christian streaming company Angel Studios <a href=\"https://shop.angel.com/pages/show-bonhoeffer?srsltid=AfmBOorLuRi0Re6swyCD-rPKXK_sRk2Zusr_YrasvcgGFfxUCtn8-zQz\">writes</a> in its promotional materials for the film, Bonhoeffer \u201cbegs the question, how far will you go to stand up for what\u2019s right?\u201d</p> <p>Bonhoeffer scholars reject this gun-toting version of the theologian \u2013 and the film\u2019s \u201chow-far-would-you-go\u201d framing. \u201c[In] the current, highly-polarized climate in the United States, these are dangerous words,\u201d wrote the leaders of the English and German-language International Bonhoeffer Society last month in Die Zeit.</p> <p>Even the actors starring in the feature film have distanced themselves from the Christian far right, writing in a 4 November statement that figures on the far right \u201cdivide us, spread fear, lies and threaten their political opponents by framing their selves as victims and marginalized \u2013 a common ploy by far-right groups worldwide. These kind of people, this demagoguery and violent system was what Bonhoeffer spoke up against.\u201d They added that they stand by the film, \u201cwhich to our belief tells a completely different story to what a radical few want to make out of it\u201d.</p> <p>Still, in their petition, the scholars warn more broadly of a possible uptick in violence after the election linked to the Christian far right.</p> <p>\u201cDietrich Bonhoeffer\u2019s words and witness will be used to pit one side against the other, to fight \u2018evil\u2019, to put \u2018America First\u2019, and to justify violence,\u201d they write. \u201cThe misalignment between these views and actions and Bonhoeffer\u2019s own cannot be overstated. When you hear these grievous misuses, and you will, do not be fooled.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "This article is co-published with Documented Leading figures on the Christian right have seized on an unlikely hero in their campaign against secular government: Dietrich Bonhoeffer, an antifascist theologian and pastor who resisted the Nazi regime before he was executed in 1945. Driving the trend is Eric Metaxas, a prolific author, speaker and celebrity on the Christian right, whose writings on Bonhoeffer and American politics provide the intellectual fodder for a movement that seeks to turn evangelicals against liberal policies on women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ+ inclusion and racial justice. In the short term, this push has taken the form of a well-funded voter mobilization campaign ahead of the 5 November presidential election, with conservative organizations coordinating to screen Metaxas\u2019s 2024 film \u2013 which lays out an argument equating liberal policies with Nazism, and urges believers to emulate Bonhoeffer \u2013 in churches across the country. In the long run, experts worry that the push to liken American liberal democracy to Nazi Germany could spur political violence, citing past examples of Christian extremists who invoked Bonhoeffer to justify bombing and shooting up abortion clinics. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about post-election political violence, and this is a way of inspiring that,\u201d said Victoria Barnett, a theologian and eminent scholar of Bonhoeffer and the Holocaust who has advocated for a nuanced understanding of Bonhoeffer and has cautioned against depicting Bonhoeffer as a kind of evangelical \u201cLone Ranger\u201d. According to documents obtained by the Guardian and Documented, the production and distribution of the movie, called Letter to the American Church, was coordinated by the rightwing group Turning Point USA and American Letter Productions \u2013 the film division of Metaxas Media, an entertainment business founded by Eric Metaxas. Through the Letter to the American Church tour, an initiative launched in mid-2024, these groups and others have screened the film at churches, community organizations, and small groups for donations of any amount; churches willing to screen the film received an \u201cextensive marketing kit\u201d to promote it.

Organizations that partnered with Metaxas, including Turning Point Action and TPUSA Faith, were promised donations from Ziklag in this effort to engage evangelical voters.

Metaxas rejected the term \u201cChristian nationalism\u201d, saying it was used to \u201cdemonize people who believe that we Christians are obliged to live our faith in every sphere, including the political\u201d. And he suggested that Bonhoeffer scholars and his critics were in fact the ones inciting political violence, not him. \u2018Co-opted by extremists\u2019 Born in 1906 and raised in a family of intellectuals and academics, Bonhoeffer dedicated himself as a young man to theology and ministry. At 21, he wrote a dissertation exploring the idea of Christians\u2019 ethical and moral obligations to one another and society. But Bonhoeffer\u2019s prodigious academic career was cut short by the rise of Hitler\u2019s Nazi party. An early dissident, Bonhoeffer wrote in 1933 that the Hitler government\u2019s increasingly discriminatory and violent oppression of Jews was a \u201cproblem for the church\u201d, which he viewed as responsible for opposing such policies, even if they were not directed at Christians. His work in the following decade, with other dissenting clergy and networks of resisters, would eventually lead the regime to accuse him of aiding in a plot to assassinate Hitler. He was arrested in 1943 and hanged in 1945 in the Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp, leaving behind his letters from prison and numerous writings on ethics, morality and the role of Christians in a secular, modern society. Before he was executed, Bonhoeffer warned of the dangers of zealotry and groupthink \u2013 perils he believed societies face during times of political upheaval. \u201c[The] upsurge of power is so terrific that it deprives men of an independent judgement,\u201d wrote Bonhoeffer, \u201cand they give up trying \u2013 more or less unconsciously \u2013 to assess the new state of affairs for themselves.\u201d Scholars of Bonhoeffer, and Bonhoeffer\u2019s living relatives, have argued that Bonhoeffer teaches Christians to reject nationalisms of all kinds. To their dismay, Christian nationalists have embraced Bonhoeffer, frequently invoking his participation in the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler as an example of moral courage. In this interpretation, Bonhoeffer is cast not as the contemplative theologian who agonized over his role in the antifascist resistance, but as a Christian warrior with the political leanings of a 21st-century American evangelical. Tobias Korenke, Bonhoeffer\u2019s great-nephew, has expressed frustration about the use of Bonhoeffer by the religious right, saying in a recent interview with Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper that Bonhoeffer\u2019s name had been \u201cco-opted by extremists\u201d. At its worst, this interpretation of Bonhoeffer has led to violence. Michael Bray, a pastor who was convicted for his role in bombing numerous abortion clinics in 1984 and 1985, cited Bonhoeffer as an inspiration. Paul Jennings Hill, an anti-abortion zealot who shot and killed a physician at an abortion clinic in 1994, too, invoked Bonhoeffer. Metaxas\u2019s political evolution One evangelical celebrity who has consistently and effectively worked to popularize Bonhoeffer on the right is Eric Metaxas, a Yale-educated talkshow host whose popular biography of Bonhoeffer helped introduce the historical figure to a broader audience in the US. Metaxas\u2019s 2009 book, Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, was marketed to Christians but achieved popular acclaim \u2013 serving as a biography and an inspirational history for readers familiar and unfamiliar with Bonhoeffer. To explain Bonhoeffer\u2019s participation in the resistance, Metaxas writes that God had called him to \u201cget his hands dirty\u201d. In turn the New York-based Metaxas, already an unusual east coast ambassador for conservative evangelicalism, achieved a new level of fame. \u201cHe was the rare figure in the evangelical world who was mixing it up with the culture shapers and the intellectuals in New York City,\u201d said John Fea, a historian who has documented the rise of contemporary Christian nationalism. \u201cAnd then the Bonhoeffer book came out, and that skyrocketed him.\u201d At the 2012 National Prayer Breakfast, an annual gala in Washington convening lawmakers and Christian faith leaders, Metaxas spoke about the genesis of his Bonhoeffer biography in a speech delivered with the cadence and occasional vulnerability of a stand-up routine. Fifteen minutes into the 30-minute talk, Metaxas reflected on the book\u2019s widespread popularity, joking that \u201cit was read even by president George W Bush, who is intellectually incurious, as we\u2019ve all read. He read the book.\u201d Metaxas paused, turning to Barack and Michelle Obama, who were seated to his right. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d he added, and thrust a copy of the book into the hands of the president, who played along, smiling for a photo with the book. During the remainder of his speech, Metaxas became sharply political, railing in particular against abortion. \u201cThis is a Bonhoeffer moment,\u201d Metaxas declared, implicitly comparing abortion to the Holocaust and calling on Christians to intervene in the manner that many Germans did not. In the decade that followed, Metaxas\u2019s political evolution has turned even more dramatically to the right. In a 2016 column in the Wall Street Journal, he endorsed Donald Trump, acknowledging his reservations about the real estate mogul but writing that if Christians voted for Hillary Clinton, \u201cGod will not hold us guiltless,\u201d citing abortion as a top issue. Metaxas eventually embraced Maga politics fully, vowing to support Trump as the former president falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election had been stolen and attempted to overturn the results. \u201cThis is the most horrible thing that has happened in the history of our nation,\u201d Metaxas told Trump on 30 November, in a since deleted recording of a phone call between Metaxas and the former president that ran on Metaxas\u2019s show. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to die in this fight,\u201d he told Trump later in the call. Experts question the underpinnings of Metaxas\u2019s work on Bonhoeffer. A recent petition circulated by eight Bonhoeffer scholars, and signed by dozens of clergy and scholars of religion, argues that Metaxas \u201chas manipulated the Bonhoeffer story to support Christian Nationalism\u201d. It warns that in his social media posts and public appearances, Metaxas \u201cglorifies violence and draws inappropriate analogies between our political system and that of Nazi Germany\u201d. Barnett argues that Metaxas\u2019s book overstated Bonhoeffer\u2019s role in the plot to assassinate Hitler and that Metaxas \u201ctapped right into\u201d a \u201cmythology that Bonhoeffer was like the Lone Ranger, the Christian hero who fought the Nazis\u201d. In fact, the full extent of Bonhoeffer\u2019s role in the conspiracy has been disputed \u2013 and however closely involved he might have been in the plot, Bonhoeffer did not legitimize political violence in religious terms. \u201cHe did not justify his knowledge of the conspiracy on his being Christian \u2013 he just refused to do that, because he understood the dangers of that,\u201d said Barnett. Blurred lines between religion and politics In Letter to the American Church, Metaxas, who narrates much of the documentary-style film, and a roster of rightwing pastors and activists take the Bonhoeffer narrative a step further, casting liberals and Democrats as being as destructive as Nazis and calling on evangelicals to take action and oppose evil. They insist liberal teachings are destroying the family and religion in an effort to strip away freedoms from the American people. The speakers warn that if evangelicals do not rise up against ideas that they portray as evil, such as LGBTQ+ rights and women\u2019s rights, the country is headed for destruction. At the heart of their argument is Bonhoeffer. \u201cBonhoeffer effectively told the church that if we\u2019re going to see any effective change for the better, they needed to start taking action and getting political,\u201d Metaxas tells his audience in the film. \u201cHe said those who call themselves Christians have an obligation to God to get political if necessary, and to take a bold and likely dangerous stance against their own government.\u201d Letter to the American Church has partnered with influential rightwing organizations, including the pro-Trump Moms for America, the anti-LGBTQ+ Her Voice Movement, and Patriot Academy \u2013 a Christian nationalist group that seeks to rewrite the constitution \u2013 to promote the film and spread its message. The organization also partnered with Million Voices, an evangelical get-out-the-vote initiative, to launch a \u201cPledge to Vote\u201d campaign, aiming to see \u201c250,000 pledge to vote\u201d after seeing the movie. The effort highlights how some tax-exempt religious organizations push the boundaries of legal restrictions on electioneering. Churches are banned from issuing endorsements or campaigning on behalf of a candidate, but they may be able to participate in the screenings without fear of incurring legal penalties, said Andrew Seidel, a constitutional attorney who specializes in first amendment and religious freedoms cases. \u201cOne of the ways that this Christian nationalist movement has started operating in the political space, is to create these kinds of movies and then push them out through churches,\u201d he said. Despite the timing of the screenings \u2013 which end on election day \u2013 and the film\u2019s ultra-political content, \u201cthe churches would all have, probably, some pretty credible deniability, if they said: \u2018Hey, we were just [given] a chance to run a movie we thought our folks would be interested in.\u2019\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The Letter to the American Church tour officially ends on 5 November \u2013 but don\u2019t expect Bonhoeffer to go away anytime soon. A splashy feature film, Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin, is to debut in theaters across the US on 22 November. Bonhoeffer, the movie, features a star-studded cast of German actors and promises to be a captivating second world war drama. (Americans might recognize August Diehl, who plays the resistance theologian Martin Niem\u00f6ller, from his role in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Inglourious Basterds, or the 2010 thriller Salt.) Posters for the movie show Bonhoeffer carrying a gun. \u201cWith world-shattering stakes,\u201d the Christian streaming company Angel Studios writes in its promotional materials for the film, Bonhoeffer \u201cbegs the question, how far will you go to stand up for what\u2019s right?\u201d Bonhoeffer scholars reject this gun-toting version of the theologian \u2013 and the film\u2019s \u201chow-far-would-you-go\u201d framing. \u201c[In] the current, highly-polarized climate in the United States, these are dangerous words,\u201d wrote the leaders of the English and German-language International Bonhoeffer Society last month in Die Zeit. Even the actors starring in the feature film have distanced themselves from the Christian far right, writing in a 4 November statement that figures on the far right \u201cdivide us, spread fear, lies and threaten their political opponents by framing their selves as victims and marginalized \u2013 a common ploy by far-right groups worldwide. These kind of people, this demagoguery and violent system was what Bonhoeffer spoke up against.\u201d They added that they stand by the film, \u201cwhich to our belief tells a completely different story to what a radical few want to make out of it\u201d. Still, in their petition, the scholars warn more broadly of a possible uptick in violence after the election linked to the Christian far right. \u201cDietrich Bonhoeffer\u2019s words and witness will be used to pit one side against the other, to fight \u2018evil\u2019, to put \u2018America First\u2019, and to justify violence,\u201d they write. \u201cThe misalignment between these views and actions and Bonhoeffer\u2019s own cannot be overstated. When you hear these grievous misuses, and you will, do not be fooled.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The American photographer Peter van Agtmael experienced a life-changing moment, aged 19, when he happened on a copy of <em>Magnum Degrees</em>, a photobook published in 2000 of dramatic images from the previous decade.</p> <p>\u201cI got an instantaneous education in the beauty, violence, mystery, complexity and simplicity of photography,\u201d he writes in his afterword to <em>Magnum America</em>, a much bigger, more mysterious and complex compendium of photographs spanning nine decades, from postwar 1940s to the present day.</p> <p>Magnum was formed as a cooperative by a group of renowned war photographers, including Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, in 1947. It\u2019s cooperative nature was initially a reflection of its founders\u2019 stoical postwar optimism in the face of the horrors and traumas they had witnessed, but also their shared spirit of creative independence.</p> <p><em>Magnum America</em> traces the nation\u2019s often turbulent journey from those tentatively optimistic postwar years to the existential anxiety of the present political moment in which democracy itself hangs in the balance. Though punctuated by celebrated portraits and observational series on ordinary American lives, it is the hard-hitting photojournalism that arrests, from Capa\u2019s blurred but powerful images from the D-day landing at Omaha beach to Van Agtmael\u2019s eye-of-the-storm reportage of the siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021.</p> <p>Van Agtmael and his fellow editor, the curator and feminist academic Laura Wexler, have not attempted to create a definitive visual history of the United States as reflexed through the lenses of Magnum photographers, but instead deftly explore ideas of history, culture, myth and national identity. The book comprises 600 images \u2013 some famous, some relatively unknown \u2013 culled from a total of 227,450. The selection here reflects that mix, but concentrates on images of conflict and political drama that are pertinent to today\u2019s fraught pre-election moment.</p> <p>The book is also a revealing social history of Magnum itself: the ideal and the often problematic reality. For too long, it reflected the predominantly white, male world of photojournalism, the exceptions being pioneers such as Eve Arnold, Martine Franck, Inge Morath and, later, Susan Meiselas. And, though Magnum photographers made some of the most memorable images of the black civil rights struggle in the 1960s, it wasn\u2019t until 1988 that Eli Reed became the first black photographer to enter the Magnum fold. That irony went unnoticed for a long time. Today, Magnum is a diverse organisation, but it is its relevance \u2013 and, by extension, photojournalism\u2019s role \u2013 that is also at stake in a world of relentless image-making and instant image-dissemination, an environment unimaginable to its founders. The ongoing carnage in Gaza enters our consciousness daily on social media, where local photojournalists as well as ordinary people with mobile phones bear witness at great risk in the midst of an ongoing humanitarian disaster. Not one photojournalist from Magnum or any other western photo agency has reported from Gaza because of Israel\u2019s refusal to admit even embedded members of the international media. The integral act of bearing witness, which is at the core of Magnum\u2019s collective being, continues just as powerfully all the same. The next big volume of retrospective Magnum images may have to find a way of grappling with that dilemma.</p> <h2><strong>1940s: </strong><strong>Robert Capa</strong></h2> <p><strong>American </strong><strong>troops </strong><strong>landing on Omaha </strong><strong>beach, D-</strong><strong>day, Normandy, France, </strong><strong>6 June</strong><strong> 1944</strong></p>    <p>On 6 June 1944, Robert Capa was one of a handful of photographers granted permission to cross the English Channel with allied forces during the D-day operation to liberate occupied France. He travelled with American soldiers from E Company of the 16th Infantry Regiment. This blurred but evocative image was taken in the immediate wake of their arrival at Omaha beach, where they were met with cannon and small arms fire from embedded German troops as they leapt off their landing crafts into cold, choppy waters. It remains one of the most visceral images of that pivotal, but at times chaotic, operation, during which about 4,440 allied soldiers lost their lives and close to 6,000 were wounded.</p> <p>Intriguingly, the circumstances in which the 11 images that comprise Capa\u2019s reportage from Omaha beach were created \u2013 which he described in characteristically self-mythologising fashion in his memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/conflict/robert-capa-d-day-omaha-beach/\">Slightly Out of Focus</a></em> \u2013 have <a href=\"https://medium.com/exposure-magazine/alternate-history-robert-capa-on-d-day-2657f9af914\">recently been contested</a>. Likewise his contention that they were all that remained of 106 pictures he sent to <em>Life</em> magazine on his return to England, the rest having been mysteriously destroyed after being left too long at a high temperature by an unfortunate lab assistant who was processing them.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, the photographs that were taken under extreme duress during his relatively short time on the beach \u2013 he made it on to a departing boat after a severe panic attack in which his hands were shaking so badly he could not reload his camera \u2013 are a powerful and up-close record of that day\u2019s tumultuous events. There have been several attempts to identify the \u201csoldier in the surf\u201d, with Private Huston \u201cHu\u201d Sears Riley the most likely contender. That he has not been definitively identified lends another level of poignancy to the image.</p> <p>Capa, one of Magnum\u2019s founders, was arguably the most revered photojournalist of the 20th century. His most famous quote epitomised his cavalier approach: \u201cIf your pictures aren\u2019t good enough, you\u2019re not close enough.\u201d In 1954, 10 years after this photograph was taken, he was killed, aged 40, by a landmine in Vietnam, while covering the first Indochina war.</p> <h2><strong>1950s: </strong><strong>Elliott Erwitt</strong></h2> <p><strong>Wilmington, North Carolina, 1950</strong></p>    <p>Elliott Erwitt was invited to join Magnum by Robert Capa in 1953. Having studied photography and film-making at college in California, Erwitt, aged 25, had already made a name for himself as an editorial photographer for various commercial magazines. He would go on to become one of the world\u2019s most famous image-makers, best known for his striking, slightly surreal pictures of the everyday. His similarly offbeat portraits of dogs have been the subject of five photobooks to date. It is fair to say that Erwitt\u2019s dedication to being, as he put it, \u201cserious about not being serious\u201d has tended to shift attention away from his more unsettlingly powerful images. One of the most rawly observant is his photograph of a grief stricken and bewildered Jackie Kennedy at her husband\u2019s funeral.</p> <p>His photograph <em>Wilmington, North Carolina, 1950</em> possesses a resonance that is at odds with its neutral geographical title. Like many images in <em>Magnum America</em>, it captures a significant moment, simultaneously evoking the darkness of the US\u2019s past and signalling a turbulent future of hard-won progress. The tentative beginning of the civil rights movement was still four years away when this picture was taken, and it was 14 years before that struggle achieved one of its seminal victories when the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 outlawed segregation. The separate drinking fountains, marked \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cColored\u201d, the one modern and sleekly designed, the other makeshift and worn, speak of a time not that distant when discrimination was a given in certain states. The face of the man crouching over the sink beneath the Colored sign is blurred, and his stance suggests he is looking towards the other fountain that is so close yet out of bounds. As a signifier of the postwar era of US segregation in the south, Erwitt\u2019s grainy image remains starkly affecting and deeply symbolic.</p> <h2><strong>1960s: </strong><strong>Paul Fusco</strong></h2> <p><strong>Robert Kennedy </strong><strong>funeral </strong><strong>train, USA, 1968</strong></p>    <p>It was a year of sustained social and political turbulence in the US, the war in Vietnam dividing the country across generational lines and provoking widespread protests that often culminated in violence. The conflict on the streets reached a climax of sorts at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August 1968, when police brutally attacked activists and bystanders, the violence captured on TV cameras and broadcast nationally on news reports.</p> <p>By then, the already divided nation had been traumatised by the recent assassinations of two progressive leaders: the black civil rights figurehead Martin Luther King Jr and the Democratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy. Paul Fusco boarded the train taking Kennedy\u2019s body from New York to Washington focused on how he would cover the senator\u2019s state funeral at Arlington cemetery for <em>Look</em> magazine. When the train emerged from a long dark Manhattan tunnel into daylight, he was taken aback by what he saw. Ordinary citizens, young and old, had gathered in clusters by the railway track, standing in silent homage to the young politician whose death, like his life, had echoed that of his older, more famous brother, President John F Kennedy.</p> <p>The train moved slowly, perhaps out of respect for the dead senator, taking eight hours rather than the usual four to complete its journey. Along the entirety of the route, people congregated trackside in their summer clothes. Fusco shot about 2,000 photos en route to Washington. In them, he freeze-framed for posterity a nation in mourning: families and friends holding hands, men standing to attention to salute, a woman kneeling in prayer. Mostly, though, a seemingly endless succession of ordinary Americans of every race, creed and colour gaze upwards as the train trundles past from city to suburb and on through sun-dappled rural neighbourhoods, their collective silence palpable in every frame.</p> <p>At the time, the editors of <em>Look</em> bafflingly decided not to publish any of Fusco\u2019s extraordinary funeral train series. After the magazine ceased publication in 1971, they remained unseen for another 30 years, consigned to the vast archive of the Library of Congress until they were uncovered by a Magnum researcher. Almost six decades on, they evoke another now distant US, one united in grief but also, as Fusco later put it, \u201cgrateful for the commitment and hope Bobby nurtured in the legions of the poor, the black and countless other forgotten Americans\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>1970s: </strong><strong>Alex Webb</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nixon </strong><strong>resignation, Washington DC, 1974</strong></p>    <p>On 8 August 1974, at 9pm, Richard Nixon, who was facing impeachment and removal from office for his role in the Watergate scandal, announced that he was resigning as president of America. He was the first and as yet only US head of state to do so. \u201cAs president,\u201d he told the country in a live television broadcast from the White House, \u201cI must put the interests of America first.\u201d</p> <p>The evidence of his misdemeanours, as uncovered by the <em>Washington Post</em> reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with the help of an anonymous source known as \u201cDeep Throat\u201d, suggested that sentiment had not been foremost in his mind two years earlier, when a break-in had occurred at the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington DC. It had been carried out by a group devoted to Nixon\u2019s re-election, which included his former close associate G Gordon Liddy. Along with six others, Liddy was subsequently jailed for his part in the burglary.</p> <p>Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s exhaustive investigation also uncovered evidence of wiretaps of the phones of those Nixon considered his most dangerous enemies. The break-in and cover-up was exposed in detail in the televised Watergate hearings that by turns enthralled and appalled the US public over 51 days in 1973.</p> <p>That Nixon hung on in office as long as he did was testament to his tenacity as well as his sense of entitlement. Tricky Dicky, as he came to be known, escaped the humiliation of impeachment and a possible prison sentence and was subsequently pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford.</p> <p>When the news of his resignation broke, Alex Webb evoked the country\u2019s collective response in his image of a single, anonymous individual intensely perusing the <em>Washington Post</em> on the streets of the capital. The front page headline, \u201cNixon Resigns\u201d, resonates across the years, through the subsequent impeachments of Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, as well as the turbulence of the latter\u2019s first term of office, the incendiary nature of his departure from it, and the possibility of his imminent return. \u201cIt changed history,\u201d Woodward recently said of the crimes he helped to uncover. \u201cIt was a red light for presidents.\u201d We may find out soon enough if that is still the case.</p> <h2><strong>1980s: </strong><strong>Susan Meiselas</strong></h2> <p><strong>US/Mexican border, 8am: undocumented workers discovered in a \u201cdrop off\u201d site, Interstate 5, Oceanside, California, 1989</strong></p>    <p>Throughout his 2016 election campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly promised his faithful that he would construct \u201ca big beautiful wall\u201d between the US and Mexico, one that stretched across its 2,000-mile length, thus ending once and for all the flow of illegal migrants that, he claimed, threatened the security and identity of the US. The construction of a border wall was already well under way long before Trump began his campaign, with more than 600 miles of the southern border barricaded and protected by immigration authorities. It signified the strategy of deterrence through military-style policing that had been officially sanctioned by President Clinton in 1995.</p> <p>This photograph by Susan Meiselas was taken in 1989, when the border was more porous and economic migrants regularly made the crossing, mainly to do the myriad low-paid menial jobs that helped keep the American, and in particular the Californian, economy afloat. By then, Meiselas had made her name with her documentary reportage from the long civil war in El Salvador and the Nicaraguan revolution.</p> <p>For her series Crossings, she worked with the migrants and the border security patrols tasked with apprehending them. Many of those sent back to their homeland would try to enter again by different routes, such was their dedication to the dream of reinventing themselves in the US. This image dramatically evokes the precariousness of the immigrant journey by capturing the moment some undocumented workers are discovered by a border patrol officer at the drop-off site they\u2019ve been left at by smugglers after crossing the border. \u201cWhen people are coming across the border, they are giving up on their homeland,\u201d she said later of this photo and others like it. \u201cThat\u2019s a very hard thing to do. There\u2019s an uncertainty; maybe it\u2019s that uncertainty that you are seeing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>1990s: </strong><strong>Eli Reed</strong></h2> <p><strong>Members of the Nation of Islam among the ruins of the Rodney King riots, Los Angeles, California, 1992</strong></p>    <p>The Magnum archive is rich in memorable images of the struggle \u2013 and solidarity \u2013 of African American activists during the civil rights era by the likes of Leonard Freed, Burt Glinn, Bruce Davidson and Danny Lyon. It wasn\u2019t until 1988, 41 years after the agency\u2019s formation, that Eli Reed became the first black member of the organisation. \u201cBy signing him on, the agency granted loftiness to its existence,\u201d Gordon Parks would later attest. Four decades earlier, in 1948, he had made a similar breakthrough when he became <em>Life</em> magazine\u2019s first black staff photographer.</p> <p>From the moment he took up a camera as a young man, Reed\u2019s ambition has been to capture the full range of black people\u2019s experience, from the everyday to the politically seismic, the intimately tender to the collectively traumatic. To this end, his book <em>Black in America</em>, published in 1997, is punctuated throughout with moments of tentative optimism but also tempered by a deep anger and frustration that Reed, an activist with a camera, shared with many of his subjects.</p> <p>This striking image was made in the immediate aftermath of the riots in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four LAPD officers who had been captured on camera a year earlier brutally beating a young black man, Rodney King. It features three besuited members of the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist organisation that believes in the formation of a separate state for African Americans within the US. Despite their extremist views, they are regarded by some in the black community as role models who uphold the traditional values of discipline and self-respect, while espousing self-determination as the only alternative to endemic racism.</p> <p>Here, the three young men stand, alert and yet seemingly unconcerned by the proximity of Reed\u2019s camera, in front of the ruins of a building destroyed in the riots. The stark contrast between their aura of calm authority and the wreckage that signifies chaos and disorder lends the image an edgy complexity. One of the underlying questions posed by Reed\u2019s immersive reportage is how the black community should respond to often murderous police brutality. It has been answered in frequently dramatic fashion in the decades since, most resoundingly in the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which became a global phenomenon after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.</p> <h2><strong>2000s: </strong><strong>Thomas Hoepker</strong></h2> <p><strong>Young people during lunch break in Brooklyn with the </strong><strong>twin </strong><strong>towers burning across the river, 11 September </strong><strong>2001</strong></p>    <p>The terrorist attack on the twin towers in lower Manhattan on the morning of 11 September 2001 was captured by several Magnum photographers, and their images of the cataclysm and its aftermath were published in a large-format book, <em>New York September 11</em>, less than two months after the event. The exception was Thomas Hoepker\u2019s complex and, for some, provocative portrait of a group of young people gathered by the river\u2019s edge in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, while a dense plume of grey smoke billows from the familiar skyline in the middle distance. The image so disoriented its creator that he chose not to include it in the book, waiting until 2006, the fifth anniversary of the attack, before publishing it.</p> <p>Hoepker\u2019s initial anxiety, it turned out, was justified. After its belated publication, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/jul/18/thomas-hoepker-obituary\">Hoepker</a> wrote a short article in response to a column in the <em>New York Times</em> that decried his \u201cshocking\u201d photograph and suggested that the five young people in it were relaxing, having already started to \u201cmove on\u201d from the shock and horror of the attack. Hoepker admitted that he had initially found the image \u201cambiguous and confusing\u201d, and had swiftly come to the conclusion that publishing it so close to the actual event \u201cmight distort the reality as we had felt it on that historic day\u201d.</p> <p>This, in turn, prompted one of the people in the photograph, Walter Sipser, to respond, accusing both Hoepker and the <em>NYT</em> columnist of distorting his reality. He pointed out that the three people chatting to him and his girlfriend were passing strangers, the group having found themselves \u201csuddenly bound together\u2026 in the aftermath of a catastrophe\u201d. Rather than feeling relaxed, they were, he explained, united \u201cin a profound state of shock and disbelief, like everyone else we encountered that day\u201d. A scene that had initially appeared \u201cambiguous and confusing\u201d to the photographer felt cynically manipulative to the subjects, for whom it is a stolen and distorted moment in which nothing but the unimaginable horror unfolding in the background is what it seems. Here, the idea of bearing witness that has traditionally underpinned photojournalism in general, and Magnum in particular, seems to collapse in on itself.</p> <h2><strong>2010s: </strong><strong>Alec Soth</strong></h2> <p><strong>Lockdown drill, Belle Plaine </strong><strong>high </strong><strong>school, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2014</strong></p>    <p>School shootings are a particularly American phenomenon, the deadliest of which have imprinted the names of their locations \u2013 Columbine, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech \u2013 on our collective consciousness. According to a recent CNN report, there were at least 58 shootings on US school grounds and collage campuses between January and mid-October of this year, resulting in 28 deaths and more than 72 injuries. </p> <p>Alec Soth\u2019s dramatic photograph was taken during a school lockdown drill that had interrupted an eight-grade gym class at Belle Plaine high school in his home town, Minneapolis. These kinds of drills are compulsory in more than 20 states. That they are now such a common feature in US schools, that they have become almost normalised, speaks volumes about US gun culture and the failure of legislation to control it. Kenneth Trump, the president of National School Safety and Security Services, told the <em>New York Times:</em> \u201cThe majority of today\u2019s generation of students and school staff view lockdowns as a routine part of the school culture, just as we have viewed fire drills for many years.\u201d </p> <p>Soth\u2019s deftly composed photograph is startling in its stillness and atmosphere of vulnerability. The young girls huddled together, faces hidden in hands, heads bowed in silent thought. Their pale limbs are in dramatic contrast to the deep red of their school T-shirts and the shiny gym lockers. The drama here lies in the dread possibility of what might one day come to pass, and one cannot help but ponder where the schoolgirls\u2019 thoughts have wandered in this silent, confined space. It is an image neither violent nor transgressive but that disturbs all the same in its evocation of a singular kind of collective cognitive dissonance.</p> <h2><strong>2020s: </strong><strong>Peter van Agtmael</strong></h2> <p><strong>Storming of the Capitol, Washington DC, 6 January </strong><strong>2021</strong></p>    <p>The tumultuous events of 6 January 2021, when a riotous mob stormed the Capitol building after an inflammatory speech by Donald Trump, hang like a storm cloud over the imminent US election. As the election results pivoted towards a Democrat victory, Trump had urged his followers to converge on the Capitol to \u201cstop the steal\u201d. Many thousands responded, fighting their way into the Capitol building where they ransacked offices, smashed furniture and wandered the corridors in search of the politicians that Trump had demonised. Chief among them were Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Mike Pence, his presidential running mate, who had refused to challenge the result. Both were perilously close to the rioters inside the building before they were safely evacuated.</p> <p>Peter van Agtmael, whose photojournalism over the past few decades has interrogated the US\u2019s foreign wars and its concurrent domestic discontents was in the midst of the mob at Capitol Hill on the day. From the eye of the hurricane, he captured protesters clashing violently with outnumbered police armed with batons and pepper spray. This image distills the greater scattered disorder that erupted around the Capitol building and the dogged determination of the protesters, one of whom has scaled a high wall, his hand clinging to a marble ledge as he bends to help others beneath him. Only his baseball cap is visible and beyond it a panoramic of the unruly horde spread out across the grounds, many of them carrying US flags.</p> <p>In the background, the tall Washington Monument, built in honour of the first US president, points towards the sky, a symbol of the birth of US democracy. Beneath it, all is chaos and disorder. Van Agtmael\u2019s dramatic image is a vivid distillation of a deeply fractured US. It may also be an augury of more turbulent times to come.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Magnum America</em> by Peter van Agtmael and Laura Wexler is published by Thames &amp; Hudson (\u00a3125).

      "bodyText": "The American photographer Peter van Agtmael experienced a life-changing moment, aged 19, when he happened on a copy of Magnum Degrees, a photobook published in 2000 of dramatic images from the previous decade. \u201cI got an instantaneous education in the beauty, violence, mystery, complexity and simplicity of photography,\u201d he writes in his afterword to Magnum America, a much bigger, more mysterious and complex compendium of photographs spanning nine decades, from postwar 1940s to the present day. Magnum was formed as a cooperative by a group of renowned war photographers, including Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, in 1947. It\u2019s cooperative nature was initially a reflection of its founders\u2019 stoical postwar optimism in the face of the horrors and traumas they had witnessed, but also their shared spirit of creative independence. Magnum America traces the nation\u2019s often turbulent journey from those tentatively optimistic postwar years to the existential anxiety of the present political moment in which democracy itself hangs in the balance. Though punctuated by celebrated portraits and observational series on ordinary American lives, it is the hard-hitting photojournalism that arrests, from Capa\u2019s blurred but powerful images from the D-day landing at Omaha beach to Van Agtmael\u2019s eye-of-the-storm reportage of the siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021. Van Agtmael and his fellow editor, the curator and feminist academic Laura Wexler, have not attempted to create a definitive visual history of the United States as reflexed through the lenses of Magnum photographers, but instead deftly explore ideas of history, culture, myth and national identity. The book comprises 600 images \u2013 some famous, some relatively unknown \u2013 culled from a total of 227,450. The selection here reflects that mix, but concentrates on images of conflict and political drama that are pertinent to today\u2019s fraught pre-election moment. The book is also a revealing social history of Magnum itself: the ideal and the often problematic reality. For too long, it reflected the predominantly white, male world of photojournalism, the exceptions being pioneers such as Eve Arnold, Martine Franck, Inge Morath and, later, Susan Meiselas. And, though Magnum photographers made some of the most memorable images of the black civil rights struggle in the 1960s, it wasn\u2019t until 1988 that Eli Reed became the first black photographer to enter the Magnum fold. That irony went unnoticed for a long time. Today, Magnum is a diverse organisation, but it is its relevance \u2013 and, by extension, photojournalism\u2019s role \u2013 that is also at stake in a world of relentless image-making and instant image-dissemination, an environment unimaginable to its founders. The ongoing carnage in Gaza enters our consciousness daily on social media, where local photojournalists as well as ordinary people with mobile phones bear witness at great risk in the midst of an ongoing humanitarian disaster. Not one photojournalist from Magnum or any other western photo agency has reported from Gaza because of Israel\u2019s refusal to admit even embedded members of the international media. The integral act of bearing witness, which is at the core of Magnum\u2019s collective being, continues just as powerfully all the same. The next big volume of retrospective Magnum images may have to find a way of grappling with that dilemma. 1940s: Robert Capa American troops landing on Omaha beach, D-day, Normandy, France, 6 June 1944 On 6 June 1944, Robert Capa was one of a handful of photographers granted permission to cross the English Channel with allied forces during the D-day operation to liberate occupied France. He travelled with American soldiers from E Company of the 16th Infantry Regiment. This blurred but evocative image was taken in the immediate wake of their arrival at Omaha beach, where they were met with cannon and small arms fire from embedded German troops as they leapt off their landing crafts into cold, choppy waters. It remains one of the most visceral images of that pivotal, but at times chaotic, operation, during which about 4,440 allied soldiers lost their lives and close to 6,000 were wounded. Intriguingly, the circumstances in which the 11 images that comprise Capa\u2019s reportage from Omaha beach were created \u2013 which he described in characteristically self-mythologising fashion in his memoir, Slightly Out of Focus \u2013 have recently been contested. Likewise his contention that they were all that remained of 106 pictures he sent to Life magazine on his return to England, the rest having been mysteriously destroyed after being left too long at a high temperature by an unfortunate lab assistant who was processing them. Whatever the truth, the photographs that were taken under extreme duress during his relatively short time on the beach \u2013 he made it on to a departing boat after a severe panic attack in which his hands were shaking so badly he could not reload his camera \u2013 are a powerful and up-close record of that day\u2019s tumultuous events. There have been several attempts to identify the \u201csoldier in the surf\u201d, with Private Huston \u201cHu\u201d Sears Riley the most likely contender. That he has not been definitively identified lends another level of poignancy to the image. Capa, one of Magnum\u2019s founders, was arguably the most revered photojournalist of the 20th century. His most famous quote epitomised his cavalier approach: \u201cIf your pictures aren\u2019t good enough, you\u2019re not close enough.\u201d In 1954, 10 years after this photograph was taken, he was killed, aged 40, by a landmine in Vietnam, while covering the first Indochina war. 1950s: Elliott Erwitt Wilmington, North Carolina, 1950 Elliott Erwitt was invited to join Magnum by Robert Capa in 1953. Having studied photography and film-making at college in California, Erwitt, aged 25, had already made a name for himself as an editorial photographer for various commercial magazines. He would go on to become one of the world\u2019s most famous image-makers, best known for his striking, slightly surreal pictures of the everyday. His similarly offbeat portraits of dogs have been the subject of five photobooks to date. It is fair to say that Erwitt\u2019s dedication to being, as he put it, \u201cserious about not being serious\u201d has tended to shift attention away from his more unsettlingly powerful images. One of the most rawly observant is his photograph of a grief stricken and bewildered Jackie Kennedy at her husband\u2019s funeral. His photograph Wilmington, North Carolina, 1950 possesses a resonance that is at odds with its neutral geographical title. Like many images in Magnum America, it captures a significant moment, simultaneously evoking the darkness of the US\u2019s past and signalling a turbulent future of hard-won progress. The tentative beginning of the civil rights movement was still four years away when this picture was taken, and it was 14 years before that struggle achieved one of its seminal victories when the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 outlawed segregation. The separate drinking fountains, marked \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cColored\u201d, the one modern and sleekly designed, the other makeshift and worn, speak of a time not that distant when discrimination was a given in certain states. The face of the man crouching over the sink beneath the Colored sign is blurred, and his stance suggests he is looking towards the other fountain that is so close yet out of bounds. As a signifier of the postwar era of US segregation in the south, Erwitt\u2019s grainy image remains starkly affecting and deeply symbolic. 1960s: Paul Fusco Robert Kennedy funeral train, USA, 1968 It was a year of sustained social and political turbulence in the US, the war in Vietnam dividing the country across generational lines and provoking widespread protests that often culminated in violence. The conflict on the streets reached a climax of sorts at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August 1968, when police brutally attacked activists and bystanders, the violence captured on TV cameras and broadcast nationally on news reports. By then, the already divided nation had been traumatised by the recent assassinations of two progressive leaders: the black civil rights figurehead Martin Luther King Jr and the Democratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy. Paul Fusco boarded the train taking Kennedy\u2019s body from New York to Washington focused on how he would cover the senator\u2019s state funeral at Arlington cemetery for Look magazine. When the train emerged from a long dark Manhattan tunnel into daylight, he was taken aback by what he saw. Ordinary citizens, young and old, had gathered in clusters by the railway track, standing in silent homage to the young politician whose death, like his life, had echoed that of his older, more famous brother, President John F Kennedy. The train moved slowly, perhaps out of respect for the dead senator, taking eight hours rather than the usual four to complete its journey. Along the entirety of the route, people congregated trackside in their summer clothes. Fusco shot about 2,000 photos en route to Washington. In them, he freeze-framed for posterity a nation in mourning: families and friends holding hands, men standing to attention to salute, a woman kneeling in prayer. Mostly, though, a seemingly endless succession of ordinary Americans of every race, creed and colour gaze upwards as the train trundles past from city to suburb and on through sun-dappled rural neighbourhoods, their collective silence palpable in every frame. At the time, the editors of Look bafflingly decided not to publish any of Fusco\u2019s extraordinary funeral train series. After the magazine ceased publication in 1971, they remained unseen for another 30 years, consigned to the vast archive of the Library of Congress until they were uncovered by a Magnum researcher. Almost six decades on, they evoke another now distant US, one united in grief but also, as Fusco later put it, \u201cgrateful for the commitment and hope Bobby nurtured in the legions of the poor, the black and countless other forgotten Americans\u201d. 1970s: Alex Webb Nixon resignation, Washington DC, 1974 On 8 August 1974, at 9pm, Richard Nixon, who was facing impeachment and removal from office for his role in the Watergate scandal, announced that he was resigning as president of America. He was the first and as yet only US head of state to do so. \u201cAs president,\u201d he told the country in a live television broadcast from the White House, \u201cI must put the interests of America first.\u201d The evidence of his misdemeanours, as uncovered by the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with the help of an anonymous source known as \u201cDeep Throat\u201d, suggested that sentiment had not been foremost in his mind two years earlier, when a break-in had occurred at the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington DC. It had been carried out by a group devoted to Nixon\u2019s re-election, which included his former close associate G Gordon Liddy. Along with six others, Liddy was subsequently jailed for his part in the burglary. Woodward and Bernstein\u2019s exhaustive investigation also uncovered evidence of wiretaps of the phones of those Nixon considered his most dangerous enemies. The break-in and cover-up was exposed in detail in the televised Watergate hearings that by turns enthralled and appalled the US public over 51 days in 1973. That Nixon hung on in office as long as he did was testament to his tenacity as well as his sense of entitlement. Tricky Dicky, as he came to be known, escaped the humiliation of impeachment and a possible prison sentence and was subsequently pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford. When the news of his resignation broke, Alex Webb evoked the country\u2019s collective response in his image of a single, anonymous individual intensely perusing the Washington Post on the streets of the capital. The front page headline, \u201cNixon Resigns\u201d, resonates across the years, through the subsequent impeachments of Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, as well as the turbulence of the latter\u2019s first term of office, the incendiary nature of his departure from it, and the possibility of his imminent return. \u201cIt changed history,\u201d Woodward recently said of the crimes he helped to uncover. \u201cIt was a red light for presidents.\u201d We may find out soon enough if that is still the case. 1980s: Susan Meiselas US/Mexican border, 8am: undocumented workers discovered in a \u201cdrop off\u201d site, Interstate 5, Oceanside, California, 1989 Throughout his 2016 election campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly promised his faithful that he would construct \u201ca big beautiful wall\u201d between the US and Mexico, one that stretched across its 2,000-mile length, thus ending once and for all the flow of illegal migrants that, he claimed, threatened the security and identity of the US. The construction of a border wall was already well under way long before Trump began his campaign, with more than 600 miles of the southern border barricaded and protected by immigration authorities. It signified the strategy of deterrence through military-style policing that had been officially sanctioned by President Clinton in 1995. This photograph by Susan Meiselas was taken in 1989, when the border was more porous and economic migrants regularly made the crossing, mainly to do the myriad low-paid menial jobs that helped keep the American, and in particular the Californian, economy afloat. By then, Meiselas had made her name with her documentary reportage from the long civil war in El Salvador and the Nicaraguan revolution. For her series Crossings, she worked with the migrants and the border security patrols tasked with apprehending them. Many of those sent back to their homeland would try to enter again by different routes, such was their dedication to the dream of reinventing themselves in the US. This image dramatically evokes the precariousness of the immigrant journey by capturing the moment some undocumented workers are discovered by a border patrol officer at the drop-off site they\u2019ve been left at by smugglers after crossing the border. \u201cWhen people are coming across the border, they are giving up on their homeland,\u201d she said later of this photo and others like it. \u201cThat\u2019s a very hard thing to do. There\u2019s an uncertainty; maybe it\u2019s that uncertainty that you are seeing.\u201d 1990s: Eli Reed Members of the Nation of Islam among the ruins of the Rodney King riots, Los Angeles, California, 1992 The Magnum archive is rich in memorable images of the struggle \u2013 and solidarity \u2013 of African American activists during the civil rights era by the likes of Leonard Freed, Burt Glinn, Bruce Davidson and Danny Lyon. It wasn\u2019t until 1988, 41 years after the agency\u2019s formation, that Eli Reed became the first black member of the organisation. \u201cBy signing him on, the agency granted loftiness to its existence,\u201d Gordon Parks would later attest. Four decades earlier, in 1948, he had made a similar breakthrough when he became Life magazine\u2019s first black staff photographer. From the moment he took up a camera as a young man, Reed\u2019s ambition has been to capture the full range of black people\u2019s experience, from the everyday to the politically seismic, the intimately tender to the collectively traumatic. To this end, his book Black in America, published in 1997, is punctuated throughout with moments of tentative optimism but also tempered by a deep anger and frustration that Reed, an activist with a camera, shared with many of his subjects. This striking image was made in the immediate aftermath of the riots in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four LAPD officers who had been captured on camera a year earlier brutally beating a young black man, Rodney King. It features three besuited members of the Nation of Islam, a black nationalist organisation that believes in the formation of a separate state for African Americans within the US. Despite their extremist views, they are regarded by some in the black community as role models who uphold the traditional values of discipline and self-respect, while espousing self-determination as the only alternative to endemic racism. Here, the three young men stand, alert and yet seemingly unconcerned by the proximity of Reed\u2019s camera, in front of the ruins of a building destroyed in the riots. The stark contrast between their aura of calm authority and the wreckage that signifies chaos and disorder lends the image an edgy complexity. One of the underlying questions posed by Reed\u2019s immersive reportage is how the black community should respond to often murderous police brutality. It has been answered in frequently dramatic fashion in the decades since, most resoundingly in the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which became a global phenomenon after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. 2000s: Thomas Hoepker Young people during lunch break in Brooklyn with the twin towers burning across the river, 11 September 2001 The terrorist attack on the twin towers in lower Manhattan on the morning of 11 September 2001 was captured by several Magnum photographers, and their images of the cataclysm and its aftermath were published in a large-format book, New York September 11, less than two months after the event. The exception was Thomas Hoepker\u2019s complex and, for some, provocative portrait of a group of young people gathered by the river\u2019s edge in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, while a dense plume of grey smoke billows from the familiar skyline in the middle distance. The image so disoriented its creator that he chose not to include it in the book, waiting until 2006, the fifth anniversary of the attack, before publishing it. Hoepker\u2019s initial anxiety, it turned out, was justified. After its belated publication, Hoepker wrote a short article in response to a column in the New York Times that decried his \u201cshocking\u201d photograph and suggested that the five young people in it were relaxing, having already started to \u201cmove on\u201d from the shock and horror of the attack. Hoepker admitted that he had initially found the image \u201cambiguous and confusing\u201d, and had swiftly come to the conclusion that publishing it so close to the actual event \u201cmight distort the reality as we had felt it on that historic day\u201d. This, in turn, prompted one of the people in the photograph, Walter Sipser, to respond, accusing both Hoepker and the NYT columnist of distorting his reality. He pointed out that the three people chatting to him and his girlfriend were passing strangers, the group having found themselves \u201csuddenly bound together\u2026 in the aftermath of a catastrophe\u201d. Rather than feeling relaxed, they were, he explained, united \u201cin a profound state of shock and disbelief, like everyone else we encountered that day\u201d. A scene that had initially appeared \u201cambiguous and confusing\u201d to the photographer felt cynically manipulative to the subjects, for whom it is a stolen and distorted moment in which nothing but the unimaginable horror unfolding in the background is what it seems. Here, the idea of bearing witness that has traditionally underpinned photojournalism in general, and Magnum in particular, seems to collapse in on itself. 2010s: Alec Soth Lockdown drill, Belle Plaine high school, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2014 School shootings are a particularly American phenomenon, the deadliest of which have imprinted the names of their locations \u2013 Columbine, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech \u2013 on our collective consciousness.

The young girls huddled together, faces hidden in hands, heads bowed in silent thought. Their pale limbs are in dramatic contrast to the deep red of their school T-shirts and the shiny gym lockers.

This image distills the greater scattered disorder that erupted around the Capitol building and the dogged determination of the protesters, one of whom has scaled a high wall, his hand clinging to a marble ledge as he bends to help others beneath him. Only his baseball cap is visible and beyond it a panoramic of the unruly horde spread out across the grounds, many of them carrying US flags. In the background, the tall Washington Monument, built in honour of the first US president, points towards the sky, a symbol of the birth of US democracy. Beneath it, all is chaos and disorder. Van Agtmael\u2019s dramatic image is a vivid distillation of a deeply fractured US. It may also be an augury of more turbulent times to come.

They worry that businesses will jack up prices by more than the Fed\u2019s 2% annual inflation target in response to a tight labour market that has kept wage increases steady even as inflation has fallen.</p> <p>However, the most recent jobs data showed the unemployment rate rising from 3.4% to 4.1% over the last 18 months, after hitting 4.3% in July.</p> <p>The closely watched non-farm payroll report on Friday showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/01/us-october-jobs-report\">US economy had added just 12,000 jobs in October</a>. That was well below expectations for 113,000. There were special factors at play \u2013 the impacts of hurricanes Helene and Milton both affected the month, and a strike at Boeing also had an effect. But even so, analysts were aware of these factors when making their forecasts.</p> <p>The weak data means that a larger 0.5-percentage-point reduction in the cost of borrowing is possible. A bigger cut would be welcomed by most US workers, whose wage increases have yet to reverse a noticeable slide in living standards.</p> <p>British workers are similarly hard-pressed and looking forward to a rate cut by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">the Bank of England</a> to ease mortgage and rental costs.</p> <p>Policymakers at the Bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street HQ also meet on 6 November and, like Fed officials, deliver their verdict on 7 November.</p> <p>There is a strong chance the Bank will cut interest rates after governor Andrew Bailey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/03/sterling-pound-bank-of-england-andrew-bailey-aggressive-interest-rate-cuts-inflation\">told the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/03/sterling-pound-bank-of-england-andrew-bailey-aggressive-interest-rate-cuts-inflation\">Guardian</a></em> that it could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in doing so if inflation continued to cool. That was before the latest official figures showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/16/uk-inflation-bank-of-england-interest-rates\">UK inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September</a> \u2013 below the Bank\u2019s 2% target and the lowest level in three and a half years.</p> <p>The Bank will have a big advantage over the Fed, and that relates to the political backdrop for its decisions.</p> <p>While the Fed will be in the dark about the tax and spending policies of the incoming president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-bets-on-public-spending-increases-in-budget-winning-over-voters\">Labour\u2019s budget last week</a> gives the Bank a good view of the government\u2019s finances five years ahead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It follows that, on both sides of the Atlantic, these two economies could be running neither too hot or too cold in a year\u2019s time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By some measures, the budget restricts government spending, giving Bailey and his colleagues room to cut rates at a faster pace. The only cross-current comes from investment spending, which Rachel Reeves said would rise substantially after relaxing government borrowing rules.</p> <p>A dash for growth could put pressure on prices if it leads to a jump in demand for skilled workers, and those workers demand higher pay in a bidding war between employers. This scenario may mean the Bank judges that rates need to stay higher for longer.</p> <p>Yet investment is likely only to rise slowly, whatever ministers say about the urgency \u2013 allowing inflation to remain low, wages to increase only modestly and interest rates to continue on their downward path.</p> <p>It follows that, on both sides of the Atlantic, these two economies could be running neither too hot or too cold in a year\u2019s time, having regained their sense of balance after a disorientating period of rocketing inflation.</p> <p>The only blot on the landscape is the US election, which could wreck this careful choreography. A disputed result, or a Trump victory, will probably send markets into a spin, upsetting the return to something like normality.</p>",

Markets currently expect Fed boss Jerome Powell to announce a 0.25-percentage-point reduction in interest rates, to a spread between 4.5% and 4.75%, at a press conference on 7 November. There are doubts among some Fed officials about whether the defeat of inflation has been permanent and lasting. They worry that businesses will jack up prices by more than the Fed\u2019s 2% annual inflation target in response to a tight labour market that has kept wage increases steady even as inflation has fallen. However, the most recent jobs data showed the unemployment rate rising from 3.4% to 4.1% over the last 18 months, after hitting 4.3% in July. The closely watched non-farm payroll report on Friday showed the US economy had added just 12,000 jobs in October. That was well below expectations for 113,000. There were special factors at play \u2013 the impacts of hurricanes Helene and Milton both affected the month, and a strike at Boeing also had an effect. But even so, analysts were aware of these factors when making their forecasts. The weak data means that a larger 0.5-percentage-point reduction in the cost of borrowing is possible. A bigger cut would be welcomed by most US workers, whose wage increases have yet to reverse a noticeable slide in living standards. British workers are similarly hard-pressed and looking forward to a rate cut by the Bank of England to ease mortgage and rental costs. Policymakers at the Bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street HQ also meet on 6 November and, like Fed officials, deliver their verdict on 7 November. There is a strong chance the Bank will cut interest rates after governor Andrew Bailey told the Guardian that it could become a \u201cbit more aggressive\u201d in doing so if inflation continued to cool. That was before the latest official figures showed UK inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September \u2013 below the Bank\u2019s 2% target and the lowest level in three and a half years. The Bank will have a big advantage over the Fed, and that relates to the political backdrop for its decisions. While the Fed will be in the dark about the tax and spending policies of the incoming president, Labour\u2019s budget last week gives the Bank a good view of the government\u2019s finances five years ahead. By some measures, the budget restricts government spending, giving Bailey and his colleagues room to cut rates at a faster pace. The only cross-current comes from investment spending, which Rachel Reeves said would rise substantially after relaxing government borrowing rules. A dash for growth could put pressure on prices if it leads to a jump in demand for skilled workers, and those workers demand higher pay in a bidding war between employers. This scenario may mean the Bank judges that rates need to stay higher for longer. Yet investment is likely only to rise slowly, whatever ministers say about the urgency \u2013 allowing inflation to remain low, wages to increase only modestly and interest rates to continue on their downward path. It follows that, on both sides of the Atlantic, these two economies could be running neither too hot or too cold in a year\u2019s time, having regained their sense of balance after a disorientating period of rocketing inflation. The only blot on the landscape is the US election, which could wreck this careful choreography. A disputed result, or a Trump victory, will probably send markets into a spin, upsetting the return to something like normality.",

      "body": "<p>The best thing that happened to me during the whole of the pandemic was a story on the internet. An Oregon resident, furloughed, saw on a daytime nature documentary that, if you fed crows, they would bring you <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ki6fnd/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/\">small gifts</a>. Curious, they tried it, and were delighted to find themselves in effective possession of a 15-strong crow family \u2013 but then things took a dark turn. The crows became an army, fiercely protective of their leader\u2019s property. If neighbours came near, the crows would dive-bomb them. \u201cTo be clear,\u201d the person wrote on Reddit, \u201cthey\u2019re not aggressive 100% of the time. If just the neighbours are out [on their own porch], they are friendly, normal crows. They only get aggressive when someone gets close to me or my property.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s such a lovely phrase, \u201cfriendly, normal crows\u201d; it\u2019s just a pity that it\u2019s an oxymoron. Crows are the most prodigious grudge-holders \u2013 something that John Marzluff, a professor of wildlife at the University of Washington, Seattle, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/science/crows-grudges-revenge.html\">discovered by capturing</a> seven of the birds while wearing an ogre mask in 2006. A full 17 years later, crows were still regularly attacking him. Even if you were to query the ethics of his original experiment, you\u2019d have to admit that he paid a high price. How such a thing is possible when the lifespan of a crow is only 12 years is this: not only can they hold a grudge, they can also pass it on to one another. Originally, even birds that witnessed the ogre-trap attacked Marzluff, then over time they transmitted the hostility to their offspring, creating a multigenerational grudge.</p> <p>We can\u2019t say this for certain, given there are so many species and only one Marzluff, but it seems likely to me that we are the only species who can match this level of grudge-holding, without which there would be no Romeo and Juliet, no Wuthering Heights and no Lee \u201cthe Jester\u201d Greig and Drew Galloway, the professional wrestlers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2rlY267943W0DzBLz3qJcvq/why-do-we-hold-grudges-and-can-they-ever-be-good-for-us\">whose career-long animus</a> propelled them to, well, maybe not worldwide fame, but certainly to a lot more wrestling. I personally don\u2019t have the concentration span for a grudge; I started a feud with my sister once \u2013 a vast grievance, set down on paper \u2013 and it evaporated in 15 seconds, when at a family gathering, she said she liked my mascara.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/20/in-my-war-against-pigeons-all-i-have-is-a-broom-but-the-rats-of-the-sky-remain-unflappable\">In my war against pigeons, all I have is a broom. But the \u2018rats of the sky\u2019 remain unflappable | Calla Wahlquist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cliche about resentment is that it\u2019s like eating poison and waiting for the other person to die; ultimately, you\u2019ll only harm yourself. There is a huge body of research on grudge-bearing\u2019s opposite, <a href=\"https://www.templeton.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Forgiveness_final.pdf\">forgiveness, and its benefits to health</a>, which include but are not limited to better cardiovascular, immune and respiratory systems. You also have to wonder what bitterness says about you personally; <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353942521_Examining_the_lived_experience_of_holding_grudges\">a research paper in 2021</a> \u2013 around the same time the crow army was getting going \u2013 identified the drives and traits of the grudge holder: \u201ca need for validation, moral superiority, inability to let go, latency (ie, existing but not manifest), severing ties\u201d. Do you want to be that person? Because they sound like a prick, no?</p> <p>Yet the fact that it exists in the animal kingdom surely suggests that there\u2019s some evolutionary benefit to it, which is the case Robert Enright, a psychologist from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, makes: particularly among athletes, short-term grudges have an observable motivational effect.</p> <p>It\u2019s only when they are so pronounced and long range as to become part of your identity that they\u2019re a problem, effectively trapping you in a dyad with your nemesis, so that you can\u2019t grow unless they do, and you will never know whether they have, because their identity has calcified in your mind. Paradoxically, this leaves you quite dependent on them, which I observed when my father died, and my mother \u2013 who\u2019d separated from him 25 years before, but nursed a healthy, even life-affirming rage all that time \u2013 had a heart attack.

      "bodyText": "The best thing that happened to me during the whole of the pandemic was a story on the internet. An Oregon resident, furloughed, saw on a daytime nature documentary that, if you fed crows, they would bring you small gifts. Curious, they tried it, and were delighted to find themselves in effective possession of a 15-strong crow family \u2013 but then things took a dark turn. The crows became an army, fiercely protective of their leader\u2019s property. If neighbours came near, the crows would dive-bomb them. \u201cTo be clear,\u201d the person wrote on Reddit, \u201cthey\u2019re not aggressive 100% of the time. If just the neighbours are out [on their own porch], they are friendly, normal crows. They only get aggressive when someone gets close to me or my property.\u201d It\u2019s such a lovely phrase, \u201cfriendly, normal crows\u201d; it\u2019s just a pity that it\u2019s an oxymoron. Crows are the most prodigious grudge-holders \u2013 something that John Marzluff, a professor of wildlife at the University of Washington, Seattle, discovered by capturing seven of the birds while wearing an ogre mask in 2006. A full 17 years later, crows were still regularly attacking him. Even if you were to query the ethics of his original experiment, you\u2019d have to admit that he paid a high price. How such a thing is possible when the lifespan of a crow is only 12 years is this: not only can they hold a grudge, they can also pass it on to one another. Originally, even birds that witnessed the ogre-trap attacked Marzluff, then over time they transmitted the hostility to their offspring, creating a multigenerational grudge. We can\u2019t say this for certain, given there are so many species and only one Marzluff, but it seems likely to me that we are the only species who can match this level of grudge-holding, without which there would be no Romeo and Juliet, no Wuthering Heights and no Lee \u201cthe Jester\u201d Greig and Drew Galloway, the professional wrestlers whose career-long animus propelled them to, well, maybe not worldwide fame, but certainly to a lot more wrestling. I personally don\u2019t have the concentration span for a grudge; I started a feud with my sister once \u2013 a vast grievance, set down on paper \u2013 and it evaporated in 15 seconds, when at a family gathering, she said she liked my mascara. The cliche about resentment is that it\u2019s like eating poison and waiting for the other person to die; ultimately, you\u2019ll only harm yourself. There is a huge body of research on grudge-bearing\u2019s opposite, forgiveness, and its benefits to health, which include but are not limited to better cardiovascular, immune and respiratory systems. You also have to wonder what bitterness says about you personally; a research paper in 2021 \u2013 around the same time the crow army was getting going \u2013 identified the drives and traits of the grudge holder: \u201ca need for validation, moral superiority, inability to let go, latency (ie, existing but not manifest), severing ties\u201d. Do you want to be that person? Because they sound like a prick, no? Yet the fact that it exists in the animal kingdom surely suggests that there\u2019s some evolutionary benefit to it, which is the case Robert Enright, a psychologist from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, makes: particularly among athletes, short-term grudges have an observable motivational effect. It\u2019s only when they are so pronounced and long range as to become part of your identity that they\u2019re a problem, effectively trapping you in a dyad with your nemesis, so that you can\u2019t grow unless they do, and you will never know whether they have, because their identity has calcified in your mind. Paradoxically, this leaves you quite dependent on them, which I observed when my father died, and my mother \u2013 who\u2019d separated from him 25 years before, but nursed a healthy, even life-affirming rage all that time \u2013 had a heart attack. I wonder if she\u2019d mind that \u2013 either my interpretation, or my saying it so publicly. She\u2019ll just have to wear it, unfortunately, because I\u2019m on a deadline. Here, the multigenerational grudge looks particularly problematic: the original insult is only totemic to the second generation, which ironically makes it harder to shift, even while it is less authentically felt. That Oregon resident, by the way, was given a solution by the local Audubon Society: if the neighbours also started feeding the crows, the grudge would vanish and the crows would happily split their fealty between multiple households.

If you talk to her ex-ministers, quite a lot of them would say they\u2019d go to meetings with her and it was obvious she hadn\u2019t read the brief. That\u2019s not a great precedent. You\u2019ve got to show up \u2013 if when you do show up it\u2019s to pick a fight, that doesn\u2019t seem ideal. You can bore voters into voting for you like Keir Starmer and John Major did, you can charm them like Tony Blair \u2013 and to some extent Boris Johnson \u2013 did, but you can\u2019t argue them into voting for you. So policy-wise and politically, she\u2019s a very difficult choice to understand the party making. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">With what she said about maternity leave</a>, she has damaged the political prospects of lots and lots of candidates up and down the country in the general election.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A </strong><strong>(non-Tory) friend who </strong><strong>met her when she was at the London Assembly:</strong></p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not part of any gang and that allows her to speak her mind without worrying too much about whether she\u2019s going to lose support from this person or that person and that. For most people who are not in Westminster, that\u2019s rather an attractive quality, because the sense you get is that there\u2019s a person who\u2019s speaking the truth as she sees it \u2013 which is a rare thing in politics. Of course, it means that she very easily loses friends, and she loses friends all the time. I don\u2019t think it is true that she goes about looking for fights, but she is very sensitive to slights [and] her basic approach to life is: \u2018I will give as good as I get, and if somebody comes after me they\u2019d better not expect any mercy.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very sensitive to the feeling that people will treat her differently and have different expectations of her because of her ethnicity, and fed up of people listening to her talk about being a Conservative and then trying to interpret what she\u2019s saying purely through the lens of \u2018isn\u2019t it strange that a black person would be a Conservative?\u2019 I suspect the thing she hates most of all is that this picture is being built of her that she\u2019s a person who doesn\u2019t think about things deeply. She also never says thank you \u2013 she thinks a lot of the common courtesies in politics, and all the \u2018let\u2019s have drinks, let\u2019s go around the tea room\u2019, aren\u2019t really a courtesy at all but are tricks and hypocrisies that politicians use to kid people about things.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A former </strong><strong>Tory special adviser who worked for a different minister while </strong><strong>Badenoch was in cabinet:</strong></p> <p>\u201cKemi Badenoch wasn\u2019t loved in DBT [the Department for Business and Trade] \u2013 she didn\u2019t want to be there, and they could tell. She cornered Rishi Sunak at the cabinet awayday after a machinery of government change because she didn\u2019t want business added to her portfolio \u2013 it was more work and two whole bills. She wouldn\u2019t take boxes home during recess and was often un-contactable on weekends. She would block write-rounds without grounds to do so other than she disagreed ideologically. She\u2019s divisive, lazy and antagonistic. All that being said, so long as she can turn her ire on Starmer, and not sow more division within the ranks, she might be OK \u2013 as she is smart, at least.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A fellow MP and friend:</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be entertaining. She\u2019s going to destroy Keir [Starmer] at the dispatch box \u2013 she doesn\u2019t hold back. She just says what she feels \u2013 she\u2019s often very sharp and very to the point, sometimes without necessarily being able to predict the backlash. That\u2019s in direct contrast to Keir, who is so cautious about potential backlash that he doesn\u2019t really say anything of substance, ever. We got to know each other when she was pregnant and had very small children, when she would come and lie down in the ladies\u2019 room and got chatting. It\u2019s so odd to read that she\u2019s lazy \u2013 that is the exact opposite of the woman I know. She never stops working. I would message and ask her a question about something and she\u2019s in a foreign country at ridiculous o\u2019clock and she\u2019ll reply. She really is a hard worker at all hours while juggling the children.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A Tory MP who was among her first backers:</strong></p> <p>\u201cWhat you see is very much what you get. She\u2019s been under the spotlight from day one and hasn\u2019t let her pressure get to her or changed who she is. She has done her job and she\u2019s delivered on merit knowing people were watching and judging her. She doesn\u2019t jump to change things even when she\u2019s under pressure to do so \u2013 but when she does move, it\u2019s substantive. When you\u2019ve got [Vladimir] Putin thinking how to smash Ukraine in the next few years and you\u2019ve got Xi [Jinping] thinking how to dominate in the next 20, I want somebody who thinks beyond the next news cycle.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2024. Kemi Badenoch was born in Wimbledon and raised in Nigeria, not the other way around as we had it in an earlier version.</p>",

You\u2019ve got to show up \u2013 if when you do show up it\u2019s to pick a fight, that doesn\u2019t seem ideal. You can bore voters into voting for you like Keir Starmer and John Major did, you can charm them like Tony Blair \u2013 and to some extent Boris Johnson \u2013 did, but you can\u2019t argue them into voting for you. So policy-wise and politically, she\u2019s a very difficult choice to understand the party making. With what she said about maternity leave, she has damaged the political prospects of lots and lots of candidates up and down the country in the general election.\u201d A (non-Tory) friend who met her when she was at the London Assembly: \u201cShe\u2019s not part of any gang and that allows her to speak her mind without worrying too much about whether she\u2019s going to lose support from this person or that person and that. For most people who are not in Westminster, that\u2019s rather an attractive quality, because the sense you get is that there\u2019s a person who\u2019s speaking the truth as she sees it \u2013 which is a rare thing in politics. Of course, it means that she very easily loses friends, and she loses friends all the time. I don\u2019t think it is true that she goes about looking for fights, but she is very sensitive to slights [and] her basic approach to life is: \u2018I will give as good as I get, and if somebody comes after me they\u2019d better not expect any mercy.\u2019 \u201cShe\u2019s very sensitive to the feeling that people will treat her differently and have different expectations of her because of her ethnicity, and fed up of people listening to her talk about being a Conservative and then trying to interpret what she\u2019s saying purely through the lens of \u2018isn\u2019t it strange that a black person would be a Conservative?\u2019 I suspect the thing she hates most of all is that this picture is being built of her that she\u2019s a person who doesn\u2019t think about things deeply. She also never says thank you \u2013 she thinks a lot of the common courtesies in politics, and all the \u2018let\u2019s have drinks, let\u2019s go around the tea room\u2019, aren\u2019t really a courtesy at all but are tricks and hypocrisies that politicians use to kid people about things.\u201d A former Tory special adviser who worked for a different minister while Badenoch was in cabinet: \u201cKemi Badenoch wasn\u2019t loved in DBT [the Department for Business and Trade] \u2013 she didn\u2019t want to be there, and they could tell. She cornered Rishi Sunak at the cabinet awayday after a machinery of government change because she didn\u2019t want business added to her portfolio \u2013 it was more work and two whole bills. She wouldn\u2019t take boxes home during recess and was often un-contactable on weekends. She would block write-rounds without grounds to do so other than she disagreed ideologically. She\u2019s divisive, lazy and antagonistic. All that being said, so long as she can turn her ire on Starmer, and not sow more division within the ranks, she might be OK \u2013 as she is smart, at least.\u201d A fellow MP and friend: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be entertaining. She\u2019s going to destroy Keir [Starmer] at the dispatch box \u2013 she doesn\u2019t hold back. She just says what she feels \u2013 she\u2019s often very sharp and very to the point, sometimes without necessarily being able to predict the backlash. That\u2019s in direct contrast to Keir, who is so cautious about potential backlash that he doesn\u2019t really say anything of substance, ever. We got to know each other when she was pregnant and had very small children, when she would come and lie down in the ladies\u2019 room and got chatting. It\u2019s so odd to read that she\u2019s lazy \u2013 that is the exact opposite of the woman I know. She never stops working. I would message and ask her a question about something and she\u2019s in a foreign country at ridiculous o\u2019clock and she\u2019ll reply. She really is a hard worker at all hours while juggling the children.\u201d A Tory MP who was among her first backers: \u201cWhat you see is very much what you get. She\u2019s been under the spotlight from day one and hasn\u2019t let her pressure get to her or changed who she is. She has done her job and she\u2019s delivered on merit knowing people were watching and judging her. She doesn\u2019t jump to change things even when she\u2019s under pressure to do so \u2013 but when she does move, it\u2019s substantive. When you\u2019ve got [Vladimir] Putin thinking how to smash Ukraine in the next few years and you\u2019ve got Xi [Jinping] thinking how to dominate in the next 20, I want somebody who thinks beyond the next news cycle.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2024. Kemi Badenoch was born in Wimbledon and raised in Nigeria, not the other way around as we had it in an earlier version.",

By Sunday morning, Rosoman had raised more than \u00a34,000 and is hoping to hit a target of \u00a35,000. He said the most difficult part was running in \u201c12 hours of pitch black\u201d through the night with little to no visibility because of heavy mist. Rosoman said the highlight was crossing the finish line at Abergavenny railway station to see his daughters and wife, who \u201cran up and gave me a hug\u201d. He thanked those who joined him on his challenge and people who donated to his fundraiser. \u201cJust thanks for all of the support I got from people, everybody who came to run out with me, donated and shared,\u201d he said. Rosoman hopes his endeavours will inspire men to take on their own challenges. \u201cI just wanted to promote this message of challenges, essentially,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s just about having aims, goals, but grand aims and grand goals that are bigger than yourself, that are more important than going to the pub, and it will give you that sort of purpose.\u201d",

Better performances at the bigger events could help to push Boulter into the top 20 next year but considering simply maintaining her position inside the top 30 will be challenging, the 358 points she has gained in the past two weeks could be very helpful. \u201cAt the start of the year, I started so strong, I put myself in a place where I probably hadn\u2019t got any experience in,\u201d Boulter said. \u201cI felt like I had to adjust a little bit, trying to get used to that, adjust my goals again because I already had specific goals that I wanted to reach all year round but I did those quite quickly. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s going to be super important to reset the mind, another career high going into Monday. I\u2019m going to have to push for some [new] goals. I\u2019ve got some goals in mind but I think they\u2019re going to stick with my team. I\u2019m really excited to really push on next year, I\u2019ve got big hopes and I\u2019m going all in.\u201d Although her individual season is over, Boulter still has one more tournament to play in 2024. She will lead the Great Britain team at the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in M\u00e1laga, where they will face Germany on 15 November.",

But for some Americans, much of Project 2025 isn\u2019t a distant possible future \u2013 it is a current-day reality.</p> <p>In several states across the country, there are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/abortion-bans-healthcare-maternal-mortality\">extreme abortion bans</a> that have led to the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-abortion-ban-amber-thurman-death\">multiple pregnant women</a> and <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/01/nevaeh-crain-death-texas-abortion-ban-emtala/\">at least one teen</a>; restrictive voting policies that make it difficult for citizens to cast their ballots; defunding of education and censorship of books; and other such policies that have also been proposed by the authors of Project 2025. If the plan is successfully implemented, many policies that are already reshaping some states would become federal laws.</p> <p>Project 2025 is \u201ca fascist blueprint for governance\u201d, said Lea Campbell, the founding president of the Mississippi Rising Coalition, a grassroots organization that supports lower-income communities. But Mississippi, she said, which has an entrenched conservative majority, is already dealing with many of the proposed policies, specifically the policing and surveilling of marginalized people.</p>    <p>Families across Mississippi are still rebuilding after the largest immigration raid in the country, which happened <a href=\"https://www.wapt.com/article/mississippi-ice-raid-5-years-later/61825647\">five years ago.</a> In 2019, on the first day of school, scores of children returned home to find that their parents were part of 680 people who were taken into custody, some of whom were <a href=\"https://immigrantjustice.org/research-items/explainer-ongoing-harms-trump-era-mississippi-raids-and-immigration-prosecutions\">subsequently deported,</a> after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided seven poultry plants. Under Project 2025, <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/news/project-2025-is-a-pathway-to-mass-deportations-and-family-separation\">mass deportations</a> would be expedited, further tearing families apart.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been sounding the alarm for more than 10 years, just around the policies in this state, enacted by conservatives that target the most vulnerable among us,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying about policies under this ultra-conservative legislature that we have here in Mississippi [that] the cruelty is the point, it seems, with a lot of this legislation that targets poor people and people of color, and women, and the queer and trans community.\u201d</p> <p>Even when voters have made it clear that they disagree with proposed conservative policies, lawmakers have found ways to maneuver around their wishes.</p> <p>In 2011, 58% of Mississippians rejected a \u201cpersonhood amendment\u201d, which, had it passed, would have defined fertilized eggs as people. Opponents warned that because of the way <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2011/11/08/142159280/mississippi-voters-reject-personhood-amendment\">the amendment defined life</a>, it would ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest, and it would have complicated in vitro fertilization.</p>    <p>Still, in 2013, the state, along with Kansas, Kentucky, Wyoming, Ohio and North Dakota attempted to pass so-called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/abortion-laws-states.html\">\u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bills,</a> in which abortion is banned after as early as six weeks once cardiac activity is detected. For several years, multiple states tried to pass similar bills and other restrictions. By 2019, 15 states introduced \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bills; six were successful in passing them.</p> <p>Project 2025 aims to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/project-2025-abortion\">enforce the Comstock Act</a>, a 151-year-old anti-obscenity law that prohibits the mailing of abortion-related materials. Doing so could lead to a de facto nationwide ban on abortion, as abortion clinics and advocates rely on the mail to send and receive abortion pills. The plan also indicates a goal of legally recognizing fetuses as people.</p> <p>Currently in Mississippi, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/16/abortion-pills-mail-usps/\">drug-sniffing dogs</a> have been used to intercept abortion pills. And in nearby Louisiana, two common abortion pills that are also often used for miscarriage management, softening the cervix during labor and other procedures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/louisiana-abortion-pills\">have been reclassified</a> as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d, despite doctors warning that doing so will harm women.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>As it stands, organizers and activists in states that have proto-Project 2025 policies are able to push for change on a state and local level. If Project 2025 were implemented, however, many of those policies could become federally enshrined, drastically changing the way lawmakers and advocates can push to repeal such laws.</p> <p>Nsombi Lambright-Haynes, the executive director of One Voice Mississippi, a civil rights organization, said that the non-profit has been encouraging people to vote by educating them about what Project 2025 would do to the public education system and to reproductive rights.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pointing out what we already have and then pointing out the danger that can come if something like this is fully implemented,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really like a wake-up call.\u201d</p> <h2><strong> </strong><strong>A \u2018beacon\u2019 to get people \u2018fervent in their racism\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Two years ago, Jackson, Mississippi\u2019s capital and the Blackest city in the country, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/01/jackson-mississippi-clean-drinking-water-flooding-problems\">without water</a> <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/news/2023/06/28/timeline-jackson-mississippi-water-problems\">for more than a month</a> due to decades of the state refusing to invest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/07/jackson-mississippi-water-outage-neighbors-helping\">infrastructure</a>. Danyelle Holmes, an organizer with the non-profit Poor People\u2019s Campaign, said that implementing Project 2025 nationwide would worsen the rest of the country\u2019s infrastructure woes.</p> <p>\u201cProject 2025 supports removing clean water protection,\u201d she said. \u201cThat puts marginalized communities really at a very vulnerable place and position, as we\u2019re feeling the impact of not having access to clean and safe drinking water.\u201d</p>    <p>Project 2025 would downgrade per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from being classified as \u201chazardous\u201d to \u201ccontaminants\u201d, and it would eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Toxic Substances Control Act, preventing the government from adequately monitoring the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/heres-what-makes-project-2025-so-dangerous-our-environment-opinion-1946400\">cumulative effect of toxins.</a></p> <p>The plan could <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2023/09/05/dark-right-wing-network-recruits-maga-army-to-replace-50k-workers-plans-to-purge/\">\u201cerode the country\u2019s system </a>of checks and balances\u201d, according to an analysis by Salon, increasing the president\u2019s power over all of the federal government. But many states have already given such extreme powers to their state officials.</p> <p>In Texas, for instance, the <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/183101/texas-death-star-summer-heat-effect\">\u201cDeath Star\u201d bill</a> prevents cities and counties from passing measures that are stronger than those passed at the state level across a broad range of policy areas. While in Florida, Ron DeSantis, the governor, has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/16/florida-ron-desantis-governor-legislature-power/\">augmented his own power</a> by using the state\u2019s republican supermajority to cement his ideas into law.</p> <p>Project 2025 would eliminate <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-would-end-dhs-law-enforcement-training/\">Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC),</a> an interagency law enforcement training body, increase the use of the federal death penalty, eliminate the use of consent decrees and increase the use of mandatory minimum sentences, according to <a href=\"https://tminstituteldf.org/project-2025-public-safety-criminal-legal-system/\">an analysis</a> by the Thurgood Marshall Institute, the research arm of the Legal Defense Fund.</p>    <p>In Mississippi, police departments across the state have already been embroiled in controversy.

      "bodyText": "Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a second Trump presidency, has been used as a warning by Democrats to highlight what would be in store for the country if he were to win the upcoming election. But for some Americans, much of Project 2025 isn\u2019t a distant possible future \u2013 it is a current-day reality. In several states across the country, there are already extreme abortion bans that have led to the deaths of multiple pregnant women and at least one teen; restrictive voting policies that make it difficult for citizens to cast their ballots; defunding of education and censorship of books; and other such policies that have also been proposed by the authors of Project 2025. If the plan is successfully implemented, many policies that are already reshaping some states would become federal laws. Project 2025 is \u201ca fascist blueprint for governance\u201d, said Lea Campbell, the founding president of the Mississippi Rising Coalition, a grassroots organization that supports lower-income communities. But Mississippi, she said, which has an entrenched conservative majority, is already dealing with many of the proposed policies, specifically the policing and surveilling of marginalized people. Families across Mississippi are still rebuilding after the largest immigration raid in the country, which happened five years ago. In 2019, on the first day of school, scores of children returned home to find that their parents were part of 680 people who were taken into custody, some of whom were subsequently deported, after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided seven poultry plants. Under Project 2025, mass deportations would be expedited, further tearing families apart. \u201cWe have been sounding the alarm for more than 10 years, just around the policies in this state, enacted by conservatives that target the most vulnerable among us,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying about policies under this ultra-conservative legislature that we have here in Mississippi [that] the cruelty is the point, it seems, with a lot of this legislation that targets poor people and people of color, and women, and the queer and trans community.\u201d Even when voters have made it clear that they disagree with proposed conservative policies, lawmakers have found ways to maneuver around their wishes. In 2011, 58% of Mississippians rejected a \u201cpersonhood amendment\u201d, which, had it passed, would have defined fertilized eggs as people. Opponents warned that because of the way the amendment defined life, it would ban all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest, and it would have complicated in vitro fertilization. Still, in 2013, the state, along with Kansas, Kentucky, Wyoming, Ohio and North Dakota attempted to pass so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bills, in which abortion is banned after as early as six weeks once cardiac activity is detected. For several years, multiple states tried to pass similar bills and other restrictions. By 2019, 15 states introduced \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bills; six were successful in passing them. Project 2025 aims to enforce the Comstock Act, a 151-year-old anti-obscenity law that prohibits the mailing of abortion-related materials. Doing so could lead to a de facto nationwide ban on abortion, as abortion clinics and advocates rely on the mail to send and receive abortion pills. The plan also indicates a goal of legally recognizing fetuses as people. Currently in Mississippi, drug-sniffing dogs have been used to intercept abortion pills. And in nearby Louisiana, two common abortion pills that are also often used for miscarriage management, softening the cervix during labor and other procedures have been reclassified as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d, despite doctors warning that doing so will harm women.

Get our free app and sign up for election alerts As it stands, organizers and activists in states that have proto-Project 2025 policies are able to push for change on a state and local level. If Project 2025 were implemented, however, many of those policies could become federally enshrined, drastically changing the way lawmakers and advocates can push to repeal such laws. Nsombi Lambright-Haynes, the executive director of One Voice Mississippi, a civil rights organization, said that the non-profit has been encouraging people to vote by educating them about what Project 2025 would do to the public education system and to reproductive rights. \u201cWe are pointing out what we already have and then pointing out the danger that can come if something like this is fully implemented,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really like a wake-up call.\u201d A \u2018beacon\u2019 to get people \u2018fervent in their racism\u2019 Two years ago, Jackson, Mississippi\u2019s capital and the Blackest city in the country, was without water for more than a month due to decades of the state refusing to invest in infrastructure. Danyelle Holmes, an organizer with the non-profit Poor People\u2019s Campaign, said that implementing Project 2025 nationwide would worsen the rest of the country\u2019s infrastructure woes. \u201cProject 2025 supports removing clean water protection,\u201d she said. \u201cThat puts marginalized communities really at a very vulnerable place and position, as we\u2019re feeling the impact of not having access to clean and safe drinking water.\u201d Project 2025 would downgrade per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from being classified as \u201chazardous\u201d to \u201ccontaminants\u201d, and it would eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Toxic Substances Control Act, preventing the government from adequately monitoring the cumulative effect of toxins. The plan could \u201cerode the country\u2019s system of checks and balances\u201d, according to an analysis by Salon, increasing the president\u2019s power over all of the federal government. But many states have already given such extreme powers to their state officials. In Texas, for instance, the \u201cDeath Star\u201d bill prevents cities and counties from passing measures that are stronger than those passed at the state level across a broad range of policy areas. While in Florida, Ron DeSantis, the governor, has augmented his own power by using the state\u2019s republican supermajority to cement his ideas into law. Project 2025 would eliminate Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), an interagency law enforcement training body, increase the use of the federal death penalty, eliminate the use of consent decrees and increase the use of mandatory minimum sentences, according to an analysis by the Thurgood Marshall Institute, the research arm of the Legal Defense Fund. In Mississippi, police departments across the state have already been embroiled in controversy. Six law enforcement officers in Rankin county were convicted for torturing two Black men, while a federal investigation found that police in a majority-Black town elsewhere in the state have \u201ccreated a system where officers can relentlessly violate the law\u201d. Project 2025 would make it so that the rest of the country experiences the restrictive, conservative lawmaking that many southerners have been organizing against for years, said Courtney Jones, a writer and researcher with \u2018SippTalk Media, a digital media platform, said. \u201cThere\u2019s no part of this nation that is untouched by the harm that racism does. Project 2025 is more of a beacon to get people to be more fervent in their racism,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of whispering about it or doing political loopholes, now they\u2019re just directly saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to take these small things that we\u2019ve been doing to these specific populations and now we\u2019re just going to amplify them. And we\u2019re going to make this happen across the entire country.\u2019\u201d Jones noted that organizers in the state and region had long been trying to warn the rest of the country about what was happening and what might soon come for them. Their warnings were met with dismissal, he said, as people believed \u201cthat\u2019s just Mississippi for you\u201d. \u201cThe people here that are doing the work have always been doing the work,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people in Mississippi recognize that because we\u2019ve always been overlooked, that we have to kind of look within in order to save ourselves.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a photo somewhere \u2013 taken to preserve history \u2013 of me swabbing my inner cheek with a cotton stick, ready for DNA testing to find my roots. Two years earlier, in 2008, my mother had died by suicide, aged 60. The coroner had said she was extraordinarily healthy for a woman her age, which only exposed the gulf between her physical and mental states. It was this sudden, shocking loss that propelled me to find a deeper meaning in my life.</p> <p>My mother had left Jamaica aged 10 to join her father and stepmother in England. Similarly, my father left the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis as a teenager, to study maths and engineering. They met, married and settled in a suburb of London, where I was born and raised.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been proud of my identity as a person of Black Caribbean origin, and I knew the stories of my paternal great-grandfather who was born at the tail end of slavery in St Kitts, the twin island to Nevis. He grew up to be a successful entrepreneur in the construction industry and was instrumental in setting up the first organisation in St Kitts that would act as a trade union. But I knew nothing of my African ancestry before the transatlantic slave trade until I came across a DNA testing company called <a href=\"https://africanancestry.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorels_GoISptR1-TqyX3yJ8EpHGol67gQEKez89pumkvgxfv2Gt\">African Ancestry</a>.</p> <p>I took a test that enables a person to discover the specific ethnicity of their mother\u2019s maternal line, up to 2,000 years ago. Three weeks later, I found out that I\u2019m descended from the Fang and Tikar people of Cameroon and Gabon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s that feeling you belong to a group that gives you a sense of identity and wholeness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So much of popular psychology focuses on the need to individuate and self-actualise. But the need to belong to a race, culture and community is hard-wired into us, and is an integral part of our sense of self. So, how is identity formed? How do we know who we are?</p> <p><em><strong>\u201cIdentity development</strong></em> is an extremely complex process that\u2019s influenced by a variety of factors,\u201d explains Dr Sarah Gaither of the Department of Psychology &amp; Neuroscience at Duke University. \u201cThese include where you\u2019re living, messages your parents, peers or teachers give you, and encounters and experiences where someone may question you or notice something different about you. Usually, these encounters cause someone to go and learn about whatever that identity or difference may be. They either accept that part of themselves by learning to internalise it, or decide that the identity doesn\u2019t match their sense of self.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Gaither\u2019s own career has been shaped by growing up as a biracial Black/White woman, which led her to research how having multiple racial and social identities affects a person\u2019s behaviours. \u201cAs humans, we all have a fundamental need to socially belong,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling you belong to a group that gives you a sense of identity and wholeness. And importantly, people\u2019s identities often change across the lifespan.\u201d</p> <p>Since the age of six, I\u2019d known I was a writer, after a teacher praised a story I wrote. My mother had taught me the alphabet before I went to school and I quickly started reading. She helped nurture my love of literature by taking me to the library every week.</p> <p>By the age of nine, I was devouring as many magazines as I could get my hands on and knew I wanted to be a journalist. I was also fascinated by the mechanics of songwriting, and would listen to Madonna songs on repeat, pulling apart the lyrics to understand how to construct my own songs. By the time my mother died, I\u2019d been a working journalist for eight years, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d ever read a single article I\u2019d written \u2013 she showed zero interest in this core part of me. In this she was as ever a woman of contradictions.</p> <p>Discovering that the Tikar people of Cameroon were known for their artistry and storytelling made me realise my deep-rooted love of writing was grounded in something bigger than me. According to the <a href=\"https://rootsrevealed.com/\">Roots Revealed blog</a>, many Tikar people were gifted in writing, acting, dancing and music. Despite my mother\u2019s lack of interest I could believe there was a set of ancestors who would have embraced my writerly self and encouraged me to share my stories.</p> <p>In their golden age, they held political and financial power in Cameroon through exporting iron and bronze, masks and sculptures. They were targeted by traffickers who, driven by envy, sought to bring about their downfall. They thought that the trafficked Tikar people were destroyed, but they were seeds who were replanted and, despite all odds, bloomed. This narrative of true resilience, grit and determination is truly inspiring.</p> <p>\u201cFinding your ancestral roots can bring a new way of thinking about your identities, and past and present belonging,\u201d says Gaither. \u201cImmersing yourself in learning your history can bring a new sense of self and purpose, since it can connect you to something bigger.\u201d</p> <p>According to a 2019 YouGov survey, an estimated 4.7 million people in the UK have used a DNA testing kit, while 60% of the population were interested in taking a DNA test. When Emma Parsons-Reid\u2019s mother did a test six years ago, it led to the discovery she was descended from Danish royalty. \u201cWe are descendants of Queen Estrid [who was born around 997] and my mother was allowed to visit her tomb privately in Denmark, as she proved she was related,\u201d says the 57-year-old grandmother from Cardiff. \u201cIt\u2019s put a spring in my step and has made me more daring \u2013 I stand up for myself. I\u2019ve been assertive about bad service and I call out bad behaviour if I see wrongdoing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For some people, learning about their past can be hurtful. If it brings up things you didn\u2019t know</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, DNA testing can come at a cost. Gaither explains: \u201cFor some people, learning about their past can be hurtful. If it brings up things you didn\u2019t know, you can feel inaccurate about yourself. This dissonance in identifying one way, but knowing something contradictory can be difficult to overcome.\u201d</p> <p>But can discovering your ancestral roots help you to express dormant parts of your own personality? \u201cScience has been very clear that, biologically, there is no such thing as race \u2013 it\u2019s a social construct,\u201d says Keon West, author of <em>The Science of Racism</em> (to be published by Picador in January). \u201cThe associations we make between race and our preferences and activities are dubious at best. Generally, people are good at the things they practise, regardless of their ancestry. That said, it can be helpful to remember that the world is full of a large variety of diverse people, and that what is considered weird in one culture is perfectly normal in another. British men, according to stereotypes, notoriously hate dancing. A British man who can\u2019t resist the call of dance might take comfort in discovering that he is part Cuban, Trinidadian or Russian, as this can remind him that there are places in the world where dancing is a normal, valued trait in men. This would transform him, in his own mind, from an odd Brit, to a dancer from a line of dancers.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Tom Bratchford,</strong></em> a 48-year-old Australian, had always felt an affinity with the ocean and with fjords and forests, despite living in the suburbs of Adelaide. He was adopted by a family with English and Irish roots, and when he found his birth mother 27 years ago, it all made sense. \u201cI feel such a connection to the ocean that I used to say that I wanted to be buried at sea. Then I found out that my natural mother is from a shipbuilding family in Norway,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always drawn to Norse mythology and Scandinavia and didn\u2019t know why. Now, I feel connected to a place on the other side of the world, and I feel pride and a sense of belonging in knowing who I am deep down.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that discovering your genetic heritage can be the missing puzzle piece in helping people embrace who they are. \u201cWe all feel like the odd ones out sometimes, and there are parts of all of us that clash with our local cultures,\u201d says West. \u201cDiscovering our genetic heritage can remind us that we belong to more of the world than our own little towns, and that we are more complex and diverse, even as individuals, than we generally think.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving her homeland, my mother never returned to Jamaica.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a photo somewhere \u2013 taken to preserve history \u2013 of me swabbing my inner cheek with a cotton stick, ready for DNA testing to find my roots. Two years earlier, in 2008, my mother had died by suicide, aged 60. The coroner had said she was extraordinarily healthy for a woman her age, which only exposed the gulf between her physical and mental states. It was this sudden, shocking loss that propelled me to find a deeper meaning in my life. My mother had left Jamaica aged 10 to join her father and stepmother in England. Similarly, my father left the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis as a teenager, to study maths and engineering. They met, married and settled in a suburb of London, where I was born and raised. I\u2019ve always been proud of my identity as a person of Black Caribbean origin, and I knew the stories of my paternal great-grandfather who was born at the tail end of slavery in St Kitts, the twin island to Nevis. He grew up to be a successful entrepreneur in the construction industry and was instrumental in setting up the first organisation in St Kitts that would act as a trade union. But I knew nothing of my African ancestry before the transatlantic slave trade until I came across a DNA testing company called African Ancestry. I took a test that enables a person to discover the specific ethnicity of their mother\u2019s maternal line, up to 2,000 years ago. Three weeks later, I found out that I\u2019m descended from the Fang and Tikar people of Cameroon and Gabon. So much of popular psychology focuses on the need to individuate and self-actualise. But the need to belong to a race, culture and community is hard-wired into us, and is an integral part of our sense of self. So, how is identity formed? How do we know who we are? \u201cIdentity development is an extremely complex process that\u2019s influenced by a variety of factors,\u201d explains Dr Sarah Gaither of the Department of Psychology &amp; Neuroscience at Duke University. \u201cThese include where you\u2019re living, messages your parents, peers or teachers give you, and encounters and experiences where someone may question you or notice something different about you. Usually, these encounters cause someone to go and learn about whatever that identity or difference may be. They either accept that part of themselves by learning to internalise it, or decide that the identity doesn\u2019t match their sense of self.\u201d In fact, Gaither\u2019s own career has been shaped by growing up as a biracial Black/White woman, which led her to research how having multiple racial and social identities affects a person\u2019s behaviours. \u201cAs humans, we all have a fundamental need to socially belong,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling you belong to a group that gives you a sense of identity and wholeness. And importantly, people\u2019s identities often change across the lifespan.\u201d Since the age of six, I\u2019d known I was a writer, after a teacher praised a story I wrote. My mother had taught me the alphabet before I went to school and I quickly started reading. She helped nurture my love of literature by taking me to the library every week. By the age of nine, I was devouring as many magazines as I could get my hands on and knew I wanted to be a journalist. I was also fascinated by the mechanics of songwriting, and would listen to Madonna songs on repeat, pulling apart the lyrics to understand how to construct my own songs. By the time my mother died, I\u2019d been a working journalist for eight years, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d ever read a single article I\u2019d written \u2013 she showed zero interest in this core part of me. In this she was as ever a woman of contradictions. Discovering that the Tikar people of Cameroon were known for their artistry and storytelling made me realise my deep-rooted love of writing was grounded in something bigger than me. According to the Roots Revealed blog, many Tikar people were gifted in writing, acting, dancing and music. Despite my mother\u2019s lack of interest I could believe there was a set of ancestors who would have embraced my writerly self and encouraged me to share my stories. In their golden age, they held political and financial power in Cameroon through exporting iron and bronze, masks and sculptures. They were targeted by traffickers who, driven by envy, sought to bring about their downfall. They thought that the trafficked Tikar people were destroyed, but they were seeds who were replanted and, despite all odds, bloomed. This narrative of true resilience, grit and determination is truly inspiring. \u201cFinding your ancestral roots can bring a new way of thinking about your identities, and past and present belonging,\u201d says Gaither. \u201cImmersing yourself in learning your history can bring a new sense of self and purpose, since it can connect you to something bigger.\u201d According to a 2019 YouGov survey, an estimated 4.7 million people in the UK have used a DNA testing kit, while 60% of the population were interested in taking a DNA test. When Emma Parsons-Reid\u2019s mother did a test six years ago, it led to the discovery she was descended from Danish royalty. \u201cWe are descendants of Queen Estrid [who was born around 997] and my mother was allowed to visit her tomb privately in Denmark, as she proved she was related,\u201d says the 57-year-old grandmother from Cardiff. \u201cIt\u2019s put a spring in my step and has made me more daring \u2013 I stand up for myself. I\u2019ve been assertive about bad service and I call out bad behaviour if I see wrongdoing.\u201d However, DNA testing can come at a cost. Gaither explains: \u201cFor some people, learning about their past can be hurtful. If it brings up things you didn\u2019t know, you can feel inaccurate about yourself. This dissonance in identifying one way, but knowing something contradictory can be difficult to overcome.\u201d But can discovering your ancestral roots help you to express dormant parts of your own personality? \u201cScience has been very clear that, biologically, there is no such thing as race \u2013 it\u2019s a social construct,\u201d says Keon West, author of The Science of Racism (to be published by Picador in January). \u201cThe associations we make between race and our preferences and activities are dubious at best. Generally, people are good at the things they practise, regardless of their ancestry. That said, it can be helpful to remember that the world is full of a large variety of diverse people, and that what is considered weird in one culture is perfectly normal in another. British men, according to stereotypes, notoriously hate dancing. A British man who can\u2019t resist the call of dance might take comfort in discovering that he is part Cuban, Trinidadian or Russian, as this can remind him that there are places in the world where dancing is a normal, valued trait in men. This would transform him, in his own mind, from an odd Brit, to a dancer from a line of dancers.\u201d Tom Bratchford, a 48-year-old Australian, had always felt an affinity with the ocean and with fjords and forests, despite living in the suburbs of Adelaide. He was adopted by a family with English and Irish roots, and when he found his birth mother 27 years ago, it all made sense. \u201cI feel such a connection to the ocean that I used to say that I wanted to be buried at sea. Then I found out that my natural mother is from a shipbuilding family in Norway,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always drawn to Norse mythology and Scandinavia and didn\u2019t know why. Now, I feel connected to a place on the other side of the world, and I feel pride and a sense of belonging in knowing who I am deep down.\u201d It\u2019s clear that discovering your genetic heritage can be the missing puzzle piece in helping people embrace who they are. \u201cWe all feel like the odd ones out sometimes, and there are parts of all of us that clash with our local cultures,\u201d says West. \u201cDiscovering our genetic heritage can remind us that we belong to more of the world than our own little towns, and that we are more complex and diverse, even as individuals, than we generally think.\u201d After leaving her homeland, my mother never returned to Jamaica. She said the circumstances of her leaving were too sad to ever return. Shortly after taking that DNA test, I visited Jamaica for the first time, finally able to piece together some parts of my more recent history. Of my mother\u2019s life, I have fragments \u2013 photos, stories, hearsay \u2013 and events forever etched in my consciousness that remain largely unspoken.

In response to his request, they created a 15-page slide deck entitled The Next Empire: Leveraging a Changing World to Save Civilization. It contained ideas that seem plucked out of a dystopian science fiction movie. According to their presentation, the city-state they envisaged would become a magnet for \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d medical research, which in turn would open the door to the \u201cmass production of genetically selected humans\u201d.</p> <p>The voting rights of citizens of the city-state would be linked to their value to society, according to the Collinses\u2019 presentation. The proposed city-state government would have \u201cincentive systems that grant more voting power to creators of economically productive agents\u201d and would be run by a single \u201cexecutor\u201d \u2013 which the proposal also called a \u201cdictator\u201d \u2013 with full control of the government\u2019s laws and operational structure. The executor would be replaced every four years by three \u201cwards\u201d, according to the slide deck.

But the Collinses are part of a movement they call the \u201cnew right\u201d, which rejects some aspects of traditional conservatism and bills itself as pragmatic, family-oriented and anti-bureaucratic. They staunchly support the Republican ticket, Donald Trump and JD Vance, and billionaire Elon Musk.</p> <p>Last year, Malcolm Collins said he thought the Isle of Man would be the best place to begin.</p> <p>\u201cI actually think that\u2019s the most viable place to do it. You\u2019re near the center of Europe, you\u2019re in a rapidly depopulating area, you can tell them look, this will obviously bring a lot of technology and investment to your country. But the great thing about a proposal like this is even if they turn it down, you can take it to other countries,\u201d Malcolm told the man purporting to be an investor at the time.</p> <p>The funding never materialized and the proposal was never pitched to the Isle of Man, a British crown dependency located in the Irish Sea, because the man who claimed to be a wealthy investor was actually an undercover researcher with Hope Not Hate, a UK-based anti-racism group. It shared video recordings of the encounters with the Collinses \u2013 and a copy of their presentation \u2013 with the Guardian.</p> <p>Asked about the slide deck in an interview with the Guardian last week in their home in Audubon, Pennsylvania, Simone and Malcolm, who work together and appear rarely to be apart, acknowledged that their proposal \u201cwasn\u2019t supposed to be public\u201d. But Simone Collins nevertheless said she stood by its core tenets \u201c100%\u201d, including the idea of mass-producing embryos, and of giving people who they deem to be less productive members of society less voting power.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are draining resources, you should have less influence,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked about how it felt to be the subject of undercover research, Malcolm Collins said: \u201cThe experience was quite validating for both us and our movement.\u201d He added: \u201cNow I think it is pretty clear that despite us not socially isolating people with toxic views, the worst views we actually have are being slightly elitist and weird eccentrics (which isn\u2019t exactly surprising to anyone).\u201d</p> <p>The couple say their ideas were meant to be experimental and fit for a city-state, not a democracy such as the US. But the views are not dissimilar to ones expressed by one of Simone and Malcolm\u2019s political heroes, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance. In a July 2021 speech, Vance said parents should be given \u201can advantage\u201d and \u201cmore power\u201d in the voting process than those who don\u2019t have children.</p> <p>Simone Collins previously worked as managing director of Dialog, which she describes as an exclusive secret society, co-founded by Peter Thiel. Thiel, the PayPal founder, helped launch and fund Vance\u2019s political career, and has supported the rightwing blogger Curtis Yarvin, who in 2012 said he believed the US should install a monarchy and \u201cget over their dictator phobia\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018We do target the elites\u2019</h2> <p>The Collinses often describe their pronatalist agenda in humanitarian terms \u2013 part of a wider bid to save the developed world from impending social and economic catastrophe. Their website outlines their desire to work with \u201cany person or organization that shares our goal to preserve as much of civilization and as many cultures as possible\u201d.</p> <p>But in the recordings made by Hope Not Hate, Malcolm describes their pronatalist agenda as being principally designed to transform the current socioeconomic elite into a future biological elite.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget how small the population of people in the world who actually impacts anything or matters is,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we do our campaigns we work really aggressively on how do we spread ideas within that narrow network, because also they are the people we want having kids and we want in the future.\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cWhen we talk to reporters we\u2019re very \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t just for the elites\u2019, but, in truth, we do target the elites \u2013 ha ha \u2013 unfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>Malcolm said he and his wife are working to create a network of other pronatalist families, with whom their children can go to summer camp, grow up alongside \u201cknowing this isn\u2019t weird, what we\u2019re doing\u201d and, ultimately, marry. But this goes beyond the average desire to find family friends with shared values and be part of a community. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really trying to do is ensure that my kids have an isolated and differential breeding network,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The so-called \u201celites\u201d appear to be a central preoccupation for the Collinses and it is a theme they return to repeatedly and unprompted. \u201cThe very few families \u2013 and I think we might be talking about a hundred, 500 families in the world today \u2013 who are high fertility and really technologically engaged and economically engaged \u2026 own the future of our species,\u201d Malcolm said.</p> <p>When the Guardian asked the Collinses about the remarks, Malcolm said they were \u201cnot incongruent with our other messaging\u201d, and that they were better off \u201cconvincing Taylor Swift to have kids than John Doe on the street if we want to create ripple effects society-wide leading to more kids\u201d.</p> <h2>Race for the statehouse</h2> <p>Simone Collins\u2019s run to represent Pennsylvania\u2019s 150th district in the state\u2019s house of representatives was born, she said, out of frustration with traditional political campaigns. She acknowledges that her odds of success are low and that she has eschewed traditional local campaign tactics, like investing in ads or mailers.</p> <p>But she is a big supporter of Donald Trump\u2019s run for the presidency and has sought through her own candidacy, which has mostly been self-funded by what she calls the family\u2019s \u201cwhat the hell\u201d savings account, to encourage so-called low propensity voters in her Pennsylvania district to boost the former president\u2019s chances.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very interested in tipping the election [in Trump\u2019s favor] and one of the most meaningful ways I can do so is as a Republican candidate running in a key, key swing spot,\u201d she said. The Collinses have done this, she said, by printing out \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of mail-in ballot applications, filling them out, and sending them to potential Republican voters to sign and send back so that they can be sent mail-in ballots. She said it is part of an effort to examine whether there are \u201clow-cost and highly effective ways\u201d to sway election results, even in Democratic-leaning districts like hers, where incumbent Democrat Joe Webster was first elected in 2018. Records show Webster has spent about $80,000 on his campaign, while Collins has spent just under $5,000.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough money to send mail-in ballot applications to every low-propensity voter, but we\u2019ll look after the election of what percent of those people voted,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asked whether there are aspects of Trump\u2019s candidacy that trouble her \u2013 from his criminal convictions to being found liable for sexual assault \u2013 Collins said she is no more troubled by the Republican nominee\u2019s record than that of Kamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic nominee.</p> <p>\u201cNobody elects a president. You elect a team,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many smart people I know are tapped into who his team is going to be.\u201d</p> <p>She is most excited about billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s high-profile involvement in the Trump campaign, and the Republican nominee\u2019s promise that Musk would lead a cost cutting and \u201cefficiency\u201d drive in government spending. Musk has admitted it would lead to \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d for Americans.</p> <p>Musk is reportedly a father of \u201cat least\u201d 11 children, according to a recent New York Times report that detailed the Tesla co-founder\u2019s effort to fill a compound full of his own children and their mothers. Although he has been open about his pronatalist views, the New York Times reported that Musk likes to keep details about his own growing family a secret.</p> <p>It is the emergence of Silicon Valley as key partners in \u201cthe new right\u201d that has the couple most excited about Republicans today. The Skype co-founder and Estonian billionaire Jaan Tallinn (a father of five) <a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h2-recommendations\">donated</a> just under half a million dollars to the Collinses\u2019 pronatalist foundation in 2022.</p> <h2>The issues</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very pro-gun. If you walk around this house you\u2019ll find guns all over the place,\u201d Simone Collins said, pointing to an old musket that is mounted on the wall. She said the guns are locked up and not loaded, and that ammunition is kept in proximity. While others might not like the constant sound of gunfire from a nearby gun club and shooting range, Collins said she loved the sound.</p> <p>Child protective services (CPS), the state agency people can call if they fear a child is being abused or neglected, has visited the Collinses at home on two occasions. Asked what prompted the first visit, Malcolm told the Guardian in a written statement that it \u201cwas supposedly because our kids were wearing used clothing, played outside in our fenced-in yard (with us watching from inside), and got sick frequently (this was before we took them out of preschool and during a time when sickness in preschools post-pandemic was brutal as kids returned from isolation)\u201d.</p> <p>The second visit by CPS, Simone Collins said, followed the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/25/american-pronatalists-malcolm-and-simone-collins\">the last Guardian article</a> about the couple, published in May, which included a description of how Malcolm had slapped their then two-year-old on the face for nearly knocking over a table in a restaurant. Slapping a child is legal in Pennsylvania if it doesn\u2019t cause serious pain or injury.</p>    <p>\u201cAfter the Guardian piece came out, CPS was here again. They walked through every room of this house because the internet decided that we were abusive, terrible people. They came again. I feel bad wasting their time. They\u2019re like, \u2018Please don\u2019t beat your infants, or whatever. But no, you\u2019re obviously fine,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Some voters in her district have called her directly to ask about her stance on issues, including abortion. Abortion is legal in Pennsylvania up until 24 weeks, though there are some restrictions in place. Simone Collins said she would support what in effect would amount to an abortion ban in the state after 12 to 15 weeks, with exceptions if a woman\u2019s life was in danger or the fetus had an anomaly. Any abortion performed after 15 weeks, she said, would have to include giving the fetus pain medication.</p> <p>Collins is, however, an unabashed advocate for IVF, which is opposed by many conservative and anti-abortion Republicans. Simone and Malcolm have used IVF themselves and plan to continue having more children. They also are \u201chuge early supporters\u201d of embryo selection based on a \u201cpolygenic score\u201d related to intelligence. In other words, selecting embryos based on IQ.</p> <p>Collins is planning for her next embryo transfer in January.</p>",

Voters expressed anger at slow growth, deindustrialisation and mass migration. The Covid pandemic exposed the fragility of global supply chains.

Despite securing 42% of the vote in the first round, Sandu faces a tough challenge in Sunday\u2019s runoff against an opposition bloc led by Alexandr Stoianoglo of the Socialist party, which aligns with Moscow. The election in this small nation of under 3 million people in south-eastern Europe follows a referendum in which a slim majority voted in favour of pursuing membership of the EU. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moldova has gravitated between pro-western and pro-Russian courses. But under Sandu, a former World Bank adviser, the impoverished country has accelerated its push to escape Moscow\u2019s orbit amid its war in neighbouring Ukraine. The results of the referendum and first round of the election were marred by allegations of a Moscow-backed vote-buying scheme. Sandu and her allies have accused Russia and its proxies of leading a large-scale campaign involving vote-buying and misinformation to sway the election.

He later apologised, having clarified his view that opponents should be allowed to challenge the haka. </p> <p>\u201cPlaying for England always felt like I was living in a dream bubble,\u201d Marler, who will continue to play for Harlequins, wrote on social media. \u201cI kept waiting for it to pop and me to suddenly go back to being a gobby, overweight 16-year-old again. But you know when it\u2019s time. </p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do what I used to do as well as I once could. I can\u2019t keep talking about my family being my priority unless they actually are. I want to keep it untarnished, all these memories of my career, both good and bad. I don\u2019t want to leave my house with my kids crying. I\u2019m ready to make the change. </p> <p>\u201cThe first teammate I told was Dan Cole. We were sharing a room at the England hotel. I hugged him, he hugged me. The conversation went a bit like this: I love you mate. I love you too. What\u2019s up? I\u2019m done, mate. I know you are.\u201d </p> <p>Marler has retired previously from international rugby, in 2018, only to reverse his decision in time for the 2019 World Cup, but at 34 another change of heart is unlikely. He has four children with his wife, Daisy, and has spoken candidly about his struggles with spending long periods in camp away from his family. In 2016 he withdrew from the summer tour of Australia and though he was talked into making himself available for the World Cup last year by Borthwick, having previously not appeared for England since the 2022 Six Nations, it was clear he took some convincing.</p> <p>While Marler accepted a place in Borthwick\u2019s squad for the Autumn Nations Series and took part in the warm-weather training camp in Girona, a well-placed source has pointed to how Marler has had to battle back from a broken foot to regain fitness last month as well as how he has fallen down the England pecking order with Ellis Genge fit again after missing the summer tour and his \u00adHarlequins teammate Fin \u00adBaxter emerging on to the scene. As a result, Marler realised his heart was no longer in it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful that I got to play 95 times for my country,\u201d Marler said. \u201cI have to pinch myself. Did I really do that? I\u2019m grateful to all those people who showed patience as I kept messing up. I\u2019m grateful to the fans who made each match special. I\u2019m grateful to the teammates who pushed alongside or behind me, and the ones who could do all the things with the ball that I can\u2019t. But most of all I\u2019m grateful to Daisy, Jasper, \u00adMaggie, Felix and Pixie for the unwavering support. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sad to say goodbye to international rugby. But, I\u2019m really proud, too. Time to exit one dream bubble; time to enter a new one. Big Love x.\u201d</p> <p>Marler\u2019s retirement is a setback for Borthwick. It is understood he was sympathetic to the decision last week but after the defeat by the All Blacks he sought to blame the inexperience of his current squad. Of the 2023 World Cup squad, Courtney Lawes, Owen Farrell, Ben Youngs, Jonny May, Manu Tuilagi, Billy Vunipola and now Marler have all either retired or made themselves unavailable for selection. </p> <p>\u201cJoe has been an outstanding servant to English rugby \u2013 a tough, uncompromising competitor on the field, and a genuine, one-of-a-kind personality off it,\u201d Borthwick said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Joe Marler instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Of the 2023 World Cup squad, Courtney Lawes, Owen Farrell, Ben Youngs, Jonny May, Manu Tuilagi, Billy Vunipola and now Marler have all either retired or made themselves unavailable for selection. \u201cJoe has been an outstanding servant to English rugby \u2013 a tough, uncompromising competitor on the field, and a genuine, one-of-a-kind personality off it,\u201d Borthwick said.",

Ronnie used to send out some of his gang to pick up young boys, 14-year-olds, so he could have sex with them. It was very sadistic. They were psychopaths. Ronnie was schizophrenic as well.

The new film will tell the story from the perspective of the police and ordinary people, including the barmaid of the Blind Beggar pub, who witnessed the 1966 shooting. Burdis said: \u201cThe Krays terrorised her. She went through a terrible time with threats. It needs to be told.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Stushki, head of Ark Movie Productions, which is producing the film, said: \u201cI used to think that the old 1960s mobsters were cool.

Internal polls show Trump ahead but some of those numbers have been so rosy in recent weeks that aides have grown distrustful about their accuracy.</p> <p>The Trump campaign has also been nervous about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/north-carolina-election-votes-hurricane-helene\">North Carolina</a> \u2013 a state they really have to hold this year \u2013 evidenced by the multiple trips Trump is making to the state in the final weekend.

He suggested Latinos loved to have sex, Black people carved watermelons and in the most damaging line, called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage.</p> <p>The complaints and condemnations poured in before Trump even got to his speech later that evening. In a sign that the campaign knew how damaging the moment had become, the campaign quickly issued a statement distancing Trump from the Puerto Rico comments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-2024-election-subversion\">The big lie 2.0: Trump plan to subvert 2024 election more organized than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the news cycle about the Puerto Rico rhetoric continued for days, prolonged by Trump being unable to resist trying to call the rally a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/oct/29/donald-trump-defends-his-madison-square-garden-rally-as-love-fest-video\">love fest</a>\u201d at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, while aides have fretted that it may have offended thousands of Puerto Rican families in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>In the final months of the campaign, Trump has been even more freewheeling in his dark rhetoric than ever, shifting from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/trump-wisconsin-immigration-speech\">accusing</a> undocumented immigrants of raping and killing Americans to saying they are running sex slave rings, as he tries to beat into the public consciousness that Harris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/trump-harris-campaign-of-hate\">was to blame</a> as a failed border tsar.</p> <p>The Harris campaign has used Trump\u2019s remarks to cast him as divisive and fascist, believing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/harris-trump-fascist-hitler-comments-election\">fascist label</a> is helping her sway moderate Republicans as they home in on a trifecta of messages that also includes support for abortion rights and promising to lower the cost of living.</p>",

The confidence is mainly coming from two places: some polls that show Trump ahead in every battleground state and Republicans holding on to early vote leads in places like Nevada, which they extrapolate to read that the Sun belt states may be increasingly out of reach for Harris. One internal model shows Trump potentially winning five of the seven battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2013 which would put him comfortably over the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election, one person said. The Trump campaign leadership is also taking solace in their polls showing a majority of the country thinks the country is on the wrong track \u2013 what they see as a leading indicator for momentum \u2013 and election forecasters such as Nate Silver putting Trump\u2019s odds of victory at 55% to Harris at 45%. The picture that emerges from interviews with multiple Trump advisers, pollsters, aides and others close to the former president is that they feel comfortable but restless about their position. However, a public display of confidence by the campaign \u2013 which has also involved Trump aides saying his recent one-off rallies in New Mexico and Virginia are because they are expanding the electoral map even though the New Mexico trip is understood to have been at the request of a donor \u2013 is also softening the ground to contest the results if Trump loses. Trump and his many campaign surrogates have been engaged in a strategy of publicly raising expectations among their followers which may create a well-spring of discontent should Harris win, especially if her victory is narrow or propelled over the line by a late-breaking wave of Democratic ballots. \u201cIf we could bring God down from heaven and he\u2019d be the vote counter, we\u2019d win this, we\u2019d win California, we\u2019d win a lot of states,\u201d Trump said last week in a typical piece of bombast about his prospects. But internal sources tell the Guardian they are universally jittery about the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, through which most of Trump\u2019s paths to 270 electoral college votes run. Internal polls show Trump ahead but some of those numbers have been so rosy in recent weeks that aides have grown distrustful about their accuracy. The Trump campaign has also been nervous about North Carolina \u2013 a state they really have to hold this year \u2013 evidenced by the multiple trips Trump is making to the state in the final weekend. Trump had two rallies in North Carolina on Saturday, one on Sunday and another on Monday. And despite their elation at record numbers of Republicans voting early this cycle, it has been difficult to gauge whether those Trump supporters who voted early were people who would have voted anyway, thereby cannibalizing the election day vote, or if they are new voters, according to two people familiar with the data. The anxiety comes with Trump aides having no way to gauge the impact of his rally at Madison Square Garden last weekend where speakers used racist and crude tropes about Puerto Rico, Latinos and African Americans that generated instant backlash from officials and voters alike. The first speaker, the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, told a series of jokes that drew little laughter but may have alienated those key constituencies. He suggested Latinos loved to have sex, Black people carved watermelons and in the most damaging line, called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. The complaints and condemnations poured in before Trump even got to his speech later that evening. In a sign that the campaign knew how damaging the moment had become, the campaign quickly issued a statement distancing Trump from the Puerto Rico comments. But the news cycle about the Puerto Rico rhetoric continued for days, prolonged by Trump being unable to resist trying to call the rally a \u201clove fest\u201d at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, while aides have fretted that it may have offended thousands of Puerto Rican families in Pennsylvania. In the final months of the campaign, Trump has been even more freewheeling in his dark rhetoric than ever, shifting from accusing undocumented immigrants of raping and killing Americans to saying they are running sex slave rings, as he tries to beat into the public consciousness that Harris was to blame as a failed border tsar. The Harris campaign has used Trump\u2019s remarks to cast him as divisive and fascist, believing the fascist label is helping her sway moderate Republicans as they home in on a trifecta of messages that also includes support for abortion rights and promising to lower the cost of living.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m totally off my face,\u201d cries sound-healer <a href=\"https://www.suarasoundhealing.com/debbi-walker\">Debbi Walker</a>. It\u2019s 11.45am and she\u2019s just finished bathing me in a cacophony of twinkling sounds reminiscent of something Tinkerbell would appear to. (I had tried to focus on connecting with my \u201cinner wisdom\u201d, but my ears instead tune into a woman outside the tent talking about the amount of crystals hidden in her underwear drawer.) I\u2019m part of a group experiencing the gentle tap of metal pipes and tuning forks around our heads, while we sway and rock to the vibrations. Debbi, who has curly silver hair flowing down to her waist, looks like an ethereal goddess as she dances between us in a floor-length grey corseted dress. I\u2019m encouraged to hold hands with strangers as we hum in various pitches (mine mainly<em> out</em> of tune) and whisper blessings such as \u201clove\u201d and \u201cgratitude\u201d into a sound-healing bowl.</p> <p>I\u2019m here for the annual <a href=\"https://fairyfestival.co.uk/\">3 Wishes Fairy Festival</a>, a gathering \u201cnestling on a leyline\u201d in Glastonbury full of folk music, folklore and those who believe in magic. Earlier in the day, while picking up my morning coffee, an elf beside me ordered \u201cpancakes and strawberries with fairy dust on top, please.\u201d Neon pink glitter blew past as he carried it away.</p>    <p>More than 1,500 people attend this quirky event over three days. <a href=\"https://www.faeryevents.com/\">Karen Kay</a>, the founder, claims to be \u201chalf fairy, half mermaid and half human\u201d and has put fairies into the mainstream; she believes in them so much that she left her job as a BBC news editor to do this full-time. While the event is family-friendly, this is not to be mistaken as a children\u2019s festival and mainly adults attend. The event describes itself as a \u201cgathering of the Celtic faerie clans\u201d. In 2018, they broke the world record for the most people wearing unicorn horns in a single location. There are no rules other than \u201cbe nice\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about spreading love, light and joy into the world,\u201d explains Kay.</p> <p><em><strong>Before </strong></em><em><strong>Debbi Walker </strong></em>became a sound therapist, her background was in NHS nursing, \u201cbut the job made me very sick,\u201d she explains, adding that she was housebound with chronic fatigue syndrome. But then, \u201cI found sound at a festival in 2010 and it changed my life.\u201d She acknowledges that it took a while for her science brain to come around but, after doing a clinical trial about how sound helps mental health, she left nursing to teach sound healing full-time.</p>    <p>\u201cWe were in a beautiful sacred sound bubble just now, it is a bit hippy and airy-fairy, but I marry this with the world of science,\u201d she says. Before we part ways, I offer to join her for a drink later. \u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d she replies and it takes me a few seconds to realise she wasn\u2019t \u201coff her face\u201d in the way I\u2019d interpreted earlier. She was, instead, drunk on the healing energy and positive effects of the atmosphere around her.</p> <p>After pulling me and the <em>Observer</em> photographer into a group hug, Debbi disappears into a sea of bubbles and fairy wings, leaving me to move on to a spot of enchanted wand-making, where I am allowed to go feral with beads and ribbon. Afterwards, I make my way through the crowd with my new creation, past <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-style picnic tables, wooden structures not dissimilar to what you\u2019d find in an enchanted forest and picnic blankets full of teacups and crockery. There are stalls filled with crystals, windchimes, fairy houses and flower crowns. Fairy wings caress my face as I come upon a man covered in bark, mushrooms and animal skulls. He proudly introduces himself as \u201cthe King of the Pixies\u201d and suddenly I am all too aware of how \u201chuman\u201d I look. I ask him what it<em> </em>means to be King of the Pixies, excited to hear what being royalty in the magical realm entails. But he replies: \u201cErm, I don\u2019t know really, I\u2019ve not got anything to say on that.\u201d</p>    <p>Determined to find out more about what identifying as a magical being means, I make my way to the Mermaid Lagoon. The water (a paddling pool) has been blessed with a spell and Cornish sea salt. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3jv5lv6vbz4mDFPINPphvw\">Mischief</a>, a 44-year-old professional mermaid, is also an <a href=\"https://www.divessi.com/en/advanced-training/mermaid/ocean-mermaid\">SSI Ocean Mermaid</a> free-dive instructor. \u201cIf people are trying to work out whether mermaids are real or not, they are wasting their time,\u201d she tells me. \u201cToo much of our water is undiscovered to ever know, it\u2019s safe from the infection of human impact. Mermaids are an example of the freedom of the ocean. Humans need to start respecting the ocean more\u2026 when a mermaid is born, it\u2019s about empowerment and a need to put some mermagic into this world. This magic shows us the way to protect our seas and our mental health,\u201d Mischief explains.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone at this festival has a wish to believe in the energy and power of this amazing world and its creatures, everyone is acknowledging how lucky we are.\u201d She hands me a shell with her email address written on it in Sharpie before continuing, \u201cbeing a mermaid has helped me focus on what\u2019s important, that living is a gift and we shouldn\u2019t waste a moment, I share this because everyone deserves to know how magical they are.\u201d</p>    <p><em><strong>Next I talk to</strong></em> River Jordan, who has been in the fairy community her whole life. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to the elements and anything mystical,\u201d she explains in a soft and playful voice. We are constantly interrupted by children running up to her, desperate for an embrace from a fairy queen. \u201cI wanted to be a mermaid when I grew up, people always told me it wasn\u2019t possible \u2013 but it is,\u201d she insists, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that you have to grow up.\u201d</p> <p>In 2021, River was diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/stages-grades/stage-3\">stage 3</a> inflammatory breast cancer. Three months after chemotherapy, radiotherapy and one mastectomy, she discovered another lump and had to go through it again. \u201cAll in all, I\u2019ve had 24 rounds of chemotherapy, 15 rounds of radiotherapy, three mastectomies \u2013 because one went wrong \u2013 and a partridge in a pear tree,\u201d she bows. \u201cWhat I love about fairy imagery, is that they are often breastless or nippleless and their faces can be gnarly and different. When I go into nature there is no judgment, in this world, people look different and fairies help me find love and self-acceptance.\u201d Embracing differences is something that is instantly apparent throughout the entire festival. Not only is it fully plant-based, it is sure to make all feel welcome, with safe spaces and full access for disabled guests.</p>    <p>After being attracted to a circus tent, I stick my head inside and glimpse a woman wrapped in silks hanging from the roof above someone dressed as a giant panda, and decide to make my way to what I hope will be the relatively uncomplicated market stalls.</p> <p>I inspect some elf ears and, before I know it, my own ears are soon replaced with pointed elf tips. \u201cThey suit you more than I\u2019ve ever seen on anyone,\u201d the stall-holder exclaims excitedly, thrusting a mirror into my hands. As I continue on my way an elderly lady drifts past and wisely smiles before saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve acquired ears I see.\u201d Other people greet me with smiles and compliments on my ears and encourage me to visit other stalls to build my elf character with more props and accessories.</p>    <p>A cacao ceremony \u2013 based on ancient Aztec and Mayan traditions to promote healing and self-exploration \u2013 is scheduled for 6pm, so I make my way to the stand for a little tester drink. On my way I pass two people dressed as unicorns and someone on a penny farthing. A lot of the ceremony that I witness uses phrases like \u201cthe divine masculine\u201d and the \u201cdivine feminine\u201d, while instruments I can\u2019t even begin to guess the name of are played. The cacao was delicious, but I wasn\u2019t as moved by the ceremony as others seemed to be. While people vehemently sway with their eyes closed and hands in front of their faces, I creep out, too buzzed from the cacao to concentrate on listening and, instead, make my way to the face-paint tent.</p> <p>By 11pm, my face is painted with witch-like symbols, my elf ears are pointing out of a fully beaded cowboy hat and I have two long neon pink and orange wool dreadlocks plaited into my hair. I\u2019ve bopped to the beats of <a href=\"https://www.fatboytim.co.uk/\">Fatboy Tim</a> (no that isn\u2019t a typo) and danced with a green-horned troll. A German fairy has spun me round, giggling and flicking her hair before planting a labradorite ring on my finger and running away.</p>    <p>When I find organiser Karen Kay again, she engulfs me with hugs, shouting: \u201cYou\u2019ve been fairy-fied!\u201d While I might not believe in fairies, I certainly believe in the power a wonderful community like this has to lift your spirits. Although adults dressing as fairies might be misunderstood to those who aren\u2019t in the subculture, their warmth, easy welcome and acceptance of those who are different showcase what\u2019s often missing from the world. For the first time in weeks, my cheeks hurt from smiling. In an overwhelming year full of darkness and stress, blowing bubbles with fairies might not be top of your list, but don\u2019t be surprised if you find it\u2019s exactly the kind of weekend you didn\u2019t know you needed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2024.

      "bodyText": "For six decades, Boeing has been among the marquee names in human spaceflight. The company helped build Nasa\u2019s mighty Saturn V rockets that put man on the moon; it was a key contractor during the space shuttle era and international space station operations; and its engines are powering the agency\u2019s next leap for the stars, the peerless Space Launch System. So, a recent report in the Wall Street Journal that the troubled aerospace giant is exploring the sale of substantial chunks of its space enterprise following the debacle of its loss-making Starliner capsule raised a number of eyebrows among industry insiders. Boeing announced last month its quarterly losses rose to almost $6bn amid a workers\u2019 strike, and its new chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, suggested his priority would be fixing problems and mending bridges in the company\u2019s core business of manufacturing aircraft. \u201cWe\u2019re better off doing less and doing it better, than doing more and not doing it well,\u201d he told analysts on a recent earnings call. There is no suggestion that Boeing intends to divest itself entirely from space, or that the company\u2019s introspection will ultimately lead to the sale of its defense, space and security division or any part of it. \u201cBoeing doesn\u2019t comment on market rumors or speculation,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian in a statement. But that a company inextricably linked to every major US achievement in space since the 1960s is even considering stepping back from ventures that helped make its name confirms deep-seated issues within Boeing, experts say. \u201cBoeing has always had a great sense of pride from being involved in the space industry, and something that the public looked on as an example of the company\u2019s technical prowess and capability, so it\u2019s definitely surprising from that perspective,\u201d said Dr Donald Platt, professor of aerospace, physics and space sciences at Florida Tech, and director of the university\u2019s Spaceport education center. \u201cBut if you look at the problems they\u2019re facing now, and the problems Starliner has created for them \u2026 nobody knows for sure how much money they\u2019ve had to dump into Starliner to even get to the point they\u2019re at now, so it\u2019s a really big problem Boeing is looking at right now from the space point of view.\u201d Boeing announced in September that Ted Colbert, head of its space division, was leaving the company as Ortberg began \u201cclean up\u201d efforts.

Starliner was intended to be operational by now as an alternative to SpaceX\u2019s Dragon capsule for ferrying astronauts to the space station.

The war seemed to have helped this channel ride the \u2018rally around the flag\u2019 effect and the rising time of nationalism to gain more support.\u201d</p> \n<p>Channel 14 has even questioned the loyalty of the Israeli army because of its perceived lack of ideological zeal. Last week, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), R Adm Daniel Hagari, wrote a formal complaint to the broadcasting authority and the ministry of defence accusing Channel 14 of incitement against its leadership.</p> \n<p>The broadcast that prompted the letter showed doctored pictures of the IDF\u2019s chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, his face distorted to make him look deranged and shrieking at the sight of messianic religious insignia on a soldier\u2019s uniform. Hagari said the IDF could accept criticism but the channel had \u201ccrossed a red line\u201d.</p> \n<p>He wrote: \u201cIt is deliberate incitement and humiliation of the IDF and its commanders during a war. Unfortunately, this is not the first time Channel 14 has taken such action towards the IDF.\u201d</p> \n<p>Channel 14 denied the claim that the broadcast was inflammatory and sardonically advised Hagari not to become a television critic. Netanyahu\u2019s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, backed the channel over the army.</p> \n<p>Just over a month earlier, three Israeli civil society groups formally demanded that the country\u2019s attorney general launch a criminal investigation into the channel, accusing it of broadcasting material that incited war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide.</p> \n<p>In their complaint on 23 September, the organisations \u2013 Zulat \u2013 Equality and Human Rights; the Democratic Bloc; and the Association for Fair Regulation \u2013 supplied a list of 265 quotes from talkshow hosts and guests on Channel 14.</p> \n<p>The remarks included guests or presenters using phrases such as \u201ctotal annihilation\u201d and \u201cexterminate\u201d in reference to people in Gaza. The legal complaint alleged at least 50 of the quotes on the list \u201ccall for or support the commission of genocide\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a response to the Guardian via its US-based lawyers, Channel 14 denied the claims that its coverage incited genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. It referred to the complaint as \u201cbaseless and highly defamatory\u201d and added that the complaint was made by an extreme group in Israel, and that it had been dismissed by the high Court in August.</p> \n<p>The complaint argues that the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, is legally obliged to launch an investigation on the grounds that Israel is a signatory to the genocide convention, and because the international court of justice (ICJ) issued an interim order in January instructing the Israeli government to prevent and punish incitement to genocide.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe explicit calls for committing horrifying crimes against millions of civilians find a home and are legitimised within the Israeli public, partly due to the statements made on the channel,\u201d the groups alleged in their legal complaint.</p> \n<p>Channel 14 responded to say the complainants filed an identical or substantially similar \u201ccomplaint against Channel 14 in the Israeli high court of justice\u201d which was dismissed. \u201cBecause the previous complaint was deemed entirely baseless, the high court recommended that plaintiffs withdraw the pleading so that it could be deleted,\u201d the channel\u2019s lawyers said.</p> \n<p>Zehava Galon, the president of Zulat and the former leader of the Meretz party, said the high court case was on a different subject, \u201cprimarily concerning fake news and a smear campaign against the judicial system\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost of these complaints were from the months preceding October 7. None of the complaints in the appeal pertained to crimes against humanity,\u201d Galon said, adding that the recommendation to withdraw \u201cwas based on a conservative policy that discourages the court from substituting the judgment of the regulator\u201d.</p> \n<p>The three organisations sent a similar letter to Israel\u2019s media regulator. The letters do not make a judgment on whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation being considered by the ICJ following a legal proceeding <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20231228-app-01-00-en.pdf\">instigated by South Africa</a> in December which discusses incitement at length.</p> \n<p>Among the examples presented in the legal complaint is a Channel 14 anchor threatening the \u201cannihilation\u201d of Palestinians, killing \u201cnumbers not seen before in Arab history\u201d.</p> \n<p>Another presenter, Shimon Riklin, said on 7 October of Palestinians in Gaza: \u201cWe should supply them with neither water nor electricity. Let them drop dead in there!\u201d and tweeted: \u201cGaza should be wiped off the face of the earth.\u201d</p> \n<p>Danny Neuman, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and a regular Channel 14 panellist, said: \u201cWe should have killed 100,000 Gazans in the first two days.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a broadcast on 6 May, Neuman said: \u201cA tiny few of them can be deemed human there. Ninety per cent are terrorists and \u2018involved\u2019! \u201d</p> \n<p>Channel 14\u2019s lawyers said many remarks referred to in the complaint were \u201cmade by guests and reporters on Channel 14 in the wake of the horrific 7 October terrorist attacks\u201d. The lawyers also say that the remarks \u201cwere repeated on multiple news stations in Israel\u201d.</p> \n<p>There has been a rise in hate speech in Israeli public discourse generally since the 7 October Hamas attack, and it has featured on other news outlets. Neuman was also quoted as calling for the \u201cextermination\u201d of Palestinians in Gaza on Channel 13 for example. Channel 12 broadcast a report from Lebanon on the weekend, in which Danny Kushmaro, the lead reporter, was allowed by the army to press a button <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/haaretz-today/2024-10-27/ty-article/.premium/israels-most-beloved-tv-journalist-blew-up-a-building-in-lebanon-israelis-didnt-blink/00000192-cfa9-d6a0-affe-cfaf203e0000\">blowing up a building</a> in a south Lebanese village.</p> \n<p>The groups behind the complaint to the attorney general claim that such rhetoric is far more concentrated on Channel 14.</p> \n<p>Panievsky argued: \u201cThere is no equivalent at all between what\u2019s happening on Channels 12 or 13, the mainstream media in Israel, and what you see on Channel 14.

      "bodyText": "An ultranationalist Israeli television channel backed by the government is fast emerging as one of the country\u2019s most-watched news sources, despite allegations from liberal groups that it is inciting war crimes, and claims from the army that it is riling up hatred of its generals for not being far enough to the right. Last month Channel 14, also known as Now 14, beat Israel\u2019s principal mainstream news outlet, Channel 12, in viewer ratings when 343,000 Israelis watched Channel 14\u2019s \u201cPatriots\u201d talkshow, known for its virulent rhetoric on Gaza. Media analysts say Channel 14\u2019s rise is both a sign and a driver of the shift of Israeli public opinion to the extreme right that has rapidly accelerated since the start of the Gaza war a year ago. Ayala Panievsky, a presidential fellow in the journalism department of City St George\u2019s, University of London, said: \u201cIt is pretty wild, because Israelis consume a lot of news through the big TV channels, 12 and 13, and to a lesser extent the public broadcaster, but Channel 14 was not even in the game until very recently. The war seemed to have helped this channel ride the \u2018rally around the flag\u2019 effect and the rising time of nationalism to gain more support.\u201d Channel 14 has even questioned the loyalty of the Israeli army because of its perceived lack of ideological zeal. Last week, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), R Adm Daniel Hagari, wrote a formal complaint to the broadcasting authority and the ministry of defence accusing Channel 14 of incitement against its leadership. The broadcast that prompted the letter showed doctored pictures of the IDF\u2019s chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, his face distorted to make him look deranged and shrieking at the sight of messianic religious insignia on a soldier\u2019s uniform. Hagari said the IDF could accept criticism but the channel had \u201ccrossed a red line\u201d. He wrote: \u201cIt is deliberate incitement and humiliation of the IDF and its commanders during a war. Unfortunately, this is not the first time Channel 14 has taken such action towards the IDF.\u201d Channel 14 denied the claim that the broadcast was inflammatory and sardonically advised Hagari not to become a television critic. Netanyahu\u2019s communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, backed the channel over the army. Just over a month earlier, three Israeli civil society groups formally demanded that the country\u2019s attorney general launch a criminal investigation into the channel, accusing it of broadcasting material that incited war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide. In their complaint on 23 September, the organisations \u2013 Zulat \u2013 Equality and Human Rights; the Democratic Bloc; and the Association for Fair Regulation \u2013 supplied a list of 265 quotes from talkshow hosts and guests on Channel 14. The remarks included guests or presenters using phrases such as \u201ctotal annihilation\u201d and \u201cexterminate\u201d in reference to people in Gaza. The legal complaint alleged at least 50 of the quotes on the list \u201ccall for or support the commission of genocide\u201d. In a response to the Guardian via its US-based lawyers, Channel 14 denied the claims that its coverage incited genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. It referred to the complaint as \u201cbaseless and highly defamatory\u201d and added that the complaint was made by an extreme group in Israel, and that it had been dismissed by the high Court in August. The complaint argues that the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, is legally obliged to launch an investigation on the grounds that Israel is a signatory to the genocide convention, and because the international court of justice (ICJ) issued an interim order in January instructing the Israeli government to prevent and punish incitement to genocide. \u201cThe explicit calls for committing horrifying crimes against millions of civilians find a home and are legitimised within the Israeli public, partly due to the statements made on the channel,\u201d the groups alleged in their legal complaint. Channel 14 responded to say the complainants filed an identical or substantially similar \u201ccomplaint against Channel 14 in the Israeli high court of justice\u201d which was dismissed. \u201cBecause the previous complaint was deemed entirely baseless, the high court recommended that plaintiffs withdraw the pleading so that it could be deleted,\u201d the channel\u2019s lawyers said. Zehava Galon, the president of Zulat and the former leader of the Meretz party, said the high court case was on a different subject, \u201cprimarily concerning fake news and a smear campaign against the judicial system\u201d. \u201cMost of these complaints were from the months preceding October 7. None of the complaints in the appeal pertained to crimes against humanity,\u201d Galon said, adding that the recommendation to withdraw \u201cwas based on a conservative policy that discourages the court from substituting the judgment of the regulator\u201d. The three organisations sent a similar letter to Israel\u2019s media regulator. The letters do not make a judgment on whether Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation being considered by the ICJ following a legal proceeding instigated by South Africa in December which discusses incitement at length. Among the examples presented in the legal complaint is a Channel 14 anchor threatening the \u201cannihilation\u201d of Palestinians, killing \u201cnumbers not seen before in Arab history\u201d. Another presenter, Shimon Riklin, said on 7 October of Palestinians in Gaza: \u201cWe should supply them with neither water nor electricity. Let them drop dead in there!\u201d and tweeted: \u201cGaza should be wiped off the face of the earth.\u201d Danny Neuman, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and a regular Channel 14 panellist, said: \u201cWe should have killed 100,000 Gazans in the first two days.\u201d In a broadcast on 6 May, Neuman said: \u201cA tiny few of them can be deemed human there.

Channel 12 broadcast a report from Lebanon on the weekend, in which Danny Kushmaro, the lead reporter, was allowed by the army to press a button blowing up a building in a south Lebanese village. The groups behind the complaint to the attorney general claim that such rhetoric is far more concentrated on Channel 14. Panievsky argued: \u201cThere is no equivalent at all between what\u2019s happening on Channels 12 or 13, the mainstream media in Israel, and what you see on Channel 14. This is a totally different universe.\u201d Channel 14\u2019s lawyers disagreed, saying the complainants \u201care small NGOs closely affiliated with the Israeli far-left who are anxious to defame and disparage Channel 14 and its reporting.\u201d They said questions should be raised about the motivations of the groups, who were \u201cabusing the Israeli legal system in the hopes of garnering negative media for Channel 14\u201d. Israel\u2019s state attorney, Amit Aisman, said in August that his office examined calls to investigate public figures such as Eyal Golan, a singer, for incitement but decided not to proceed. Aisman did not say why that decision had been taken.

We need to do two things now: we need to reform our public services to make sure they work better and we need to grow our economy.\u201d</p> <p>She also gave an \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d that the government would stick to its manifesto pledge for five years that there would be no tax increases on \u201cworking people\u201d, saying Labour had \u201cwiped the slate clean\u201d after the Tories\u2019 \u201cmismanagement\u201d.</p> <p>Reeves said: \u201cIt\u2019s now on us. We\u2019ve put everything out into the open, we\u2019ve set the spending envelope of this parliament, we don\u2019t need to come back for more, we\u2019ve done that now, we\u2019ve wiped the slate clean.\u201d</p> <p>After delivering her first budget on Wednesday, Reeves has been defending her decisions to increase employer national insurance in particular, with some GPs\u2019 surgeries, social care providers and charities facing higher bills for employing staff.</p> <p>On the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg programme, Reeves was pressed on whether it had been misleading to say she would not to raise national insurance but the chancellor said the Labour manifesto made clear that it was a pledge not to raise that tax on working people \u2013 not the employer element.</p> <p>Asked about the concerns of GPs, charities and others, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not immune to their criticism but we\u2019ve got to raise the money. For GPs I would say that Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will be setting the allocations for the budgets.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves\u2019s budget has been well received by experts at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the markets have largely stabilised after the pound fell and gilts rose slightly in the aftermath.</p> <p>It was reported over the weekend that the chancellor will soon turn her attention to how to kickstart growth, with a Mansion House speech looking at changes to unlock investment from public pension funds. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts only low or stagnant growth over the course of the parliament.</p> <p>Reeves is also facing the possibility of a legal challenge from Unite, the trade union and major Labour donor, which said it was planning to launch a judicial review.</p> <p>Unite has sent a pre-action protocol letter to Liz Kendall, the secretary of state at the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP), asking the government to reverse the removal of the winter fuel payment and repeal the regulations introduced in August 2024.</p> <p>Unite said it believed the government had acted unlawfully and its action would have a terrible effect on millions of older people in society and would be likely to cause an increase in cold-related deaths.</p>",

The UK chancellor said she had not known the true picture of the \u201chuge black hole in public finances\u201d left by the Conservatives, which the government says amounted to \u00a322bn. \u201cI was wrong on June 11, I didn\u2019t know everything,\u201d she said. Reeves said there was no requirement to come back with another big tax-raising budget, after increasing employer national insurance contributions, raising capital gains on most assets, making inheritance tax changes, and charging VAT on private school fees. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Trevor Phillips on Sunday programme, Reeves said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to write five years\u2019 worth of budgets on this show today, but \u2026 there\u2019s no need to come back with another budget like this.We\u2019ll never need to do that again. \u201cWe\u2019ve now set the spending envelope for the remainder of this parliament, we don\u2019t need to increase taxes further. We need to do two things now: we need to reform our public services to make sure they work better and we need to grow our economy.\u201d She also gave an \u201cabsolute commitment\u201d that the government would stick to its manifesto pledge for five years that there would be no tax increases on \u201cworking people\u201d, saying Labour had \u201cwiped the slate clean\u201d after the Tories\u2019 \u201cmismanagement\u201d. Reeves said: \u201cIt\u2019s now on us. We\u2019ve put everything out into the open, we\u2019ve set the spending envelope of this parliament, we don\u2019t need to come back for more, we\u2019ve done that now, we\u2019ve wiped the slate clean.\u201d After delivering her first budget on Wednesday, Reeves has been defending her decisions to increase employer national insurance in particular, with some GPs\u2019 surgeries, social care providers and charities facing higher bills for employing staff. On the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg programme, Reeves was pressed on whether it had been misleading to say she would not to raise national insurance but the chancellor said the Labour manifesto made clear that it was a pledge not to raise that tax on working people \u2013 not the employer element. Asked about the concerns of GPs, charities and others, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not immune to their criticism but we\u2019ve got to raise the money. For GPs I would say that Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will be setting the allocations for the budgets.\u201d Reeves\u2019s budget has been well received by experts at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the markets have largely stabilised after the pound fell and gilts rose slightly in the aftermath. It was reported over the weekend that the chancellor will soon turn her attention to how to kickstart growth, with a Mansion House speech looking at changes to unlock investment from public pension funds. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts only low or stagnant growth over the course of the parliament. Reeves is also facing the possibility of a legal challenge from Unite, the trade union and major Labour donor, which said it was planning to launch a judicial review. Unite has sent a pre-action protocol letter to Liz Kendall, the secretary of state at the Department for Works and Pensions (DWP), asking the government to reverse the removal of the winter fuel payment and repeal the regulations introduced in August 2024. Unite said it believed the government had acted unlawfully and its action would have a terrible effect on millions of older people in society and would be likely to cause an increase in cold-related deaths.",

      "body": "<p>Nina Marchenko was in her kitchen when a bomb fell on her cottage. It blew off the roof, demolished the concrete summer house in the garden, and killed her dog, Tulik. Bits of fence were tossed into the air. \u201cThere was smoke and that was it,\u201d she said. \u201cA woman died in another strike nearby. I can only curse Vladimir Putin. He\u2019s driven us from our house.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, Marchenko and her disabled husband, Misha, fled their home in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/how-drones-froze-ukraine-frontlines\">Kupiansk</a>, in the north-east of Ukraine. The Russian army seized the city in the early days of Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion. Ukrainian soldiers took it back eight months later. For most of the last two years the frontline \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/how-drones-froze-ukraine-frontlines\">across the Oskil River and a series of rustic hamlets</a> \u2013 barely changed.</p>    <p>In recent weeks, however, the Russians have been advancing. Across the frontline, Ukrainian defences are crumbling at the fastest rate since 2022. In October, Russia swallowed nearly 310 miles (500km) of Ukrainian territory including more than 15 sq miles around Kupiansk. Two-thirds of these losses of territory have been in the neighbouring Donetsk region. Ukraine\u2019s southern sector there is close to collapse.</p> <p>Russian combat units are now <a href=\"https://english.nv.ua/russian-war/russian-forces-2-5-3-km-from-kupyansk-military-administration-50462496.html\">less than two miles from Kupiansk</a>. A little to the south, troops have already reached the Oskil River, turning Ukrainian-controlled territory on the left bank into two separate and shrinking bulges. Bridges across the river are relentlessly bombed. Moscow\u2019s apparent plan is to flatten Kupiansk and then reoccupy it.</p> <p>Speaking from an office bunker, Kupiansk\u2019s military-civilian mayor, Andriy Besedin, described the situation on the eastern side of the Oskil as \u201ccritical\u201d. He said 1,400 people were refusing to evacuate from their homes, despite having no electricity, water or gas. Most were elderly people. They were not pro-Russian, Besedin suggested, but simply unwilling to move out or listen to anxious relatives.</p>    <p>\u201cWe are going flat to flat and driving around with loudspeakers. We say: \u2018Please leave. We don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe pensioners think the Russians won\u2019t hurt them. We tell them the situation is different from 2022 and that they will get killed.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI hope when the weather changes and it\u2019s cold they will finally exit,\u201d Besedin added.</p> <p>Since the beginning of October the situation in Kupiansk became dramatically worse, the mayor said. Russian kamikaze drones were flying above the city, targeting people waiting at bus stops. \u201cWe can\u2019t deliver humanitarian aid. They see a pick-up and hit it with a drone. You can\u2019t outrun them,\u201d Besedin said. About 2,200 residents remained, as missiles crashed around them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/kupiansk-zip/giv-4559noqmX5EbIXf1/\" data-alt=\"A map showing the location of Kupiansk as well as Russian-controlled areas and recent advances\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/kupiansk-zip/giv-4559noqmX5EbIXf1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Recently a Russian warplane dropped a 1,500kg guided bomb on the civic building next to Besedin\u2019s office, killing three people. The decorative brick structure was a sprawling mess. Was the Kremlin trying to target the mayor personally? \u201cYes,\u201d Besedin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried several times.\u201d Other missiles have struck Kupiansk\u2019s museum, football ground, meat factory, market and palace of culture.</p> <p>Ukraine was battling against terrorism and dictatorship, Besedin said, and a malevolent axis of countries that included Russia, North Korea and Iran.</p> <p>\u201cOur guys are fighting for every centimetre. Unfortunately the civilised world isn\u2019t giving us enough weapons. What about democratic values? Stopping Russia is our collective responsibility. If we fail, Putin will attack the Baltic states and Poland,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>Soldiers said conditions on the frontline were tough. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to shoot with. They fire 10 shells for our one,\u201d said Oleksandr Isaiev, a 59-year-old sapper. The Russians had more personnel and armoured vehicles, he said, and dropped between eight and 12 KAB glided bombs a day on his position. \u201cIf one lands on you, you\u2019re dead. They make a hole 5 metres deep and 10 metres\u2019 across,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Isaiev expressed frustration at the west\u2019s so-called \u201cred lines\u201d and the Biden administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/26/ukraine-russia-war-nato-biden-putin\">persistent refusal to allow Kyiv to hit targets deep inside Russia with US-supplied munitions</a>. The UK and France have not lifted restrictions either. \u201cWe have the rockets. But we can\u2019t use them to wallop Russian airfields,\u201d Isaiev said. \u201cUntil the US gets over its nervousness, we will lose territory.\u201d</p>    <p>With too few conventional weapons, Ukraine is trying to hold the line using drones. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alex_denali/?hl=en\">Oleksandr Ivantsov</a>, a drone operator with the 3rd Assault Brigade, said the situation on the left bank was tense. The Russians were constantly trying to storm Ukrainian positions, he said, adding: \u201cThere are battles everywhere. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don\u2019t. There are no easy places. They have huge resources.\u201d</p> <p>This week, streets in Kupiansk were largely deserted. A handful of elderly residents could be seen carrying shopping bags and pushing trolleys. Police on patrol wore body armour. Besedin said he would provide municipal services for as long as possible. \u201cWe are fighting on every front: military, administrative and social,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is doing what they can. Kupiansk isn\u2019t lost yet.\u201d</p> <p>Some residents, however, acknowledged it was only a matter of time before the Russians came back. Ksenia Lukyanova said her home city was strategically important and a railway hub. From Kupiansk, a road went south to the town of Izium \u2013 occupied and liberated in 2022 \u2013 and the garrison city of Sloviansk. Another led to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city. To the north was the Russian province of Belgorod.</p>    <p>\u201cDuring the second world war, Kupiansk was seized and liberated four times. It switched between Soviets and Nazis,\u201d Lukyanova said. Last year a bomb wrecked her home. In September, shrapnel shattered the window of her new apartment in the village of Hrushivka, just outside Kupiansk. \u201cWe carry on, keep smiling and try and help each other. Inside we are crying and screaming,\u201d she said. \u201cOur souls hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Her friend Natalya Surko said most residents in the suburb of Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi were packing up to leave. \u201cAt night it\u2019s terrible. You hear a siren and three seconds later an explosion. There\u2019s no time to get dressed. After the first bang, you think: \u2018Do I get up or not?\u2019 You don\u2019t.\u201d Surko said she lost her job as Kupiansk\u2019s railway station duty manager when the full-scale war arrived. \u201cI\u2019m paid \u00a340 a month,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Evacuees from the Kupiansk region are taken to a processing centre in Kharkiv, where they are registered and given medical checkups. Some arrive in their own vehicles; others are brought by minibus or ambulance. So far this month 1,800 people have turned up. Local charities, the UNHCR and the Red Cross dole out emergency parcels. Many of the displaced stay with relatives. Others are allocated dormitories.</p>    <p>The regional administration had issued compulsory evacuation notices to families with children. Lilya Shevchenko, 16, and Nadia Shynkarenko, 14, said they had come from Barove, a left-bank village south of Kupiansk. Every other house was smashed, they said. \u201cThe Russians were 30kms away. Now it\u2019s 15 to 20kms. There are a few old ladies left. At night people drive to Izyum and sleep there, because it\u2019s safer,\u201d Lilya said.</p> <p>She described bombardment as scary but said Russia\u2019s eight-month occupation in 2022 was far worse. \u201cFor the first few weeks we had no internet connection. We didn\u2019t know what was happening in Kharkiv. The Russians stole everything. They were drunk. We were afraid to go out on the street.\u201d She last attended school on the day before the invasion, and was studying online, she said.</p> <p>Queuing up to register, Marchenko said she had left all her belongings behind. \u201cWe had a garden with fruit trees and vegetables. But this year it was only weeds because it was impossible to plant anything. As soon as you stepped foot outside they start to shell,\u201d the 72-year-old said. Would she ever go back? \u201cI don\u2019t know. If my house still stands, maybe I will.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nina Marchenko was in her kitchen when a bomb fell on her cottage. It blew off the roof, demolished the concrete summer house in the garden, and killed her dog, Tulik. Bits of fence were tossed into the air. \u201cThere was smoke and that was it,\u201d she said. \u201cA woman died in another strike nearby. I can only curse Vladimir Putin. He\u2019s driven us from our house.\u201d Last week, Marchenko and her disabled husband, Misha, fled their home in Kupiansk, in the north-east of Ukraine. The Russian army seized the city in the early days of Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion. Ukrainian soldiers took it back eight months later. For most of the last two years the frontline \u2013 across the Oskil River and a series of rustic hamlets \u2013 barely changed. In recent weeks, however, the Russians have been advancing. Across the frontline, Ukrainian defences are crumbling at the fastest rate since 2022. In October, Russia swallowed nearly 310 miles (500km) of Ukrainian territory including more than 15 sq miles around Kupiansk. Two-thirds of these losses of territory have been in the neighbouring Donetsk region. Ukraine\u2019s southern sector there is close to collapse. Russian combat units are now less than two miles from Kupiansk. A little to the south, troops have already reached the Oskil River, turning Ukrainian-controlled territory on the left bank into two separate and shrinking bulges. Bridges across the river are relentlessly bombed. Moscow\u2019s apparent plan is to flatten Kupiansk and then reoccupy it. Speaking from an office bunker, Kupiansk\u2019s military-civilian mayor, Andriy Besedin, described the situation on the eastern side of the Oskil as \u201ccritical\u201d. He said 1,400 people were refusing to evacuate from their homes, despite having no electricity, water or gas. Most were elderly people. They were not pro-Russian, Besedin suggested, but simply unwilling to move out or listen to anxious relatives. \u201cWe are going flat to flat and driving around with loudspeakers. We say: \u2018Please leave. We don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe pensioners think the Russians won\u2019t hurt them. We tell them the situation is different from 2022 and that they will get killed.\u201d \u201cI hope when the weather changes and it\u2019s cold they will finally exit,\u201d Besedin added. Since the beginning of October the situation in Kupiansk became dramatically worse, the mayor said. Russian kamikaze drones were flying above the city, targeting people waiting at bus stops. \u201cWe can\u2019t deliver humanitarian aid. They see a pick-up and hit it with a drone. You can\u2019t outrun them,\u201d Besedin said. About 2,200 residents remained, as missiles crashed around them. Recently a Russian warplane dropped a 1,500kg guided bomb on the civic building next to Besedin\u2019s office, killing three people. The decorative brick structure was a sprawling mess. Was the Kremlin trying to target the mayor personally? \u201cYes,\u201d Besedin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried several times.\u201d Other missiles have struck Kupiansk\u2019s museum, football ground, meat factory, market and palace of culture. Ukraine was battling against terrorism and dictatorship, Besedin said, and a malevolent axis of countries that included Russia, North Korea and Iran. \u201cOur guys are fighting for every centimetre. Unfortunately the civilised world isn\u2019t giving us enough weapons. What about democratic values? Stopping Russia is our collective responsibility. If we fail, Putin will attack the Baltic states and Poland,\u201d he said. Soldiers said conditions on the frontline were tough. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough to shoot with. They fire 10 shells for our one,\u201d said Oleksandr Isaiev, a 59-year-old sapper. The Russians had more personnel and armoured vehicles, he said, and dropped between eight and 12 KAB glided bombs a day on his position. \u201cIf one lands on you, you\u2019re dead. They make a hole 5 metres deep and 10 metres\u2019 across,\u201d he said. Isaiev expressed frustration at the west\u2019s so-called \u201cred lines\u201d and the Biden administration\u2019s persistent refusal to allow Kyiv to hit targets deep inside Russia with US-supplied munitions. The UK and France have not lifted restrictions either. \u201cWe have the rockets. But we can\u2019t use them to wallop Russian airfields,\u201d Isaiev said. \u201cUntil the US gets over its nervousness, we will lose territory.\u201d With too few conventional weapons, Ukraine is trying to hold the line using drones. Oleksandr Ivantsov, a drone operator with the 3rd Assault Brigade, said the situation on the left bank was tense. The Russians were constantly trying to storm Ukrainian positions, he said, adding: \u201cThere are battles everywhere. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don\u2019t. There are no easy places. They have huge resources.\u201d This week, streets in Kupiansk were largely deserted. A handful of elderly residents could be seen carrying shopping bags and pushing trolleys. Police on patrol wore body armour. Besedin said he would provide municipal services for as long as possible. \u201cWe are fighting on every front: military, administrative and social,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is doing what they can. Kupiansk isn\u2019t lost yet.\u201d Some residents, however, acknowledged it was only a matter of time before the Russians came back. Ksenia Lukyanova said her home city was strategically important and a railway hub. From Kupiansk, a road went south to the town of Izium \u2013 occupied and liberated in 2022 \u2013 and the garrison city of Sloviansk. Another led to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city. To the north was the Russian province of Belgorod. \u201cDuring the second world war, Kupiansk was seized and liberated four times. It switched between Soviets and Nazis,\u201d Lukyanova said. Last year a bomb wrecked her home. In September, shrapnel shattered the window of her new apartment in the village of Hrushivka, just outside Kupiansk. \u201cWe carry on, keep smiling and try and help each other. Inside we are crying and screaming,\u201d she said. \u201cOur souls hurt.\u201d Her friend Natalya Surko said most residents in the suburb of Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi were packing up to leave. \u201cAt night it\u2019s terrible. You hear a siren and three seconds later an explosion. There\u2019s no time to get dressed. After the first bang, you think: \u2018Do I get up or not?\u2019 You don\u2019t.\u201d Surko said she lost her job as Kupiansk\u2019s railway station duty manager when the full-scale war arrived. \u201cI\u2019m paid \u00a340 a month,\u201d she said. Evacuees from the Kupiansk region are taken to a processing centre in Kharkiv, where they are registered and given medical checkups. Some arrive in their own vehicles; others are brought by minibus or ambulance. So far this month 1,800 people have turned up. Local charities, the UNHCR and the Red Cross dole out emergency parcels. Many of the displaced stay with relatives. Others are allocated dormitories. The regional administration had issued compulsory evacuation notices to families with children. Lilya Shevchenko, 16, and Nadia Shynkarenko, 14, said they had come from Barove, a left-bank village south of Kupiansk. Every other house was smashed, they said. \u201cThe Russians were 30kms away. Now it\u2019s 15 to 20kms. There are a few old ladies left. At night people drive to Izyum and sleep there, because it\u2019s safer,\u201d Lilya said. She described bombardment as scary but said Russia\u2019s eight-month occupation in 2022 was far worse. \u201cFor the first few weeks we had no internet connection. We didn\u2019t know what was happening in Kharkiv. The Russians stole everything. They were drunk. We were afraid to go out on the street.\u201d She last attended school on the day before the invasion, and was studying online, she said. Queuing up to register, Marchenko said she had left all her belongings behind. \u201cWe had a garden with fruit trees and vegetables. But this year it was only weeds because it was impossible to plant anything. As soon as you stepped foot outside they start to shell,\u201d the 72-year-old said. Would she ever go back? \u201cI don\u2019t know. If my house still stands, maybe I will.\u201d",

The potentially carcinogenic properties of the popular artificial sweetener, added to everything from soft drinks to children\u2019s medicine, have been debated for decades. Its approval in the US stirred controversy in 1974, several UK supermarkets banned it from their products in the 00s, and peer-reviewed academic studies have long butted heads.

Google and Microsoft are betting big on the idea and have already introduced AI-generated summaries into Google Search and Bing.</p> <p>But what is pitched as a more convenient way of looking up information online has prompted scrutiny over how and where these chatbots select the information they provide.

But what a chatbot should do in the case of a more complex debate, such as that around aspartame, is less clearcut. \u201cDo we want them to simply summarise your search results for you, or do we want them to act as mini research assistants that weigh all the evidence and just present you with a final answer,\u201d asks Alexander Wan, an undergraduate researcher and co-author of the study. The latter option would offer maximum convenience, but makes the criteria by which chatbots select information all the more important. And if a person could somehow game those criteria<strong>,</strong> could they guarantee the information a chatbot puts in front of the eyes of billions of internet users?</p> <h2><strong>Generative </strong><strong>engine </strong><strong>optimisation</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a question that has animated businesses, content creators and others who want to control how they are seen online, and sparked a nascent industry of marketing agencies offering services in what has become known as generative engine optimisation (GEO). The idea is that online content can be written and presented in such a way as to improve its visibility to chatbots, therefore making it more likely to appear in their outputs. The advantages are obvious: if someone were to ask a chatbot to recommend the best vacuum cleaner, say, a domestic appliance manufacturer might want it to point to its latest model and talk about it in glowing terms.</p> <p>The basic principle is similar to search engine optimisation (SEO), a common practice whereby webpages are built and written to draw the attention of search engine algorithms, pushing them towards the top of the list of results returned when you make a search on Google or Bing. GEO and SEO share some basic techniques, and websites that are already optimised for search engines generally have a greater chance of appearing in chatbot outputs. But those wanting to really improve their AI visibility need to think more holistically.</p>    <p>\u201cRankings in AI search engines and LLMs require features and mentions on relevant third-party websites, such as news outlets, listicles, forums and industry publications,\u201d says Viola Eva, founder of marketing company Flow Agency, which has recently rebranded to expand beyond its SEO speciality into GEO. \u201cThese are tasks that we typically associate with brand and PR teams.\u201d</p> <p>Gaming chatbots is possible, then, but not straightforward. And while website owners and content creators have derived an evolving list of essential SEO dos and don\u2019ts over the past couple of decades, no such clear set of rules exists for manipulating AI models. The term generative engine optimisation was only coined last year in an <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735\">academic paper</a>, whose authors concluded that using authoritative language (regardless of what is expressed or whether the information is correct) alongside references (even those that are incorrect or unrelated to what they\u2019re being used to cite) could boost visibility in chatbot responses by up to 40%. But they stress these findings aren\u2019t prescriptive, and identifying the exact rules governing chatbots is inherently tricky.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cat and mouse game,\u201d says Ameet Deshpande, a doctoral student at Princeton University, New Jersey, and co-author of the paper. \u201cBecause these generative engines are not static, and they\u2019re also black boxes, we don\u2019t have any sense of what they\u2019re using [to select information] behind closed doors. It could range from complicated algorithms to potential human supervision.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Researchers have demonstrated how chatbots can be tactically controlled by a carefully written string of text</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those wanting a firmer grip on chatbots, then, may have to explore more underhand techniques, such as the one discovered by two computer-science researchers at Harvard University. They\u2019ve <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07981\">demonstrated</a> how chatbots can be tactically controlled by deploying something as simple as a carefully written string of text. This \u201cstrategic text sequence\u201d looks like a nonsensical series of characters \u2013 all random letters and punctuation \u2013 but is actually a delicate command that can strong-arm chatbots into generating a specific response. Not part of a programming language, it\u2019s derived using an algorithm that iteratively develops text sequences that encourage LLMs to ignore their safety guardrails \u2013 and steer them towards particular outputs.</p> <p>Add the string to the online product information page of a coffee machine, for example, and it will increase the probability that any chatbots that discover the page will output the name of the machine in their responses. Deployed across a whole catalogue, such a technique could give savvy retailers \u2013 and those with enough resources to invest in understanding knotty LLM architecture \u2013 a simple way of thrusting their products into chatbot answers. Internet users, meanwhile, will have no inkling that the products they are being shown by the chatbot have been selected, not because of their quality or popularity, but a clever piece of chatbot manipulation.</p> <p>Aounon Kumar, a research associate and co-author of the study, says LLMs could be designed to combat these strategic text sequences in the future, but other underhand methods of manipulating them may yet be discovered. \u201cThe challenge lies in anticipating and defending against a constantly evolving landscape of adversarial techniques,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cWhether LLMs can be made robust to all potential future attack algorithms remains an open question.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Manipulation machines</strong></h2> <p>Current search engines and the practices that surround them aren\u2019t without problems of their own. SEO is responsible for some of the most reader-hostile practices of the modern internet: blogs churning out near-duplicate articles to target the same big-traffic queries; writing that\u2019s tailored for the attention of Google\u2019s algorithm rather than readers. Anyone who has looked up an online recipe and found themselves tortuously scrolling through paragraphs of tangentially related background information before reaching even the ingredients list will know only too well how attempts to optimise content for search engine algorithms have hamstrung good writing practices.</p>    <p>Yet an internet dominated by pliant chatbots throws up issues of a more existential kind. Ask a search engine a question, and it will return a long list of webpages. Most users will pick from the top few, but even those websites towards the bottom of the results will net some traffic. Chatbots, by contrast, only mention the four or five websites from which they crib their information as references to the side. That casts a big spotlight on the lucky few that are selected and leaves every other website that isn\u2019t picked practically invisible, plummeting their traffic.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows the fragility of these systems,\u201d says Deshpande. Creators who produce quality online content have a lot to gain by being cited by a chatbot. \u201cBut if it\u2019s an adversarial content creator who is not writing high-quality articles and is trying to game the system, a lot of traffic is going to go to them, and 0% will go to good content creators,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/01/sure-googles-ai-overviews-could-be-useful-if-you-like-eating-rocks\">Sure, Google\u2019s AI overviews could be useful \u2013 if you like eating rocks | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For readers, too, the presentation of chatbot responses makes them only more fertile for manipulation. \u201cIf LLMs give a direct answer to a question, then most people may not even look at what the underlying sources are,\u201d says Wan. Such thinking points to a broader worry that has been termed the \u201cdilemma of the direct answer\u201d: if a person is given a single answer to a question and offered no alternatives to consider, will they diligently look for other views to weigh the initial answer against? Probably not. More likely, they\u2019ll accept it as given and move on, blind to the nuances, debates and differing perspectives that may surround it.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the dilemma of the direct answer persists with generative search,\u201d says Martin Potthast, chair of intelligent language technologies at Leipzig University and one of the three computer scientists who <a href=\"https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/potthast_2020j.pdf\">coined</a> the term. \u201cThe underlying retrieval system may just retrieve documents pointing in one direction and thus the generated answer will reflect only that direction. In effect, users may be led to believe this is the only, most authoritative answer.\u201d</p> <p>When Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/\">announced</a> it was integrating AI-generated summaries into its search engine earlier this year, it brandished a bold slogan: \u201cLet Google do the searching for you.\u201d It\u2019s an appealing idea that plays on our fondness for convenient tech that can streamline our lives. Yet if you\u2019re the sort of internet user who wants to be sure you\u2019re getting the most impartial, accurate and useful information, you may not want to leave the searching in such susceptible AI hands.</p>",

Not part of a programming language, it\u2019s derived using an algorithm that iteratively develops text sequences that encourage LLMs to ignore their safety guardrails \u2013 and steer them towards particular outputs. Add the string to the online product information page of a coffee machine, for example, and it will increase the probability that any chatbots that discover the page will output the name of the machine in their responses. Deployed across a whole catalogue, such a technique could give savvy retailers \u2013 and those with enough resources to invest in understanding knotty LLM architecture \u2013 a simple way of thrusting their products into chatbot answers. Internet users, meanwhile, will have no inkling that the products they are being shown by the chatbot have been selected, not because of their quality or popularity, but a clever piece of chatbot manipulation. Aounon Kumar, a research associate and co-author of the study, says LLMs could be designed to combat these strategic text sequences in the future, but other underhand methods of manipulating them may yet be discovered. \u201cThe challenge lies in anticipating and defending against a constantly evolving landscape of adversarial techniques,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cWhether LLMs can be made robust to all potential future attack algorithms remains an open question.\u201d Manipulation machines Current search engines and the practices that surround them aren\u2019t without problems of their own. SEO is responsible for some of the most reader-hostile practices of the modern internet: blogs churning out near-duplicate articles to target the same big-traffic queries; writing that\u2019s tailored for the attention of Google\u2019s algorithm rather than readers. Anyone who has looked up an online recipe and found themselves tortuously scrolling through paragraphs of tangentially related background information before reaching even the ingredients list will know only too well how attempts to optimise content for search engine algorithms have hamstrung good writing practices. Yet an internet dominated by pliant chatbots throws up issues of a more existential kind. Ask a search engine a question, and it will return a long list of webpages. Most users will pick from the top few, but even those websites towards the bottom of the results will net some traffic. Chatbots, by contrast, only mention the four or five websites from which they crib their information as references to the side. That casts a big spotlight on the lucky few that are selected and leaves every other website that isn\u2019t picked practically invisible, plummeting their traffic. \u201cIt shows the fragility of these systems,\u201d says Deshpande. Creators who produce quality online content have a lot to gain by being cited by a chatbot. \u201cBut if it\u2019s an adversarial content creator who is not writing high-quality articles and is trying to game the system, a lot of traffic is going to go to them, and 0% will go to good content creators,\u201d he says. For readers, too, the presentation of chatbot responses makes them only more fertile for manipulation. \u201cIf LLMs give a direct answer to a question, then most people may not even look at what the underlying sources are,\u201d says Wan. Such thinking points to a broader worry that has been termed the \u201cdilemma of the direct answer\u201d: if a person is given a single answer to a question and offered no alternatives to consider, will they diligently look for other views to weigh the initial answer against? Probably not. More likely, they\u2019ll accept it as given and move on, blind to the nuances, debates and differing perspectives that may surround it. \u201cWe believe the dilemma of the direct answer persists with generative search,\u201d says Martin Potthast, chair of intelligent language technologies at Leipzig University and one of the three computer scientists who coined the term. \u201cThe underlying retrieval system may just retrieve documents pointing in one direction and thus the generated answer will reflect only that direction. In effect, users may be led to believe this is the only, most authoritative answer.\u201d When Google announced it was integrating AI-generated summaries into its search engine earlier this year, it brandished a bold slogan: \u201cLet Google do the searching for you.\u201d It\u2019s an appealing idea that plays on our fondness for convenient tech that can streamline our lives. Yet if you\u2019re the sort of internet user who wants to be sure you\u2019re getting the most impartial, accurate and useful information, you may not want to leave the searching in such susceptible AI hands.",

Then people can exchange it for what they really wanted in good time so that when it comes to Christmas there is nothing left to do but sit. Except food! How do we get ahead with food? Well, thanks to the internet, invitations from supermarkets to book your Christmas delivery slots come earlier and earlier, so we can start worrying about the late December availability of pigs in blankets even as we attempt to relax in the carcinogenic sunshine while contemplating what time on Tuesday we should leave for the airport in order to make Wednesday\u2019s flight. Why not book next Christmas\u2019s delivery while we\u2019re at it? Then you won\u2019t have to worry next summer. People are already reserving their 2025 turkeys \u2013 you don\u2019t want to end up with a scrawny one full of antibiotics. You need to put your name down for one now, even before it\u2019s hatched. Quickly think through the Christmas guest list: a couple of elderly relations may have died by then but it\u2019s always nice to have some cold on Boxing Day\u2026 If we count anyone over 80 as half a person\u2026 plus a bit extra\u2026 sod it, let\u2019s go for the six kilo. In fact let\u2019s get it all done: work out the full Christmas lunch list and order it for the next 30 years \u2013 what does it matter if the puddings keep turning up after you\u2019ve died yourself? It all comes off the estate before inheritance tax. It\u2019s never too early to start planning. There\u2019s a staff shortage so try to avoid busy times. Make your requests early, gradually and, preferably, in alphabetical order. Book a table online. We\u2019ll need it back after 90 minutes. The menu\u2019s on the website so you can text through your order in advance and then, if you\u2019re running late, we can eat it for you. Then it\u2019s done. Thanks to smartphones, these are all things the people turning up 20 minutes early can be organising as they wait for the train to heat up, and listen to the intermittent beeping of the automatic doors, and feel the carriage get fuller and fuller around them and the windows get covered in condensation from the sweaty panting of the less foresighted, and therefore probably Covid-bearing, so that they can\u2019t even look across the platforms and see fellow early arrivers crammed against their own train windows sending out save-the-date emails for the birthdays of children as yet unborn and then, seeing as they\u2019ve still got five minutes, starting to plan their own funerals so that they can just get ahead on this stuff and book a nice grave somewhere easy for people to visit \u2013 and in fact there\u2019s an app for getting flowers put on it automatically \u2013 and then, instead of going home one night, just head there and lie in it. All ready, everything done, finished.",

The details of the latest UN fact-finding mission report are accompanied by claims from activists that the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary is attempting a genocide of non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur. The report found fighters from the RSF responsible for sexual violence across Sudan, where they have been fighting the army for control since April 2023, with victims aged between eight and 75. But in Darfur, and particularly against the Masalit ethnic group, victims said there was a clearly racial motivation to the violence. The fact-finding mission quotes Masalit rape survivors who overheard the fighters stating their intent that \u201cthis year, all girls must be pregnant by the Janjaweed\u201d. Another from El Geneina said her attacker told her: \u201cWe will make you, the Masalit girls, give birth to Arab children.\u201d The city of El Geneina in the state of West Darfur, with its predominantly Masalit population, was the focus of heavy fighting and a long siege by the RSF fighters, who took control of the city in June 2023. The report said that RSF fighters went door-to-door in Masalit neighbourhoods seeking men to kill. Women were assaulted, raped and subjected to other forms of violence then often told to leave Sudan for neighbouring Chad. Caroline Buisman, coordinator for the Sudan fact-finding mission, said they found the RSF and allied militias had carried out war crimes against Masalit people, including sexual violence, torture, attacking civilians and forcible displacement. \u201cWe found that rape and other forms of sexual violence committed by the RSF and its allied militias formed part of large-scale attacks which targeted, in particular, the Masalit community, on the basis of their ethnicity,\u201d said Buisman. Formalised into a paramilitary from militias known as the Janjaweed, the RSF and its leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, came to prominence following popular protests that ended the three-decade dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir in 2019. With a power base on the fringe of Sudanese society in Darfur, Dagalo was able to lodge himself into the centre of events in the capital Khartoum as the second-in-power in the transitional government, working alongside army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to sideline civilians until the two began tussling for control themselves last year. In the 18 months since fighting began, the RSF and Sudanese army have fought bitter battles for power across the country, displacing around 14 million people according to the UN, while at least 19,000 people have been killed. The RSF has seized almost the entirety of Darfur and embedded itself in Khartoum, forcing the government to relocate to Port Sudan. Services have crumbled, hospitals have been attacked and a lack of humanitarian access has made it difficult to deliver food and medicine to affected areas. A report in May by Human Rights Watch also found evidence of racially motivated sexual violence, including many fighters using ethnic slurs, calling the women they attacked slaves and telling them they would rape Masalit women until they had their Arab babies. It also cited an example of fighters leaving after being told a 15-year-old girl they wanted to rape was from a prominent Arab family. Activists said that the RSF and the Janjaweed militias had a long history of using sexual violence that stretched back to its numerous attacks on non-Arabs in the early 2000s, a period of violence that is under investigation for genocide at the International Criminal Court. Hala Al-Karib, regional director of women\u2019s rights group Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, said conditions in Darfur had deteriorated since the ending of UN peacekeeping in the region in 2020, empowering Arab militias and their leaders. \u201cThe RSF has used sexual violence as a tool for ethnic cleansing and there are definitely footprints of genocide, particularly in western Darfur.

She said the tribes that RSF recruit from believed in their superiority over other communities because of their Arab heritage. \u201cTo keep their superiority, they invade these areas and make sure that they kill the men and change the gene pool by raping women and having babies that are Arabs, not Masalit or Fur or any other black ethnicity,\u201d said Gibril.",

      "body": "<p>When Coen van den Bighelaar first spoke to school friends about taking over their parents\u2019 dairy farms, he was the only one of the four to voice serious doubts. Fresh out of university, he was making more money in a comfortable office than his father did toiling for twice as long in the field.</p> <p>But six years later, Bighelaar has followed in his parents\u2019 footsteps, while his friends\u2019 enthusiasm has waned. One quit farming to take a job in logistics. Another opened a daycare centre to supplement the income from selling milk. A third is thinking about buying land and moving to Canada.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d says Bighelaar, a fourth-generation dairy farmer in the Netherlands who feels a mix of hope and fear about the future. \u201cA lot of young farmers quit because they don\u2019t see any perspective.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands of small and medium-sized farms in Europe shut up shop each year, unable to survive from selling food at the dirt-cheap prices that big competitors offer. The brutal economic situation has inflicted misery on farmers who struggle to turn a profit and forced some to give up or look for additional streams of revenue.</p> <p>Ma\u0142gorzata Maj, who runs a guest house on her parents\u2019 20-hectare sheep farm in south-west Poland, says most of her income now comes from tourists. The profit margins on sheep are so small that \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be able to survive\u201d without guests, she says.</p> <p>The average income on European farms is rising but so, too, is the earnings gap between the biggest and smallest farms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/revealed-the-growing-income-gap-between-europes-biggest-and-smallest-farms#:~:text=The%20income%20gap%20rose%20from,counts%20farms%20with%20unpaid%20labour.\">a Guardian analysis of pay data found</a>. Agricultural economists say the death of small farms is being driven by economies of scale and leaps in technology that big farms are more able to embrace. They can spread capital costs such as large tractors and milking robots over more crops and animals, allowing them to sell at prices that small farms cannot match.</p> <p>\u201cWe would need to have hundreds of hectares of land and breed thousands of sheep to be able to get a proper income,\u201d says Maj, who remembers the stress her parents experienced trying to support a family of seven from farming. \u201cAs kids, we didn\u2019t realise how difficult it is.\u201d </p> <p>Small farmers who try to expand or modernise also face hurdles. They say they struggle to get loans that would let them make the investments needed to compete with industrial farms.</p> <p>\u201cBanks usually don\u2019t like to give credit to farmers,\u201d says Carlos Franco, a blueberry farmer near Lisbon. \u201cIf you have a pig they can give you a sausage \u2013 but the opposite is not possible. It\u2019s very difficult for people to begin without assets to give as collateral.\u201d</p> <p>Franco, who comes from the city but has fond memories of his grandfather\u2019s farm in the country, says he started his own farm eight years ago and expects to break even this year for the first time. If he had been able to secure a big loan from the beginning, he says, he could have bought an automated pumping system that would have helped him hit that point in half the time.</p> <p>Big farms have more capital, and tend to be less reliant on a single product than small farmers, says Franco. \u201cThey don\u2019t put all their eggs in the same basket.\u201d</p> <p>The income crisis among small farmers helped fuel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/01/farmers-hurl-eggs-at-european-parliament-as-leaders-meet-for-summit\">violent protests at the start of the year</a> that farming lobbies used to rail against rules to protect nature and cut pollution. Environmental campaigners argue that big farms exploited public sympathy for small farmers to reject green measures the rest of the sector could afford.</p> <p>Some small farmers see both sides. Bighelaar, who works on his parents\u2019 60-hectare dairy farm, says the investments needed to comply with environmental rules are, indeed, expensive \u2013 and thus more palatable on a big farm than a small one. If he had to invest \u20ac100,000 in technology to reduce nitrogen pollution, he says, it would be easier to stomach if he could spread the costs over 200 cows rather than the 125 he has.</p> <p>\u201cFor small farms and middle-size farms, it\u2019s way harder to join in this transition,\u201d says Bighelaar. \u201cWe want to join \u2026 but it\u2019s not possible for us because our size is too small.\u201d</p> <p>Stakeholders from across the food supply chain agreed in September on the need to reform the EU\u2019s farm subsidy scheme, which hands out more money to bigger farms. They proposed solutions such as supporting farmers based on their needs and creating a just transition fund to help them reduce their environmental footprint.</p> <p>Some farmers say they have taken steps toward sustainable practices without costly loans and investments. Airi Kylvet, an organic beef farmer in Estonia, says she has invested in her knowledge of cows and land rather than in expensive machinery \u2013 but that the administrative burden is still a huge source of stress. \u201cThere are a million officials who control us and deal with only one sector of the system. But the farmer has to know it all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to be a successful farmer you have to be really wise,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a lot of farmers who are good at farming but not good at dealing with all this bureaucracy.\u201d</p> <p>But even as small farmers voice fears about environmental rules becoming more onerous, they also worry about extreme weather growing more violent. Maj was hit by the heavy rain that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/25/global-heating-doubled-chance-of-extreme-rain-in-europe-in-september\">devastated</a> central Europe last month, destroying half a hectare of her land. Franco says the \u201cincredibly hot\u201d weather that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/29/climate-crisis-caused-half-of-european-heat-deaths-in-2022-says-study\">scorched Europe</a> in recent years has made his blueberry plants rot and burn. Studies show both weather extremes were made worse by pollutants heating the planet, about a quarter of which come from food systems.</p> <p>Despite all the stresses, Franco says, he takes pleasure in seeing plants bloom and bees buzz when he works in the fresh farm air. \u201cIn Portugal, we say: agriculture is a way of becoming poor but happy.\u201d</p>",

A third is thinking about buying land and moving to Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d says Bighelaar, a fourth-generation dairy farmer in the Netherlands who feels a mix of hope and fear about the future. \u201cA lot of young farmers quit because they don\u2019t see any perspective.\u201d Thousands of small and medium-sized farms in Europe shut up shop each year, unable to survive from selling food at the dirt-cheap prices that big competitors offer. The brutal economic situation has inflicted misery on farmers who struggle to turn a profit and forced some to give up or look for additional streams of revenue. Ma\u0142gorzata Maj, who runs a guest house on her parents\u2019 20-hectare sheep farm in south-west Poland, says most of her income now comes from tourists. The profit margins on sheep are so small that \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be able to survive\u201d without guests, she says. The average income on European farms is rising but so, too, is the earnings gap between the biggest and smallest farms, a Guardian analysis of pay data found. Agricultural economists say the death of small farms is being driven by economies of scale and leaps in technology that big farms are more able to embrace. They can spread capital costs such as large tractors and milking robots over more crops and animals, allowing them to sell at prices that small farms cannot match. \u201cWe would need to have hundreds of hectares of land and breed thousands of sheep to be able to get a proper income,\u201d says Maj, who remembers the stress her parents experienced trying to support a family of seven from farming. \u201cAs kids, we didn\u2019t realise how difficult it is.\u201d Small farmers who try to expand or modernise also face hurdles. They say they struggle to get loans that would let them make the investments needed to compete with industrial farms. \u201cBanks usually don\u2019t like to give credit to farmers,\u201d says Carlos Franco, a blueberry farmer near Lisbon. \u201cIf you have a pig they can give you a sausage \u2013 but the opposite is not possible. It\u2019s very difficult for people to begin without assets to give as collateral.\u201d Franco, who comes from the city but has fond memories of his grandfather\u2019s farm in the country, says he started his own farm eight years ago and expects to break even this year for the first time. If he had been able to secure a big loan from the beginning, he says, he could have bought an automated pumping system that would have helped him hit that point in half the time. Big farms have more capital, and tend to be less reliant on a single product than small farmers, says Franco. \u201cThey don\u2019t put all their eggs in the same basket.\u201d The income crisis among small farmers helped fuel violent protests at the start of the year that farming lobbies used to rail against rules to protect nature and cut pollution. Environmental campaigners argue that big farms exploited public sympathy for small farmers to reject green measures the rest of the sector could afford. Some small farmers see both sides. Bighelaar, who works on his parents\u2019 60-hectare dairy farm, says the investments needed to comply with environmental rules are, indeed, expensive \u2013 and thus more palatable on a big farm than a small one. If he had to invest \u20ac100,000 in technology to reduce nitrogen pollution, he says, it would be easier to stomach if he could spread the costs over 200 cows rather than the 125 he has. \u201cFor small farms and middle-size farms, it\u2019s way harder to join in this transition,\u201d says Bighelaar. \u201cWe want to join \u2026 but it\u2019s not possible for us because our size is too small.\u201d Stakeholders from across the food supply chain agreed in September on the need to reform the EU\u2019s farm subsidy scheme, which hands out more money to bigger farms. They proposed solutions such as supporting farmers based on their needs and creating a just transition fund to help them reduce their environmental footprint. Some farmers say they have taken steps toward sustainable practices without costly loans and investments. Airi Kylvet, an organic beef farmer in Estonia, says she has invested in her knowledge of cows and land rather than in expensive machinery \u2013 but that the administrative burden is still a huge source of stress. \u201cThere are a million officials who control us and deal with only one sector of the system. But the farmer has to know it all.\u201d \u201cIf you want to be a successful farmer you have to be really wise,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a lot of farmers who are good at farming but not good at dealing with all this bureaucracy.\u201d But even as small farmers voice fears about environmental rules becoming more onerous, they also worry about extreme weather growing more violent. Maj was hit by the heavy rain that devastated central Europe last month, destroying half a hectare of her land. Franco says the \u201cincredibly hot\u201d weather that has scorched Europe in recent years has made his blueberry plants rot and burn. Studies show both weather extremes were made worse by pollutants heating the planet, about a quarter of which come from food systems. Despite all the stresses, Franco says, he takes pleasure in seeing plants bloom and bees buzz when he works in the fresh farm air. \u201cIn Portugal, we say: agriculture is a way of becoming poor but happy.\u201d",

It happens in Ben Wheatley\u2019s new Channel 4 horror series <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/generation-z\">Generation Z</a></strong>, which features young characters, but also pensioners first seen stuck in care homes. In the opening moments, a truck spillage releases a chemical that turns the residents into marauding zombies who crave youthful flesh.</p> <p>As the government and army cordon off the area (Michael Smiley appears as a sinister operative), the drama doesn\u2019t stint on blood and guts. Anita Dobson bites into necks; an undead Paul Bentall pushes his arm through a dog like it\u2019s a cardigan sleeve. While the teenagers (Lewis Gribben from <em>Somewhere Boy</em>, Viola Prettejohn, Buket K\u00f6m\u00fcr, Jay Lycurgo) battle to survive, their elders form a group and hide in the woods, feeding on joggers and conducting bacchanalian orgies. Their late-life zombification isn\u2019t a clearcut tragedy \u2013 it\u2019s a chance for rejuvenation, relevance and revenge. \u201cI feel a power in me,\u201d roars Johnston\u2019s Cecily. \u201cSomething has transformed us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of the more poignant scenes see them remembering what they\u2019ve done and standing, blinking, momentarily saddened by the memory</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is another textured, unnerving piece of work from Wheatley (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/04/kill-list-review\">Kill List</a></em>). I loved his subtle, uneasy 2012 black comedy, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/02/sightseers-film-review\">Sightseers</a></em>. <em>Generation Z</em> isn\u2019t subtle: it\u2019s full-on Disaster TV wielding an abattoir\u2019s-worth of gore. At the same time it spits out big themes: Covid (the young are once again the lost children of lockdown); clashes reminiscent of Brexit; government control; toxic masculinity; intergenerational resentment.</p> <p>Robert Lindsay plays an anti-establishment conspiracist. A strong supporting cast includes Johnny Vegas, T\u2019Nia Miller and Rob James Collier (playing against type as a loutish stepdad). There\u2019s a layer of homegrown horror history mixed in (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/13/classics.johnwyndham\">John Wyndham</a>, <em>The Wicker Man</em>), and a big stylistic wink to 1980s nuclear war-obsessed <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/15/threads-nuclear-apocalypse-bbc-tv-drama-40-years-on-mick-jackson-interview\">Threads</a></em> Britain.</p> <p>Over six episodes there are a fair few unnecessary sub-strands; while the younger cast are great, their trials and tribulations sometimes dominate too much. It\u2019s more novel to watch the crazed, vengeful elderly running amok, cavorting satanically around bonfires. Some of the more poignant scenes see them remembering what they\u2019ve done, blinking, momentarily saddened by the memory. <em>Generation Z</em> emerges as flawed but compelling to the last shot.</p> <p>From dramatising the undead to monetising the dead. If you\u2019re anything like me, watching Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck\u2019s BBC Four <em>Storyville</em> documentary <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024hnl/storyville-eternal-you\">Eternal </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024hnl/storyville-eternal-you\">You</a></strong> may leave you feeling unclean. It\u2019s concerned with a fast-developing branch of the death industry called the \u201cdigital afterlife\u201d, in which the bereaved are given the chance to derive comfort from \u201ccommunicating\u201d with the dead.</p>    <p>As explored here, it\u2019s a bit like an AI-generated medium or seance, but with different levels of effect and intrusion.

      "bodyText": "Generation Z (Channel 4) | channel4.com Storyville: Eternal You (BBC Four) | iPlayer Helmand: Tour of Duty (BBC Two) | iPlayer Doctor Odyssey (Disney+) Of all the sights modern television has to offer, still, it\u2019s a shock to see Sue Johnston gnawing on human flesh with blood caked all over her face. It happens in Ben Wheatley\u2019s new Channel 4 horror series Generation Z, which features young characters, but also pensioners first seen stuck in care homes. In the opening moments, a truck spillage releases a chemical that turns the residents into marauding zombies who crave youthful flesh. As the government and army cordon off the area (Michael Smiley appears as a sinister operative), the drama doesn\u2019t stint on blood and guts. Anita Dobson bites into necks; an undead Paul Bentall pushes his arm through a dog like it\u2019s a cardigan sleeve. While the teenagers (Lewis Gribben from Somewhere Boy, Viola Prettejohn, Buket K\u00f6m\u00fcr, Jay Lycurgo) battle to survive, their elders form a group and hide in the woods, feeding on joggers and conducting bacchanalian orgies. Their late-life zombification isn\u2019t a clearcut tragedy \u2013 it\u2019s a chance for rejuvenation, relevance and revenge. \u201cI feel a power in me,\u201d roars Johnston\u2019s Cecily. \u201cSomething has transformed us.\u201d This is another textured, unnerving piece of work from Wheatley (Kill List). I loved his subtle, uneasy 2012 black comedy, Sightseers. Generation Z isn\u2019t subtle: it\u2019s full-on Disaster TV wielding an abattoir\u2019s-worth of gore. At the same time it spits out big themes: Covid (the young are once again the lost children of lockdown); clashes reminiscent of Brexit; government control; toxic masculinity; intergenerational resentment. Robert Lindsay plays an anti-establishment conspiracist. A strong supporting cast includes Johnny Vegas, T\u2019Nia Miller and Rob James Collier (playing against type as a loutish stepdad). There\u2019s a layer of homegrown horror history mixed in (John Wyndham, The Wicker Man), and a big stylistic wink to 1980s nuclear war-obsessed Threads Britain. Over six episodes there are a fair few unnecessary sub-strands; while the younger cast are great, their trials and tribulations sometimes dominate too much. It\u2019s more novel to watch the crazed, vengeful elderly running amok, cavorting satanically around bonfires. Some of the more poignant scenes see them remembering what they\u2019ve done, blinking, momentarily saddened by the memory. Generation Z emerges as flawed but compelling to the last shot. From dramatising the undead to monetising the dead. If you\u2019re anything like me, watching Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck\u2019s BBC Four Storyville documentary Eternal You may leave you feeling unclean. It\u2019s concerned with a fast-developing branch of the death industry called the \u201cdigital afterlife\u201d, in which the bereaved are given the chance to derive comfort from \u201ccommunicating\u201d with the dead. As explored here, it\u2019s a bit like an AI-generated medium or seance, but with different levels of effect and intrusion. One looks basic: back and forth messaging, with the AI drawing on the dead person\u2019s digital information to make them sound legitimate. Another painstakingly reactivates the voice of the departed. A third, courtesy of a Korean TV station, produces a full-blown interactive virtual reality avatar: a playful little girl runs around as her sobbing mother, wearing a VR helmet, gropes the air trying to hug her. This is the point at which I recoil. It all seems so exploitative.

In Michigan, the phrase \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d was said dozens of times \u2013 and by the way, when people say that, they\u2019re usually voting Trump. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the advantages of being blind and in journalism is that you can focus on the words</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>A recent poll found that </strong><strong>a quarter of Americans fear civil war following the election. </strong><strong>Does that seem a credible threat to you?<br></strong>The idea of America is under enormous strain. The divides are everywhere \u2013 between the coasts and the centre, the north and the south, the urban and the rural, the religious and the unreligious. They are so entrenched that there is very little crossover communication, very little empathy. I find that incredibly sad. Do I think there could be civil war? I don\u2019t but you\u2019d be a fool to rule out violence. I mean, we\u2019ve already had violence, haven\u2019t we?</p>    <p><strong>Right. What went through your mind as you dived for cover at Butler?<br></strong>I knew immediately that those were gunshots, and then suddenly realised Trump had stopped talking. That\u2019s the \u201cOh shit!\u201d moment. Your mind is working at a million miles an hour \u2013 you have no idea whether it\u2019s over or not, and then you hear the screaming start and you think, we\u2019re in a pretty exposed position.</p> <p><strong>You ended up getting a vital interview \u2013 </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4v7v2g5l1o\">with a man wearing a Trump visor</a> topped with fake hair</strong><strong> and holding a beer can.<br></strong>I don\u2019t know what prejudices I\u2019d have brought to it if I could see. One of the advantages of being blind and in journalism is that you can focus on the words. I\u2019m a listener. If we\u2019d put someone on air live who was lying or got it wrong, it could have really inflamed the situation, but Greg Smith was consistent.</p> <p><strong>Advances in technology must have made your professional life simultaneously easier and still more challenging.<br></strong>Keeping up with information and the world as it is now, I feel like I\u2019m paddling furiously under the surface the whole time. You\u2019re listening to things mainly on audio, so it\u2019s all linear, you can\u2019t skim in the way you can when you can see. I rely on the wonderful Iona [Hampson, O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s senior producer] to let me know what\u2019s trending and what I\u2019m missing, but I must spend 70% more time than my colleagues just trying to keep up.</p> <p><strong>Does it ever get you down?<br></strong>Sometimes it takes its toll because you\u2019re obviously dealing with the same kind of life stuff that everyone has. I was in Chicago to report on Kamala Harris\u2019s acceptance speech at the DNC when my mother died. I had a bit of a wobble recently because I realised I hadn\u2019t thought about her once in four or five days. The guilt was just awful.</p> <p><strong>How has broadcast journalism changed over the course of your career?<br></strong>When I started out, there were no anti-discrimination laws. People could say: \u201cYou can\u2019t be a reporter, you\u2019re blind.\u201d Now they can\u2019t say that, which makes it harder to spot, but there are still dinosaurs around who believe it. Fortunately the key people at the BBC get it and they\u2019re kind of chuffed \u2013 I mean, I am the first ever disabled foreign correspondent. We\u2019re publicly funded, we need to walk, talk, look, sound, smell like the country who pays our salaries, right?</p>    <p><strong>Where does your resilience come from?<br></strong>I lost my sight when I was eight and was sent away to boarding school, because that\u2019s where blind children were educated in those days. It was actually the best thing that ever happened to me because I ended up with a Rolls-Royce education. But the other thing that happens is you\u2019re forced to build some resilience because a thousand times a day there are micro-aggressions, as they call them nowadays. </p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve spoken about how your mother once confided that things were so hard in your childhood, she\u2019d thought of killing you both. Presumably she betrayed none of that at the time?<br></strong>None at all. It was really tough and my parents weren\u2019t educated people, but they were incredibly foresightful: they knew that getting me an education would give me some independence in life. It must have broken their hearts sending me away but they did the right thing.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the most distressing news story you\u2019ve ever had to report on?<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pittsburgh-shooting\">The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting</a>. I\u2019d done other mass shootings but there was so much horrible detail about what happened, every sinew in me was screaming. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever come to losing it on air.</p> <p><strong>Is there a story you\u2019re especially proud of?<br></strong>The Trump conviction. I basically did the whole 10 o\u2019clock news with Clive Myrie. The drama was magnificent but the thing I was particularly pleased with is that the years of working hard to understand America meant I could sustain something as high profile as that, for all that time.</p> <p><strong>What do you do to decompress?<br></strong>I\u2019m continually rereading the multi-volume <em><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-history-of-the-united-states-ohus/?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Oxford History of the United States</a></em>, but fiction is the thing that calms me down. I love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/colson-whitehead\">Colson Whitehead</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/02/claire-keegan-i-cant-explain-my-work-i-just-write-stories-so-late-in-the-day-interview\">Claire Keegan</a>, Henry James.</p> <p><strong>Is there anything you miss about the UK?<br></strong>London, mince pies and proper chocolate. American chocolate sucks, as they say.<br></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2024. Gary O\u2019Donoghue was born in London, not Norfolk as an earlier version had said due to an editing error.</p>",

If we\u2019d put someone on air live who was lying or got it wrong, it could have really inflamed the situation, but Greg Smith was consistent. Advances in technology must have made your professional life simultaneously easier and still more challenging. Keeping up with information and the world as it is now, I feel like I\u2019m paddling furiously under the surface the whole time. You\u2019re listening to things mainly on audio, so it\u2019s all linear, you can\u2019t skim in the way you can when you can see. I rely on the wonderful Iona [Hampson, O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s senior producer] to let me know what\u2019s trending and what I\u2019m missing, but I must spend 70% more time than my colleagues just trying to keep up. Does it ever get you down? Sometimes it takes its toll because you\u2019re obviously dealing with the same kind of life stuff that everyone has. I was in Chicago to report on Kamala Harris\u2019s acceptance speech at the DNC when my mother died. I had a bit of a wobble recently because I realised I hadn\u2019t thought about her once in four or five days. The guilt was just awful. How has broadcast journalism changed over the course of your career? When I started out, there were no anti-discrimination laws. People could say: \u201cYou can\u2019t be a reporter, you\u2019re blind.\u201d Now they can\u2019t say that, which makes it harder to spot, but there are still dinosaurs around who believe it. Fortunately the key people at the BBC get it and they\u2019re kind of chuffed \u2013 I mean, I am the first ever disabled foreign correspondent. We\u2019re publicly funded, we need to walk, talk, look, sound, smell like the country who pays our salaries, right? Where does your resilience come from? I lost my sight when I was eight and was sent away to boarding school, because that\u2019s where blind children were educated in those days. It was actually the best thing that ever happened to me because I ended up with a Rolls-Royce education. But the other thing that happens is you\u2019re forced to build some resilience because a thousand times a day there are micro-aggressions, as they call them nowadays. You\u2019ve spoken about how your mother once confided that things were so hard in your childhood, she\u2019d thought of killing you both. Presumably she betrayed none of that at the time? None at all. It was really tough and my parents weren\u2019t educated people, but they were incredibly foresightful: they knew that getting me an education would give me some independence in life. It must have broken their hearts sending me away but they did the right thing. What\u2019s the most distressing news story you\u2019ve ever had to report on? The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. I\u2019d done other mass shootings but there was so much horrible detail about what happened, every sinew in me was screaming. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever come to losing it on air. Is there a story you\u2019re especially proud of? The Trump conviction. I basically did the whole 10 o\u2019clock news with Clive Myrie. The drama was magnificent but the thing I was particularly pleased with is that the years of working hard to understand America meant I could sustain something as high profile as that, for all that time. What do you do to decompress? I\u2019m continually rereading the multi-volume Oxford History of the United States, but fiction is the thing that calms me down. I love Colson Whitehead, Claire Keegan, Henry James. Is there anything you miss about the UK? London, mince pies and proper chocolate. American chocolate sucks, as they say. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2024. Gary O\u2019Donoghue was born in London, not Norfolk as an earlier version had said due to an editing error.",

      "body": "<p>Anne-Marie Duff was out for a walk on London\u2019s Hampstead Heath, drinking an oat-milk latte (\u201cBecause I\u2019m an actress!\u201d) when suddenly she was surrounded by a group of men. They were red-faced runners in Lycra, \u201cvery affluent, very sophisticated middle-aged guys, and they stopped me on the path.\u201d She was startled. Yes, she\u2019s famous, having been familiar to British viewers ever since her breakthrough in Paul Abbott\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shameless\">Shameless</a></em> 20 years ago, but even so, hers has never been the \u201cstop you for an autograph\u201d kind of fame, more the discerning nod, the briefly clasped \u201cthank you\u201d hands. They wanted to talk to her, they said, \u201cto ask what I thought about a friend of theirs. They were worried.\u201d</p> <p>Duff quickly understood. The men had seen the multi-award winning black comedy <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/bad-sisters-review-sharon-horgan-pitch-black-comedy-is-murderously-good\">Bad Sisters</a></em>, in which Duff\u2019s character, Grace, is a victim of coercive abuse by \u201cthe Prick\u201d, her husband, whose death haunts the series. Duff has explored abuse on screen before \u2013 she\u2019s worked with <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwveK4BhD4ARIsAKy6pMLARYPBSYubSYhETyngiA8_9kXvKZ_WJbHuLuKJI-htZ20Dkvaopj0aAhzIEALw_wcB\">Women\u2019s Aid</a> and played a woman escaping violence in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/14/2\">Born Equal</a></em> \u2013 but this is the first time, she says, that the work has resonated not just with women, but men, too. Posh men. \u201cMen who were sweating all over me.\u201d They gave examples of their friend\u2019s abusive behaviour to his partner, \u201cand I said, \u2018Yeah, to be honest, that doesn\u2019t sound great.\u2019\u201d She gave them some advice and suggested they encourage their wives to support their friend\u2019s wife and went on her way. \u201cActually I felt sort of flattered, you know? Because it\u2019s like, we nailed it. We did it properly.\u201d</p> <p>Duff, now 54, has been acting professionally since 1994, having first been encouraged to join a youth theatre by her parents, who thought it might help with her crippling shyness. They were a working-class Irish family in west London and, despite her suspicion that \u201cpeople like me\u201d didn\u2019t become actors, she went on to study at the prestigious <a href=\"https://www.thedramacentre.co.uk/\">Drama Centre</a> (known colloquially as the \u201ctrauma centre\u201d, so rigorous were its methods). Decades of acclaim followed, culminating last year in a Bafta for her role in <em>Bad Sisters</em>.</p> <p>The new series is typically dark and surprising. \u201cIt\u2019s really extraordinary, in fact,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause, it has such a different smell, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d In the first series Grace was the object \u2013 widowed at the start, the story dragged us backwards into the weeds of her abusive marriage. Without giving too much away, in the new series she becomes the subject. Talking to co-star Fiona Shaw about the twist, \u201cShe was like, \u2018Honey, you\u2019re everywhere in the show\u2026\u2019\u201d Her accent is impeccable. \u201c\u2018Even when you\u2019re not there, you\u2019re everywhere.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She plays Grace with typical Duff-ian nuance and beauty. \u201cGrace was an incredibly difficult part to play,\u201d admits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sharon-horgan\">Sharon Horgan</a>, the show\u2019s creator. \u201cBut for Anne-Marie it was always about creating a fully believable atmosphere for the character. Then she\u2019ll do anything. She\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had never played anybody that opaque before,\u201d says Duff. \u201cYou know, that lost. I found it overwhelming, inhabiting that little soul, that lost wisp of a woman for that long. But I\u2019m always up for telling stories about a section of society\u2019s difficult reality. It\u2019s important, isn\u2019t it? Because if you do that well, the effect is profound.\u201d</p>    <p>The only time she\u2019s received a similar depth of response to that of <em>Bad Sisters</em> was when she played Joan of Arc on stage, and got letters from young Christian women battling with their faith. It\u2019s a responsibility she takes seriously. She takes the work seriously. \u201cThis is the thing about life, your intentions are what is received. So if you take the issue seriously, people take you seriously. Or if you\u2019re worried about certain things, then those things are what people will focus on. You know, gesture\u2019s bigger than any sentence. That\u2019s what it feels like to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes acting with Anne-Marie so enjoyable,\u201d says Rory Kinnear, who starred opposite her in the National Theatre\u2019s production of <em>Macbeth</em>, \u201cis that, like all great actors, she always seems to exist completely in the moment. As if she\u2019s saying the lines for the first time, as if, in fact, she\u2019s only just thought of them to say.\u201d She\u2019s fearless, he says, with a preparedness to fail that only can come alongside a complete lack of personal vanity. \u201cShe is also one of the great laughers, and manages to imbue her work with such tenderness, depth and delicacy while refusing to ever take herself too seriously. She has magic in her.\u201d</p> <p>When directors approach Duff, what does she think they\u2019re looking for? \u201cI don\u2019t know, pal. I\u2019m not being disingenuous, I promise I\u2019m not.\u201d She thinks for a second. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m quite courageous? And I guess people like to have their shit taken seriously. It\u2019s nice when someone can come in and go, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to commit to this.\u2019\u201d She explains what that looks like, the act of taking a story seriously. \u201cWell the flaws are the sexy bits. But I do spend a lot of time worrying about getting into the very truth of something, you know? Because those are the bits that surprise people.\u201d</p> <p>Does that commitment come from studying in a strict conservatoire environment? \u201cYes, but I think there has to be an element of the fact of where it came from, too, what\u2019s at stake. Because there wasn\u2019t any other option for me, in terms of falling back on anything. There wasn\u2019t anyone who could help me, you know? You get this extraordinary work ethic if you have a pinch of impostor syndrome. And I think if you\u2019ve got a vagina that can partly be an element of it, too.\u201d There\u2019s no trick to being a good actor, she adds, no trick to being an artist. \u201cDo you think Mark Rylance just tips up? Fuck off! All the brilliant people work their asses off. Good luck,\u201d she says, pointing a gentle finger, \u201cis just working hard.\u201d</p>    <p>Duff herself seems jolly, settled and steely \u2013 she brings a low sort of light to the room, yet the characters she leans towards are women in crisis, women at a point of change, \u201cBecause who wants to be the one putting Superman\u2019s cape on him and saying, \u2018Have a great day, darling?\u2019\u201d Not her. While she\u2019s still seeing a lack of meaty parts for women on screen, \u201cWe\u2019re getting there slowly, slowly. The incrementalism feels a bit like we\u2019re taking larger strides now. But it is a curious time when it comes to gender. I think we do still have to be vigilant.\u201d</p> <p>And not just in terms of art. She co-parents her teenage son with her ex-husband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/06/ive-failed-badly-and-im-good-with-it-james-mcavoy-on-class-comfort-and-carnage\">James McAvoy</a>, who she met on the set of <em>Shameless</em> and divorced in 2016. It\u2019s a \u201cscary\u201d time to be a woman, she says, let alone a feminist, let alone a mother of a boy. \u201cI think the rhetoric around it is frustrating sometimes,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t love the expression \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019, because masculinity is a describing noun, isn\u2019t it? Is all masculinity toxic? It\u2019s like saying, \u2018pathetic femininity\u2019.\u201d Her face crumples into an expression of pain. \u201cMy worry is that there are a lot of young boys who think it\u2019s innate.\u201d</p> <p>A friend told her a story the other day, \u201ca very sad story\u201d about a 13-year-old boy they knew who was having counselling because he thought there was an inevitability about him becoming a rapist. \u201cWe have to be so careful with our young people,\u201d she says, who want to be good, but meet obstacles at every turn. Like her son, who has complained multiple times about racist posts to TikTok, she sighs, but had no response. \u201cOur kids are growing up in a world that makes no sense. People say, but don\u2019t do, a lot of the time.\u201d Not Duff, though.</p> <p><em><strong>One afternoon she</strong></em> had just come offstage at the National when she got a call from her GP. Her brother had walked into the surgery and asked for help \u2013 he didn\u2019t know where he was. Eddie was around 40, when, Duff says, \u201cI just started noticing funny wee things. All of the classics, it\u2019s always the classics. Trouble making tea, getting on the bus, couldn\u2019t work, pay rent, and me just thinking, what the hell is going on here?\u201d After he walked into the doctor\u2019s surgery, he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and Duff\u2019s life suddenly pitched quite sharply to the left.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. But the gift that it gives you is\u2026 it\u2019s very hard to explain.\u201d When you\u2019re with him, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re <em>so</em> with him. Everything else kind of evaporates, you know, because you\u2019re so focused on just those moments. We don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have with him, because it\u2019s one of those bastards of a disease where the prognosis is a question mark, so you have to really treasure it. And any of the sticky old nonsense you have from the past, any of your minor complex familial crap that you carry around with you, it\u2019s all gone. Because them not remembering it means you don\u2019t have to either.\u201d She\u2019s closer to him than she\u2019s ever been, as is her son, \u201cand that\u2019s beautiful. People call it, don\u2019t they, the long goodbye?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s turned down roles in the past that overlapped with her experience with Eddie, stories about Alzheimer\u2019s, as they felt too close, \u201cand for my mum and dad, I thought it might be overwhelming.\u201d She\u2019d consider, maybe, directing something on the subject. But at the moment, \u201cI\u2019m literally like a dog pulling at the lead, I\u2019m so excited to get back on stage again,\u201d in a production of <em><a href=\"https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/the-little-foxes\">The Little Foxes</a></em> at the Young Vic. What excites her about theatre? \u201cBecause it\u2019s like this now, it\u2019s just like you and me. And there is nothing as thrilling as the moment you change the temperature in the room. As soon as you say \u2018I love you\u2019 to someone on stage, the whole room will gasp. How fucking sexy is that? You feel like a rock star. You want to turn around sometimes and go to the audience, \u2018I know, right?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s known this feeling for decades, ever since those first performances as a kid. The realisation that came with acting, the discovery that, \u201cWe\u2019re all interesting, all of us. And that\u2019s what drama does really give you. The notion, actually, everyone\u2019s fucking fascinating.\u201d And acting made her feel safe, too. \u201cI love the security, however unhealthy this sounds, of the fact that it\u2019s not random, like life. It\u2019s the beginning, the middle and the end. And even if you die in act five, you know you\u2019re going to die. So I\u2019ve always felt there was a great comfort in that, and that it made everything dealable with in a way that real life doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>    <p>Another lovely thing about being an actor, she says, is that, \u201cIt keeps you young. Because you have to be curious all the time. You keep working, you keep staying interested. And feeling like you\u2019re not finished yet.\u201d Does she think often about age? \u201cOf course! It\u2019s a bit like people who deny the fact that they\u2019ve got childcare. It\u2019s such a lie. Everyone thinks about age. I have to look at my ageing face on the screen, which,\u201d she laughs hollowly, \u201cis not easy. But I\u2019m trying to see the beauty in it. I\u2019m at this weird little phase where I look at my face and go, \u2018Oh, age has brought me a couple of really nice things.\u2019 I don\u2019t like the lines, but I like the shape of my cheekbones now. You have to try, don\u2019t you, and see the little gifts it gives you.\u201d</p> <p>And beyond appearance, she likes the way age increases her \u201cbreadth\u201d, how being around teenagers especially, \u201ckeeps you engaged, in the way the tides come in and out, and how things are changing. Even though you hate having to listen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/travis-scott\">Travis Scott</a> on the drive into school, there\u2019s something about it, too, that makes you go, \u2018Oh, really?

      "bodyText": "Anne-Marie Duff was out for a walk on London\u2019s Hampstead Heath, drinking an oat-milk latte (\u201cBecause I\u2019m an actress!\u201d) when suddenly she was surrounded by a group of men. They were red-faced runners in Lycra, \u201cvery affluent, very sophisticated middle-aged guys, and they stopped me on the path.\u201d She was startled. Yes, she\u2019s famous, having been familiar to British viewers ever since her breakthrough in Paul Abbott\u2019s Shameless 20 years ago, but even so, hers has never been the \u201cstop you for an autograph\u201d kind of fame, more the discerning nod, the briefly clasped \u201cthank you\u201d hands. They wanted to talk to her, they said, \u201cto ask what I thought about a friend of theirs. They were worried.\u201d Duff quickly understood. The men had seen the multi-award winning black comedy Bad Sisters, in which Duff\u2019s character, Grace, is a victim of coercive abuse by \u201cthe Prick\u201d, her husband, whose death haunts the series. Duff has explored abuse on screen before \u2013 she\u2019s worked with Women\u2019s Aid and played a woman escaping violence in Born Equal \u2013 but this is the first time, she says, that the work has resonated not just with women, but men, too. Posh men. \u201cMen who were sweating all over me.\u201d They gave examples of their friend\u2019s abusive behaviour to his partner, \u201cand I said, \u2018Yeah, to be honest, that doesn\u2019t sound great.\u2019\u201d She gave them some advice and suggested they encourage their wives to support their friend\u2019s wife and went on her way. \u201cActually I felt sort of flattered, you know? Because it\u2019s like, we nailed it. We did it properly.\u201d Duff, now 54, has been acting professionally since 1994, having first been encouraged to join a youth theatre by her parents, who thought it might help with her crippling shyness. They were a working-class Irish family in west London and, despite her suspicion that \u201cpeople like me\u201d didn\u2019t become actors, she went on to study at the prestigious Drama Centre (known colloquially as the \u201ctrauma centre\u201d, so rigorous were its methods). Decades of acclaim followed, culminating last year in a Bafta for her role in Bad Sisters. The new series is typically dark and surprising. \u201cIt\u2019s really extraordinary, in fact,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause, it has such a different smell, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d In the first series Grace was the object \u2013 widowed at the start, the story dragged us backwards into the weeds of her abusive marriage. Without giving too much away, in the new series she becomes the subject. Talking to co-star Fiona Shaw about the twist, \u201cShe was like, \u2018Honey, you\u2019re everywhere in the show\u2026\u2019\u201d Her accent is impeccable. \u201c\u2018Even when you\u2019re not there, you\u2019re everywhere.\u2019\u201d She plays Grace with typical Duff-ian nuance and beauty. \u201cGrace was an incredibly difficult part to play,\u201d admits Sharon Horgan, the show\u2019s creator. \u201cBut for Anne-Marie it was always about creating a fully believable atmosphere for the character. Then she\u2019ll do anything. She\u2019s incredible.\u201d \u201cI had never played anybody that opaque before,\u201d says Duff. \u201cYou know, that lost. I found it overwhelming, inhabiting that little soul, that lost wisp of a woman for that long. But I\u2019m always up for telling stories about a section of society\u2019s difficult reality. It\u2019s important, isn\u2019t it? Because if you do that well, the effect is profound.\u201d The only time she\u2019s received a similar depth of response to that of Bad Sisters was when she played Joan of Arc on stage, and got letters from young Christian women battling with their faith. It\u2019s a responsibility she takes seriously. She takes the work seriously. \u201cThis is the thing about life, your intentions are what is received. So if you take the issue seriously, people take you seriously. Or if you\u2019re worried about certain things, then those things are what people will focus on. You know, gesture\u2019s bigger than any sentence. That\u2019s what it feels like to me.\u201d \u201cWhat makes acting with Anne-Marie so enjoyable,\u201d says Rory Kinnear, who starred opposite her in the National Theatre\u2019s production of Macbeth, \u201cis that, like all great actors, she always seems to exist completely in the moment. As if she\u2019s saying the lines for the first time, as if, in fact, she\u2019s only just thought of them to say.\u201d She\u2019s fearless, he says, with a preparedness to fail that only can come alongside a complete lack of personal vanity. \u201cShe is also one of the great laughers, and manages to imbue her work with such tenderness, depth and delicacy while refusing to ever take herself too seriously. She has magic in her.\u201d When directors approach Duff, what does she think they\u2019re looking for? \u201cI don\u2019t know, pal. I\u2019m not being disingenuous, I promise I\u2019m not.\u201d She thinks for a second. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m quite courageous? And I guess people like to have their shit taken seriously. It\u2019s nice when someone can come in and go, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to commit to this.\u2019\u201d She explains what that looks like, the act of taking a story seriously. \u201cWell the flaws are the sexy bits. But I do spend a lot of time worrying about getting into the very truth of something, you know? Because those are the bits that surprise people.\u201d Does that commitment come from studying in a strict conservatoire environment? \u201cYes, but I think there has to be an element of the fact of where it came from, too, what\u2019s at stake. Because there wasn\u2019t any other option for me, in terms of falling back on anything. There wasn\u2019t anyone who could help me, you know? You get this extraordinary work ethic if you have a pinch of impostor syndrome. And I think if you\u2019ve got a vagina that can partly be an element of it, too.\u201d There\u2019s no trick to being a good actor, she adds, no trick to being an artist. \u201cDo you think Mark Rylance just tips up? Fuck off! All the brilliant people work their asses off. Good luck,\u201d she says, pointing a gentle finger, \u201cis just working hard.\u201d Duff herself seems jolly, settled and steely \u2013 she brings a low sort of light to the room, yet the characters she leans towards are women in crisis, women at a point of change, \u201cBecause who wants to be the one putting Superman\u2019s cape on him and saying, \u2018Have a great day, darling?\u2019\u201d Not her. While she\u2019s still seeing a lack of meaty parts for women on screen, \u201cWe\u2019re getting there slowly, slowly. The incrementalism feels a bit like we\u2019re taking larger strides now. But it is a curious time when it comes to gender. I think we do still have to be vigilant.\u201d And not just in terms of art. She co-parents her teenage son with her ex-husband James McAvoy, who she met on the set of Shameless and divorced in 2016. It\u2019s a \u201cscary\u201d time to be a woman, she says, let alone a feminist, let alone a mother of a boy. \u201cI think the rhetoric around it is frustrating sometimes,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t love the expression \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019, because masculinity is a describing noun, isn\u2019t it? Is all masculinity toxic? It\u2019s like saying, \u2018pathetic femininity\u2019.\u201d Her face crumples into an expression of pain. \u201cMy worry is that there are a lot of young boys who think it\u2019s innate.\u201d A friend told her a story the other day, \u201ca very sad story\u201d about a 13-year-old boy they knew who was having counselling because he thought there was an inevitability about him becoming a rapist. \u201cWe have to be so careful with our young people,\u201d she says, who want to be good, but meet obstacles at every turn. Like her son, who has complained multiple times about racist posts to TikTok, she sighs, but had no response. \u201cOur kids are growing up in a world that makes no sense. People say, but don\u2019t do, a lot of the time.\u201d Not Duff, though. One afternoon she had just come offstage at the National when she got a call from her GP. Her brother had walked into the surgery and asked for help \u2013 he didn\u2019t know where he was. Eddie was around 40, when, Duff says, \u201cI just started noticing funny wee things. All of the classics, it\u2019s always the classics. Trouble making tea, getting on the bus, couldn\u2019t work, pay rent, and me just thinking, what the hell is going on here?\u201d After he walked into the doctor\u2019s surgery, he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s and Duff\u2019s life suddenly pitched quite sharply to the left. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. But the gift that it gives you is\u2026 it\u2019s very hard to explain.\u201d When you\u2019re with him, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re so with him. Everything else kind of evaporates, you know, because you\u2019re so focused on just those moments. We don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll have with him, because it\u2019s one of those bastards of a disease where the prognosis is a question mark, so you have to really treasure it. And any of the sticky old nonsense you have from the past, any of your minor complex familial crap that you carry around with you, it\u2019s all gone. Because them not remembering it means you don\u2019t have to either.\u201d She\u2019s closer to him than she\u2019s ever been, as is her son, \u201cand that\u2019s beautiful. People call it, don\u2019t they, the long goodbye?\u201d She\u2019s turned down roles in the past that overlapped with her experience with Eddie, stories about Alzheimer\u2019s, as they felt too close, \u201cand for my mum and dad, I thought it might be overwhelming.\u201d She\u2019d consider, maybe, directing something on the subject. But at the moment, \u201cI\u2019m literally like a dog pulling at the lead, I\u2019m so excited to get back on stage again,\u201d in a production of The Little Foxes at the Young Vic. What excites her about theatre? \u201cBecause it\u2019s like this now, it\u2019s just like you and me. And there is nothing as thrilling as the moment you change the temperature in the room.

Some offer voters the option of returning absentee ballots to a secure dropbox. Eight states practice \u201call-mail\u201d elections in which all registered voters receive a ballot in the mail, whether or not they plan to use it.</p> \n<p>Federal law requires states to send absentee ballots to military voters and voters overseas. Most states allow officials to immediately process absentee ballots but some require them to wait until election day to begin processing ballots \u2013 which can slow the release of election results.</p> \n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">election day,</a> which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/when-do-polls-close-election-day\">5 November</a> this year, everyone else goes to polling places to cast their vote.

She is a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor and is bidding to make history as the first woman and first woman of colour to be elected president in America\u2019s 248-year history.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/trump-behavior-final-meltdown\">Donald Trump</a>, 78, the Republican nominee, is making make his third consecutive run for the White House. The businessman and reality TV star continues to repeat his false claim that Democrats stole the 2020 election from him. He is the first president to be impeached twice and convicted of a crime. Trump is also the oldest major party nominee in history and this summer survived two assassination attempts.</p> \n<p>Chase Oliver, 39, is the little-known candidate for the Libertarian party. Oliver ran for a Georgia state senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote. The party, which prioritises small government and individual freedoms, typically gains 3% or less of the national vote but its members could yet prove crucial in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/03/electoral-votes-swing-state-margins-explained?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">swing states</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jill-stein\">Jill Stein</a>, 74, a physician who ran under the Green party in 2016, is running again in 2024.

But the Republicans George W Bush and Donald Trump won the White House by gaining more than 270 votes in the all-important <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/election-electoral-college-votes-explained\">electoral college</a>.</p> \n<p>Each state counts its votes separately. With two exceptions \u2013 Nebraska and Maine \u2013 the winner of a state gets all of its electoral votes. Each state has a number of electors based on the number of congressional districts it has, plus two additional votes representing the state\u2019s Senate seats. Washington DC has three electoral votes, despite having no voting representation in Congress.</p> \n<p>This year the electoral college will probably come down to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/swing-state-polls-pennsylvania-michigan-georgia-arizona-wisconsin-nevada-north-carolina\">seven crucial battleground states</a> \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Harris and Trump campaigns are eyeing multiple combinations that could put them over the top.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, which carries 19 electoral college votes, is the ultimate prize and has been the focus of much campaigning. Along with Michigan and Wisconsin, it forms a \u201cblue wall\u201d won by Barack Obama, lost by Hillary Clinton and won by Joe Biden. Trump is targeting rural blue-collar voters; Harris is aiming to turn out Black voters in big cities.</p> \n<p>Losses in these states might be offset by victories in Arizona, where Trump has made gains among Latino voters; Nevada, the most diverse swing state; and Georgia, long a red state which Biden narrowly flipped in 2020. Republicans have won North Carolina in every election since 2012 but Democrats are running close this time.</p> \n<p>Democrats currently control the Senate but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/presidential-congress-election-polls-democrats\">face a tough map this year</a>. Democrats and senators who caucus with them currently occupy seven of the eight most competitive seats, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/montana-senate-race-jon-tester-democrats\">Montana</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/ohio-senate-election-power-balance\">Ohio</a>, which generally lean Republican.</p> \n<p>The House is likely to hinge on 42 of the most competitive elections. Republicans could retain control by winning just 12 of the 26 seats rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report if they also win seats deemed \u201clikely\u201d or \u201clean\u201d Republican.</p> \n<h2>What are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/election-harris-trump-issues-policies\">the main issues</a> that will decide the White House?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/us-elections-2024-guide/anim-6-main-issues\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Abortion.</strong> This is the first presidential election since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a>. Many Republican-led states have since imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state\">total or near-total bans</a> on the procedure. Harris has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion. Trump has struggled to find his footing on the issue, insisting that it is a state matter and belatedly ruling out a national ban. Constitutional amendments that would protect or expand abortion rights will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states\">appear on the ballot in 10 states</a>, which Democrats hope will drive higher turnout.</p> \n<p><strong>Democracy.</strong> Democrats have warned that Trump poses an existential threat to democratic norms, citing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/06/what-happened-january-6-trump-democracy-election\">6 January 2021 insurrection</a>, when a mob of his supporters attempted to overturn his election defeat. Harris has described her opponent as a fascist who has said he would be a dictator on day one and who would yield to foreign autocrats such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Trump has sought to turn the tables by claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Harris is the true threat to democracy, citing alleged online censorship and the criminal cases against him. He has refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election. A recent a Washington Post-Schar School <a href=\"https://s2.washingtonpost.com/3f5f201/671abd80eecc072801c78b50/596b43419bbc0f403f8e1b20/15/51/671abd80eecc072801c78b50\">survey</a> of voters in seven swing states found that slightly more trust Trump to handle threats to democracy than Harris.</p> \n<p><strong>Economy.</strong> The Economist magazine describes the US economy as the envy of the world, contending: \u201cThe American economy has left other rich countries in the dust.\u201d But despite strong growth, low unemployment and stabilising inflation, Biden and Harris have consistently trailed Trump in opinion polls. Harris\u2019s economic plans include tax cuts for most Americans, price-gouging bans, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. Trump has vowed to cut taxes, impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods and protect social security and Medicare.</p> \n<p><strong>I</strong><strong>mmigration.</strong> This has been Trump\u2019s signature issue since he trundled down an escalator at Trump Tower in June 2015 to launch his presidential bid. This time, even as border crossings drop to 2020 levels, he has pledged what he calls the biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies\">deportation operation</a> in US history. He has also used dehumanising language reminiscent of the Nazis to claim that undocumented immigrants are \u201canimals\u201d, have \u201cbad genes\u201d and are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally\">poisoning the blood of our country</a>\u201d. Harris has shifted to the centre on the issue, underlining her support for a bipartisan proposal in Congress that would have hired thousands of new border security agents and closed the border if crossings hit an average of more than 5,000 people a day over a week.</p> \n<h2>What is the state of the race?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/01/us-elections-2024-guide/anim-3-at-stake\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/03/presidential-polls-today-donald-trump-kamala-harris-election-latest\">Excruciatingly close</a>. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/poll-harris-trump-times-siena.html\">poll</a> published on 25 October.</p> \n<p>After Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/elected-democrats-admit-biden-had-poor-debate-performance-but-reject-talk-of-replacement\">27 June debate</a>, Trump held a four-percentage-point lead over Biden among registered voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, who then surged to parity and a small lead over Trump amid a wave of energy and enthusiasm.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks the race has stabilised and an equilibrium has been restored.</p> \n<p>The national race is less important than swing states that will decide the electoral college. These too are tantalisingly close.

      "bodyText": "The 60th US presidential election will decide the 47th president \u2013 widely held to be the most powerful job in the world \u2013 and 50th vice-president. The candidates and their supporters are describing it as the most important election of their lifetimes, with democracy and the American way of life at stake. Record amounts of money have been raised and spent on campaign ads and ground games. Media coverage in print, on TV, online and on podcasts has never been more intense \u2013 or more polarised. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, along with 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate, which together will decide the membership of the 119th US Congress. Thirteen state and territorial governorships and numerous other state and local elections will take place. Voters in 41 states will consider a total of 159 ballot initiatives. Ten states including Arizona, Colorado and Florida have abortion-related measures on the ballot. Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota are considering whether to legalise marijuana. How are people voting? It no longer makes sense to talk solely about \u201celection day\u201d. Tens of millions of people have voted early by mail or in-person, thereby avoiding long queues, potential bad weather or other inconveniences. Georgia\u2019s first day of early voting \u201cshattered records\u201d, according to state officials, while an \u201cunheard of\u201d 97,000-plus voted on day one in Wisconsin. Democrats encouraged people to vote by mail in 2020 to avoid exposure to Covid-19 during the pandemic and fought legal battles to expand absentee voting. Trump, by contrast, falsely claimed that the practice was rife with fraud (it is extremely rare), although Republicans have since changed their messaging and increasingly embraced it. With the exception of Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire, all states give voters the chance to cast a ballot in person at a polling place ahead of election day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most states begin counting those ballots on election day, and some require officials to wait until polls are closed to begin counting. Some states offer a version of early voting called \u201cin-person absentee\u201d voting, in which a voter can obtain and submit an absentee ballot in person at a polling place before election day. Most states offer some form of absentee voting, in which a voter requests a ballot in advance and returns it by mail. Some offer voters the option of returning absentee ballots to a secure dropbox. Eight states practice \u201call-mail\u201d elections in which all registered voters receive a ballot in the mail, whether or not they plan to use it. Federal law requires states to send absentee ballots to military voters and voters overseas. Most states allow officials to immediately process absentee ballots but some require them to wait until election day to begin processing ballots \u2013 which can slow the release of election results. On election day, which is 5 November this year, everyone else goes to polling places to cast their vote. Once ballots are tallied, results start being released. Who are the presidential candidates? Kamala Harris, 60, the current vice-president, won the Democratic party\u2019s nomination after Joe Biden ended his re-election bid. She is a former senator, California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor and is bidding to make history as the first woman and first woman of colour to be elected president in America\u2019s 248-year history. Donald Trump, 78, the Republican nominee, is making make his third consecutive run for the White House. The businessman and reality TV star continues to repeat his false claim that Democrats stole the 2020 election from him. He is the first president to be impeached twice and convicted of a crime. Trump is also the oldest major party nominee in history and this summer survived two assassination attempts. Chase Oliver, 39, is the little-known candidate for the Libertarian party. Oliver ran for a Georgia state senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote. The party, which prioritises small government and individual freedoms, typically gains 3% or less of the national vote but its members could yet prove crucial in swing states. Jill Stein, 74, a physician who ran under the Green party in 2016, is running again in 2024. She launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \u201cfor working people, youth and the climate again and again \u2013 while Republicans don\u2019t even make such promises in the first place\u201d. Cornel West, 71, is running as an independent candidate. The political activist, philosopher and academic is making an effort to attract more progressive, Democratic-leaning voters. What are the paths to victory? Democrats have won the national popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections. But the Republicans George W Bush and Donald Trump won the White House by gaining more than 270 votes in the all-important electoral college. Each state counts its votes separately. With two exceptions \u2013 Nebraska and Maine \u2013 the winner of a state gets all of its electoral votes. Each state has a number of electors based on the number of congressional districts it has, plus two additional votes representing the state\u2019s Senate seats. Washington DC has three electoral votes, despite having no voting representation in Congress. This year the electoral college will probably come down to seven crucial battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Harris and Trump campaigns are eyeing multiple combinations that could put them over the top. Pennsylvania, which carries 19 electoral college votes, is the ultimate prize and has been the focus of much campaigning. Along with Michigan and Wisconsin, it forms a \u201cblue wall\u201d won by Barack Obama, lost by Hillary Clinton and won by Joe Biden. Trump is targeting rural blue-collar voters; Harris is aiming to turn out Black voters in big cities. Losses in these states might be offset by victories in Arizona, where Trump has made gains among Latino voters; Nevada, the most diverse swing state; and Georgia, long a red state which Biden narrowly flipped in 2020. Republicans have won North Carolina in every election since 2012 but Democrats are running close this time. Democrats currently control the Senate but face a tough map this year. Democrats and senators who caucus with them currently occupy seven of the eight most competitive seats, including Montana and Ohio, which generally lean Republican. The House is likely to hinge on 42 of the most competitive elections. Republicans could retain control by winning just 12 of the 26 seats rated as toss-ups by the Cook Political Report if they also win seats deemed \u201clikely\u201d or \u201clean\u201d Republican. What are the main issues that will decide the White House? Abortion. This is the first presidential election since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion. Many Republican-led states have since imposed total or near-total bans on the procedure. Harris has made reproductive rights and personal freedoms a rallying cry and backs a national law codifying access to safe abortion. Trump has struggled to find his footing on the issue, insisting that it is a state matter and belatedly ruling out a national ban. Constitutional amendments that would protect or expand abortion rights will appear on the ballot in 10 states, which Democrats hope will drive higher turnout. Democracy. Democrats have warned that Trump poses an existential threat to democratic norms, citing the 6 January 2021 insurrection, when a mob of his supporters attempted to overturn his election defeat. Harris has described her opponent as a fascist who has said he would be a dictator on day one and who would yield to foreign autocrats such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. Trump has sought to turn the tables by claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that Harris is the true threat to democracy, citing alleged online censorship and the criminal cases against him. He has refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election. A recent a Washington Post-Schar School survey of voters in seven swing states found that slightly more trust Trump to handle threats to democracy than Harris. Economy. The Economist magazine describes the US economy as the envy of the world, contending: \u201cThe American economy has left other rich countries in the dust.\u201d But despite strong growth, low unemployment and stabilising inflation, Biden and Harris have consistently trailed Trump in opinion polls. Harris\u2019s economic plans include tax cuts for most Americans, price-gouging bans, more affordable housing and a new child tax credit as well as efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. Trump has vowed to cut taxes, impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods and protect social security and Medicare. Immigration. This has been Trump\u2019s signature issue since he trundled down an escalator at Trump Tower in June 2015 to launch his presidential bid. This time, even as border crossings drop to 2020 levels, he has pledged what he calls the biggest deportation operation in US history. He has also used dehumanising language reminiscent of the Nazis to claim that undocumented immigrants are \u201canimals\u201d, have \u201cbad genes\u201d and are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d. Harris has shifted to the centre on the issue, underlining her support for a bipartisan proposal in Congress that would have hired thousands of new border security agents and closed the border if crossings hit an average of more than 5,000 people a day over a week. What is the state of the race? Excruciatingly close. Harris and Trump are tied at 48% each for the popular vote, according to the final New York Times/Siena College national poll published on 25 October. After Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in the 27 June debate, Trump held a four-percentage-point lead over Biden among registered voters, according to the Pew Research Center. Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, who then surged to parity and a small lead over Trump amid a wave of energy and enthusiasm. In recent weeks the race has stabilised and an equilibrium has been restored. The national race is less important than swing states that will decide the electoral college. These too are tantalisingly close. As of 17 October, for example, the Guardian\u2019s poll tracker showed Trump narrowly leading in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris ahead in Nevada and Pennsylvania and a dead heat in North Carolina \u2013 but all could still go one way or the other. The election will provide another test for a polling industry battered by the 2016 and 2020 elections when it seemed to underestimate Trump\u2019s strength. Conversely, in the 2022 midterms, Democrats overperformed the polls and headed off the predicted \u201cred wave\u201d. Political analysts and commentators are understandably reluctant to stick out their necks and guess the outcome. Frank Luntz, a consultant and pollster, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t call it. Anyone who calls it is an idiot.\u201d But Allan Lichtman, a historian with a predictive method that has been right nine times out of 10, has declared he thinks Harris will win. Does the US have exit polls? Exit polls are surveys conducted with voters immediately after they have cast their ballots. Major news networks such as CNN, ABC and Fox News use them to make early projections about who is likely to win, though these are subject to revisions as actual vote counts come in. Traditionally, media outlets agree not to release exit poll data before all polls have closed to avoid influencing people still voting. Exit pollsters position interviewers at selected polling stations, chosen to represent a cross-section of the voting population. Voters leaving polling stations are asked to voluntarily complete anonymous questionnaires covering the candidate they voted for, key issues and demographic information. Interviewers typically phone in the results three times during the day. Exit poll data is analysed quickly to generate insights about the voter base such as who is winning certain demographic groups. Dearborn, Michigan, for example, will be studied closely for any evidence that the war in Gaza affected turnout of Arab and Muslim Americans.

In states with a high level of early in-person voters, exit polls are carried out weeks before election day as these voters leave the polling place.

The vice-president serves as the president of the Senate and formally presides over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots cast and announces the result. In this case, Harris will proclaim her own victory or defeat on the fourth anniversary of the insurrection at the US Capitol. The election could be a big payday for lawyers.

      "body": "<p>A few weeks ago Felicity Spector, senior producer of <em>Channel 4 News,</em> contacted me. She\u2019d just returned from another trip to Ukraine, could she send me some amazing chocolate she\u2019d found there? This made me quite emotional for many reasons.</p> <p>My answer was: of course. And a few days later a package arrived with some bean-to-bar <strong>Meetty</strong> chocolate that had come, via the C4 news desk in London, to me in Suffolk from Ukraine. What I was sent was the gift box, \u00a325 plus shipping, that has won an <a href=\"https://academyofchocolate.org.uk/\">Academy of Chocolate </a>silver award. In this beautifully simple box there are 12 mini-bars of chocolate, each colourfully illustrated with examples of Ukrainian art and each weighing 24g, which is a perfect one-person portion and don\u2019t let anyone tell you different.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We keep going and running our family business despite the challenges: missiles, drones, blackouts\u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Oleksiy of Meetty</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The flavours were all wonderful and a mixture of the traditional: dark, milk, almond and orange, and fresh mixes, such as coffee and cinnamon, rose and grape, and cheese.

How was he doing? \u2018Well, we keep going and running our family business despite the challenges: missiles, drones, blackouts, war logistics, lack of personnel, rising bean prices and taxes. But, in many ways, we feel incredibly lucky to still have the opportunity to work, to produce chocolate that brings some relief to our friends (all our customers are friends and partners), to provide employment to others, and to welcome guests to our workshop. We were especially happy that Felicity was able to visit us.\u2019</p> <p>Do please support them if you possibly can.

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago Felicity Spector, senior producer of Channel 4 News, contacted me. She\u2019d just returned from another trip to Ukraine, could she send me some amazing chocolate she\u2019d found there? This made me quite emotional for many reasons. My answer was: of course. And a few days later a package arrived with some bean-to-bar Meetty chocolate that had come, via the C4 news desk in London, to me in Suffolk from Ukraine. What I was sent was the gift box, \u00a325 plus shipping, that has won an Academy of Chocolate silver award. In this beautifully simple box there are 12 mini-bars of chocolate, each colourfully illustrated with examples of Ukrainian art and each weighing 24g, which is a perfect one-person portion and don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. The flavours were all wonderful and a mixture of the traditional: dark, milk, almond and orange, and fresh mixes, such as coffee and cinnamon, rose and grape, and cheese. I contacted co-founder Oleksiy, in awe of someone (he\u2019s not alone, remember I wrote about Stranger chocolate a year ago) producing chocolate in a war zone. How was he doing? \u2018Well, we keep going and running our family business despite the challenges: missiles, drones, blackouts, war logistics, lack of personnel, rising bean prices and taxes. But, in many ways, we feel incredibly lucky to still have the opportunity to work, to produce chocolate that brings some relief to our friends (all our customers are friends and partners), to provide employment to others, and to welcome guests to our workshop. We were especially happy that Felicity was able to visit us.\u2019 Do please support them if you possibly can. The chocolate is delicious: 65g bars of individual flavours are \u00a34 plus shipping and you can order by sending a message to instagram.com/meetty_chocolate. Follow Annalisa on X @AnnalisaB",

But at the end of this <a href=\"https://modernartoxford.org.uk/whats-on/belkis-ayon-sikan-illuminations\">startling exhibition</a>, which presents more than 40 works, there is a sense of something more personal stirring in her art\u2019s singularly strange and intricate mythology.</p> <p>Born and raised in Havana, the daughter of a former fighter in the Angolan civil war, Ay\u00f3n came upon the secretive and insular brotherhood of Abaku\u00e1 \u2013 a kind of Afro-Cuban freemasonry \u2013 through rumours and newspaper stories in childhood. It gave her the characters, myths and narratives that underpin her art. What you see are giant friezes \u2013 black on white, white on black, and many shimmering greys between \u2013 set in forest glades, nameless caves, even beneath the ocean, in which sinuous figures with watchful eyes appear in outlandish scenarios.</p> <p>A female figure, covered with fish scales, stares directly at us, cradling a soft goat on her shoulder. A man with a mist-grey body and white head, crowned with an upright cockerel, casts a furtive glance to one side. Chieftains, dotted with leopard spots, preside over initiations involving pineapples, Christian haloes, palm fronds and curiously Celtic-looking insignia.

Her prints can have the appearance of suave linocuts, until you notice that there are actual impressions, almost dents, running like reliefs through the surface. Ay\u00f3n was a pioneer of collography, a complex and hardwon technique in which the artist assembles collages on cardboard surfaces and then inks them to press down on paper.</p> <p>A film from 1998 shows the artist hard at it in the printmaking workshop of the Instituto Superior de Arte in Havana, where she studied and later taught.

Of the collographic process she remarks it just \u201cseems to me the most appropriate technique to express what I want\u201d.</p> <p>And what she wanted to express in the devastating poverty of 1990s Cuba after the fall of the USSR, when paint was hard to come by but cardboard was cheap, was exceptionally bold. Her version of the Abaku\u00e1 mythology, with its founding legends involving snakes and fish, and the ritual sacrifice of the woman who discovered their secret fraternity, was avowedly feminist, in Castro\u2019s patriarchal Cuba.</p>    <p>In <em>La cena</em> \u2013 a kind of <em>Last Supper</em> \u2013 the figures are women, in defiance of the Abaku\u00e1\u2019s all-male membership, and Jesus is replaced by poor doomed Sik\u00e1n, who discovered the society\u2019s secrets.

Her figures have no hair, no other features than eyes; radically simplified, they nonetheless suggest innumerable expressions.

      "body": "<p>\u2018American politics has often been an arena for angry minds.\u201d Not a comment on this year\u2019s presidential campaign but an observation on another US presidential race, that of 1964. It is the opening line to one of the most <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/\">influential political essays of the postwar era</a>, <em>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</em>, first published 60&nbsp;years ago this month.</p> <p>The very title of Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay is redolent of contemporary fears. As Donald Trump has, over the past decade, built a movement out of anger and disaffection, old copies of Hofstadter have been dusted off and op-eds written with titles such as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/opinion/campaign-stops/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics-is-back.html\">The paranoid style in American politics is back</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2016/07/07/paranoid_politics_donald_trumps_style_perfectly_embodies_the_theories_of_renowned_historian/\">Donald Trump\u2019s style perfectly embodies the theories of renowned historian</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Not just Hofstadter\u2019s analysis of the paranoid style but his evisceration of populism, too, has found a new generation of readers. Yet, as brilliant and influential as Hofstadter was, he was often wrong on both issues, and it is his wrongness that has shaped much subsequent debate.</p> <p>One of America\u2019s most celebrated historians, Hofstadter moved from Marxist leanings in the 1930s into a cold war liberal who regarded social consensus rather than class conflict as the defining feature of American history. His 1964 essay, an abridged version of a lecture he had given in Oxford (the full version appearing later in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/paranoidstyleina0000rich/mode/2up\">book form</a>), was an attempt to confront a new, belligerent form of rightwing reactionary politics that had emerged, displayed in Joe McCarthy\u2019s anti-communist witch-hunt, in the creation of the ultraconservative John Birch Society, and in the success of Arizona senator Barry Goldwater in routing the Republican establishment to secure the party\u2019s 1964 presidential nomination.</p> <p>The mainstream response to Goldwater in the 1960s prefigured in many ways the hostility to Trump half a century later. Some saw Goldwater\u2019s rise as portending fascism.<em> Fact</em> magazine published a special edition on \u201cThe Mind of Barry Goldwater\u201d in which more than 1,100 psychiatrists, none of whom had ever met the would-be president, diagnosed him as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/health/views/24mind.html\">psychologically unfit</a>\u201d for office. If he consolidated his Republican \u201cparty coup\u201d by winning the election, Hofstadter warned, he would \u201cput the democratic process in this country in jeopardy\u201d. Goldwater lost to Lyndon Baines Johnson by a landslide.</p> <p>For Hofstadter, the new right was a potent expression of the \u201cparanoid style\u201d, a way of thinking that cast conspiracy not as a singular occurrence, but as \u201c<em>the motive force</em>\u201d in history. \u201cThe paranoid spokesman\u201d, Hofstadter wrote, \u201calways speaks in apocalyptic&nbsp;terms\u201d, and is \u201calways manning the barricades of civilization\u201d in the existential struggle between good and evil.</p> <p>Hofstadter insisted he was not using \u201cparanoia\u201d in a clinical sense, but \u201cborrowing a clinical term for other purposes\u201d. Yet, he also believed&nbsp;\u201cthe recurrence of the paranoid style\u201d across history \u201csuggests that a mentality disposed to see the world in the paranoid\u2019s way may always be present in some considerable minority of the population\u201d. In other words, it is an ineradicable pathology lying latent within the population, and activated&nbsp;by the emergence of particular social movements or political organisations.</p> <p>It is an argument that many find appealing because it gives licence to dismiss alternative viewpoints as a form of mental illness. It is also a perspective that wrenches political responses out of a historical frame. Even \u201cmillennial sects of Europe from the eleventh to the sixteenth century\u201d, Hofstadter wrote, exhibited a \u201cpsychological complex that closely resembles\u201d that of the reactionary right in postwar America. \u201cThe paranoid style as described by Hofstadter,\u201d the historian <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/858858\">Andrew McKenzie-McHarg wryly observes</a>, \u201cis present throughout history yet does not itself appear to have any real history of which to speak.\u201d It is a perspective, too, that allows liberals to be oblivious to the presence of such traits within their own ranks. Rightwing populists certainly trade heavily on conspiracy theories, whether about immigration or the elites.

      "bodyText": "\u2018American politics has often been an arena for angry minds.\u201d Not a comment on this year\u2019s presidential campaign but an observation on another US presidential race, that of 1964. It is the opening line to one of the most influential political essays of the postwar era, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, first published 60 years ago this month. The very title of Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay is redolent of contemporary fears. As Donald Trump has, over the past decade, built a movement out of anger and disaffection, old copies of Hofstadter have been dusted off and op-eds written with titles such as \u201cThe paranoid style in American politics is back\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s style perfectly embodies the theories of renowned historian\u201d. Not just Hofstadter\u2019s analysis of the paranoid style but his evisceration of populism, too, has found a new generation of readers. Yet, as brilliant and influential as Hofstadter was, he was often wrong on both issues, and it is his wrongness that has shaped much subsequent debate. One of America\u2019s most celebrated historians, Hofstadter moved from Marxist leanings in the 1930s into a cold war liberal who regarded social consensus rather than class conflict as the defining feature of American history. His 1964 essay, an abridged version of a lecture he had given in Oxford (the full version appearing later in book form), was an attempt to confront a new, belligerent form of rightwing reactionary politics that had emerged, displayed in Joe McCarthy\u2019s anti-communist witch-hunt, in the creation of the ultraconservative John Birch Society, and in the success of Arizona senator Barry Goldwater in routing the Republican establishment to secure the party\u2019s 1964 presidential nomination. The mainstream response to Goldwater in the 1960s prefigured in many ways the hostility to Trump half a century later. Some saw Goldwater\u2019s rise as portending fascism. Fact magazine published a special edition on \u201cThe Mind of Barry Goldwater\u201d in which more than 1,100 psychiatrists, none of whom had ever met the would-be president, diagnosed him as \u201cpsychologically unfit\u201d for office. If he consolidated his Republican \u201cparty coup\u201d by winning the election, Hofstadter warned, he would \u201cput the democratic process in this country in jeopardy\u201d. Goldwater lost to Lyndon Baines Johnson by a landslide. For Hofstadter, the new right was a potent expression of the \u201cparanoid style\u201d, a way of thinking that cast conspiracy not as a singular occurrence, but as \u201cthe motive force\u201d in history. \u201cThe paranoid spokesman\u201d, Hofstadter wrote, \u201calways speaks in apocalyptic terms\u201d, and is \u201calways manning the barricades of civilization\u201d in the existential struggle between good and evil. Hofstadter insisted he was not using \u201cparanoia\u201d in a clinical sense, but \u201cborrowing a clinical term for other purposes\u201d. Yet, he also believed \u201cthe recurrence of the paranoid style\u201d across history \u201csuggests that a mentality disposed to see the world in the paranoid\u2019s way may always be present in some considerable minority of the population\u201d. In other words, it is an ineradicable pathology lying latent within the population, and activated by the emergence of particular social movements or political organisations. It is an argument that many find appealing because it gives licence to dismiss alternative viewpoints as a form of mental illness. It is also a perspective that wrenches political responses out of a historical frame. Even \u201cmillennial sects of Europe from the eleventh to the sixteenth century\u201d, Hofstadter wrote, exhibited a \u201cpsychological complex that closely resembles\u201d that of the reactionary right in postwar America. \u201cThe paranoid style as described by Hofstadter,\u201d the historian Andrew McKenzie-McHarg wryly observes, \u201cis present throughout history yet does not itself appear to have any real history of which to speak.\u201d It is a perspective, too, that allows liberals to be oblivious to the presence of such traits within their own ranks. Rightwing populists certainly trade heavily on conspiracy theories, whether about immigration or the elites. Liberal panics about the coming of \u201cfascism\u201d and the \u201cend of democracy\u201d often exhibit, though, an equally apocalyptic view and present the fight against populism in black and white terms. This takes us to the second key theme in Hofstadter\u2019s work in the 1950s and 60s \u2013 his critique of populism. As Hofstadter moved from early radicalism to midlife centrism, he became increasingly wary of the masses and their impact on culture and intellectual life. His growing distrust of working-class movements led him to be sceptical of democracy itself. \u201cIntellect,\u201d he wrote in his 1963 book Anti-intellectualism in American Life, \u201cis pitted against democracy, since intellect is felt to be a form of distinction that defies egalitarianism.\u201d This political transformation shaped his reading of history. Until Hofstadter, most historians had viewed the rise of Populist movements in 1890s America in positive terms.

A host of historians, including C Vann Woodward, Lawrence Goodwyn and Walter Nugent, challenged and largely rebutted Hofstadter\u2019s revisionism. The political substance of his argument, however, became entrenched. After Hofstadter, Nugent wrote in a 2013 preface to his 1963 book The Tolerant Populists, \u201cpopulism\u201d began \u201cto carry the connotation of demagogic, unreasoning, narrow-minded, conspiratorial, fearful attitudes toward society and politics\u201d. It still does, shaping our view not just of the past but of the present, too. \u201cHaving come of age in a political culture that glorified \u2018the people\u2019 as the wellspring of democracy and decency in American life,\u201d Eric Foner, perhaps the most distinguished living historian of the American tradition, observed of his mentor\u2019s trajectory, \u201che came to portray politics as a realm of fears, symbols and nostalgia, and ordinary Americans as beset by bigotry, xenophobia and paranoid delusions\u201d. The loss of hope, the sense of betrayal, disillusionment with fellow Americans \u2013 that might describe not just Hofstadter\u2019s trajectory but America\u2019s too.

      "body": "<p>\u201cAny chance?\u201d asks Michael Caulfield, Brentford\u2019s sports psychologist, and with that Paisley, a lurcher-whippet with a marble-cake coat, hops out of the boot of his car at the training ground. He stops for a chat with the groundstaff, on their hands and knees repairing black netting chewed by urban foxes in this part of west London.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a fox sees Paisley, they scarper off to Surbiton,\u201d Caulfield says, walking past the place he calls Augusta, by which he means the immaculate pitches in front of the Robert Rowan Performance Centre named after their technical director who died six years ago. \u201cIt sounds pathetic but I walked past his portrait this morning and went: \u20181-1 last night [against Sheffield Wednesday], penalties, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but we got there. Hope we get a home draw.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soon Caulfield is talking about his unique, open-air office. \u201cThere are four benches here now, two \u2013 for the academy \u2013 are having an official opening next week,\u201d he says. The first spot, he adds, was a \u201ccrappy tin bench\u201d outside the original training pavilion. He sought an upgrade, ordering a wooden one, adding a plaque that reads: \u2018Michael\u2019s Bench; Just sit and talk, or just sit.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThe most moving thing was Robert\u2019s widow, Suzanne, rang and said: \u2018Can we come and sit on the bench?\u2019 I could have filled the ground up with tears. We had 15 minutes in the sunshine. Some days no one comes near me but the next day you can\u2019t get on there. That was the whole point of it, to create a space where you can just sit there and go: \u2018It\u2019s shit.\u2019 Or: \u2018Wasn\u2019t that amazing?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sir AP McCoy, who led Caulfield to retrain as a psychologist while he was chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, has visited. The All Blacks, too. \u201cThey nearly broke it,\u201d he smiles. It is on those benches where he gets to work, chatting with players and staff, usually with a light touch. Sometimes they walk and talk, Paisley in tow; Keane Lewis-Potter and Aaron Hickey found it beneficial when injured. Mads Roerslev took Paisley for a walk the day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/brentford-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford\u2019s 4-3 win over Ipswich</a>. A replica bench followed at the request of the B team.</p> <p>\u201cI told them they could decide what would be on the plaque. They came back with something brilliant: \u2018Michael\u2019s Other Bench.\u2019 I could have gone to Saatchi and Saatchi, Google, Elon Musk, AI, all the gurus of the world and they would have come up with something as dull as flu.\u201d</p> <p>In a way, that speaks to the simplicity of Caulfield\u2019s work. \u201cMyself and Thomas [Frank] often sit down and have a bit of lunch. After he signed his new contract [as manager in 2022], he said: \u2018I\u2019m jealous of you, Michael. You don\u2019t understand, you\u2019ve got one thing I\u2019ll never, ever have and, by the way, that goes for most people in this building.\u2019 I said: \u2018Go on then\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Time.\u2019 And that\u2019s my innovation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time and I create time for others to have time. I\u2019m always working towards that moment when the music stops, so for Monday, when it\u2019s red and white stripes v Fulham\u2019s white and black shorts, 11 v 11. I\u2019m trying to keep that joy and soul in football.\u201d</p>    <p>The palette of conversation is rich and varied; his previous dog, Shankly, a lurcher-greyhound, who acted as Caulfield\u2019s sidekick during his spells at Middlesbrough, Hull and here. \u201cThe idea was you\u2019ll never walk alone,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Growing besotted with football \u2013 \u201cthe greatest meritocracy in the world\u201d \u2013 after his first game, West Ham 1-3 Manchester United at Upton Park in 1967; the Brentford Lifeline Society, which Caulfield pays into, \u00a32 a week. \u201cI mean, you try and get out of that,\u201d he laughs. Morecambe and Wise; Maggie Smith.</p> <p>Working at the darts in Bolton, the dressage at Badminton; David Raya\u2019s journey from Barcelona to Blackburn and Arsenal, via Brentford and Southport, Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s artistry. \u201cI\u2019ve asked him to do a print for me because he paints beautifully, wonderful watercolours,\u201d Caulfield says. \u201cAnd he enjoys a tinkle on the piano. He\u2019s a delightful man, who happens to be very good at football.\u201d Only Erling Haaland has scored more league goals than Mbeumo this season.</p> <p>Caulfield says he cannot take credit for Brentford\u2019s fast starts or joyous crescendos. Brentford scored inside the opening 40 seconds of three successive matches and then 75 seconds into the fourth game of that run, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/05/brentford-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">a 5-3 win against Wolves</a>. Mbeumo scored a 96th-minute winner against Ipswich and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/29/brentford-sheffield-wednesday-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">prevailed on penalties on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve helped, then it is by 0.00001% recurring,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did find out, because only we would know this, that when we got the third goal [inside a minute], that hadn\u2019t happened in one million games. Football is still based around conversation, connection, emotion, understanding. You can now analyse the game in incredible detail and thought. If you can get those two married, you\u2019re on to something.\u201d</p> <p>Caulfield, who radiates warmth, rewinds to his first day, midway through 2016-17, a few days before Frank joined Dean Smith\u2019s staff. Brentford were 18th in the Championship. Then, his role comprised half a day a week, now it is three, two with the first team, one with the B team. \u201cWe had just been whopped 5-0 by Norwich,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone thought they brought me in because of the result. So, in the meeting room after training, 25 chairs, me in the middle. I was doing the Tony Blair,\u201d he says, drily, \u201cthat\u2019s why I wear a jacket.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m terrified. This is as bad as it gets for me, introducing myself to you after a 5-0 defeat. I\u2019m standing here dressed like this in front of you \u2026 Don\u2019t think for one minute I\u2019m enjoying this, so I\u2019d be really, really honoured if one of you could ask a question. Can one of you save my life?\u2019 Then a hand goes up. Lasse Vibe. \u2018Can we trust you?\u2019 he said. I could feel 25 pairs of eyes going: \u2018You better answer this well, otherwise you\u2019re done.\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, you\u2019ve already made your mind up anyway, but I hope you can.\u2019 OK, good.\u201d</p> <p>How does Caulfield think the players and staff view his role? He pauses for thought. \u201cThey accept it, they understand it, they appreciate it, I think, but they also question it as well. It is great because they challenge me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Anxiety, racism, divorce, miscarriages, it is an absolute A-Z \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s a VAR-free zone\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Caulfield</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps Henrik Dalsgaard, who won promotion with Brentford three years ago, put it best. \u201cA bloke comes in with his dog, walks around the pitch and we give him the heavy stuff from our hearts. I\u2019ve been doing it this morning \u2026 I walked with a B team player. He was telling me about his week; he\u2019s finding his way in life.\u201d</p> <p>Players and staff later went for a wander. \u201cIt was beautiful. You\u2019ve got 11-15 players in tracksuits and T-shirts, support staff in tracksuits and T-shirts, and a history teacher looking like he\u2019s about to give a lecture on the Tudors. Bonkers.\u201d</p> <p>Caulfield, wearing a flat cap, blazer, shirt, striped socks and a pair of Dr. Martens, does a good line in self-deprecation. \u201cI don\u2019t really look like your football man, to quote [the X page] Bryan\u2019s Gunn.\u201d Caulfield sometimes refers to himself as a dustbin, where players and coaches can declutter their minds to focus on performance. But deep and complex issues, such as grief, arise on those benches. \u201cI\u2019ve got the list: anxiety, racism, divorce, miscarriages, it is an absolute A-Z.\u201d Perceived miscarriages of justice? \u201cIt\u2019s a VAR-free zone.\u201d</p> <p>Surely not everyone wants to chat? \u201cA third are really interested, a third are quite interested, a third are going: \u2018Michael, how are you?\u2019\u201d The conversations, of course, remain confidential. \u201cSome of the things I know and have heard, shared and discussed, they\u2019re going to the grave with me. They will never be discussed, written about, spoken about, put in fancy lights. There\u2019s got to be room in life for that, I think.\u201d</p>    <p>With Paisley, Caulfield makes his way towards the first-team bench, outside the gym and round the corner from the padel court installed last year. He shakes hands and chats with a B team player, before bumping into a cleaner heading the other way, engaging in conversation, and then Rhys Weston, the former Arsenal and Cardiff full-back who is now Brentford\u2019s head of team operations. \u201cHome draw?\u201d Caulfield says of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, hours before Brentford are rewarded with a December trip to Newcastle.</p> <p>Grounds staff fix a couple more blemishes. The Ukrainian midfielder Yehor Yarmoliuk drives home. Caulfield walks past the meeting rooms and, later than billed, towards the far end of pitch one. Paisley, apparently in anticipation of the chicken and cheese roll treats that await, stretches into a downward dog before looking with great intrigue towards the camera lens. \u201cSorry,\u201d Caulfield says, \u201cI got talking.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cAny chance?\u201d asks Michael Caulfield, Brentford\u2019s sports psychologist, and with that Paisley, a lurcher-whippet with a marble-cake coat, hops out of the boot of his car at the training ground. He stops for a chat with the groundstaff, on their hands and knees repairing black netting chewed by urban foxes in this part of west London. \u201cWhen a fox sees Paisley, they scarper off to Surbiton,\u201d Caulfield says, walking past the place he calls Augusta, by which he means the immaculate pitches in front of the Robert Rowan Performance Centre named after their technical director who died six years ago. \u201cIt sounds pathetic but I walked past his portrait this morning and went: \u20181-1 last night [against Sheffield Wednesday], penalties, you wouldn\u2019t believe it, but we got there. Hope we get a home draw.\u2019\u201d Soon Caulfield is talking about his unique, open-air office. \u201cThere are four benches here now, two \u2013 for the academy \u2013 are having an official opening next week,\u201d he says. The first spot, he adds, was a \u201ccrappy tin bench\u201d outside the original training pavilion. He sought an upgrade, ordering a wooden one, adding a plaque that reads: \u2018Michael\u2019s Bench; Just sit and talk, or just sit.\u2019 \u201cThe most moving thing was Robert\u2019s widow, Suzanne, rang and said: \u2018Can we come and sit on the bench?\u2019 I could have filled the ground up with tears. We had 15 minutes in the sunshine. Some days no one comes near me but the next day you can\u2019t get on there. That was the whole point of it, to create a space where you can just sit there and go: \u2018It\u2019s shit.\u2019 Or: \u2018Wasn\u2019t that amazing?\u2019\u201d Sir AP McCoy, who led Caulfield to retrain as a psychologist while he was chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, has visited. The All Blacks, too. \u201cThey nearly broke it,\u201d he smiles. It is on those benches where he gets to work, chatting with players and staff, usually with a light touch. Sometimes they walk and talk, Paisley in tow; Keane Lewis-Potter and Aaron Hickey found it beneficial when injured. Mads Roerslev took Paisley for a walk the day after Brentford\u2019s 4-3 win over Ipswich. A replica bench followed at the request of the B team. \u201cI told them they could decide what would be on the plaque. They came back with something brilliant: \u2018Michael\u2019s Other Bench.\u2019 I could have gone to Saatchi and Saatchi, Google, Elon Musk, AI, all the gurus of the world and they would have come up with something as dull as flu.\u201d In a way, that speaks to the simplicity of Caulfield\u2019s work. \u201cMyself and Thomas [Frank] often sit down and have a bit of lunch. After he signed his new contract [as manager in 2022], he said: \u2018I\u2019m jealous of you, Michael. You don\u2019t understand, you\u2019ve got one thing I\u2019ll never, ever have and, by the way, that goes for most people in this building.\u2019 I said: \u2018Go on then\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Time.\u2019 And that\u2019s my innovation. \u201cI\u2019ve got time and I create time for others to have time. I\u2019m always working towards that moment when the music stops, so for Monday, when it\u2019s red and white stripes v Fulham\u2019s white and black shorts, 11 v 11. I\u2019m trying to keep that joy and soul in football.\u201d The palette of conversation is rich and varied; his previous dog, Shankly, a lurcher-greyhound, who acted as Caulfield\u2019s sidekick during his spells at Middlesbrough, Hull and here. \u201cThe idea was you\u2019ll never walk alone,\u201d he says. Growing besotted with football \u2013 \u201cthe greatest meritocracy in the world\u201d \u2013 after his first game, West Ham 1-3 Manchester United at Upton Park in 1967; the Brentford Lifeline Society, which Caulfield pays into, \u00a32 a week. \u201cI mean, you try and get out of that,\u201d he laughs. Morecambe and Wise; Maggie Smith. Working at the darts in Bolton, the dressage at Badminton; David Raya\u2019s journey from Barcelona to Blackburn and Arsenal, via Brentford and Southport, Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s artistry. \u201cI\u2019ve asked him to do a print for me because he paints beautifully, wonderful watercolours,\u201d Caulfield says. \u201cAnd he enjoys a tinkle on the piano. He\u2019s a delightful man, who happens to be very good at football.\u201d Only Erling Haaland has scored more league goals than Mbeumo this season. Caulfield says he cannot take credit for Brentford\u2019s fast starts or joyous crescendos. Brentford scored inside the opening 40 seconds of three successive matches and then 75 seconds into the fourth game of that run, a 5-3 win against Wolves. Mbeumo scored a 96th-minute winner against Ipswich and they prevailed on penalties on Tuesday. \u201cIf I\u2019ve helped, then it is by 0.00001% recurring,\u201d he says. \u201cWe did find out, because only we would know this, that when we got the third goal [inside a minute], that hadn\u2019t happened in one million games. Football is still based around conversation, connection, emotion, understanding. You can now analyse the game in incredible detail and thought. If you can get those two married, you\u2019re on to something.\u201d Caulfield, who radiates warmth, rewinds to his first day, midway through 2016-17, a few days before Frank joined Dean Smith\u2019s staff. Brentford were 18th in the Championship. Then, his role comprised half a day a week, now it is three, two with the first team, one with the B team. \u201cWe had just been whopped 5-0 by Norwich,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone thought they brought me in because of the result. So, in the meeting room after training, 25 chairs, me in the middle. I was doing the Tony Blair,\u201d he says, drily, \u201cthat\u2019s why I wear a jacket. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019m terrified. This is as bad as it gets for me, introducing myself to you after a 5-0 defeat. I\u2019m standing here dressed like this in front of you \u2026 Don\u2019t think for one minute I\u2019m enjoying this, so I\u2019d be really, really honoured if one of you could ask a question. Can one of you save my life?\u2019 Then a hand goes up. Lasse Vibe. \u2018Can we trust you?\u2019 he said. I could feel 25 pairs of eyes going: \u2018You better answer this well, otherwise you\u2019re done.\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, you\u2019ve already made your mind up anyway, but I hope you can.\u2019 OK, good.\u201d How does Caulfield think the players and staff view his role? He pauses for thought. \u201cThey accept it, they understand it, they appreciate it, I think, but they also question it as well. It is great because they challenge me.\u201d Perhaps Henrik Dalsgaard, who won promotion with Brentford three years ago, put it best. \u201cA bloke comes in with his dog, walks around the pitch and we give him the heavy stuff from our hearts. I\u2019ve been doing it this morning \u2026 I walked with a B team player. He was telling me about his week; he\u2019s finding his way in life.\u201d Players and staff later went for a wander. \u201cIt was beautiful. You\u2019ve got 11-15 players in tracksuits and T-shirts, support staff in tracksuits and T-shirts, and a history teacher looking like he\u2019s about to give a lecture on the Tudors. Bonkers.\u201d Caulfield, wearing a flat cap, blazer, shirt, striped socks and a pair of Dr. Martens, does a good line in self-deprecation. \u201cI don\u2019t really look like your football man, to quote [the X page] Bryan\u2019s Gunn.\u201d Caulfield sometimes refers to himself as a dustbin, where players and coaches can declutter their minds to focus on performance. But deep and complex issues, such as grief, arise on those benches. \u201cI\u2019ve got the list: anxiety, racism, divorce, miscarriages, it is an absolute A-Z.\u201d Perceived miscarriages of justice? \u201cIt\u2019s a VAR-free zone.\u201d Surely not everyone wants to chat? \u201cA third are really interested, a third are quite interested, a third are going: \u2018Michael, how are you?\u2019\u201d The conversations, of course, remain confidential. \u201cSome of the things I know and have heard, shared and discussed, they\u2019re going to the grave with me. They will never be discussed, written about, spoken about, put in fancy lights. There\u2019s got to be room in life for that, I think.\u201d With Paisley, Caulfield makes his way towards the first-team bench, outside the gym and round the corner from the padel court installed last year. He shakes hands and chats with a B team player, before bumping into a cleaner heading the other way, engaging in conversation, and then Rhys Weston, the former Arsenal and Cardiff full-back who is now Brentford\u2019s head of team operations. \u201cHome draw?\u201d Caulfield says of the Carabao Cup quarter-finals, hours before Brentford are rewarded with a December trip to Newcastle. Grounds staff fix a couple more blemishes. The Ukrainian midfielder Yehor Yarmoliuk drives home. Caulfield walks past the meeting rooms and, later than billed, towards the far end of pitch one. Paisley, apparently in anticipation of the chicken and cheese roll treats that await, stretches into a downward dog before looking with great intrigue towards the camera lens. \u201cSorry,\u201d Caulfield says, \u201cI got talking.\u201d",

Since 1970, wildlife populations have declined on average by 73%. Since 2015, <a href=\"https://www.ifaw.org/uk/journal/18-animals-recently-extinct\">we have lost a number of species forever</a>: the golden toad, the Pinta giant tortoise, the mountain mist frog, several bats and birds. We heard at Cop16 that <a href=\"https://iucn.org/press-release/202410/species-experts-meeting-concludes-declaration-saving-species-integral-0\">46,000 species face extinction</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c24558g69mgo\">more than a third of the planet\u2019s trees</a>.</p> <p>But as woods empty of wildlife, coral reefs ossify and the wind howls through wastelands that used to be rainforests, the focus of governments, environmentalists and industry has become lopsided. Climate change sucks up all the attention. Nature loss loses. The world has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/31/alarm-grows-over-disturbing-lack-of-progress-revealed-at-biodiversity-summit-cop16\">never met a single target</a> to stem the destruction of wildlife.</p> <p>Contrast, for example, the politics of the two Cops in Britain. When in 2022 the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced that he would not be attending Cop27, a public backlash <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63484971\">forced him to change his mind</a>. Another outcry followed his progress at Cop28, at which he deigned to appear for the span of <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-rishi-sunak-criticism-half-day-cop-28-visit-king-charles/\">half a day</a>. But there is next to no pressure for prime ministers to turn up at the biodiversity conference. This time Britain was represented by a \u201cnature envoy\u201d, appointed to the role \u2013 hastily perhaps \u2013 just one day before Cop16&nbsp;started.</p> <p>The trend stretches back decades. It can be traced, I think, to the 1980s and early 1990s, when environmental movements shifted priorities. They largely stopped talking about saving whales, pandas or the rainforests, and started talking about degrees in temperature. \u201cGlobal warming\u201d \u2013 now \u201cclimate change\u201d \u2013 became the headline message. The shift continues. There is up to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2017.00175/full\">eight times more media coverage</a> of the climate crisis than of biodiversity loss.

You are less likely to have heard of Cop16, the international summit on biodiversity. It wrapped up two days ago but has barely scraped the news agenda. The lack of interest in Cop16 extended even to the participants. A whopping 80% of countries failed to submit plans for meeting a landmark UN nature agreement at the conference, as they had promised to do. Even Colombia, which hosted Cop16, missed the deadline.

And if the ending feels uncomfortable, well, that\u2019s precisely the point. Film\u2019s relationship with its viewer, Baker suggests, is its own cheap transaction. Its clients demand happy endings or they feel short-changed and let down. Ani understands what\u2019s required and performs her role with aplomb, to the point where she is no longer certain what is fake and what\u2019s real. In UK and Irish cinemas",

Hospitals, health centres, surgeries and hospices can borrow the charity\u2019s paintings to put on display, usually for two or three years.</p> <p>In the book, <em>Lifting the Clouds</em>, patients and medical staff have given statements or been interviewed. PiH chief executive Sandra Bruce-Gordon is sending the book along with a letter to the prime minister and health secretary, following their recent calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/21/nhs-saved-my-life-rescue-health-service-wes-streeting\">suggestions to improve the NHS</a>. \u201cOur research clearly shows art helps health,\u201d Bruce-Gordon said.</p> <p>Most patients\u2019 comments in the book are anonymous for privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019m receiving chemo and wanted to let you know how lovely it is to have art in the waiting area,\u201d says one. \u201cIt reminds me that there is a life after cancer.\u201d Another talks of being in and out of hospital, and stopping to look at one painting, <em>Heavy Seas</em> by Ken Symonds. \u201cIt has given me a lot of calm before my appointments. I hope I can recover and go to the sea itself.\u201d</p>    <p>Another patient, recently in the Maudsley psychiatric hospital in London, says: \u201cWhen the ward was unlocked, I would sneak to the cafe in outpatients and gaze at the paintings on the wall. It gave me a break from the grind of the bleak ward.\u201d</p> <p>Clinical staff also see benefits. \u201cWhen you come to a hospital, you come for difficult reasons,\u201d said Peter Wilkinson, a consultant cardiologist at Ashford and St Peter\u2019s Trust, Surrey. His hospital has some Warhol prints. \u201cThey take your mind off your concerns.\u201d </p> <p>Wynford Ellis Owen, chief executive of Cardiff\u2019s Living Room, an addiction recovery centre, where June Forster\u2019s <em>Winter Landscape</em> hung, said: \u201cIt was invaluable in our therapeutic work. The painting\u2019s many shapes and colours helped show that human life itself must be viewed from both its dark and light sides.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to make our new premises modern, friendly and interesting,\u201d said Susan Rankine, senior partner at the Victoria Medical Centre in Westminster.</p> <p>She believes the art chosen, including <em>Anemone and Jugs</em> by Paula Vincent, alleviates anxiety.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Southampton\u2019s Shirley Health Partnership consulted 1,100 patients and staff about PiH works for its new premises. Stella Rankin\u2019s <em>Daffodils</em> and Wilhelmina Barns-Graham\u2019s <em>Millennium Blue II </em><em> </em>are among 30 pieces selected.</p> <p>Artworks are often chosen for their suitability, like the inspirational paintings of Welsh rugby internationals at the stroke rehabilitation centre at University Hospital in Llandough.</p> <p>There is also new scientific support to back PiH\u2019s evidence, including two studies with the Art Fund. Visitors to the Courtauld Gallery in London were given headsets which showed that the brain\u2019s dopamine levels of pleasure and comfort were raised by the landscapes of Van Gogh and Monet, but lowered by some abstracts.</p> <p>Another test with University College London involved 6,700 adults aged over 50, who were asked 15 years ago about their gallery visits, and again this year. The results showed paintings reduced anxiety, depression and helped with living longer.</p> <p>In Holland, neuro-research company Neurensics produced results in October from visitors looking at Vermeer\u2019s <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> in the Mauritshuis museum. Their brains were stimulated time and time again by her eyes, mouth and earring.</p> <p>\u201cThe longer they looked, the more drawn in they were and satisfied,\u201d said Martin de Munnik of Neurensics. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2024.

Most patients\u2019 comments in the book are anonymous for privacy reasons. \u201cI\u2019m receiving chemo and wanted to let you know how lovely it is to have art in the waiting area,\u201d says one. \u201cIt reminds me that there is a life after cancer.\u201d Another talks of being in and out of hospital, and stopping to look at one painting, Heavy Seas by Ken Symonds. \u201cIt has given me a lot of calm before my appointments. I hope I can recover and go to the sea itself.\u201d Another patient, recently in the Maudsley psychiatric hospital in London, says: \u201cWhen the ward was unlocked, I would sneak to the cafe in outpatients and gaze at the paintings on the wall. It gave me a break from the grind of the bleak ward.\u201d Clinical staff also see benefits. \u201cWhen you come to a hospital, you come for difficult reasons,\u201d said Peter Wilkinson, a consultant cardiologist at Ashford and St Peter\u2019s Trust, Surrey. His hospital has some Warhol prints. \u201cThey take your mind off your concerns.\u201d Wynford Ellis Owen, chief executive of Cardiff\u2019s Living Room, an addiction recovery centre, where June Forster\u2019s Winter Landscape hung, said: \u201cIt was invaluable in our therapeutic work. The painting\u2019s many shapes and colours helped show that human life itself must be viewed from both its dark and light sides.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to make our new premises modern, friendly and interesting,\u201d said Susan Rankine, senior partner at the Victoria Medical Centre in Westminster. She believes the art chosen, including Anemone and Jugs by Paula Vincent, alleviates anxiety. Earlier this year, Southampton\u2019s Shirley Health Partnership consulted 1,100 patients and staff about PiH works for its new premises. Stella Rankin\u2019s Daffodils and Wilhelmina Barns-Graham\u2019s Millennium Blue II are among 30 pieces selected. Artworks are often chosen for their suitability, like the inspirational paintings of Welsh rugby internationals at the stroke rehabilitation centre at University Hospital in Llandough. There is also new scientific support to back PiH\u2019s evidence, including two studies with the Art Fund. Visitors to the Courtauld Gallery in London were given headsets which showed that the brain\u2019s dopamine levels of pleasure and comfort were raised by the landscapes of Van Gogh and Monet, but lowered by some abstracts. Another test with University College London involved 6,700 adults aged over 50, who were asked 15 years ago about their gallery visits, and again this year. The results showed paintings reduced anxiety, depression and helped with living longer. In Holland, neuro-research company Neurensics produced results in October from visitors looking at Vermeer\u2019s Girl with a Pearl Earring in the Mauritshuis museum. Their brains were stimulated time and time again by her eyes, mouth and earring. \u201cThe longer they looked, the more drawn in they were and satisfied,\u201d said Martin de Munnik of Neurensics. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2024. Ashford and St Peter\u2019s NHS Trust is in Surrey, not Kent as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch delivered a sobering and uncompromising message to her own party on Saturday within minutes of being elected as its new leader, saying the Conservatives had to become \u201chonest\u201d again if they were to stand any chance of recovering as a political force. This is the Badenoch way: blunt and straight to the point. The cheers and whooping had hardly died away at the news that she had defeated Robert Jenrick by 53,806 votes to 41,388 votes before she was laying down the law. \u201cOur party is critical to the success of country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to be heard, we have to be honest. Honest about the fact that we made mistakes. Honest about the fact that we let standards slip. The time has come to tell the truth.\u201d Whichever individuals she had in mind \u2013 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak or whether it was everyone all together \u2013 there could be no repeat. It was time \u201cto reset our politics and our thinking\u201d. For the first three months after July\u2019s election, British politics had been stuck in a pre-budget phoney war. Government ministers had been unsure what money they would have to spend so couldn\u2019t talk about new policies, while shattered Tories agonised and argued about what kind of leader they wanted next. But over the past four days, two huge and historic moments have finally begun to deliver signs of a \u201creset\u201d of British politics. Last Wednesday saw the first budget delivered by a female chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves. Then on Saturday, 44-year-old Kemi Badenoch, born of Nigerian parents and brought up there, became the first Black politician to be elected as leader of one of the UK\u2019s main political parties. Both Reeves and Badenoch marked their moments in some style: Reeves with a spectacular high-risk, high-tax and borrowing budget, and Badenoch with a pledge to reimagine \u201cwhat the Conservative party needs to be over the next five, 10 and 20 years\u201d. One senior Tory at Saturday\u2019s leadership event in central London said: \u201cWe have an intriguing battle in prospect now. Labour has laid out its store in no uncertain terms. Big tax, big spend. Now we under our new leader have to work out how to respond. What kind of party are we? We have to get this right but don\u2019t need to be in any great rush.\u201d That said, Badenoch has to start making decisions almost immediately. Labour cabinet ministers have been going around after the budget saying, \u201cwe have made our choices\u201d, and \u201cwe have gone big\u201d with \u00a340bn of tax increases and changes to fiscal rules that allow massive extra borrowing. Now they are challenging the Tories to respond. In the next fortnight there will be votes in the Commons on Reeves\u2019s blockbuster \u00a325.7bn move to increase employers national insurance contributions. The NI measure requires legislation of its own before it can be implemented. There will also be other votes on changing the fiscal rules to allow the huge sums of extra borrowing, and new inheritance tax arrangements for owners of farms, which the Tories hate. All require decisions by Badenoch. Will she oppose Labour\u2019s plans to spend on services and invest in infrastructure and if so what is the message that sends? Cabinet minister Pat McFadden, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, sees the dividing lines sharply now: \u201cIf the Tories want to go round the country opposing every new public investment in schools and hospitals they can be our guests.\u201d This all moves on from the pre and immediate post-election period when the two parties were both hedging bets. \u201cThe budget turns the page on that,\u201d says another cabinet minister. No one in Labour is pretending that everything is set fair or easy now the budget is out of the way. There are worries about growth projections being so low despite all the extra spending. Reeves stressed to the Observer that reform of services is now the key and that money will on its own not create a better public realm. \u201cNow we have fixed the foundations of our economy I am going for growth and I am going for reform,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we cannot tax and spend our way to prosperity nor can we tax and spend our way to better services.

Badenoch was congratulated by several of her predecessors, including Sunak, who posted on social media: \u201cI know that she will be a superb leader of our great party\u201d while former prime minister Boris Johnson praised her \u201ccourage and clarity\u201d and said she \u201cbrings a much needed zing and zap to the Conservative party\u201d.

      "body": "<p>There is a consensus among economists that a precondition for higher growth is higher levels of investment, and that one of the most certain ways of lifting investment levels is for the state to&nbsp;provide a lead. </p> <p>Whether European growth in the 1950s, Japan\u2019s astounding national income-doubling plan in the 1960s or the dynamic growth of the Asian tigers in the 1970s and 80s, it has been the same story of higher public investment triggering a step change in economic growth. In the US, vast increases in investment spending on defence have induced growth and the tech revolution, given extra economic impetus by President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure and R&amp;D spending. It was true of Britain in the 1950s and 1960s too, when public investment averaged more than 3% of GDP.</p> <p>The process is relatively simple and easy to understand. An increase in public investment does three things. It lifts the capacity of the economy permanently by improving the public infrastructure \u2013 everything from hospitals, court buildings and public housing to improved transport, utility provision and R&amp;D. This is especially true after years of public underinvestment \u2013 following a war, say, or a prolonged period of austerity. There is a second-round effect of crowding in higher private investment as public sector contractors tool up to meet the public contracts, and then a third \u2013 as all firms adjust to the higher level of demand by raising business investment levels \u2013 of more crowding in and so-called \u201cmultiplier effects\u201d. </p> <p>For the past 40 years, free-market economists have tried to contest these effects: public investment, they argue, can only \u201ccrowd&nbsp;out\u201d virtuous private business investment.

So-called \u201cmultiplier\u2019\u2019 effects of public investment are downplayed. </p> <p>After a succession of disasters, of which the Liz Truss budget was the most conspicuous, very few economists subscribe to the crowding out, weak multiplier hypothesis.

Yes, there will be a \u201ctemporary sugar rush\u201d of higher growth in the short term responding to the front-end loading of the spending, as Richard Hughes, the chair of the OBR dismissively acknowledged. Some slight benefit&nbsp;might survive five years, but we would have to wait 50 years for a little more.

Then, under intense pressure from Tory ministers, it downplayed the impact of Brexit in its forecasts, despite recognising it was an economic calamity in the side boxes accompanying its reports.

      "body": "<p>When I started to read Rachel Shabi\u2019s new book, I felt a profound sense of relief and recognition. As she writes: \u201cThe left has ceded the space on antisemitism\u2026 and the right has smartly and strategically filled that void.\u201d As someone who has been involved for years with various causes where leftwing people gather, I wholeheartedly concur. It\u2019s more than time to take back that space. The downplaying of antisemitism by the left has led to some racism being given a free pass, and it has also resulted in a depressing lack of empathy around the Jewish experience and a weakening of potential solidarity.</p> <p>It has been hard to talk about this for a long time, for fear of detracting from what feels like more pressing anti-black racism. But now, when charges of antisemitism are being used by defenders of Israel to head off criticism of horrific crimes against Palestinians, it often feels pretty much impossible. Still, not dealing with it is not doing anyone except racists any favours, and many of us will feel grateful to Shabi for stepping out into this maze.</p> <p>While the book is subtitled <em>The Truth A</em><em>bout Antisemitism</em>, it quickly becomes clear \u2013 if we didn\u2019t already know \u2013 that there is no simple truth here, but rather a host of interconnected and complex stories. Shabi, who was born in Israel to Iraqi Jewish parents, and whose previous book explored the experiences of Israeli Jews from Arab countries, is a good and careful guide through many of these thorny&nbsp;paths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Holocaust is currently being weaponised to head off criticism of Israel, but we don\u2019t get past that simply by denying the reality of Jewish anguish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She is sharp on the ways that antisemitism differs from other kinds of racism, and how that can make it difficult to confront. Our paradigm of racism is so often that it targets \u201cpeople of colour in order to subjugate, segregate, colonise, enslave and kill them\u201d, and we expect it to be baked into political and social structures in myriad instances of inequality. Antisemitism does always not fit into that model, not least, as Shabi says, because Jews, by and large, in most places today \u201cdon\u2019t face that kind of structural racism\u201d. As other writers have also pointed out, this makes Jews both white and not white \u2013 as the title has it: <em>Off-White</em> \u2013 depending on the situation.</p> <p>But antisemitism can be as harmful as any other racism, and spawned the genocide whose trauma still echoes down the generations. Shabi is honest that, while she doesn\u2019t personally share this sense of trauma, she recognises that for many Jewish people it is still present, and the assumption that they should see themselves as \u201cwhite\u201d \u201ccan flatten out the sense of paper-thin conditionality that feels ever-present for many Jewish people\u201d. As a Jew brought up in a family still dealing with the ghosts of the past, I would agree that leftwingers need to do better at accepting this all-too-real sense of vulnerability, \u201cwithout dismissal, disbelief, or bad faith\u201d. For sure, the Holocaust is currently being weaponised to head off criticism of Israel, but we don\u2019t get past that simply by denying the reality of Jewish anguish. As Shabi says at one point: \u201cThere has rarely been a more urgent need for us to stretch our compassion, to hold Jewish trauma even while a savagely catastrophic war is inflicted on Palestinians in its&nbsp;name.\u201d</p> <p>The horror of the Holocaust also needs to be recognised in order to understand Israel\u2019s founding, which is not just a simple tale of colonialism. Shabi quotes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/100-best-nonfiction-books-8-orientalism-edward-said\">Edward Said</a> saying \u201cthe Palestinians are the victims of the victims, the refugees of the refugees\u201d. Recognising the complexity of Israel\u2019s past and present means that \u201cdecolonisation cannot involve drawing up rigid lists of the indigenous and the colonisers\u201d. This may seem obvious, but Shabi\u2019s reminder to readers that Jewish life and Palestinian life must be treated as equivalent is, sadly, a necessary counterbalance to those on the left who seem to believe that massacring civilians in a gruesome attack can on some level be justified when those people are Israeli Jews.</p>    <p>Another part of the book that I found particularly valuable is its exploration of the way the right is using antisemitism now. I\u2019ve found it really disconcerting to see xenophobic rightwing commentators in Britain suggesting that Jews should make common cause with the far right against Muslims. Are Jews meant to be grateful that at some point we got promoted from being the darkest stain on western civilisation to its frontline defenders? It\u2019s good to see that phenomenon explored along with the mad fringe of Christian Zionism, and the bizarre friendships that Israel is trying to make with some of the worst authoritarian governments in the world.</p> <p>What\u2019s even more disconcerting than the newfound friendship between some Jews and the right is the growth of crazy conspiracy theories that build on old antisemitic patterns of the super-powerful Jew. It\u2019s vital that we are ready to call out and bring into the light these conspiracy theories, which often centre on the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/a-deadly-ideology-how-the-great-replacement-theory-went-mainstream\">great replacement</a>\u201d \u2013 the idea that Jews are trying to orchestrate the replacement of white people through immigration \u2013 and are becoming frighteningly widespread.</p> <p>I ended the book invigorated by Shabi\u2019s engaged clarity, and would have liked even more. For instance, I would have been interested in more discussion of antisemitism in Muslim communities. Having travelled in Saudi Arabia and Iran, I\u2019ve been struck by the shocking antisemitism that I\u2019ve encountered, which can go way beyond anti-Zionism. Muslims in Europe also tend to hold more antisemitic attitudes than the population as a whole. It may be true, as Shabi suggests, that antisemitism across the Middle East has been imported from western traditions of racism, now fanned by western support for Israel, but it would still be useful to have more discussions about how this is playing out in Muslim communities and what can be done to challenge it.</p> <p>As Shabi herself says, this book is not intended to be the end of this discussion, but a vital part of those overdue conversations that are needed in order to build greater solidarity in this time of crisis. We need to be more confident in separating justified criticism of Israel from antisemitism, and</p> <p>this timely and valuable book should help to build that confidence. Because her key message is a vital one \u2013 that the fight against antisemitism is an essential part of the fight against all injustice and dehumanisation.</p> <p>Natasha Walter\u2019s latest book is Before the Light Fades: A Family Story of Resistance (Little, Brown, \u00a310.99).

A provisional trial date has been set for January next year. Police across the country have continued efforts to identify people involved in riots that swept multiple towns and cities after the attack. Almost 1,600 arrests have so far been made, with 1,015 charges brought. Spurrell said dedicated teams are still combing through footage of disorder for suspects. \u201cAlthough it was three months ago, that doesn\u2019t mean people can get away with what they did,\u201d she added. In Merseyside, in an attempt to tackle some of the underlying issues behind the riots, money seized from criminals will be invested into projects focusing on community cohesion, inclusion and tackling hate crime, Spurrell said. She also hopes to use her two-year term at the APCC, which represents elected police and crime commissioners across England and Wales and is Labour-dominated for the first time, to help improve public trust in policing. While the most recent official statistics show most types of recorded crime falling and prosecution rates increasing, Spurrell said the statistics do not matter if public perception does not improve. \u201cAs it currently stands, I think policing and criminal justice isn\u2019t working,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can tell people [the statistics] all the time but if they don\u2019t feel safe, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to tackle. They just want to know that when they need the police, they will be there for them.\u201d",

The algorithm, based on what we can tell from the outside in, is actually sending you false matches, and not delivering the ones you might actually truly be a match [with]\u201d.</p> <p>This could be for two reasons, the source concluded. \u201cTo keep you on the platform\u201d, but also, \u201cbreaking down the [users] in terms of sending them matches that make no sense on any level, such that they think that they\u2019re the problem and such that they\u2019re going to be incentivised to continue by escalating subscription costs, and do anything because they are made to feel like they can\u2019t find a match.\u201d</p> <p>Match Group said: \u201cThis lawsuit is ridiculous and has zero merit. Our business model is not based on advertising or engagement metrics. We actively strive to get people on dates every day and off our apps. Anyone who states anything else doesn\u2019t understand the purpose and mission of our entire industry.\u201d</p> <p>Dating apps today are different from how they were just a few years ago. Tinder, the world\u2019s highest grossing dating app, was free when it became the first mainstream smartphone dating platform in 2012. Other apps emulated its pioneering game-like design, with a carousel of profiles that users can \u201cswipe\u201d through and \u201clike\u201d to match and chat.</p> <p>After amassing millions of users, Tinder launched its first paid subscription features in 2015. Match acquired Hinge in 2018,<sup> </sup>and two years later it launched the \u201cstandouts\u201d feature, which effectively keeps \u201cpeople most your type\u201d behind a paywall. It means that daters on Hinge can view the profiles that the app says are \u201cgetting the most attention coupled with who we think you\u2019ll like\u201d, but cannot contact them without sending them a \u201crose\u201d. Hinge offers one free \u201crose\u201d a week, after which they cost \u00a33.33 each. Bumble offers a similar feature called a \u201cSuperSwipe\u201d: \u00a34 to contact a profile that it says \u201cmay help you match!\u201d.The app also offers advanced filters and a more tailored experience for paid users.</p>    <p>Pop-up adverts in all three apps promote paid-for options that imply you will \u201cget seen by more people\u201d or \u201cget noticed sooner\u201d for a certain period of time. But it\u2019s unclear what users are actually paying for.</p> <p>Luke Brunning, who runs a love, sex, and relationships research group at the University of Leeds, likened dating apps\u2019 features to video game <a href=\"https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/print/lootboxes-advice-to-the-gambling-commission-from-absg\">loot boxes</a>, which have <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8498/\">drawn the attention of</a> gambling regulators.</p> <p>Brunning said that the financial model of some dating apps \u201cis a bit like other kinds of in-video game purchasing, which \u2026 some people worry is basically a form of gambling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa6a41290bfb52289e1fb2fce4daaa42087a05f83%3Fcrop%3D0_0_1920_1080&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F02%2F241102hinge2loop.mp4\" data-alt=\"Hinge embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa6a41290bfb52289e1fb2fce4daaa42087a05f83%3Fcrop%3D0_0_1920_1080&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2024%2F11%2F02%2F241102hinge2loop.mp4\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re basically saying, \u2018look, I\u2019m going to pay money for this profile boost. I\u2019ve got literally no idea how this works. I have no access to data. All I\u2019m doing is paying money to a company in the hope that my profile will be pushed up, and I\u2019ll somehow get an advantage.\u2019 So people worry that could be addictive.\u201d</p> <p>Before testing Hinge\u2019s boost feature, I was shown a screen that said: \u201cNo likes yet \u2013 we\u2019re here to help. We can get you seen by more daters, sooner.\u201d I was offered the option to \u201cboost your profile\u201d or \u201cupgrade to HingeX\u201d.</p> <p>I paid \u00a39.99 for a 60-minute boost, after which I had 23 new \u201clikes\u201d. But I couldn\u2019t see them all. The app told me: \u201cSubscribe to see everyone who likes you\u201d. I was also prompted to buy a \u00a329.99 24-hour \u201cSuperboost\u201d, which claims to \u201cget up to 3x more views than Boost\u201d.</p> <p>One of the men I matched and chatted with indicated that he had \u201cliked\u201d me before I purchased the boost.</p> <p>Addictive design appears to have been baked in to Tinder from the beginning. Jonathan Badeen, Tinder\u2019s co-founder, invented the swipe mechanism and wrote the original Tinder iPhone application.</p> <p>In 2018 he told HBO\u2019s <em>Swiped</em> documentary that \u201cwe have some of these almost game-like elements where you almost feel like you\u2019re being rewarded. It kind of works like a slot machine.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re excited to see who the next person is \u2026 Hopefully, you\u2019re excited to see the \u2018It\u2019s a Match!\u2019 screen. A nice little rush.\u201d</p> <p>Badeen said he\u2019d learned about the intermittent variable reward system, a form of engineered behavioural addiction, in business classes at college. \u201cHaving unpredictable yet frequent rewards is the best way to motivate somebody to keep moving forward,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Intermittent or random rewards are addictive because they hijack the brain\u2019s reward-seeking systems to expect something good to come without knowing when, so people feel compelled to keep playing, scrolling or swiping.</p> <p>When contacted by the <em>Observer</em>, Badeen said he was no longer affiliated with Tinder or Match Group.</p> <p>Natasha Sch\u00fcll, author of <em>Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas</em>, compared the infinite vertical scroll of social media \u2013 the addictive potential of which the UK parliament is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/14/new-bill-could-force-social-media-firms-to-make-content-less-addictive-for-children\">now scrutinising</a> \u2013 with the \u201chorizontal scroll\u201d of dating apps.</p> <p>Instead of going out to meet people in real life, she said, daters \u201cget stuck swiping left and right\u201d. That\u2019s because the designers of these dating apps \u201cmake it as easy as possible, like on a slot machine\u201d.</p> <p>Sch\u00fcll said: \u201cGamblers are always talking about this \u2018machine zone\u2019 that they get pulled into where they feel like they\u2019re merging with the process. I think this sort of trance-like state, whether it\u2019s texting, or trading, or mobile sports betting or the dating, it starts to feel like this curious, trance-like flow, [where] you can\u2019t stop and you\u2019re just like, \u2018let me keep swiping.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sch\u00fcll believes some dating app companies have used \u201cevery manner of enticement and monetisation to get revenue and extract value out of people\u2026 preying on their natural humanity. It\u2019s \u2026 predatory monetisation, on top of what\u2019s already these \u2026 addicting kind of features.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, she said, \u201cthere is some sort of crisis happening\u201d in dating.</p> <p>Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick who specialises in digital intimacy, has interviewed dating app users in the UK and Italy. \u201cI can report the anger of people with the algorithm and how the algorithm doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThose premium subscriptions are the business exploitation, the financial exploitation of this frustration \u2013 the promise that if you do something different, if you do something more, then the algorithm will reward you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is a certain extortion,\u201d she said. \u201cDating apps are businesses. If they worked, they would be financially unsustainable.\u201d</p> <p>Tinder claims to have made 55bn matches, but Match Group does not keep data on how many lasting relationships have been formed via its platforms.</p> <p>Dating apps are regulated in the UK under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/article/2024/aug/08/what-is-uk-online-safety-act-new-legislation-laws\">Online Safety Act</a>, via Ofcom, but only regarding illegal and harmful content, particularly that concerning children. Technology that may exploit or harm adult consumers was more pertinent to consumer protection law, Ofcom said.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority said: \u201cOnline dating sites must operate fairly and ensure that customers are not misled.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm, which is leading the US lawsuit against Match, said that people using dating platforms were particularly vulnerable because \u201cthe carrot that\u2019s being dangled is the single most important thing that people look for in life, which is love, connection, and companionship\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Peter*, a 57-year-old divorced father from Fife, has been single since 2012 and uses Match.com and Plenty of Fish. He believes Match deploys cynical tactics to retain subscribers. \u201cWhen you signify you\u2019re cancelling your membership and you\u2019ve two or three weeks before it ends, all of a sudden \u2026 you\u2019re shown a gorgeous [woman].\u201d</p> <p>Peter believes it is \u201cduplicitous\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d. He said: \u201cThere must be managers in a room in the Texas HQ of Match.com that say, \u2018send profiles to those sad, lonely old men.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, Match\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Kim, said: \u201cOur goal is to see real single users find a date and then get off of our apps. We focus on attracting singles who want to make real connections and satisfying our daters who are earnest in their intentions by delivering great experiences.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson also highlighted a 2022 blog post that said the algorithm \u201crecommends profiles using recent activity, who members are sending Likes and Nopes to, profile elements like interests, and location\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Bumble said: \u201cBumble Inc exists to help people build healthy and equitable relationships. During this well-documented loneliness epidemic we firmly believe that relationships are the crucial foundation of a happy and healthy life. The best way we can deliver as a business and for our members is to continuously innovate and drive real impact across the user experience.</p> <p>\u201cOur business thrives on personal recommendations from success stories of people who\u2019ve found love and friendship through our apps. As a result, there is a strong incentive for our teams to develop features that help users build authentic online connections that can grow into real-life relationships.\u201d</p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority indicated that if anyone had concerns over in-app adverts or purchases, it would consider any complaints it received.</p> <p>The Trading Standards service said \u201cany unhappy consumers should register their complaints with the Citizens Advice consumer service, so Trading Standards can get an idea of the scale of the alleged problem.\u201d</p> <p>Dating apps do not fall under the remit of the Gambling Commission, which declined to comment.</p> <p>Peter argued tighter regulation was needed. \u201cI feel exploited by Match,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re all just a swipe, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s swipe left, swipe right, and we\u2019ve all become monetised. It\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"6bc8fbad-533e-44c8-a896-a36cbe0bab76\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>",

Many apps, including Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, now offer the prospect of more matches, more profile visibility and more dates \u2013 if users pay more money.

Other apps emulated its pioneering game-like design, with a carousel of profiles that users can \u201cswipe\u201d through and \u201clike\u201d to match and chat. After amassing millions of users, Tinder launched its first paid subscription features in 2015. Match acquired Hinge in 2018, and two years later it launched the \u201cstandouts\u201d feature, which effectively keeps \u201cpeople most your type\u201d behind a paywall. It means that daters on Hinge can view the profiles that the app says are \u201cgetting the most attention coupled with who we think you\u2019ll like\u201d, but cannot contact them without sending them a \u201crose\u201d. Hinge offers one free \u201crose\u201d a week, after which they cost \u00a33.33 each. Bumble offers a similar feature called a \u201cSuperSwipe\u201d: \u00a34 to contact a profile that it says \u201cmay help you match!\u201d.The app also offers advanced filters and a more tailored experience for paid users. Pop-up adverts in all three apps promote paid-for options that imply you will \u201cget seen by more people\u201d or \u201cget noticed sooner\u201d for a certain period of time. But it\u2019s unclear what users are actually paying for. Luke Brunning, who runs a love, sex, and relationships research group at the University of Leeds, likened dating apps\u2019 features to video game loot boxes, which have drawn the attention of gambling regulators. Brunning said that the financial model of some dating apps \u201cis a bit like other kinds of in-video game purchasing, which \u2026 some people worry is basically a form of gambling. \u201cYou\u2019re basically saying, \u2018look, I\u2019m going to pay money for this profile boost. I\u2019ve got literally no idea how this works. I have no access to data. All I\u2019m doing is paying money to a company in the hope that my profile will be pushed up, and I\u2019ll somehow get an advantage.\u2019 So people worry that could be addictive.\u201d Before testing Hinge\u2019s boost feature, I was shown a screen that said: \u201cNo likes yet \u2013 we\u2019re here to help. We can get you seen by more daters, sooner.\u201d I was offered the option to \u201cboost your profile\u201d or \u201cupgrade to HingeX\u201d. I paid \u00a39.99 for a 60-minute boost, after which I had 23 new \u201clikes\u201d. But I couldn\u2019t see them all. The app told me: \u201cSubscribe to see everyone who likes you\u201d. I was also prompted to buy a \u00a329.99 24-hour \u201cSuperboost\u201d, which claims to \u201cget up to 3x more views than Boost\u201d. One of the men I matched and chatted with indicated that he had \u201cliked\u201d me before I purchased the boost. Addictive design appears to have been baked in to Tinder from the beginning. Jonathan Badeen, Tinder\u2019s co-founder, invented the swipe mechanism and wrote the original Tinder iPhone application. In 2018 he told HBO\u2019s Swiped documentary that \u201cwe have some of these almost game-like elements where you almost feel like you\u2019re being rewarded. It kind of works like a slot machine. \u201cYou\u2019re excited to see who the next person is \u2026 Hopefully, you\u2019re excited to see the \u2018It\u2019s a Match!\u2019 screen. A nice little rush.\u201d Badeen said he\u2019d learned about the intermittent variable reward system, a form of engineered behavioural addiction, in business classes at college. \u201cHaving unpredictable yet frequent rewards is the best way to motivate somebody to keep moving forward,\u201d he said. Intermittent or random rewards are addictive because they hijack the brain\u2019s reward-seeking systems to expect something good to come without knowing when, so people feel compelled to keep playing, scrolling or swiping. When contacted by the Observer, Badeen said he was no longer affiliated with Tinder or Match Group. Natasha Sch\u00fcll, author of Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas, compared the infinite vertical scroll of social media \u2013 the addictive potential of which the UK parliament is now scrutinising \u2013 with the \u201chorizontal scroll\u201d of dating apps. Instead of going out to meet people in real life, she said, daters \u201cget stuck swiping left and right\u201d. That\u2019s because the designers of these dating apps \u201cmake it as easy as possible, like on a slot machine\u201d. Sch\u00fcll said: \u201cGamblers are always talking about this \u2018machine zone\u2019 that they get pulled into where they feel like they\u2019re merging with the process. I think this sort of trance-like state, whether it\u2019s texting, or trading, or mobile sports betting or the dating, it starts to feel like this curious, trance-like flow, [where] you can\u2019t stop and you\u2019re just like, \u2018let me keep swiping.\u2019\u201d Sch\u00fcll believes some dating app companies have used \u201cevery manner of enticement and monetisation to get revenue and extract value out of people\u2026 preying on their natural humanity. It\u2019s \u2026 predatory monetisation, on top of what\u2019s already these \u2026 addicting kind of features.\u201d As a result, she said, \u201cthere is some sort of crisis happening\u201d in dating. Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick who specialises in digital intimacy, has interviewed dating app users in the UK and Italy. \u201cI can report the anger of people with the algorithm and how the algorithm doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cThose premium subscriptions are the business exploitation, the financial exploitation of this frustration \u2013 the promise that if you do something different, if you do something more, then the algorithm will reward you.\u201d \u201cThere is a certain extortion,\u201d she said. \u201cDating apps are businesses. If they worked, they would be financially unsustainable.\u201d Tinder claims to have made 55bn matches, but Match Group does not keep data on how many lasting relationships have been formed via its platforms. Dating apps are regulated in the UK under the Online Safety Act, via Ofcom, but only regarding illegal and harmful content, particularly that concerning children. Technology that may exploit or harm adult consumers was more pertinent to consumer protection law, Ofcom said. The Competition and Markets Authority said: \u201cOnline dating sites must operate fairly and ensure that customers are not misled.\u201d Tim Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm, which is leading the US lawsuit against Match, said that people using dating platforms were particularly vulnerable because \u201cthe carrot that\u2019s being dangled is the single most important thing that people look for in life, which is love, connection, and companionship\u201d. *** Peter*, a 57-year-old divorced father from Fife, has been single since 2012 and uses Match.com and Plenty of Fish. He believes Match deploys cynical tactics to retain subscribers. \u201cWhen you signify you\u2019re cancelling your membership and you\u2019ve two or three weeks before it ends, all of a sudden \u2026 you\u2019re shown a gorgeous [woman].\u201d Peter believes it is \u201cduplicitous\u201d and \u201cdeceitful\u201d. He said: \u201cThere must be managers in a room in the Texas HQ of Match.com that say, \u2018send profiles to those sad, lonely old men.\u2019\u201d Earlier this year, Match\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Kim, said: \u201cOur goal is to see real single users find a date and then get off of our apps. We focus on attracting singles who want to make real connections and satisfying our daters who are earnest in their intentions by delivering great experiences.\u201d A spokesperson also highlighted a 2022 blog post that said the algorithm \u201crecommends profiles using recent activity, who members are sending Likes and Nopes to, profile elements like interests, and location\u201d. A spokesperson for Bumble said: \u201cBumble Inc exists to help people build healthy and equitable relationships. During this well-documented loneliness epidemic we firmly believe that relationships are the crucial foundation of a happy and healthy life. The best way we can deliver as a business and for our members is to continuously innovate and drive real impact across the user experience. \u201cOur business thrives on personal recommendations from success stories of people who\u2019ve found love and friendship through our apps. As a result, there is a strong incentive for our teams to develop features that help users build authentic online connections that can grow into real-life relationships.\u201d The Advertising Standards Authority indicated that if anyone had concerns over in-app adverts or purchases, it would consider any complaints it received. The Trading Standards service said \u201cany unhappy consumers should register their complaints with the Citizens Advice consumer service, so Trading Standards can get an idea of the scale of the alleged problem.\u201d Dating apps do not fall under the remit of the Gambling Commission, which declined to comment. Peter argued tighter regulation was needed. \u201cI feel exploited by Match,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re all just a swipe, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s swipe left, swipe right, and we\u2019ve all become monetised. It\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When writer and artist <a href=\"http://www.alicemaddicott.com/\">Alice Maddicott</a>\u2019s beloved rescue cat died, she was understandably bereft. Dylan was a proper character, she says, the kind of gregarious cat that follows you to the pub or for a walk. But mourning him made Alice, who was then in her late 30s and single, feel faintly self-conscious. What if people thought she was a mad cat lady, weeping spinsterish tears for her pet?</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d had a dog, there would be no stereotype. But as a single woman approaching 40, it could be seen very differently,\u201d says Maddicott. Curious about the origins of such a kneejerk prejudice, she started digging into its history. The research became a book, <em>Cat Women</em>, reclaiming an insult long used to belittle older women (especially non-compliant ones) or frighten younger women into settling down, lest they end up like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/16/claws-pop-culture-crazy-cat-lady-lonely-sexless-eccentric-stereotype-millennial-ailurophiles\">crazy cat lady</a> from <em>The Simpsons</em>: once a high achiever, now a burnt-out drunk.</p> <p>But as Maddicott points out, it\u2019s an objectively ridiculous insult. There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201ccrazy cat man\u201d and single hamster owners aren\u2019t considered a threat to the patriarchal order. Only cat ladies touch a nerve, because only cat ladies immediately conjure up the idea of witches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Childless Cat Lady for Kamala T-shirt is now a gleeful statement of defiance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In medieval times, the devil was believed to give cats as gifts to women inducted into witchcraft, Maddicott explains: so strong was the association that at the Bideford witch trials in 17th-century Devon, one woman was accused after a cat was seen slipping in through her window. \u201cProbably an eccentric older woman feeding a stray, but that was used to condemn her.\u201d Single women, unrestrained and also undefended by any man, made dangerously easy scapegoats if sickness came or the crops failed. Thankfully, people no longer believe in witches ruining lives out of spite. Or do they?</p> <p>Three years ago, the then aspiring Republican senator (and now vice-presidential candidate) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance\">JD Vance</a> complained on Fox News that America was being run by \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\u201d He named vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, secretary of transportation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a> (who is gay) and the young New York representative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> as politicians who supposedly had no stake in the future they were legislating for.</p> <p>The idea that if you haven\u2019t given birth, you don\u2019t count, was hurtful to many doting stepmothers (as Harris is) or adoptive parents (like Buttigieg). But most incendiary of all was the idea that not having children renders a person a bitter, vengeful husk, desperate to drag everyone else down with them. Polling this summer, after those comments were dug up and recirculated, found two-thirds of Americans disagreed that not having biological children was a hindrance in a president; even among Republicans, only 15% agreed.</p>    <p>Though Vance now insists he was merely being sarcastic, for many women on both sides of the Atlantic, those words summed up a strand of politics that seemingly values them mainly for their ability to procreate and views their right to choose with suspicion. Though powerful women have long been shamed for not being mothers \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/07/it-took-on-a-life-of-its-own-the-story-behind-julia-gillards-misogyny-speech\">deliberately barren</a>\u201d, the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard\u2019s opponents called her \u2013 in the current climate, attacks on childless cat ladies have a sharper edge.</p> <p>In both the US and Europe, rightwing parties are weaponising female fertility as a political issue, tapping into a potent mix of misogyny, economic anxiety and overtly racist angst about being \u201creplaced\u201d as the dominant culture if white women don\u2019t start breeding more enthusiastically. Though falling birth rates across the developed world are an undeniable economic headache \u2013 shrinking populations mean fewer young workers to fund pensions for the old and, typically, lower growth \u2013 populists focus on the way a dwindling workforce leads to more imported labour. Hungary\u2019s populist leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a> has claimed the west is \u201ccommitting suicide\u201d by not making babies; in Germany, the far right AfD called in its manifesto for \u201clarger families instead of mass immigration\u201d. Elon Musk, the X owner and Donald Trump donor, tweets in apocalyptic terms about impending \u201cpopulation collapse\u201d.</p> <p>Yet still, the baby drought persists. Around one in five British women don\u2019t have children by the end of their fertile years \u2013 the Office for National Statistics doesn\u2019t keep equivalent statistics for men \u2013 and this year deaths overtook births for the first time (outside a pandemic) since the 1970s. Almost half of Americans under 50, meanwhile, are childless. Or should that be childfree? For this year of shaming women has also been a year of women refusing to be shamed: older women reclaiming witchy insults like \u201chag\u201d and \u201ccrone\u201d, while younger ones resist what they see as a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em> future of curtailed rights over their own bodies.</p> <p>Like the cat-eared pink hats that anti-Trump marchers wore in 2017, referencing his boasts about grabbing women \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/29/denying-accuracy-of-access-hollywood-tape-would-be-trumps-biggest-lie\">by the pussy</a>\u201d, in 2024 a \u201cChildless Cat Lady for Kamala\u201d T-shirt or sticker is now a gleeful statement of defiance. When Taylor Swift <a href=\"https://x.com/guardian/status/1833719916618195203\">identified as one</a> in her Instagram post formally endorsing Harris, it felt like something of a Spartacus moment \u2013 arguably even more so when Elon Musk responded with a creepy tweet offering to get her pregnant.</p> <p>What\u2019s different about Swift isn\u2019t merely that she, too, is unmarried, childfree and a cat owner at 34; it\u2019s that she makes it look like a blast. Rich, powerful and taking her pick of trophy boyfriends, she lives closer to what would once have been called a rakish bachelor\u2019s life than a spinster\u2019s \u2013 though these days spinsterdom is a story told very differently.</p> <p>In Kate Winslet\u2019s recent feminist biopic <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/08/kate-winslet-insisted-her-film-about-lee-miller-must-have-female-director#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLee%20is%20a%20great%20role,into%20the%20heart%20of%20darkness%E2%80%9D.\">Lee</a></em>, about the pioneering Second World War photographer Lee Miller, there is a scene in which Winslet\u2019s Miller and <em>Vogue</em> magazine editor Audrey Withers ask each other if they\u2019re planning to have children. \u201cGod no,\u201d says Withers, cheerfully. \u201cOh God no,\u201d echoes Winslet\u2019s Miller. It\u2019s a bonding moment in the film which implies neither could have done what they did \u2013 in Miller\u2019s case following the US army\u2019s advance across Europe and documenting newly liberated concentration camps; and in Withers\u2019s case battling the censors to publish her images \u2013 if they\u2019d had families at home. Though Miller did eventually have a son after the war, the film doesn\u2019t duck the fact their relationship was difficult and ultimately lets her work take centre stage. It\u2019s how great men\u2019s stories are often told, drawing a veil over domestic shortcomings, but more rarely women\u2019s.</p>    <p>Once upon a time in Hollywood, childless women could be mad, murderous bunny boilers \u2013 in films like <em>Single White Female</em> and <em>Fatal Attraction</em> \u2013 or at a push Bridget Jones, terrified of dying \u201cfat and alone\u201d. Now they can be Carrie Bradshaw, reimagined in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/and-just-like-that\">And Just Like That\u2026</a></em> as a sexy fiftysomething widow with a fluffy rescue cat, or even Greta Gerwig\u2019s <em>Barbie</em>, the eternally childless doll who (according to her creator Ruth Handler) \u201calways represented the fact that a woman has choices\u201d. Though the film has a darker side, with the Kens\u2019 angry revolt against the Barbie matriarchy echoing a backlash many young women say they\u2019re experiencing in real life, the Barbieland both sides seek to control is a hedonistic land of parties and beach days where nobody is spending their Saturdays bleary-eyed at soft play. The toymaker Mattel has always resisted pleas to give Barbie and Ken children; instead they stayed forever aspirational Dinks, an 80s acronym for Dual Income No Kids now gleefully revived by millennials.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re DINKs. Of course we are already planning our European vacation next year,\u201d says TikToker <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@johnefinance?lang=en\">@johnefinance</a>, in a chirpy post last December that racked up over 290,000 likes. \u201cWe\u2019re DINKs; we spend our discretionary income on $8 lattes,\u201d his partner giggles. Social media is still awash with #dinkcouple posts bragging about how much more money, sex and sleep they get compared to haggard new parents, recasting childless life as the opposite of sad and empty. Unusually, the trend brings young men\u2019s perspectives into a debate normally (and exhaustingly) focused on women. But it also reflects polling released by the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/19/growing-share-of-childless-adults-in-u-s-dont-expect-to-ever-have-children/\">Pew Center</a> thinktank earlier this year showing the most common reason childless Americans under 50 give for not being parents is that they just don\u2019t want to.</p> <p>TikTok\u2019s Dinks are young, and maybe not ruling parenthood out forever. But for now their lives arguably look a lot more fun than being a tradwife, those sourdough-baking, God-fearing, home-schooling mothers of multiple children whose retro social media content is \u2013 depending on your view \u2013 either a bit of guilty escapist fantasy for tired working women or a sinister attempt to drag women back into the kitchen. This summer a British newspaper interview with uber-tradwife Hannah Neeleman (aka <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ballerinafarm/?hl=en\">@ballerinafarm</a>), in which the writer wondered how exactly she\u2019d ended up sacrificing a ballet career to have eight children and why her husband kept answering questions for her, triggered days of debate about whether she was being secretly oppressed or whether (as Neeleman\u2019s fans argued) this was a hit piece by a writer who doesn\u2019t have kids.</p> <p>Cut through all the noise, however, and there is one clear signal: neither the tradwife nor the Dink camp seem to think having it all is an option any more. You can\u2019t have kids and a career in ballet; you can\u2019t have a thrilling social life and children. You have to choose, with the implication that either way, something is lost. If there is a sadness to Neeleman talking about giving up on her professional ambitions, there is a faint whiff of financial distress around some of those Dink reels, too; a sense they\u2019re blowing their cash on bucket-list travel destinations because the idea of buying a family home (while paying nursery bills that cost more than a mortgage) seems wildly out of reach.</p> <p>The second most common reason childless Britons aged 35-44 gave for not having children (after thinking they were too old) was a split between \u201cI don\u2019t want the impact on my lifestyle\u201d and \u201cthe cost is too high\u201d, according to YouGov. But for those on tight budgets, the two are related. It may be no accident that Britain\u2019s last mini-baby boom was in the early Noughties \u2013 fuelled by cheaper childcare, longer maternity leave and rising prosperity \u2013 or that it fizzled out with the 2009 recession.</p> <p>On both sides<em><strong> </strong></em>of the Atlantic, women who do want kids some day are tired of being blamed for their childlessness by politicians who seemingly won\u2019t meet them halfway: who instead of building cheap houses for first-time buyers or slashing their nursery bills, suggest (in Vance\u2019s case) that grandparents could help out for free. But for some women, there\u2019s an added worry that politicians cajoling or shaming women into having children may eventually turn to forcing them.</p> <p><em><strong>For American women</strong></em> under 30, abortion is now the number one election issue, according to an October poll by the health policy researchers <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/\">KFF</a>. Two years ago, the overturning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">Roe v Wade</a> \u2013 the landmark ruling underpinning legal abortion in America \u2013 left the way open for an all-out assault on reproductive rights. At campaign rally after rally, Harris has hammered away at fears of what a Republican administration might do. She often quotes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025\">Project 2025</a>, the infamous leaked wishlist for a second Trump term drawn up by a rightwing thinktank, which argues for giving foetuses legal rights and scrapping funding for contraceptive services.</p> <p>In Europe, too, rightwing governments in Hungary, Italy and Poland have tightened abortion law, though furious female voters helped propel a pro-liberalisation Polish government into power last year.</p> <p>For now, Britain seems to be on a much more progressive path. The prospect of curbs on abortion in this parliament looks at first glance remote, though the Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stella-creasy\">Stella Creasy</a> \u2013 who has been aggressively targeted in her constituency by anti-abortion activists \u2013 argues complacency is dangerous. \u201cIf the election hadn\u2019t been called, it\u2019s not clear that we wouldn\u2019t have seen the first rollback on rights in 50 years,\u201d she says, pointing to a backbench attempt to reduce the legal time limit from 24 to 22 weeks in the dying months of the last Conservative government.</p> <p>But the Tory MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/18/tory-mp-miriam-cates-investigated-standards-watchdog\">Miriam Cates</a> \u2013 who once argued that dwindling fertility rates are \u201cthe one overarching threat\u201d to western society \u2013 lost her seat in July, while the Tory leadership favourite Kemi Badenoch says she isn\u2019t convinced governments can make women have babies.</p> <p>America\u2019s fate, however, still hangs by a thread, with a stark divide emerging particularly among the young: women for Harris, angry young men for Trump.</p> <p>Whether she wins or whether she loses in the coming election, it almost certainly won\u2019t be because (along with every other occupant of the Oval Office in history) Kamala Harris hasn\u2019t physically given birth. Most Americans say this election is still about the economy, stupid. But what is clear from months of arguing about childless cat ladies is that being one is just another American story now.</p> <p>When the pollsters Ipsos went looking this summer for female voters with no kids at home, but with a feline companion, the surprise was all the ways in which they were pretty much like everyone else: mostly suburban, disproportionately white, mostly with some college education, no richer or poorer than average \u2013 and in almost a third of cases, Republicans. They\u2019re living behind the same white-picket fences as everyone else, shopping at Target, working nine to five, just getting on with life. And the clearer that becomes, the harder it is to pretend that every childless cat lady is a witch.</p>    <h2>Feline friendship</h2> <p><em>Cat lover and author Britt Collins on her furry companions</em></p> <p>I never imagined that childless cat ladies would become a political force and a whole new demographic. Over the years, I\u2019ve heard all the snarks: mad, lonely, obsessive \u2013 the old witch-hunting slurs that have dogged outlier women forever. Am I miserable by the choices I made? Hell, no. Here\u2019s the thing, cats rock and I don\u2019t have to defend my choices. If I wanted kids, I\u2019d have adopted one.</p> <p>The only time I felt lonely was in the last year of my marriage when I lost my sense of self. I\u2019ve had boyfriends since I was 15, always cat men, and I still adore my two long-term exes with whom I spent my 20s and 30s. I\u2019ve raised dozens of strays with them and had the best of times. However, these days, my ideal man is a gay vet. I\u2019m happy with my mogs, enjoying the deep, uncomplicated love and pure joy of feline friendship.</p> <p>Still, I\u2019ve had strangers tell me that giving up on relationships, as I moved into my 50s, is no way to live. Women and the cats they love have long been maligned, somehow seen as lesser-than or unfulfilled. Carving out my own little universe, I\u2019ve filled it with cats and creativity. I\u2019ve travelled to more than 35 countries, looked after big cats, baboons, bats and various wild orphans, written two books, ghostwritten and edited others, edited and created magazines, run a sell-out cat festival, directed pop videos and completed the screenplay adaption for my book, <em>Strays</em>, that has sparked interest from Hollywood producers. I do what I want, when I want \u2013 enjoying the privileges historically afforded to men.</p> <p>Journalist and activist Gloria Steinem, who\u2019s had many felines over the decades, credits them as her teachers \u2018when it comes to a strong will and self-authority\u2019. When Steinem was asked how to raise the next generation of feminists, she said: \u2018Like cats. They tell you what they\u2019re going to do, and that\u2019s that.\u2019</p> <p>Cats, with their punky attitudes, have taught me defiance and everything else worth knowing. They are sensualists, things of beauty, who\u2019ve inspired artists for centuries. Lennon, McCartney, Bowie, Dylan and many of the greatest rock stars were all crazy-cat ladies. Us cat people of all political stripes may not agree on everything, but we don\u2019t let it get in the way of what matters most.</p> <p><em>Strays: A Lost Cat, A Homeless Man and Their Journey Across America by Britt Collins is published by Simon &amp; Schuster</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When writer and artist Alice Maddicott\u2019s beloved rescue cat died, she was understandably bereft. Dylan was a proper character, she says, the kind of gregarious cat that follows you to the pub or for a walk. But mourning him made Alice, who was then in her late 30s and single, feel faintly self-conscious. What if people thought she was a mad cat lady, weeping spinsterish tears for her pet? \u201cIf I\u2019d had a dog, there would be no stereotype. But as a single woman approaching 40, it could be seen very differently,\u201d says Maddicott. Curious about the origins of such a kneejerk prejudice, she started digging into its history. The research became a book, Cat Women, reclaiming an insult long used to belittle older women (especially non-compliant ones) or frighten younger women into settling down, lest they end up like the crazy cat lady from The Simpsons: once a high achiever, now a burnt-out drunk. But as Maddicott points out, it\u2019s an objectively ridiculous insult. There\u2019s no such thing as a \u201ccrazy cat man\u201d and single hamster owners aren\u2019t considered a threat to the patriarchal order. Only cat ladies touch a nerve, because only cat ladies immediately conjure up the idea of witches. In medieval times, the devil was believed to give cats as gifts to women inducted into witchcraft, Maddicott explains: so strong was the association that at the Bideford witch trials in 17th-century Devon, one woman was accused after a cat was seen slipping in through her window. \u201cProbably an eccentric older woman feeding a stray, but that was used to condemn her.\u201d Single women, unrestrained and also undefended by any man, made dangerously easy scapegoats if sickness came or the crops failed. Thankfully, people no longer believe in witches ruining lives out of spite. Or do they? Three years ago, the then aspiring Republican senator (and now vice-presidential candidate) JD Vance complained on Fox News that America was being run by \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\u201d He named vice-president Kamala Harris, secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg (who is gay) and the young New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as politicians who supposedly had no stake in the future they were legislating for. The idea that if you haven\u2019t given birth, you don\u2019t count, was hurtful to many doting stepmothers (as Harris is) or adoptive parents (like Buttigieg). But most incendiary of all was the idea that not having children renders a person a bitter, vengeful husk, desperate to drag everyone else down with them. Polling this summer, after those comments were dug up and recirculated, found two-thirds of Americans disagreed that not having biological children was a hindrance in a president; even among Republicans, only 15% agreed. Though Vance now insists he was merely being sarcastic, for many women on both sides of the Atlantic, those words summed up a strand of politics that seemingly values them mainly for their ability to procreate and views their right to choose with suspicion. Though powerful women have long been shamed for not being mothers \u2013 \u201cdeliberately barren\u201d, the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard\u2019s opponents called her \u2013 in the current climate, attacks on childless cat ladies have a sharper edge. In both the US and Europe, rightwing parties are weaponising female fertility as a political issue, tapping into a potent mix of misogyny, economic anxiety and overtly racist angst about being \u201creplaced\u201d as the dominant culture if white women don\u2019t start breeding more enthusiastically. Though falling birth rates across the developed world are an undeniable economic headache \u2013 shrinking populations mean fewer young workers to fund pensions for the old and, typically, lower growth \u2013 populists focus on the way a dwindling workforce leads to more imported labour. Hungary\u2019s populist leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n has claimed the west is \u201ccommitting suicide\u201d by not making babies; in Germany, the far right AfD called in its manifesto for \u201clarger families instead of mass immigration\u201d. Elon Musk, the X owner and Donald Trump donor, tweets in apocalyptic terms about impending \u201cpopulation collapse\u201d. Yet still, the baby drought persists. Around one in five British women don\u2019t have children by the end of their fertile years \u2013 the Office for National Statistics doesn\u2019t keep equivalent statistics for men \u2013 and this year deaths overtook births for the first time (outside a pandemic) since the 1970s. Almost half of Americans under 50, meanwhile, are childless. Or should that be childfree? For this year of shaming women has also been a year of women refusing to be shamed: older women reclaiming witchy insults like \u201chag\u201d and \u201ccrone\u201d, while younger ones resist what they see as a Handmaid\u2019s Tale future of curtailed rights over their own bodies. Like the cat-eared pink hats that anti-Trump marchers wore in 2017, referencing his boasts about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d, in 2024 a \u201cChildless Cat Lady for Kamala\u201d T-shirt or sticker is now a gleeful statement of defiance. When Taylor Swift identified as one in her Instagram post formally endorsing Harris, it felt like something of a Spartacus moment \u2013 arguably even more so when Elon Musk responded with a creepy tweet offering to get her pregnant. What\u2019s different about Swift isn\u2019t merely that she, too, is unmarried, childfree and a cat owner at 34; it\u2019s that she makes it look like a blast. Rich, powerful and taking her pick of trophy boyfriends, she lives closer to what would once have been called a rakish bachelor\u2019s life than a spinster\u2019s \u2013 though these days spinsterdom is a story told very differently. In Kate Winslet\u2019s recent feminist biopic Lee, about the pioneering Second World War photographer Lee Miller, there is a scene in which Winslet\u2019s Miller and Vogue magazine editor Audrey Withers ask each other if they\u2019re planning to have children. \u201cGod no,\u201d says Withers, cheerfully. \u201cOh God no,\u201d echoes Winslet\u2019s Miller. It\u2019s a bonding moment in the film which implies neither could have done what they did \u2013 in Miller\u2019s case following the US army\u2019s advance across Europe and documenting newly liberated concentration camps; and in Withers\u2019s case battling the censors to publish her images \u2013 if they\u2019d had families at home. Though Miller did eventually have a son after the war, the film doesn\u2019t duck the fact their relationship was difficult and ultimately lets her work take centre stage. It\u2019s how great men\u2019s stories are often told, drawing a veil over domestic shortcomings, but more rarely women\u2019s. Once upon a time in Hollywood, childless women could be mad, murderous bunny boilers \u2013 in films like Single White Female and Fatal Attraction \u2013 or at a push Bridget Jones, terrified of dying \u201cfat and alone\u201d. Now they can be Carrie Bradshaw, reimagined in And Just Like That\u2026 as a sexy fiftysomething widow with a fluffy rescue cat, or even Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, the eternally childless doll who (according to her creator Ruth Handler) \u201calways represented the fact that a woman has choices\u201d. Though the film has a darker side, with the Kens\u2019 angry revolt against the Barbie matriarchy echoing a backlash many young women say they\u2019re experiencing in real life, the Barbieland both sides seek to control is a hedonistic land of parties and beach days where nobody is spending their Saturdays bleary-eyed at soft play. The toymaker Mattel has always resisted pleas to give Barbie and Ken children; instead they stayed forever aspirational Dinks, an 80s acronym for Dual Income No Kids now gleefully revived by millennials. \u201cWe\u2019re DINKs. Of course we are already planning our European vacation next year,\u201d says TikToker @johnefinance, in a chirpy post last December that racked up over 290,000 likes. \u201cWe\u2019re DINKs; we spend our discretionary income on $8 lattes,\u201d his partner giggles. Social media is still awash with #dinkcouple posts bragging about how much more money, sex and sleep they get compared to haggard new parents, recasting childless life as the opposite of sad and empty. Unusually, the trend brings young men\u2019s perspectives into a debate normally (and exhaustingly) focused on women. But it also reflects polling released by the Pew Center thinktank earlier this year showing the most common reason childless Americans under 50 give for not being parents is that they just don\u2019t want to. TikTok\u2019s Dinks are young, and maybe not ruling parenthood out forever. But for now their lives arguably look a lot more fun than being a tradwife, those sourdough-baking, God-fearing, home-schooling mothers of multiple children whose retro social media content is \u2013 depending on your view \u2013 either a bit of guilty escapist fantasy for tired working women or a sinister attempt to drag women back into the kitchen. This summer a British newspaper interview with uber-tradwife Hannah Neeleman (aka @ballerinafarm), in which the writer wondered how exactly she\u2019d ended up sacrificing a ballet career to have eight children and why her husband kept answering questions for her, triggered days of debate about whether she was being secretly oppressed or whether (as Neeleman\u2019s fans argued) this was a hit piece by a writer who doesn\u2019t have kids. Cut through all the noise, however, and there is one clear signal: neither the tradwife nor the Dink camp seem to think having it all is an option any more. You can\u2019t have kids and a career in ballet; you can\u2019t have a thrilling social life and children. You have to choose, with the implication that either way, something is lost. If there is a sadness to Neeleman talking about giving up on her professional ambitions, there is a faint whiff of financial distress around some of those Dink reels, too; a sense they\u2019re blowing their cash on bucket-list travel destinations because the idea of buying a family home (while paying nursery bills that cost more than a mortgage) seems wildly out of reach. The second most common reason childless Britons aged 35-44 gave for not having children (after thinking they were too old) was a split between \u201cI don\u2019t want the impact on my lifestyle\u201d and \u201cthe cost is too high\u201d, according to YouGov. But for those on tight budgets, the two are related. It may be no accident that Britain\u2019s last mini-baby boom was in the early Noughties \u2013 fuelled by cheaper childcare, longer maternity leave and rising prosperity \u2013 or that it fizzled out with the 2009 recession. On both sides of the Atlantic, women who do want kids some day are tired of being blamed for their childlessness by politicians who seemingly won\u2019t meet them halfway: who instead of building cheap houses for first-time buyers or slashing their nursery bills, suggest (in Vance\u2019s case) that grandparents could help out for free. But for some women, there\u2019s an added worry that politicians cajoling or shaming women into having children may eventually turn to forcing them. For American women under 30, abortion is now the number one election issue, according to an October poll by the health policy researchers KFF. Two years ago, the overturning of Roe v Wade \u2013 the landmark ruling underpinning legal abortion in America \u2013 left the way open for an all-out assault on reproductive rights. At campaign rally after rally, Harris has hammered away at fears of what a Republican administration might do. She often quotes Project 2025, the infamous leaked wishlist for a second Trump term drawn up by a rightwing thinktank, which argues for giving foetuses legal rights and scrapping funding for contraceptive services. In Europe, too, rightwing governments in Hungary, Italy and Poland have tightened abortion law, though furious female voters helped propel a pro-liberalisation Polish government into power last year. For now, Britain seems to be on a much more progressive path. The prospect of curbs on abortion in this parliament looks at first glance remote, though the Labour MP Stella Creasy \u2013 who has been aggressively targeted in her constituency by anti-abortion activists \u2013 argues complacency is dangerous. \u201cIf the election hadn\u2019t been called, it\u2019s not clear that we wouldn\u2019t have seen the first rollback on rights in 50 years,\u201d she says, pointing to a backbench attempt to reduce the legal time limit from 24 to 22 weeks in the dying months of the last Conservative government. But the Tory MP Miriam Cates \u2013 who once argued that dwindling fertility rates are \u201cthe one overarching threat\u201d to western society \u2013 lost her seat in July, while the Tory leadership favourite Kemi Badenoch says she isn\u2019t convinced governments can make women have babies. America\u2019s fate, however, still hangs by a thread, with a stark divide emerging particularly among the young: women for Harris, angry young men for Trump. Whether she wins or whether she loses in the coming election, it almost certainly won\u2019t be because (along with every other occupant of the Oval Office in history) Kamala Harris hasn\u2019t physically given birth.

The studio, Abi Morocco, was run by a husband-and-wife team, John and Funmilayo Abe, from the 1970s to 2006, and captured images of generations of Nigerians during decades in which the exponentially growing city became the unofficial street-style capital of Africa and the world. The picture is included in a new exhibition that traces the place of the staged portrait in that story \u2013 in the years before smartphones and Instagram rendered many high street studios obsolete.</p> <p>The exhibition is derived from an evolving project called <a href=\"https://www.karlohiri.com/lagos-studio-archives\">Lagos Studio Archives</a> that is the work of two artists and curators, Karl Ohiri and Riikka Kassinnen, which now involves the preservation of thousands of film negatives from that period. The project began when Ohiri, based in London, travelled to Owerri in southern Nigeria in 2015 to visit family. While he was there, he met a local portrait photographer and asked if he might look at his archive of images. The photographer told him that he had thrown out and destroyed all his negatives as they were taking up too much space. When Ohiri asked around other photographers, he often heard the same story. He raised funds from different foundations to create the archive project and preserve the negatives that remained.</p> <p>The Abi Morocco pictures are central to that project. The studio developed from a business begun by John Abe in the 1960s in which he travelled around Lagos on a bike advertising his portrait services. It took off when he met his wife, who had initially left school at primary level to follow her passion and vocation as a photographer. Together, for years, they documented in their subjects every shift in local style - which, as here, incorporated a range of traditional and pan-African influences, along with the occasional Hollywood inflection. John Abe died in June; Funmilayo retired in 2021, but continues to live near Lagos. </p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"https://autograph.org.uk/exhibitions/abi-morocco-photos-spirit-of-lagos\">Abi Morocco Photos: Spirit of Lagos</a> is at Autograph, London, until 22 March 2025</p>",

The picture is included in a new exhibition that traces the place of the staged portrait in that story \u2013 in the years before smartphones and Instagram rendered many high street studios obsolete. The exhibition is derived from an evolving project called Lagos Studio Archives that is the work of two artists and curators, Karl Ohiri and Riikka Kassinnen, which now involves the preservation of thousands of film negatives from that period. The project began when Ohiri, based in London, travelled to Owerri in southern Nigeria in 2015 to visit family. While he was there, he met a local portrait photographer and asked if he might look at his archive of images. The photographer told him that he had thrown out and destroyed all his negatives as they were taking up too much space. When Ohiri asked around other photographers, he often heard the same story. He raised funds from different foundations to create the archive project and preserve the negatives that remained. The Abi Morocco pictures are central to that project. The studio developed from a business begun by John Abe in the 1960s in which he travelled around Lagos on a bike advertising his portrait services. It took off when he met his wife, who had initially left school at primary level to follow her passion and vocation as a photographer. Together, for years, they documented in their subjects every shift in local style - which, as here, incorporated a range of traditional and pan-African influences, along with the occasional Hollywood inflection. John Abe died in June; Funmilayo retired in 2021, but continues to live near Lagos. \u2022 Abi Morocco Photos: Spirit of Lagos is at Autograph, London, until 22 March 2025",

Since 2010 Cadbury has belonged first to Kraft then after 2012, to Mondel\u0113z International, a US-based confectionery giant that still chooses to operate factories and pay taxes within Russia. In Ukraine Mondel\u0113z was designated, in 2023, an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/ukraine-govt-designates-mondelez-as-intl-war-sponsor-over-ongoing-business-in-russia/\">international sponsor of war</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Its chairman and chief executive, Dirk Van de Put, prefers to think of the Mondel\u0113z mission as \u201cempowering people to snack right\u201d. \u201cSnacking made right\u201d appears on every Mondel\u0113z International website, including its Russian language one. \u201cI remain humbled to advance the important work of Snacking Made Right for generations to come,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/803946-mondelez-2023-snacking-made-right-report-letter-chairman-ceo\">Van de Put concluded</a> a recent statement, which reported that the related practice of \u201cmindful snacking\u201d is \u201cbeing applied across our entire portfolio\u201d. Including at Cadbury, presumably. Learn from Mondel\u0113z how to \u201ceat with intention and attention\u201d. Or as it <a href=\"https://www.snackmindful.ru/#what-it-is\">calls the practice on its Russian-language page, </a>the collectable, limited-edition Cadbury 200th anniversary tin will remind you first of Mondel\u0113z International, then of Van de Put, and then, inexorably, of the international arrest warrant for Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.</p> <p>Given the risk informed consumers will conclude, having taken Van de Put\u2019s slogan to heart, that it can\u2019t be right to snack on products from a company whose taxes could have helped fund the killing of tens of thousands of Ukrainians, the abduction of their children and obliteration of their homes, a cheerful online history of Cadbury dwelling on the vision of the founding family, is probably right to omit Mondel\u0113z landmarks of the last few years. Cadbury\u2019s delight in generosity and \u201clovely stories\u201d (do you know about the Cadbury Secret Santa Postal Service?) might not be a great fit with the steadfast refusal by its owner, in the face of unending Russian murders and atrocities in Ukraine, to join other companies still divesting themselves, if only after long resistance, of assets in Russia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Van de Put has even argued, as if sales in Russia would amount to a humanitarian project, that biscuits were a \u2018breakfast item\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mindful Snacking hint: consider that just last week Russia added to its outrages, as the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/kharkiv-residents-describe-pure-horror-after-russian-attack-on-historic-derzhprom-building\">Guardian</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/kharkiv-residents-describe-pure-horror-after-russian-attack-on-historic-derzhprom-building\">\u2019s Luke Harding </a>reported, with another exercise in cultural vandalism: the bombing of the Derzhprom, a historic, Unesco-listed building in Kharkiv, which had survived the Second World War. Another report brought to light extensive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/carved-on-bodies-and-souls-russias-use-of-male-sexual-torture-in-ukraine\">previously unrecognised sexual torture</a> of captive Ukrainian men and boys.

Van de Put called the figures \u201crobust\u201d. </p> <p>On the <a href=\"https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain\">Yale university </a>website that tracks companies still refusing to leave Russia, more than 1,000 having now done so, Mondel\u0113z is categorised as \u201cbuying time\u201d. Its excuses for not quitting to date have included those familiar from like-minded time-buyers, of wanting to prevent the company being seized, or having its profits benefit a friend of Putin. Van de Put has even argued, as if their for-profit sales in Russia are a kind of humanitarian project, that <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-ceo-why-were-still-doing-business-in-russia-204049695.html\">biscuits are a \u201cbreakfast item\u201d</a>. It\u2019s not long since Unilever, whose brands include Marmite and Dove, was attempting equally feeble justifications. But earlier this month \u2013 two years and many tax contributions too late \u2013 Unilever, having avoided seizure, finally <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/unilever-completes-sale-russian-business-2024-10-10/#:~:text=Oct%2010%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Unilever,a%20%22complex%22%20sale%20process\">sold its Russian operation</a> to the Arnest Group. The French retailer Auchan is reportedly also close to an exit.</p> <p>What would it take to make Mondel\u0113z (and fellow stayers including PepsiCo and Nestl\u00e9) follow suit? While a Nordic boycott of Mondel\u0113z products, including the end of its royal supplier status in Sweden, has yet to bring about divestment, it was enough in 2023 to rattle the company\u2019s Europe president. In a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/mondelez-singled-out-boycott-over-russia-business-memo-2023-06-16/\">memo seen by Reuters</a>, he complained about \u201cbeing singled out and treated differently\u201d.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://b4ukraine.org/what-we-do/mondelez\">campaigners from </a>B4Ukraine have identified the potential of Cadbury, still in the Midlands and still trading on its enlightened, <a href=\"https://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/media/4lrf2oei/cadbury-family-factsheet.pdf\">originally Quaker values</a>, as another route to shaming the multifaceted multinational whose name (\u201cpronounced mohn-dah-LEEZ\u201d) was made up in 2012. It is asking for the revoking of a royal warrant awarded to Cadbury by the late queen, and, from the new mayor of the West Midlands, Richard Parker, a statement condemning Mondel\u0113z. \u201cThe values that build Cadbury,\u201d B4Ukraine reminds Parker, probably drawing on the glowing account provided by Cadbury World historians, \u201cvalues of community, fairness and pacificism \u2013 are not just history, they are principles that today are sorely in need of defending.\u201d</p> <p>Step forward, then, Van de Put and his mindful snacking, a&nbsp;technique, the company suggests, to \u201cbe practised anywhere, anytime and by anyone\u201d. The Cadbury Christmas range offers a host of opportunities for supporters of Ukraine to mindfully decide if they want to snack, especially in the season of peace and goodwill, on products distributed by a multinational whose tax revenues, however far away, are potentially funding the Russian invasion. Can&nbsp;you ever totally \u201c<a href=\"https://www.snackmindful.com/\">enjoy the moment</a>\u201d with an international sponsor of war?</p> <p>A Mondel\u0113z Cadbury advent calendar could prove, from many mindful perspectives, particularly troubling. Even a child\u2019s build-your-own Cadbury train with Oreo wheels might seem ineradicably contaminated, upon mindful consideration, by Van de Put-style business philosophy. Investors, he told the <em>FT</em> in February, do not \u201cmorally care\u201d if businesses stay in Russia. The general secretary of Wespath, a faith-based US investment company, promptly called Van de Put\u2019s statement \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wespath.org/News/Mondelez-Letter\">tin-eared and false</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In an earlier discussion of Mondel\u0113z\u2019s Russia options, in October 2022, Van de Put appeared to suggest that the war was not yet bad enough to occasion the company\u2019s withdrawal: \u201cif the situation gets worse, we might have to take other decisions\u201d. Two years on, a report from the UN high commissioner for human rights is headlined, \u201cWorsening impact on civilians of Russia\u2019s attack, torture of prisoners of war\u201d. Worsening enough to convince him? Or would it be simpler to change Mondel\u0113z\u2019s \u201cSnacking Made Right\u201d to something more closely resembling the truth?</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Its chairman and chief executive, Dirk Van de Put, prefers to think of the Mondel\u0113z mission as \u201cempowering people to snack right\u201d. \u201cSnacking made right\u201d appears on every Mondel\u0113z International website, including its Russian language one. \u201cI remain humbled to advance the important work of Snacking Made Right for generations to come,\u201d Van de Put concluded a recent statement, which reported that the related practice of \u201cmindful snacking\u201d is \u201cbeing applied across our entire portfolio\u201d. Including at Cadbury, presumably. Learn from Mondel\u0113z how to \u201ceat with intention and attention\u201d. Or as it calls the practice on its Russian-language page, the collectable, limited-edition Cadbury 200th anniversary tin will remind you first of Mondel\u0113z International, then of Van de Put, and then, inexorably, of the international arrest warrant for Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. Given the risk informed consumers will conclude, having taken Van de Put\u2019s slogan to heart, that it can\u2019t be right to snack on products from a company whose taxes could have helped fund the killing of tens of thousands of Ukrainians, the abduction of their children and obliteration of their homes, a cheerful online history of Cadbury dwelling on the vision of the founding family, is probably right to omit Mondel\u0113z landmarks of the last few years. Cadbury\u2019s delight in generosity and \u201clovely stories\u201d (do you know about the Cadbury Secret Santa Postal Service?) might not be a great fit with the steadfast refusal by its owner, in the face of unending Russian murders and atrocities in Ukraine, to join other companies still divesting themselves, if only after long resistance, of assets in Russia. Mindful Snacking hint: consider that just last week Russia added to its outrages, as the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding reported, with another exercise in cultural vandalism: the bombing of the Derzhprom, a historic, Unesco-listed building in Kharkiv, which had survived the Second World War. Another report brought to light extensive, previously unrecognised sexual torture of captive Ukrainian men and boys. Meanwhile, the Grocery Gazette reports a jump in Mondel\u0113z\u2019s third quarter profits. Van de Put called the figures \u201crobust\u201d. On the Yale university website that tracks companies still refusing to leave Russia, more than 1,000 having now done so, Mondel\u0113z is categorised as \u201cbuying time\u201d. Its excuses for not quitting to date have included those familiar from like-minded time-buyers, of wanting to prevent the company being seized, or having its profits benefit a friend of Putin. Van de Put has even argued, as if their for-profit sales in Russia are a kind of humanitarian project, that biscuits are a \u201cbreakfast item\u201d. It\u2019s not long since Unilever, whose brands include Marmite and Dove, was attempting equally feeble justifications. But earlier this month \u2013 two years and many tax contributions too late \u2013 Unilever, having avoided seizure, finally sold its Russian operation to the Arnest Group. The French retailer Auchan is reportedly also close to an exit. What would it take to make Mondel\u0113z (and fellow stayers including PepsiCo and Nestl\u00e9) follow suit? While a Nordic boycott of Mondel\u0113z products, including the end of its royal supplier status in Sweden, has yet to bring about divestment, it was enough in 2023 to rattle the company\u2019s Europe president. In a memo seen by Reuters, he complained about \u201cbeing singled out and treated differently\u201d. In the UK, campaigners from B4Ukraine have identified the potential of Cadbury, still in the Midlands and still trading on its enlightened, originally Quaker values, as another route to shaming the multifaceted multinational whose name (\u201cpronounced mohn-dah-LEEZ\u201d) was made up in 2012. It is asking for the revoking of a royal warrant awarded to Cadbury by the late queen, and, from the new mayor of the West Midlands, Richard Parker, a statement condemning Mondel\u0113z. \u201cThe values that build Cadbury,\u201d B4Ukraine reminds Parker, probably drawing on the glowing account provided by Cadbury World historians, \u201cvalues of community, fairness and pacificism \u2013 are not just history, they are principles that today are sorely in need of defending.\u201d Step forward, then, Van de Put and his mindful snacking, a technique, the company suggests, to \u201cbe practised anywhere, anytime and by anyone\u201d. The Cadbury Christmas range offers a host of opportunities for supporters of Ukraine to mindfully decide if they want to snack, especially in the season of peace and goodwill, on products distributed by a multinational whose tax revenues, however far away, are potentially funding the Russian invasion. Can you ever totally \u201cenjoy the moment\u201d with an international sponsor of war? A Mondel\u0113z Cadbury advent calendar could prove, from many mindful perspectives, particularly troubling. Even a child\u2019s build-your-own Cadbury train with Oreo wheels might seem ineradicably contaminated, upon mindful consideration, by Van de Put-style business philosophy. Investors, he told the FT in February, do not \u201cmorally care\u201d if businesses stay in Russia. The general secretary of Wespath, a faith-based US investment company, promptly called Van de Put\u2019s statement \u201ctin-eared and false\u201d. In an earlier discussion of Mondel\u0113z\u2019s Russia options, in October 2022, Van de Put appeared to suggest that the war was not yet bad enough to occasion the company\u2019s withdrawal: \u201cif the situation gets worse, we might have to take other decisions\u201d. Two years on, a report from the UN high commissioner for human rights is headlined, \u201cWorsening impact on civilians of Russia\u2019s attack, torture of prisoners of war\u201d. Worsening enough to convince him? Or would it be simpler to change Mondel\u0113z\u2019s \u201cSnacking Made Right\u201d to something more closely resembling the truth? \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Harris, hands folded, said: \u201cYou and me both, sister.\u201d Rudolph said: \u201cNice to see you, Kamala.\u201d Harris replied: \u201cIt is nice to see you, Kamala, and I\u2019m just here to remind you: you got this. Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors.\u201d This was a reference to Trump reaching towards, and appearing to miss, the door of a garbage truck during a recent stunt. \u201cI see what you did there,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cLike to a garbage truck, right?\u201d The actor then burst into an exaggerated cackle. Harris asked: \u201cI don\u2019t really laugh like that, do I?\u201d This was a near repeat of a line from a 2008 episode when Hillary Clinton, running in the Democratic presidential primary, appeared next to Amy Poehler, who played her with an over-the-top chortle. The real Clinton questioned: \u201cDo I really laugh like that?\u201d Rudolph then reached out, took Harris\u2019s hand and gave her a pep talk. \u201cNow Kamala, take my palm-ala. The American people want to stop the chaos \u2026 \u201d Harris rounded off: \u201cAnd end the drama-la.\u201d Rudolph: \u201cWith a cool new stepmom-ala. Get back in our pajama-las and watch a rom-com-ala.\u201d Harris: \u201cLike Legally Blonde-ala.\u201d Rudolph: \u201cAnd start decorating for Christmas, fa-la-la-la-la. Because what do we always say?\u201d The pair then said in unison: \u201cKeep calmala and carry on-a-la.\u201d Rudolph added: \u201cWe know each other so well we even finish each other\u2019s\u2026\u201d They said together: \u201cBelief in the promise of America.\u201d Rudolph and Harris then stood together. Rudolph said: \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for us.\u201d Harris replied: \u201cGreat. Any chance you are registered in Pennsylvania?\u201d \u2013 referring to a pivotal swing state in Tuesday\u2019s election. Rudolph admitted: \u201cNope, I am not.\u201d Harris mused: \u201cWell, worth a shot.\u201d Together they then delivered the show\u2019s signature line: \u201cAnd live from New York, it\u2019s Saturday night!\u201d Harris was making her first appearance on the show. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d she told reporters on the tarmac before flying to Detroit in the battleground state of Michigan. Saturday\u2019s episode also featured Tim Kaine, a senator for Virginia who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 running mate, performing in a skit where a contestant could not recall who Kaine was. The musical guest, Chappell Roan, announced in September that she is voting for Harris. Rudolph\u2019s performance has won critical acclaim, including from Harris herself. \u201cMaya Rudolph \u2013 I mean, she\u2019s so good,\u201d the vice-president said last month on ABC\u2019s The View. \u201cShe had the whole thing, the suit, the jewellery, everything!\u201d Harris follows a long line of politicians seeking to show a lighter side on Saturday Night Live, broadcast on the NBC network. The first sitting president to take part was Republican Gerald Ford, who made his debut a cold open in April 1976. Then-senator Barack Obama appeared alongside Poehler impersonating Clinton in 2007, and Republican Bob Dole was on the show in November 1996 \u2013 just 11 days after losing that year\u2019s election to Bill Clinton. In 2008 Tina Fey gave a memorable impression of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, joking that \u201cI can see Russia from my house\u201d. Palin herself appeared on the show in the weeks before the election. Trump hosted Saturday Night Live in 2015, drawing protests outside the studio, and poked fun at his tendency to exaggerate and steer clear of policy specifics. He also appeared in 2004.",

      "body": "<p>A global summit on halting the destruction of nature ended in disarray on Saturday, with some breakthroughs but key issues left unresolved.</p> <p>Governments have been meeting in Cali, Colombia, for the first time since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/19/cop15-historic-deal-signed-to-halt-biodiversity-loss-by-2030-aoe\">a 2022 deal to stop the human-caused destruction</a> of life on Earth. Countries hoped to make progress during the two-week summit on crucial targets such as protecting 30% of the Earth for nature and reforming parts of the global financial system that damage the environment.</p> <p>Negotiations were due to finish on Friday evening but ended in confusion on Saturday morning after almost 12 hours of talks. Governments failed to reach a consensus on key issues such as nature funding and how this decade\u2019s targets would be monitored. Many were forced to leave the talks early to catch flights, and negotiations were suspended at 8.30am when fewer than half of the countries were present, and the meeting lost quorum. Countries will need to continue the talks next year at an interim meeting in Bangkok.</p> <p>A number of countries expressed fury at the way the talks had been dragged out and the order of discussions, which left crucial issues undecided at the final hour.</p> <p>\u201cWe really question the lack of legitimacy of discussing such an important issue at the end of the Cop,\u201d the Brazilian negotiator Maria Angelica Ikeda said, shortly before discussions of resource mobilisation were cut off. \u201cWe should have started discussing these issues at the beginning \u2026 We should have decisions guaranteeing that we have the resources we need.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/31/alarm-grows-over-disturbing-lack-of-progress-revealed-at-biodiversity-summit-cop16\">Alarm grows over \u2018disturbing\u2019 lack of progress to save nature at Cop16</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The negotiator for Fiji, Michelle Baleikanacea, emphasised that many developing nations \u2013 who did not have budgets to change flight plans \u2013 were forced to abandon the meeting. \u201cUnfortunately Fiji is the only remaining Pacific island country present at this Cop \u2013 we came as a delegation of 10 and I am the only one left. We cannot afford to be changing flights because we don\u2019t have the funds,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>Governments were able to make some significant breakthroughs: they agreed on a global levy on products made using genetic data from nature, potentially creating one of the world\u2019s largest biodiversity conservation funds; and formally incorporated Indigenous communities in the official decision-making of the UN biodiversity process, in what negotiators described as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for indigenous representation.</p> <p>But while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/nature-biodiversity-genetic-digital-sequencing-information-dsi-biopiracy-cop16-aoe\">digital sequence information</a> (DSI) fund plan passed at the meeting, it was unclear whether there were enough countries still present to formalise the vote. If not, countries could question the legitimacy of the decision at a later date.</p> <p>Observers said that despite the agreements, Cop16 fell short of what was needed to halt the crisis in the natural world, warning that many governments and UN officials were not acting with the required urgency. They pointed to a lack of leadership from the EU, China, Canada and others who had played a leading role in helping to reach agreements on this decade\u2019s targets just two years ago.</p> <p>During the summit, it became clear that many countries were making weak or no progress on crucial aims such as reforming environmentally harmful subsidies, protected areas and even submitting national plans for meeting the targets.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw insufficient leadership from the wealthier countries, the European Union and France in particular, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, the UK, but also China. The executive secretary of the UN convention on biodiversity was also quite phantomatic,\u201d said Oscar Soria, director of thinktank the Common Initiative.</p> <p>Brian O\u2019Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature, said too many countries and UN officials came to Cali without the urgency and level of ambition needed.<strong> </strong>\u201cThe world doesn\u2019t have time for business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe suspension of the Cop without any agreed-upon finance strategy is alarming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe pace of Cop16 negotiations did not reflect the urgency of the crisis we are facing,\u201d said Catherine Weller, director of global policy at Fauna &amp; Flora.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/30/the-world-needs-700bn-a-year-to-restore-nature-but-where-is-the-money-coming-from\">The world needs $700bn a year to restore nature. But where is the money coming from?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDespite the hard-won breakthrough on creating a fund for profits from nature\u2019s genetic information and ongoing rhetoric about the urgency of scaling up finance for nature, there has not been significant headway made on how we will finance nature recovery, nor clarity on how we monitor progress at a global level. Two years on, the vast majority of nature targets agreed in Montreal regrettably currently still feel like unfunded words on paper,\u201d she said.</p> <h2><strong>What countries did \u2013 and didn\u2019t \u2013 deliver</strong></h2> <p><strong>Agree</strong><strong>ment to make companies share profits from commercial discoveries derived from nature\u2019s genetics</strong></p> <p>Genetic data from nature, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/nature-biodiversity-genetic-digital-sequencing-information-dsi-biopiracy-cop16-aoe\">Digital Sequence Information</a>, is playing an increased role in commercial drug and product discoveries. Much of this information has so far been accessed for free on global databases despite generating billions in revenue, infuriating the nature-rich countries from where the data originates. But this is expected to change.</p> <p>Companies that meet two of three criteria \u2013 sales of more than $50m (\u00a339m), profits of more than $5m, and $20m in total assets \u2013 will need to contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of their revenue to the DSI fund.</p> <p>While the deal is voluntary and national governments will need to introduce the rules domestically, some estimate that the fund could generate more than \u00a31bn a year for nature conservation.</p> <p>At least half of the money raised will flow to Indigenous communities and a portion will be dedicated to ensuring that developing countries benefit.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a significant step forward,\u201d said Pierre du Plessis, a veteran former negotiator from Namibia and a DSI expert.</p> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t help feeling we have missed a major opportunity to rally around a far more ambitious approach [to finance], which could mobilise resources at the scale urgently required.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Indigenous and local communities to have a permanent role in biodiversity decision-making</strong></p>    <p>For more than 20 years, Indigenous peoples and local communities have had an informal working group as part of the UN biodiversity process. This has been upgraded into a permanent body \u2013 meaning they can contribute to negotiations without being reliant on the goodwill of governments.</p> <p>This is the first time a UN environment body has made this decision. Jennifer \u201cJing\u201d Corpuz, a lead negotiator for the International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity (IIFB), called it \u201cwatershed moment in the history of multilateral environmental agreements\u201d.</p> <p>Local communities are defined as groups of people who have a long association with the land or water they live on, and the text includes mention of the rights of afro-descendant people, which refers to people of African descent living in the Americas often as a result of slavery. </p> <p><strong>No strategy for raising $200bn a year to finance nature conservation</strong></p> <p>One of Cop16\u2019s priorities was to implement a strategy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/30/the-world-needs-700bn-a-year-to-restore-nature-but-where-is-the-money-coming-from\">raising money to fund nature protection</a>. In 2022, countries had committed to raising $200bn a year by 2030, including $20bn to be given by richer countries to developing countries by 2025. It failed to do so.</p> <p>Bernadette Fischler Hooper, global advocacy lead at WWF, said the lack of progress was \u201creally disappointing\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s a real anticlimax. I\u2019ve been here for three weeks and it\u2019s kind of ended in a little dust cloud,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Throughout talks, developing nations raised concerns that wealthy countries were not going to deliver on their $20bn promise, given that the deadline is just two months away. During final discussions, delegates from countries in the global south made impassioned speeches about the limited resources they have to protect biodiversity.</p> <p>\u201cThis Cop has neither delivered that additional funding nor given us confidence that governments will work together to deliver it in a transparent and urgent manner,\u201d said Jiwoh Abdulai, minister of environment and climate change from Sierra Leone. \u201cGovernments have shown time and time again that they can materialise the funds needed when they want \u2013 be that for pandemics or wars. Why then can they not materialise it to fight the greatest existential threat we face?\u201d</p> <p>Developing countries \u2013 especially the Africa group and Brazil \u2013 had demanded a new \u201cfinance mechanism\u201d to distribute biodiversity finance. They argue that the current fund \u2013 which sits within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) \u2013 is too burdensome to access and controlled by wealthy nations. This remains unresolved.</p> <p>The meeting also ran out of time to approve the Convention on Biological Diversity budget for the next two years.</p> <p><strong>No plan for how biodiversity targets will be monitored</strong></p> <p>Governments failed at Cop16 to sign off on how this decade\u2019s targets would be monitored, something that was underscored as a key priority before the summit. After 23 targets and four goals were agreed upon at Cop15 in Montreal two years ago, it remains undecided how progress to meeting them will be officially tracked.</p> <p>The world has never met a target on halting the destruction of nature, and several vague aims were blamed for a lack of progress on the last decade\u2019s deal. It is understood that most countries are in agreement on the draft monitoring framework for the deal but were unable to sign off on it after they ran out of time while discussing other more divisive topics.</p>",

Countries hoped to make progress during the two-week summit on crucial targets such as protecting 30% of the Earth for nature and reforming parts of the global financial system that damage the environment. Negotiations were due to finish on Friday evening but ended in confusion on Saturday morning after almost 12 hours of talks. Governments failed to reach a consensus on key issues such as nature funding and how this decade\u2019s targets would be monitored. Many were forced to leave the talks early to catch flights, and negotiations were suspended at 8.30am when fewer than half of the countries were present, and the meeting lost quorum. Countries will need to continue the talks next year at an interim meeting in Bangkok. A number of countries expressed fury at the way the talks had been dragged out and the order of discussions, which left crucial issues undecided at the final hour. \u201cWe really question the lack of legitimacy of discussing such an important issue at the end of the Cop,\u201d the Brazilian negotiator Maria Angelica Ikeda said, shortly before discussions of resource mobilisation were cut off. \u201cWe should have started discussing these issues at the beginning \u2026 We should have decisions guaranteeing that we have the resources we need.\u201d The negotiator for Fiji, Michelle Baleikanacea, emphasised that many developing nations \u2013 who did not have budgets to change flight plans \u2013 were forced to abandon the meeting. \u201cUnfortunately Fiji is the only remaining Pacific island country present at this Cop \u2013 we came as a delegation of 10 and I am the only one left. We cannot afford to be changing flights because we don\u2019t have the funds,\u201d she said. Governments were able to make some significant breakthroughs: they agreed on a global levy on products made using genetic data from nature, potentially creating one of the world\u2019s largest biodiversity conservation funds; and formally incorporated Indigenous communities in the official decision-making of the UN biodiversity process, in what negotiators described as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for indigenous representation. But while the digital sequence information (DSI) fund plan passed at the meeting, it was unclear whether there were enough countries still present to formalise the vote. If not, countries could question the legitimacy of the decision at a later date. Observers said that despite the agreements, Cop16 fell short of what was needed to halt the crisis in the natural world, warning that many governments and UN officials were not acting with the required urgency. They pointed to a lack of leadership from the EU, China, Canada and others who had played a leading role in helping to reach agreements on this decade\u2019s targets just two years ago. During the summit, it became clear that many countries were making weak or no progress on crucial aims such as reforming environmentally harmful subsidies, protected areas and even submitting national plans for meeting the targets. \u201cWe saw insufficient leadership from the wealthier countries, the European Union and France in particular, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, the UK, but also China. The executive secretary of the UN convention on biodiversity was also quite phantomatic,\u201d said Oscar Soria, director of thinktank the Common Initiative. Brian O\u2019Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature, said too many countries and UN officials came to Cali without the urgency and level of ambition needed. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t have time for business as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe suspension of the Cop without any agreed-upon finance strategy is alarming.\u201d \u201cThe pace of Cop16 negotiations did not reflect the urgency of the crisis we are facing,\u201d said Catherine Weller, director of global policy at Fauna &amp; Flora. \u201cDespite the hard-won breakthrough on creating a fund for profits from nature\u2019s genetic information and ongoing rhetoric about the urgency of scaling up finance for nature, there has not been significant headway made on how we will finance nature recovery, nor clarity on how we monitor progress at a global level. Two years on, the vast majority of nature targets agreed in Montreal regrettably currently still feel like unfunded words on paper,\u201d she said. What countries did \u2013 and didn\u2019t \u2013 deliver Agreement to make companies share profits from commercial discoveries derived from nature\u2019s genetics Genetic data from nature, known as Digital Sequence Information, is playing an increased role in commercial drug and product discoveries. Much of this information has so far been accessed for free on global databases despite generating billions in revenue, infuriating the nature-rich countries from where the data originates. But this is expected to change. Companies that meet two of three criteria \u2013 sales of more than $50m (\u00a339m), profits of more than $5m, and $20m in total assets \u2013 will need to contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of their revenue to the DSI fund. While the deal is voluntary and national governments will need to introduce the rules domestically, some estimate that the fund could generate more than \u00a31bn a year for nature conservation. At least half of the money raised will flow to Indigenous communities and a portion will be dedicated to ensuring that developing countries benefit. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant step forward,\u201d said Pierre du Plessis, a veteran former negotiator from Namibia and a DSI expert. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help feeling we have missed a major opportunity to rally around a far more ambitious approach [to finance], which could mobilise resources at the scale urgently required.\u201d Indigenous and local communities to have a permanent role in biodiversity decision-making For more than 20 years, Indigenous peoples and local communities have had an informal working group as part of the UN biodiversity process. This has been upgraded into a permanent body \u2013 meaning they can contribute to negotiations without being reliant on the goodwill of governments. This is the first time a UN environment body has made this decision. Jennifer \u201cJing\u201d Corpuz, a lead negotiator for the International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity (IIFB), called it \u201cwatershed moment in the history of multilateral environmental agreements\u201d. Local communities are defined as groups of people who have a long association with the land or water they live on, and the text includes mention of the rights of afro-descendant people, which refers to people of African descent living in the Americas often as a result of slavery. No strategy for raising $200bn a year to finance nature conservation One of Cop16\u2019s priorities was to implement a strategy for raising money to fund nature protection. In 2022, countries had committed to raising $200bn a year by 2030, including $20bn to be given by richer countries to developing countries by 2025. It failed to do so. Bernadette Fischler Hooper, global advocacy lead at WWF, said the lack of progress was \u201creally disappointing\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s a real anticlimax. I\u2019ve been here for three weeks and it\u2019s kind of ended in a little dust cloud,\u201d she said. Throughout talks, developing nations raised concerns that wealthy countries were not going to deliver on their $20bn promise, given that the deadline is just two months away. During final discussions, delegates from countries in the global south made impassioned speeches about the limited resources they have to protect biodiversity. \u201cThis Cop has neither delivered that additional funding nor given us confidence that governments will work together to deliver it in a transparent and urgent manner,\u201d said Jiwoh Abdulai, minister of environment and climate change from Sierra Leone. \u201cGovernments have shown time and time again that they can materialise the funds needed when they want \u2013 be that for pandemics or wars. Why then can they not materialise it to fight the greatest existential threat we face?\u201d Developing countries \u2013 especially the Africa group and Brazil \u2013 had demanded a new \u201cfinance mechanism\u201d to distribute biodiversity finance. They argue that the current fund \u2013 which sits within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) \u2013 is too burdensome to access and controlled by wealthy nations. This remains unresolved. The meeting also ran out of time to approve the Convention on Biological Diversity budget for the next two years. No plan for how biodiversity targets will be monitored Governments failed at Cop16 to sign off on how this decade\u2019s targets would be monitored, something that was underscored as a key priority before the summit. After 23 targets and four goals were agreed upon at Cop15 in Montreal two years ago, it remains undecided how progress to meeting them will be officially tracked. The world has never met a target on halting the destruction of nature, and several vague aims were blamed for a lack of progress on the last decade\u2019s deal. It is understood that most countries are in agreement on the draft monitoring framework for the deal but were unable to sign off on it after they ran out of time while discussing other more divisive topics.",

During such turbulent times, many individuals feel lost and fearful. It\u2019s a natural response to crave solid ground in an effort to gain a sense of clarity amid the chaos.</p> <p>Historically, this craving for certainty has often led people to seek out leaders and ideologies that offer simple, definitive answers. One stark example is the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1930s Germany. After the First World War and during the economic disaster of the Great Depression, Germany was in turmoil. Many people were desperate for an explanation for their suffering and a promise of better days. Hitler offered a clear, simple narrative: Germany\u2019s problems could be blamed on particular groups, such as Jews, and his authoritarian vision was presented as a path back to strength and stability. This example illustrates a fundamental human tendency: when life feels precarious, many people are drawn to ideologies that provide certainty \u2013 even if those ideologies are hateful and destructive.</p> <p>The philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/hannah-arendt\">Hannah Arendt</a> observed that people are often drawn to these movements, because they provide a sense of belonging and a framework that makes the world feel less chaotic. Arendt argued that those who feel isolated or alienated are particularly vulnerable to joining movements that promise solidarity and a clear division between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. This division simplifies the world into good and evil, allowing people to feel that their suffering has a clear cause and that a solution is possible, even if it means scapegoating others or even genocide.</p> <p>Your friend\u2019s embrace of conspiracy theories seems to be a modern manifestation of this same desire for certainty. By aligning himself with right-wing narratives, he has constructed a worldview that feels predictable and ordered. His admiration for figures who present themselves as \u201cstrong\u201d, decisive leaders will be tied to his need for clear, unambiguous answers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If your friend were to entertain other perspectives, it would leave him vulnerable to the fear he is trying to avoid</p> <footer> <cite>Philippa Perry</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is easier to believe that there is a hidden, malevolent force controlling events than to accept that randomness and chaos are part of life.

      "body": "<p><strong>Mauby, 1 Harefield Road, London SE4 1LW (<a href=\"https://www.maubybrockley.com/\">maubybrockley.com</a>). All dishes \u00a34-\u00a310, wines from \u00a318, all cocktails \u00a310</strong></p> <p>A few weeks ago, I wrote one long, wretched primal scream about the terrible insult to the words \u201chot dog\u201d that I had to eat at Harrods in your service. If you were worried about me after that, and I understand you might have been, you can now relax. For here I am at Mauby, a new Caribbean restaurant in Brockley, southeast London, and the first plate before us is a single, fat smoked sausage with exactly the right crisp-skinned snap and the correct smooth, juicy interior that I had hoped for. With it are pickles and a yellow Bajan pepper sauce full of heat and vinegar and vigour. It was everything I hoped it would be. This one dish sent all the bad memories packing.</p> <p>There are many ways to get to Mauby, not least by foot if you are lucky enough to live within a smoke and allspice-sniff of the place. I took the overground from Highbury &amp; Islington, a train route which in February was renamed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/15/angry-tories-windrush-line-woke-rail-routes-suffragette\">Windrush Line</a> by Transport for London. The new title has not been entirely without controversy. Some saw it as a mere gesture. There are, they say, still too many people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean from the 40s onwards, who suffered as part of the Windrush scandal for which Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/uk-still-uncertain-about-windrush-era-deportations\">apologised,</a> and who are still awaiting justice, be it for wrongful imprisonment, deportation or infringement of legal rights.</p>    <p>It\u2019s a fair point. But the renaming has also been taken by many as a tribute to the contribution made by people from the islands to the capital, as it trundles through Afro-Caribbean communities from Dalston in the north of London to Peckham in the southeast. It makes it an appropriate way to arrive at this wine bar and bistro celebrating the food of Jamaica and Barbados. Given the power of cocktails often made with an awful lot of rum, it helps that it\u2019s merely a three-minute stagger from restaurant door to platform. My first drink is a cocktail made with the sweet sharpness of sorrel and lime, lending a briskness to a good measure of that Jamaican Wray &amp; Nephew rum. The evening has begun.</p>    <p>Mauby, which is the name of a Caribbean drink made from tree bark, belongs to Daniel Maynard, who has both Barbadian and Jamaican heritage, and his partner Heleena. It began life as a mildly restless project called <a href=\"https://www.jerkoffbbq.com/\">Jerk Off BBQ</a>. It is tempting to suggest with a knowing wink, that you should be careful before looking that up online, but I got to the 15th<sup> </sup>page of a Google search without finding anything not related to smoke, sauce or dry rubs of an entirely innocent kind. For a few years they worked out of a unit in Deptford and ran a street-food operation, building a fanbase, before crowdfunding to convert this old chippy. You can see where the money hasn\u2019t gone. It is a simple, warm, bare-bones space. There\u2019s a paprika-coloured frontage framing half net-curtained windows. There\u2019s a nailed-together wooden bar upon which sits a bowl heaped with oranges. There are rough-textured walls, wooden tables and, as evening falls, the gutter of a few candles.</p>    <p>It is a conscious reframing of the food of the islands. I live in Brixton and have long been a fan of the neighbourhood\u2019s takeaways: simple places like Brompton Jerk Kitchen which operates most Saturdays in the alley out the back of a caf\u00e9 opposite Brockwell Park, serving crusty slabs of crackled jerk pork fresh off the drum BBQ, or the cult <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maureensbrixtonkitchen/?hl=en\">Maureen\u2019s Kitchen</a> round the corner from me on Railton Road, who literally cooks in her domestic kitchen, and delivers her food in boxes of pure cardboard.</p> <p>Through familiarity and repetition, we assume that\u2019s how it must always be with this food, but the Maynards are rightly determined to show there are other ways; that it cannot and should not be overlooked. Mauby offers a short, impressively cheap menu of small plates, plus a few well-chosen wines and cocktails. Alongside the \u00a38 sausage of my dreams, there\u2019s a \u00a36 bowl of their beans stewed \u201chomestyle\u201d in a thumping gravy. If that\u2019s the style of their home, I want to move in. It\u2019s the sort of comfort food that would make any bad day better. From the lighter and brighter side of the ledger there is a Bajan cucumber salad, sparky with Scotch bonnet, fragrant with chopped green herbs, sprightly with vinegar. Or have the heritage tomato salad, a platter of well-dressed discs in yellow, red and purple, topped with a couple of fat, meaty sardines, silver-skinned, brown-fleshed and deeply flavoured. A bowl of crispy new potatoes with garlic mayo is a cheery accompaniment, although it feels like an interloper from a different small plates restaurant.</p>    <p>The most expensive dish tonight costs a mighty \u00a310. It is a heavily sauced jerk chicken thigh and drumstick, with a properly crunchy blackened skin, and a big old hit of pimento and mace. It\u2019s easy to assume this would always be part of the repertoire. Not so. A new menu was introduced just a week or so after I ate there, and jerk chicken isn\u2019t on it. That new menu includes charred pumpkin with Bajan tamarind sauce, crispy okra with pepper mayo, home-style stewed pork \u2013 that home really is sounding inviting \u2013 fried sprats with lemon and braised butter beans. The message is this: you should park your assumptions about what must be available at such a place. Having given one list of dishes a complete shake down, I\u2019d happily do the same with the other. The only constant amid the savouries is the carbohydrate ballast of plantain, served in a bronzed, fried heap. I confess plantain has never done it for me. It\u2019s an acquired taste that I have never quite acquired. I accept that I may be the one missing out here.</p>    <p>Dessert is handled by a plate of rum-sodden chocolate truffles, which are so soft they\u2019re almost a dark ganache being held together only by a thick cocoa dusting and politeness. This is not a complaint. On an early Friday evening, Mauby has exactly the vibe you want of it: relaxed, mellow and bubbling with end-of-week chatter. It feels like a new business that has worked out what it needs to be from the very start. On the short walk back to the station I come across a chap tending to a smoky barbecue beneath a street corner tree. He\u2019s offering more jerk chicken to the Friday night crowd. I conclude I rather like Brockley.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>After 14 years, James Robb and Alan Kilpatrick, the impeccably tasteful duo behind the East Pier Smokehouse in St Monan\u2019s, Fife, are calling it a day. But they are determined that the much-loved seasonal restaurant, famed for serving lobster and chips and seafood curries in cardboard containers, should not just become another fish and chip shop. In short, they are looking for successors. As Robb says, \u2018A busy restaurant needs fit, young creative people with a passion for food and hard work. We have plenty of passion, but youth and fitness are slipping away. It\u2019s torch passing time.\u2019 If running a bare-bones seafood restaurant on the Scottish east coast is calling to you, you\u2019re invited to email them for more information (<a href=\"mailto:info@eastpier.co.uk\">info@eastpier.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>The staff of Gloria Trattoria, part of the Big Mamma Group, are staging a dinner to raise funds to help save Casa Italiana, the social club which has served London\u2019s Italian community in Clerkenwell since 1960 and which is now under threat from rising costs and falling membership.

I live in Brixton and have long been a fan of the neighbourhood\u2019s takeaways: simple places like Brompton Jerk Kitchen which operates most Saturdays in the alley out the back of a caf\u00e9 opposite Brockwell Park, serving crusty slabs of crackled jerk pork fresh off the drum BBQ, or the cult Maureen\u2019s Kitchen round the corner from me on Railton Road, who literally cooks in her domestic kitchen, and delivers her food in boxes of pure cardboard. Through familiarity and repetition, we assume that\u2019s how it must always be with this food, but the Maynards are rightly determined to show there are other ways; that it cannot and should not be overlooked. Mauby offers a short, impressively cheap menu of small plates, plus a few well-chosen wines and cocktails. Alongside the \u00a38 sausage of my dreams, there\u2019s a \u00a36 bowl of their beans stewed \u201chomestyle\u201d in a thumping gravy. If that\u2019s the style of their home, I want to move in. It\u2019s the sort of comfort food that would make any bad day better. From the lighter and brighter side of the ledger there is a Bajan cucumber salad, sparky with Scotch bonnet, fragrant with chopped green herbs, sprightly with vinegar. Or have the heritage tomato salad, a platter of well-dressed discs in yellow, red and purple, topped with a couple of fat, meaty sardines, silver-skinned, brown-fleshed and deeply flavoured. A bowl of crispy new potatoes with garlic mayo is a cheery accompaniment, although it feels like an interloper from a different small plates restaurant. The most expensive dish tonight costs a mighty \u00a310. It is a heavily sauced jerk chicken thigh and drumstick, with a properly crunchy blackened skin, and a big old hit of pimento and mace. It\u2019s easy to assume this would always be part of the repertoire. Not so. A new menu was introduced just a week or so after I ate there, and jerk chicken isn\u2019t on it. That new menu includes charred pumpkin with Bajan tamarind sauce, crispy okra with pepper mayo, home-style stewed pork \u2013 that home really is sounding inviting \u2013 fried sprats with lemon and braised butter beans. The message is this: you should park your assumptions about what must be available at such a place. Having given one list of dishes a complete shake down, I\u2019d happily do the same with the other. The only constant amid the savouries is the carbohydrate ballast of plantain, served in a bronzed, fried heap. I confess plantain has never done it for me. It\u2019s an acquired taste that I have never quite acquired. I accept that I may be the one missing out here. Dessert is handled by a plate of rum-sodden chocolate truffles, which are so soft they\u2019re almost a dark ganache being held together only by a thick cocoa dusting and politeness. This is not a complaint. On an early Friday evening, Mauby has exactly the vibe you want of it: relaxed, mellow and bubbling with end-of-week chatter. It feels like a new business that has worked out what it needs to be from the very start. On the short walk back to the station I come across a chap tending to a smoky barbecue beneath a street corner tree. He\u2019s offering more jerk chicken to the Friday night crowd. I conclude I rather like Brockley. News bites After 14 years, James Robb and Alan Kilpatrick, the impeccably tasteful duo behind the East Pier Smokehouse in St Monan\u2019s, Fife, are calling it a day. But they are determined that the much-loved seasonal restaurant, famed for serving lobster and chips and seafood curries in cardboard containers, should not just become another fish and chip shop. In short, they are looking for successors. As Robb says, \u2018A busy restaurant needs fit, young creative people with a passion for food and hard work. We have plenty of passion, but youth and fitness are slipping away. It\u2019s torch passing time.\u2019 If running a bare-bones seafood restaurant on the Scottish east coast is calling to you, you\u2019re invited to email them for more information (info@eastpier.co.uk). The staff of Gloria Trattoria, part of the Big Mamma Group, are staging a dinner to raise funds to help save Casa Italiana, the social club which has served London\u2019s Italian community in Clerkenwell since 1960 and which is now under threat from rising costs and falling membership. Tickets for the four-course dinner, which is taking place at the club on 14 November, cost \u00a360. Find details of the menu and buy tickets here. Recently, I announced the closure of Caf\u00e9 Kitty at the Underbelly Boulevard Theatre in Soho. Now comes news of its replacement. Peckham stalwarts Artusi have just opened Artusi Soho there, serving seasonal Italian dishes, including a pre-theatre menu of two courses for \u00a325 and three for \u00a330.

Sunday me time? I have my children with me for half of my Sundays. The other half, it\u2019s just me and Sally [Hodgkiss]. We tend not to get out of bed, really. There will be some eating, cups of tea, reading. We\u2019ll watch nonsense on YouTube or play Mario Kart. Intermittent with that, we\u2019ll throw each other around for hours on end. Sunday nookie! One of the nice things about getting older is that you are more aware of how the machinery works. Once I split from my ex-wife, I thought: \u2018Hang on, I\u2019ve been locked into one service provider. Maybe I could broaden this out.\u2019 Then when I met Sally, we thought: \u2018Great, what are we doing with clothes on?\u2019 Rufus Hound\u2019s Lore is available to watch at home on digital streaming and download now",

And it is here, on ground set aside for the construction of a long-awaited Holocaust museum, that Germany\u2019s head of state, Frank\u2013Walter Steinmeier, last week launched an emotionally fraught three-day visit, declaring: \u201cAnyone who stands and speaks here as German president is filled with shame.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/archive-2-zip/giv-4559U25E3CBIMfr7/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/archive-2-zip/giv-4559U25E3CBIMfr7/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The eight-storey, octagonal-shaped Holocaust museum has been branded the most important behemoth to be erected in Thessaloniki since the second world war.</p> <p>Construction workers have been laying its foundations since the year began, with the building due to be completed in 2026. Germany was the first to commit \u20ac10m in funds. \u201cFinally it\u2019s happening,\u201d says David Saltiel, who heads <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/30/thessalonikis-jews-we-cant-let-this-be-forgotten-if-its-forgotten-it-will-die\">Thessaloniki\u2019s now vastly diminished Jewish community</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited for this for so many years.\u201d</p> <p>More than 80 years have passed since the Third Reich\u2019s war machine orchestrated the death convoys that would see an estimated 50,000 of the city\u2019s men, women and children killed in Nazi concentration camps. It was a loss of life that destroyed one of the great centres of European Jewry \u2013 about 90% of Thessaloniki\u2019s population was eradicated \u2013 paralleled only by Poland, where similar mortality rates also occurred. Before the Nazi occupation, Salonika, as it was then called, had been known as the \u201cMother of Israel\u201d, a reflection of the community\u2019s ancient roots in a Balkan metropolis where Jews far outnumbered Christians well after its incorporation into the Kingdom of Greece in 1912.</p> <p>Most were Ladino-speaking Sephardic Jews who had settled in the trading port after their expulsion from Spain in the 15th century. Elsewhere, about 17,000 perished, ensuring that as much as 90% of Greece\u2019s total prewar Jewish population fell victim to the \u201cfinal solution\u201d.</p> <p>For Saltiel, a straight-talking businessman who has headed Greece\u2019s central board of Jewish communities for 25 years, the Holocaust museum is long overdue. Replacing a small if resplendent Jewish museum that opened its doors in 2001, it will, he believes, finally allow a \u201cwound to be healed\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cI feel I am the voice of all those Jews who were put on trains, with no one stopping them and everyone looking,\u201d he says, visibly shaken as his own voice rises a little. \u201cAs the generation after the Holocaust, we have a responsibility to speak on behalf of those who could not say anything.\u201d</p> <p>News of the museum has come not a moment too soon for Lola Hassid Angel, among the few survivors still alive in Greece. A feisty great-grandmother, the 88-year-old still vividly recalls being deported with her parents, both Spanish passport holders, on one of the last trains to leave Athens, where her family had fled earlier in the occupation from Thessaloniki.</p> <p>It was April 1944 \u2013 three years after the Wehrmacht marched into the Greek capital \u2013 and their destination was the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen. It was mooted that there they, and other \u201cforeign Jews\u201d, would be exchanged with German prisoners of war, a plan quashed by the D-day landings a month later.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the train journey very well. It was terrible, the smell, the stench, the people crying. And my father taking me, then barely six years old, in his arms and putting me up to an opening [in the freight car] and saying in French: \u2018Breathe Lola, take in the fresh air\u2019,\u201d she tells the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>They were things, she said, that were impossible to forgive or forget.</p> <p>\u201cThey stole my childhood. There are memories that can never be erased. They took away my seven uncles and eight aunts, and all their children and, in the end, Thessaloniki, which we would never go back to.</p> <p>\u201cBut I beat Hitler because I managed to have a big family, and I hope to live long enough to see this Holocaust museum, which, of course, should have happened long ago.\u201d</p> <p>For Saltiel, the delay is testimony \u201cto the silence\u201d that has haunted Sephardic communities in Greece.</p> <p>By the time the first death train left Thessaloniki on 15 March 1943, German bureaucrats had mastered the art of mass murder that underpinned the racial restructuring envisaged by the Nazi regime. But the silence of those who looked on as Thessaloniki\u2019s Jews were shunted into ghettoes and then deported was also deafening.</p> <p>In sharp contrast to Athens and other parts of Greece, where the Orthodox Church, resistance fighters and leftists rallied to hide Jews, in Thessaloniki the community was left to fend for itself.</p> <p>Fewer than 2,000 survived. Those who returned invariably encountered a city whose inhabitants were not only overwhelmingly Christian but reluctant to face the horrors at all.</p> <p>\u201cIn Thessaloniki silence prevailed,\u201d explains Saltiel, estimating the city\u2019s community today at around 1,000. \u201cThe majority did not want to talk about what happened, and certainly not about what did not happen.\u201d</p> <p>The 9,000-sq ft museum is not only a belated tribute to those who suffered in Thessaloniki at the hands of the Nazis and their collaborators. It will also celebrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/23/brief-history-german-greek-relations\">the history of Greek Jewry</a>, including the 39 other Jewish communities that, prewar, were dotted around Greece and, it is hoped, be an educational hub and human rights centre at a time when hard-right parties and Holocaust deniers are resurfacing and gaining momentum across Europe.</p>    <p>Greece\u2019s centre-right government, which has sought to improve ties with Israel despite mounting disquiet over its actions in the Middle East, has pledged to contribute \u20ac18m. A further \u20ac10m will come from the Stavros Niarchos philanthropic foundation while Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, will commit $1m in prize money received for the discovery of an effective Covid vaccine. Bourla was born in Thessaloniki to Jewish parents who narrowly survived the Holocaust.</p> <p>Yet all agree that had it not been for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/dec/30/tattooed-mayor-thessaloniki-greece-yiannis-boutaris\">Yiannis Boutaris</a>, the city\u2019s charismatic former mayor, the museum, even at this stage, might still not exist. A prominent wine-maker who went into local politics to \u201cgive back to the community\u201d, Boutaris was bent on opening up Thessaloniki and highlighting its Jewish and Ottoman Muslim heritage.</p> <p>By reviving its once fabled multicultural past, the progressive businessman stated bluntly that he hoped to tackle the blatant antisemitism that, for years, had stalked socially conservative northern Greece. Central to that was a proper Holocaust museum. Under his stewardship, a site was found and permits signed.</p> <p>\u201cBoutaris was unique because he didn\u2019t care about the political cost, and that really helped break taboos in a place where so many pretended the Holocaust never happened,\u201d says Giorgos Antoniou, assistant professor of Jewish studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.</p> <p>Now 82, the tattooed, chain-smoking Boutaris regards the venture as one of his greatest achievements. On being sworn into office for a second time in 2014, he donned a yellow star to show far-right municipal councillors from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/03/golden-dawn-the-rise-and-fall-of-greece-neo-nazi-trial\">now defunct neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party</a> that he meant business.</p> <p>\u201cWherever I went I\u2019d be asked, \u2018why do you want this museum?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThere was push-back, for sure. With the Holocaust, Thessaloniki lost its future. All the good merchants, bankers and academics were Jewish. It was a huge loss.\u201d</p> <p>Five years on, Boutaris shakes his head in disbelief that there is still so much to do. A memorial park he had planned to create in Eleftherias [Freedom] Square, the plaza where thousands of Jewish men were first rounded up in 1942, remains a car park because his successor refused to sign off on the project. As a result, the city\u2019s Holocaust memorial stands nearby on the corner of a busy intersection, half hidden by trees.</p> <p>Even worse, he says, was the decision to build the University of Thessaloniki over an ancient Jewish cemetery. \u201cFor a long time, there was no sign or monument on the site, just as there are no signs to suggest that there were once 30 synagogues in this town before all but one was destroyed by the Nazis.\u201d</p> <p>But Boutaris is optimistic. Plans to transform Freedom Square into a memorial park with the Holocaust memorial sculpture as its centrepiece have been resurrected. And the new museum itself, he says, will not fail to impress. \u201cThere are Holocaust museums all over the world but none have been dedicated solely to the history and culture of Sephardic Jews in this part of the world. And none will tell their story like this.\u201d</p>",

And it is here, on ground set aside for the construction of a long-awaited Holocaust museum, that Germany\u2019s head of state, Frank\u2013Walter Steinmeier, last week launched an emotionally fraught three-day visit, declaring: \u201cAnyone who stands and speaks here as German president is filled with shame.\u201d The eight-storey, octagonal-shaped Holocaust museum has been branded the most important behemoth to be erected in Thessaloniki since the second world war. Construction workers have been laying its foundations since the year began, with the building due to be completed in 2026. Germany was the first to commit \u20ac10m in funds. \u201cFinally it\u2019s happening,\u201d says David Saltiel, who heads Thessaloniki\u2019s now vastly diminished Jewish community. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited for this for so many years.\u201d More than 80 years have passed since the Third Reich\u2019s war machine orchestrated the death convoys that would see an estimated 50,000 of the city\u2019s men, women and children killed in Nazi concentration camps. It was a loss of life that destroyed one of the great centres of European Jewry \u2013 about 90% of Thessaloniki\u2019s population was eradicated \u2013 paralleled only by Poland, where similar mortality rates also occurred. Before the Nazi occupation, Salonika, as it was then called, had been known as the \u201cMother of Israel\u201d, a reflection of the community\u2019s ancient roots in a Balkan metropolis where Jews far outnumbered Christians well after its incorporation into the Kingdom of Greece in 1912. Most were Ladino-speaking Sephardic Jews who had settled in the trading port after their expulsion from Spain in the 15th century. Elsewhere, about 17,000 perished, ensuring that as much as 90% of Greece\u2019s total prewar Jewish population fell victim to the \u201cfinal solution\u201d. For Saltiel, a straight-talking businessman who has headed Greece\u2019s central board of Jewish communities for 25 years, the Holocaust museum is long overdue. Replacing a small if resplendent Jewish museum that opened its doors in 2001, it will, he believes, finally allow a \u201cwound to be healed\u201d. \u201cI feel I am the voice of all those Jews who were put on trains, with no one stopping them and everyone looking,\u201d he says, visibly shaken as his own voice rises a little. \u201cAs the generation after the Holocaust, we have a responsibility to speak on behalf of those who could not say anything.\u201d News of the museum has come not a moment too soon for Lola Hassid Angel, among the few survivors still alive in Greece. A feisty great-grandmother, the 88-year-old still vividly recalls being deported with her parents, both Spanish passport holders, on one of the last trains to leave Athens, where her family had fled earlier in the occupation from Thessaloniki. It was April 1944 \u2013 three years after the Wehrmacht marched into the Greek capital \u2013 and their destination was the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen. It was mooted that there they, and other \u201cforeign Jews\u201d, would be exchanged with German prisoners of war, a plan quashed by the D-day landings a month later. \u201cI remember the train journey very well. It was terrible, the smell, the stench, the people crying. And my father taking me, then barely six years old, in his arms and putting me up to an opening [in the freight car] and saying in French: \u2018Breathe Lola, take in the fresh air\u2019,\u201d she tells the Observer. They were things, she said, that were impossible to forgive or forget. \u201cThey stole my childhood. There are memories that can never be erased. They took away my seven uncles and eight aunts, and all their children and, in the end, Thessaloniki, which we would never go back to. \u201cBut I beat Hitler because I managed to have a big family, and I hope to live long enough to see this Holocaust museum, which, of course, should have happened long ago.\u201d For Saltiel, the delay is testimony \u201cto the silence\u201d that has haunted Sephardic communities in Greece. By the time the first death train left Thessaloniki on 15 March 1943, German bureaucrats had mastered the art of mass murder that underpinned the racial restructuring envisaged by the Nazi regime. But the silence of those who looked on as Thessaloniki\u2019s Jews were shunted into ghettoes and then deported was also deafening. In sharp contrast to Athens and other parts of Greece, where the Orthodox Church, resistance fighters and leftists rallied to hide Jews, in Thessaloniki the community was left to fend for itself. Fewer than 2,000 survived. Those who returned invariably encountered a city whose inhabitants were not only overwhelmingly Christian but reluctant to face the horrors at all. \u201cIn Thessaloniki silence prevailed,\u201d explains Saltiel, estimating the city\u2019s community today at around 1,000. \u201cThe majority did not want to talk about what happened, and certainly not about what did not happen.\u201d The 9,000-sq ft museum is not only a belated tribute to those who suffered in Thessaloniki at the hands of the Nazis and their collaborators. It will also celebrate the history of Greek Jewry, including the 39 other Jewish communities that, prewar, were dotted around Greece and, it is hoped, be an educational hub and human rights centre at a time when hard-right parties and Holocaust deniers are resurfacing and gaining momentum across Europe. Greece\u2019s centre-right government, which has sought to improve ties with Israel despite mounting disquiet over its actions in the Middle East, has pledged to contribute \u20ac18m. A further \u20ac10m will come from the Stavros Niarchos philanthropic foundation while Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, will commit $1m in prize money received for the discovery of an effective Covid vaccine. Bourla was born in Thessaloniki to Jewish parents who narrowly survived the Holocaust. Yet all agree that had it not been for Yiannis Boutaris, the city\u2019s charismatic former mayor, the museum, even at this stage, might still not exist. A prominent wine-maker who went into local politics to \u201cgive back to the community\u201d, Boutaris was bent on opening up Thessaloniki and highlighting its Jewish and Ottoman Muslim heritage. By reviving its once fabled multicultural past, the progressive businessman stated bluntly that he hoped to tackle the blatant antisemitism that, for years, had stalked socially conservative northern Greece. Central to that was a proper Holocaust museum. Under his stewardship, a site was found and permits signed. \u201cBoutaris was unique because he didn\u2019t care about the political cost, and that really helped break taboos in a place where so many pretended the Holocaust never happened,\u201d says Giorgos Antoniou, assistant professor of Jewish studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Now 82, the tattooed, chain-smoking Boutaris regards the venture as one of his greatest achievements. On being sworn into office for a second time in 2014, he donned a yellow star to show far-right municipal councillors from the now defunct neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party that he meant business. \u201cWherever I went I\u2019d be asked, \u2018why do you want this museum?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThere was push-back, for sure. With the Holocaust, Thessaloniki lost its future. All the good merchants, bankers and academics were Jewish. It was a huge loss.\u201d Five years on, Boutaris shakes his head in disbelief that there is still so much to do. A memorial park he had planned to create in Eleftherias [Freedom] Square, the plaza where thousands of Jewish men were first rounded up in 1942, remains a car park because his successor refused to sign off on the project. As a result, the city\u2019s Holocaust memorial stands nearby on the corner of a busy intersection, half hidden by trees. Even worse, he says, was the decision to build the University of Thessaloniki over an ancient Jewish cemetery. \u201cFor a long time, there was no sign or monument on the site, just as there are no signs to suggest that there were once 30 synagogues in this town before all but one was destroyed by the Nazis.\u201d But Boutaris is optimistic. Plans to transform Freedom Square into a memorial park with the Holocaust memorial sculpture as its centrepiece have been resurrected. And the new museum itself, he says, will not fail to impress. \u201cThere are Holocaust museums all over the world but none have been dedicated solely to the history and culture of Sephardic Jews in this part of the world. And none will tell their story like this.\u201d",

The same year Zwickau turned out about 247,000 EVs, far below the plant\u2019s capacity of more than 300,000 vehicles a year. The site\u2019s problems are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/07/an-earthquake-at-volkswagen-and-a-crisis-for-germany\">symptomatic of Germany\u2019s crucial car industry as a whole</a>.</p> <p>The country\u2019s chancellor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, surprised many by coming to power in 2021, riding on a pledge of \u201crespect\u201d for hard-working Germans. But his fractious government is struggling to respond to a crisis that has made Europe\u2019s top economy the worst performers among industrialised nations.</p> <p>At the start of the year, Berlin cut EV subsidies to address budget shortfalls, hobbling the domestic market and giving a boon to cheaper Chinese models even before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/04/eu-chinese-ev-tariffs-split-vote-germany-car-firms\">the EU imposed extra tariffs on imports</a>, touching off a potential trade war with China.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) has successfully seized on the internal combustion engine as a touchstone of prosperity being sacrificed on the altar of Green-voting urban elites.</p> <p>The AfD triumphed in local elections in June and came in a very close second in the Saxony state poll in September. Its influence ripples through VW, labour representatives say, and the wider culture in Zwickau, as when the fourth annual LGBT Pride parade was held in August and drew hundreds of right-wing extremist counter-protesters.

But Oder argues workers should not bear the brunt of catastrophic mistakes by the management. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re being made to choose between the plague and cholera,\u201d the 31-year-old says. \u201cEither a plant closes or we have to accept massive sacrifices for the workforce in the area of pay that would cut to the bone.\u201d In 2023, VW let hundreds of temporary contracts run out while pledging to preserve permanent jobs. The same year Zwickau turned out about 247,000 EVs, far below the plant\u2019s capacity of more than 300,000 vehicles a year. The site\u2019s problems are symptomatic of Germany\u2019s crucial car industry as a whole. The country\u2019s chancellor, Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, surprised many by coming to power in 2021, riding on a pledge of \u201crespect\u201d for hard-working Germans. But his fractious government is struggling to respond to a crisis that has made Europe\u2019s top economy the worst performers among industrialised nations. At the start of the year, Berlin cut EV subsidies to address budget shortfalls, hobbling the domestic market and giving a boon to cheaper Chinese models even before the EU imposed extra tariffs on imports, touching off a potential trade war with China. Meanwhile, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) has successfully seized on the internal combustion engine as a touchstone of prosperity being sacrificed on the altar of Green-voting urban elites. The AfD triumphed in local elections in June and came in a very close second in the Saxony state poll in September. Its influence ripples through VW, labour representatives say, and the wider culture in Zwickau, as when the fourth annual LGBT Pride parade was held in August and drew hundreds of right-wing extremist counter-protesters. Nearly 500 police officers were needed to keep the peace, making national headlines. K\u00e4mpf, who grew up in the region, says he fears a \u201crise of the political extremes\u201d if VW no longer provides an anchor in a community that has seen its share of upheaval over the last century. But he adds that the history of Zwickau and other regions rocked by industrial revolutions also offer countless examples of openness to change and resilience. \u201cWhatever may come, we will manage,\u201d he says. \u201cI am sure of it.\u201d",

on interest rate cuts this week.</p> <p>The central bank has kept the target cash rate on hold at 4.35% for almost a year, a level it believes is high enough to slow the economy, weaken demand for goods and services, and bring down inflation.</p> <p>Quarterly inflation data released last week will be at the centre of discussions in the two-day meeting.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s headline inflation eased to 2.8% in the September quarter, its lowest level in more than three years and back within the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band.</p> <p>The underlying inflation rate \u2013 the trimmed mean watched closely by the central bank \u2013 came in at 3.5%.</p> <p>The result was down from 4% in June, but outside the desired range.</p> <p>Strong job creation and low unemployment further adds to the case to stay on hold although consumer spending has been weak, in a sign interest rates are weighing on demand.</p> <p>Both retail sales and household spending data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics point to sluggish spending, even as federal government tax cuts boost incomes.</p> <p>As well as a post-meeting statement from the board, RBA governor <strong>Michele</strong> <strong>Bullock</strong> will take questions from the media after the rates announcement on Tuesday.</p> <p>Other data on the agenda includes Melbourne Institute\u2019s inflation gauge, and ANZ and Indeed\u2019s job

It was also like playing Russian roulette \u2013 passengers still got the significantly cheaper fare even if the algorithm failed to match them with a co-rider.</p> <p>Uber\u2019s pool option disappeared at the outbreak of the pandemic, and while it has since been reintroduced, its savings are now less pronounced, and marginal if the algorithm doesn\u2019t find you a co-rider.</p> <p>I was curious if passengers had re-embraced sharing confined spaces with randoms.

      "bodyText": "With that we\u2019re wrapping up the blog. Before we go, here are the major stories from Sunday: The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has pledged to cut a fifth of all student debt if his government is re-elected. The prime minister has also announced that his government will make Tafe free across the country as part of a broader push to reform the education sector. Two men have been charged after a bushfire in Adelaide on Saturday. Former US ambassador and former treasurer Joe Hockey says the re-election of Trump would be good for Australia. The Coalition has criticised the Labor government\u2019s pledge on student debt as a \u201ccash splash\u201d. The Greens have responded to Albanese\u2019s student debt announcement by claiming credit for the policy and asking, why wait? Unclaimed Myki credit is now sitting at $115m. We\u2019ll pick things up again tomorrow. Auction activity across the country falls Auction activity has dropped this weekend with 1,983 auctions to be held. This is a steep fall on the 3,135 held last week and roughly similar to the 2,023 that occurred at the same time last year. Based on results collected so far, CoreLogic\u2019s summary found that the preliminary clearance rate was 63.4% across the country, which is lower than the 66.8% preliminary rate recorded last week and slightly below the 63.8% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 744 of 1,056 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 65.5% Melbourne: 378 of 473 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 62.4% Brisbane: 128 0f 182 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 58.3% Adelaide: 82 of 173 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 73.8% Canberra: 58 of 94 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 55.2% Tasmania: No auctions held. Perth: Three of 15 auctions held. Inflation easing but RBA not expected to lower interest rates Inflation is easing but the Reserve Bank of Australia is still expected to hold off on interest rate cuts this week. The central bank has kept the target cash rate on hold at 4.35% for almost a year, a level it believes is high enough to slow the economy, weaken demand for goods and services, and bring down inflation. Quarterly inflation data released last week will be at the centre of discussions in the two-day meeting. Australia\u2019s headline inflation eased to 2.8% in the September quarter, its lowest level in more than three years and back within the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band. The underlying inflation rate \u2013 the trimmed mean watched closely by the central bank \u2013 came in at 3.5%. The result was down from 4% in June, but outside the desired range. Strong job creation and low unemployment further adds to the case to stay on hold although consumer spending has been weak, in a sign interest rates are weighing on demand. Both retail sales and household spending data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics point to sluggish spending, even as federal government tax cuts boost incomes. As well as a post-meeting statement from the board, RBA governor Michele Bullock will take questions from the media after the rates announcement on Tuesday. Other data on the agenda includes Melbourne Institute\u2019s inflation gauge, and ANZ and Indeed\u2019s job advertisement numbers due on Monday. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release international goods trade balance data on Thursday. \u2013 AAP The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, is going the extra mile after helping launch the government\u2019s campaign event in Adelaide. In a series of posts to X, formerly known as Twitter, the premier says the PM has \u201calways worked hard and he\u2019s never forgotten who he\u2019s worked for\u201d. The series of posts, which echoes his earlier statements attempting to rally the troops before a federal election, also contains big glossy images of the premier, who is looking at his own 2026 election, sharing the limelight with Albanese. Police search for three men on Gold Coast continues Police are searching for three men allegedly involved in a break and enter on Sunday morning which ended with a 25-year-old injured as they sought to defend themselves. Queensland police say that just before 4am, three men entered a unit in Arundel when a fight broke out between them and the 25-year-old occupant. After the men fled the scene, the occupant was transported to Gold Coast university hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Detectives from the Gold Coast criminal investigation branch are investing and do not believe the suspects pose a threat to the general community. Any witnesses or anyone with relevant CCTV vision is urged to contact police. Two men charged with animal cruelty after two dogs allegedly shot in NSW Two men have been charged with animal cruelty offences after two dogs were allegedly shot in western New South Wales on Saturday. NSW police allege a 41-year-old man became involved in a verbal argument with another at a property in Stannifer. After the argument the 41-year-old allegedly walked outside with a shotgun and fired several rounds towards two dogs, killing one and injuring the other. He then allegedly left the scene before police arrived. A crime scene was established, and investigations commenced. It is believed the two men are known to each other. Police later found the man by his vehicle where he was arrested and taken to Inverell police station. A roadside breath test allegedly returned a positive result. The 41-year-old man has been charged with common assault (DV), torturing, beating etc and causing death of animal, handling/using firearm under the influence of alcohol/drug, possessing unregistered firearm-prohibited firearm, not keeping firearm safety-prohibited firearm, commit an act of cruelty upon an animal, and driving with middle range PCA. He has been refused bail and will appear before Parramatta local court on Sunday. Police also stopped another vehicle seen leaving the property, driven by a 67-year-old man. After approaching the vehicle, the officers allegedly found a firearm. The man was arrested and taken to Inverell police station and charged with possessing unregistered firearm-not pistol/prohibited firearm. He was granted conditional bail to appear before Inverell local court in January. Electric heavy-duty trucks rolling out More Australian businesses are adopting electric heavy-duty trucks but the industry still risks missing its emissions reduction target, experts warn. Supermarket giant Coles and recycling firm CD Dodd are the latest companies to add electric prime movers to their transport fleets in Victoria and Western Australia, under changes announced last week, AAP reports. Another 150 heavy-duty zero-emission trucks are expected to follow in 2025, according to Volvo, despite restrictions in some states and inconsistent laws in others. The updates come weeks after the transition to electric vehicles inquiry heard calls for the federal government to provide greater support for the use and purchase of electric trucks, including charging infrastructure and financial incentives. Coles is adding a battery-powered prime mover to its Victorian delivery fleet in partnership with Linfox, and the COO, Matt Swindells, said the addition would save 25,000 litres of fuel each year. Mining metal recycling firm CD Dodd also announced plans to deploy a heavy-duty electric truck in its operations, with the Volvo FM electric truck able to transport 50 tonnes of freight for up to 300km a charge. The investments show transport companies are keen to embrace fuel-saving technology, adding to the 65 heavy and medium-sized electric trucks already on Australian roads, the Volvo Group president, Martin Merrick, said. Local companies had placed another 150 orders for large electric trucks to arrive in 2025, he said, but the figure could be larger if state, territory and federal governments worked to provide consistent rules for their use. Governments in Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT have changed front axle weight restrictions to allow electric trucks, although the rules vary. Disturbed, not surprised: Chris Bowen on climate crisis In Spain, more than 200 people have been killed after the deadliest floods in the country\u2019s modern history. Australia is heating faster than the global average, meaning more extreme heat events, longer fire seasons, increasingly intense heavy rain and sea level rise. And globally, this year is highly likely to be the hottest on record, beating the current title holder, 2023. For some, this escalating scientific evidence can be alarming. But the person in charge of Australia\u2019s response to the climate crisis says that is not a word he would choose. \u201cIf alarm implies concern, sure. But alarm implying surprise? No,\u201d says Chris Bowen, the country\u2019s climate change and energy minister. We\u2019re living climate change. What we\u2019re now trying to do is avoid the worst of it. Report after report, temperature records tumbling, natural disasters increasingly unnatural \u2013 that\u2019s why we keep going. That\u2019s what drives me. It gets me out of bed every day. So perhaps alarmed is the wrong word. Disturbed, maybe. But, you know, not surprised. For more on this the Guardian Australia\u2019s interview with the federal climate minister, read the full report by environment editor Adam Morton: It\u2019s up to Labor to \u2018make the case for fairness\u2019: SA premier The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, with a somewhat gravelly voice, is now giving his speech making the case for the Albanese government. He\u2019s made a reference to the Light on the Hill, and has pitched the Labor government as the stewards of fairness in Australia. It\u2019s up to Labor to \u201cmake the case for fairness in this country\u201d he says \u2013 but he warns of a fierce fight ahead. The Tories are going to come at us. And they\u2019re going to come at us hard. It\u2019s the one thing they might actually be good at. Dutton\u2019s agenda is \u2018all wrong for Australia\u2019: PM Albanese: Peter Dutton has spent every day hoping the worst for this country. He thinks Australia can\u2019t compete for good jobs, that workers don\u2019t deserve their wages, that you don\u2019t need help with your power bills, he thinks medicine should be more expensive and Medicare less generous. He is wrong about our country and his agenda is all wrong for Australia. Because the challenges facing us won\u2019t be solved by cutting. The opportunities ahead of us won\u2019t be seized by wrecking. This is a time for building. Building better education for all, building more homes for Australians, building the cleaner and cheaper energy to cut our emissions and power our homes and industries. Building an economy defined by good jobs, fair wages and equality for women. Building an economy connected to the growth and opportunities of Asia where we make things here in Australia. Building a society defined and uplifted by better aged care, a more secure NDIS and stronger Medicare for everyone. Building a nation that is secure at home, strong in our region and respected on the world stage. Building and Australia where we care for our environment and keep it safe for our grandchildren. Building in Australia where we embrace every culture, every faith and every tradition that enriches our nation, beginning with the oldest continuous culture on earth. My fellow Australians, next year, with respect for our people, optimism for the future and a determination to shape it. A Labor government will be asking for the opportunity to continue to serve the greatest country in the world and the chance to make it even greater still. Building on the strong foundations we have made, building together, building to last, our Labor government building Australia\u2019s future. And with that, Albanese leaves to great applause. PM hints at further education pledges Albanese has signalled that his government has unfinished business saying these policies are the \u201cnext big step\u201d but \u201cwon\u2019t be the last\u201d. My colleague Paul Karp suggests that this means the government may look at the cost of degrees, will seek to undo parts of the Coalition\u2019s \u201cjob ready graduates\u201d program, or return to a demand-driven university system. Meanwhile, the PM is building to a crescendo saying the next election will present a clear choice: A Labor government driving to be the change our nation needs and creating the opportunities that our people deserve. Or a return to the denial, delay and vision of the past Liberal and National parties, the same people that spent nine years in government creating the problems and have spent every day in opposition trying to block the solutions. Their cuts, waste and neglect left Australia wide open to global uncertainty and now they want to go further, they want to cut what is helping, punish people that are struggling, to claw back big tax cuts we delivered, close the Medicare urgent care clinics we opened, to stop the housing projects we started, to take away the help with power bills you deserve, to push up the price of medicines you need, to rip away the pay rises you received and the rights you have, to derail the progress we made on renewables so they can burn 100s of billions of dollars on nuclear reactors, a plan that will deliver less than 4% of the energy Australia needs, and two decades too late. Graduates have been \u2018caught out\u2019 by rising inflation: PM Albanese is now addressing his promise to wipe $3bn of student debt if re-elected. He says Australia\u2019s graduates have been \u201ccaught out\u201d by rising inflation and that this change will save a person with an average debt \u201caround $1,200\u201d. Part of this was about addressing a one-off but, just as importantly, we changed the system and made it fairer and better so it could never happen again. Albanese says it was a Labor government that created the Hecs system and \u201cchose that name because it was about students making a contribution to the cost of their education\u201d. He says that was changed by the Liberals to make it more like a standard loan. This generation of students graduating from three-year degrees with debt of 30, 40, $50,000. That level of debt hangs over you. You can see it when you login to myGov or do your tax return and it affects how much you can borrow for homes and impacts decisions you make about your family and career. Because of the changes in rising costs, it comes out of your take-home pay sooner. Fixing this intergenerational unfairness will require substantial investment. It will take time. The PM says that if his party wins re-election, his government will wipe 20% of student debt \u201cfor everyone that has one\u201d. This measure alone means a typical university graduate will see their debt cut by $5,500. The government will also raise the repayment threshold from $54k to $67k, lower the rate of repayment and \u201cindex both to keep them fairer into the future\u201d. Australia will have access to permanent free Tafe nationwide if the Labor government is re-elected, the PM says in the first major policy announcement. Albanese says his government will legislate to guarantee 100,000 free Tafe places each year to give \u201cmore opportunity for Australians to train and retrain in a changing and dynamic economy\u201d. Tafe gives our country and our people all of this and as long as there is a labour government, free Tafe is here to stay. The PM says his government will also double the number of university hubs in regional communities. Education at heart of Labor\u2019s vision for Australia: PM The PM is using the opportunity to define the legacy of his first-term government and to lay out his vision for what Australia as \u201ca country where you know if you put in and work hard, it adds up to something\u201d and \u201cno one held back and no one left behind\u201d. Albanese says education is at the heart of this vision, as it will help ensure the country has the \u201ctradies and architects to build and plan the homes we need, the engineers and electricians that deliver the clean energy to take us to net zero, the scientists discover new cures and driving new breakthroughs\u201d. He says that his government has done this by putting Tafe back of its policy planning. No Labor government would ever call Tafe a waste. \u2018Our nation can lead the world on clean energy\u2019: PM Albanese is seeking to cast the challenges that Australia has faced as opportunity: I know workers, families and small businesses have all done it hard. But while there are still challenges to meet, still problems to solve, still people under pressure that need our help, when we look at the economy today, we can see new reasons for optimism, new proof that the worst is behind us. Together we have faced a global storm and have navigated it in the Australian way, the Labor way, not by cutting services Australians count on, not by denying families the help they need in hard times, but by looking after people and look to the future. For all the challenges we have faced, this remains a time of profound opportunity for Australia. He then pivots into a discussion about South Australia\u2019s embrace of renewable energy as an example of how \u201cour nation can lead the world on clean energy\u201d. We can power a new generation of manufacturing. We can make things here in Australia. We can build Australia\u2019s future stronger and fairer than ever before. And we can make sure the people who have carried the weight of today\u2019s challenges share the reward of tomorrow\u2019s opportunities. Reform that holds no one back, progress that leaves no one behind. That is what drives and defines our government. PM outlines new reforms since Labor came to office Albanese is running through the list of reforms and interventions his government has introduced since coming to office. According to the PM, this includes: Making medicine cheaper; Opening 75 new Medicare urgent care clinics; Boosting bulk billing; \u201cRebuilding the health system so that your Medicare card that matters, not the balance on your credit card\u201d; Energy bill relief for households and business A crackdown on dodgy pricing and unfair practices; Industrial relations reforms; Boosting wages in aged care, childcare and low-paid industries; Expanding paid parental leave to six months and adding superannuation to it; Tax cuts \u201cfor every single Australian taxpayer\u201d. Albanese also points to falling inflation, a narrowing gender pay gap, a stabilised relationship with China and \u201cback-to-back budget surpluses for the first time in nearly two decades.\u2019 When you look at all of these facts, this is an economic record we are so proud of. PM outlines \u2018serious and urgent challenges\u2019 government has faced With Marles having set the scene, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is called to the stage with applause. Albanese opens by using the moment to set the scene for the challenges faced by his newly elected government. We came to office knowing this is a time of serious and urgent challenges for the global economic uncertainty. A worldwide surge in inflation and energy prices. And Australia\u2019s relationships with our own region under strain. Under home, aged care was in crisis. Medicare under threat. Bulk billing in freefall. Real wages going backwards not by accident but as a deliberate design feature of the economic architecture. Our energy grid had been run down by years of ideology and neglect. And skills and manufacturing hollowed out to the point that in the midst of a global pandemic we nearly ran out of masks and could not make any more here. These are the challenges we have had to face. This is the mess we have worked to clean up. \u2018Can we afford the cost of Peter Dutton?\u2019: Marles The defence minister, Richard Marles, is speaking now at a campaign event in Adelaide as federal Labor gears up for the next election. Marles is attempting to flip the script on the Coalition leader, Peter Dutton, presenting his as reckless, arrange and selfish, and committed to austerity saying he \u201cis prepared to send the country backwards if it will propel him forwards\u201d. Marles has attacked Dutton\u2019s record on healthcare from his time when he served as Tony Abbott\u2019s health minister, joking that \u201che was so bad as health minister that even Tony Abbott had to sack him\u201d. If we give Medicare back to Dutton it will be gone for ever. He has also landed attacks on the Coalition\u2019s nuclear pitch, pointing out that Dutton has so far refused to answer basic questions and provide basic numbers. Even if you ignore all of that, you cannot ignore that Peter Dutton\u2019s reckless and risky plan to build nuclear power plants will send energy bills through the roof. The theme, which will probably be developed going into the next federal election, appears to be a simple one: Can we afford the cost of Peter Dutton? Female killer who wore clown costume released from US prison An American woman who pleaded guilty to dressing as a clown and in 1990 murdering the wife of a man she later married has been released from prison, ending a case that has been strange even by Florida standards, AAP reports. Sheila Keen-Warren, 61, was released 18 months after she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the shooting of Marlene Warren, Florida Department of Corrections records show. The plea deal came shortly before her trial would have started. Keen-Warren, who has maintained her innocence even after her plea, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. But she had been in custody for seven years since her arrest in 2017, and Florida\u2019s law in 1990 allowed significant credit for good behaviour. It had been expected she would be released in about two years. Palm Beach county state attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement Saturday that the release does not undo her conviction. Sheila Keen-Warren will always be an admitted convicted murderer and will wear that stain for every day for the rest of her life. Aronberg last year conceded that there were holes in the case, saying they were caused by the three decades it took to get it to trial, including the death of key witnesses. Greg Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren\u2019s attorney, has said she only took the plea deal because she would be released in less than two years and had been facing a life sentence if convicted at trial. We are absolutely thrilled that Ms Keen-Warren has been released from prison and is returning to her family. As we\u2019ve stated from the beginning, she did not commit this crime. Marlene Warren\u2019s son, Joseph Ahrens, and his friends were at home when they said a person dressed as a clown rang the door bell. He said that when his mother answered, the clown handed her some balloons. After she responded, \u201cHow nice,\u201d the clown pulled a gun and shot her in the face before fleeing. The Victorian government is holding $115m in unclaimed Myki funds in a trust, Guardian Australia can reveal. Last month, the NSW government announced it was holding $143m in unused Opal transport card funds from nearly 18m cards that hadn\u2019t been tapped on for over a year, encouraging people to check cards and transfer the money back to their bank account. Sixty per cent of transport users in New South Wales have switched to using credit cards, bank cards or their phones for tapping on. In Victoria, however, a similar type system isn\u2019t expected to roll out until next year, and Myki cards expire. When they expire the leftover funds go into a trust held by the government until they\u2019re claimed. As of the end of June, that fund sits at $115m. The government extended the expiry of Myki cards by two years in October last year, and indicated the improvements under way will reduce the risk of unused funds sitting on cards in the future. What a week of riding Uber Pool reveals about Sydney As kids we\u2019re warned not to accept rides with strangers. But when my editors told me to take Uber Pools around Sydney and write about the characters I meet, I had little idea I\u2019d be in for fashion critiques, tales of backseat romances, plenty of awkward silences \u2013 and mostly solo rides. When it first launched before Covid, Uber Pool was perhaps the truest form of ride sharing. Not only would passengers literally share rides, it offered seriously cheap fares \u2013 lower than even the artificially low rates Uber initially charged in early years to capture market share. The novelty of riding with a stranger, and the more circuitous routes at prices not much higher than a bus ticket, proved popular. It was also like playing Russian roulette \u2013 passengers still got the significantly cheaper fare even if the algorithm failed to match them with a co-rider. Uber\u2019s pool option disappeared at the outbreak of the pandemic, and while it has since been reintroduced, its savings are now less pronounced, and marginal if the algorithm doesn\u2019t find you a co-rider. I was curious if passengers had re-embraced sharing confined spaces with randoms. Post-pandemic data shows Australians are driving private cars more than ever. Have Sydneysiders become a special breed of overly precious recluses? For more on this story, read the full feature by Guardian Australia\u2019s Elias Visontay: Leading women\u2019s rights advocate dies Fay Marles, a leading feminist in Victoria and an advocate for the rights of women in the workplace, has died. Marles was appointed Victoria\u2019s first Equal Opportunity Commissioner, a position she held until 1986. Her work in that role changed helped open up the workplace to women in the state. In a statement on Saturday, the University of Melbourne issued a statement detailing her career and the long association with the institution that began when she began as an undergraduate in 1944. Fay will be deeply missed by the University community and the very many people whose lives she touched. Fay passed away on Friday, surrounded by her children who spent the day beside her. She is survived by, Victoria, Jennifer, Elizabeth and Richard. Her husband, Don Marles, passed away in 2017 after 66 years of marriage. Tasmanian government eyes TasPorts and TT-Line merger A proposed merger between besieged TasPorts and TT-Line has been flagged by the Tasmanian government, AAP reports. The premier, Jeremy Rockliff, confirmed on Sunday the government would explore the merger and combine it with TasRail to make it a \u201cunified government entity\u201d. Describing the proposal as a \u201clandmark move\u201d, Mr Rockliff said it would enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Tasmania\u2019s transport and logistics services. We have seen growing concerns around the performance, accountability, and coordination of some of our government businesses. Recent issues have highlighted the need for a more strategic, long-term approach to managing Tasmania\u2019s critical infrastructure. We also require a greater customer focus and better service delivery. TasPorts is a state-owned company responsible for eleven Tasmanian ports and the Devonport Airport. TasRail is a state operated company that manages mailine trainlines across the state since 2009, it only operates freight services. Rockliff said the possible merger could ensure a more integrated, cost-effective, and responsive system for the people of Tasmania. The Tasmanian government will undertake a detailed restructuring analysis to assess the proposal and ensure a smooth transition. The analysis will also identify any potential regulatory, legal and competition issues. It\u2019s unknown how long the analysis will take or when the proposed merger could take place. Rockliff is expected to hold a press conference on Sunday. Why wait?: Greens welcome PM pledge on student debt The deputy Greens leader, Senator Mehreen Faruqi has responded to the government\u2019s announcement that it will wipe a fifth of the country\u2019s student debt if re-elected by asking: why wait? In a statement on Sunday, Faruqi said the announcement was \u201ca big win for the Greens and all those in the community who have pleaded and pushed for action to tackle skyrocketing student debt\u201d. This is a start, but if Labor can wipe 20% of student debt, surely they can wipe all of it. There\u2019s no reason to wait till July to deliver much needed student debt relief. Labor should bring on the legislation now and we\u2019ll work with them to pass it. Instead of promising to wipe some student debt if they get re-elected, Labor should start wiping student debt now. Student debt relief shouldn\u2019t be dangled like a carrot on a stick and held hostage to the next election results. We have the numbers in parliament to do it right now. Earlier the shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, also gave the Coalition\u2019s reaction to Labor\u2019s announcement that it will slash student debts by 20%. Birmingham told Sky News: I think the initial reaction is, where is the money coming from? When Anthony Albanese was elected he inherited an improving budget position ... but the actions of this government have created a worsening budget position \u2026 higher deficits in years ahead. And if Anthony Albanese intends to turn the next election campaign into some great cash splash, where is the money coming from? . \u2026 This isn\u2019t real reform, this doesn\u2019t change the student fees that somebody who starts next year pays. This is simply a cash splash \u2026 an attempt at trying to con or hoodwink the electorate ahead of the election. South Australian senator Simon Birmingham has expressed frustration at the publication of photos identifying the new home of the Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong. In a post to social media on Saturday he asked media to take down and avoid publishing photos over security concerns. High profile politicians face genuine security considerations for themselves and their families. Responsible media should respect those safety considerations in any reporting of the issues. \u2018It\u2019s certainly not pretty, but this democracy is working\u2019: Hockey Hockey says he does not have concerns that Donald Trump, should he lose the US election, will not accept the result leading to possible civil unrest. I\u2019m not so concerned about it at all. I think the moment that was most risky for civil unrest in the United States was the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. Thank God \u2013 Democrats say that to me as well as Republicans, \u2018Thank God that didn\u2019t happen\u2019 because it\u2019s going to be a moment like that that will ignite the flame of American politics and we all hope and pray that doesn\u2019t happen. So I think Americans recognise this is democracy. It\u2019s certainly not pretty, but this democracy is working. Hockey says a re-elected trump will be a known quantity to Australia and \u201cwill be good for us\u201d. I\u2019ll just say this: Donald Trump 2.0 won\u2019t be a hell of a lot different to Donald Trump 1.0. That\u2019s good for us. It offers some measure of predictability, whereas Harris will be a little less predictable because she needs to differentiate herself from the Biden presidency and most importantly, she will always be looking to re-election. Don\u2019t forget \u2013 if Trump is elected, that\u2019s it. Even under Trumpland thinking, he can only serve one more term and that\u2019s it, he can\u2019t run for re-election. Harris can run and will run for re-election if she\u2019s president. So it will be a different type of Presidency. Harris currently serves as vice-president under the US president, Joe Biden, who was elected in 2020. Trump \u2018not afraid to exercise power\u2019: Hockey Hockey says he believes Trump will seek to restart his trade war with China as he \u201csees China as the main adversary of the United States rather than Russian, or even threats in the Middle East\u201d. Hockey says Australia will be able to leverage its relationship with the US to maintain Aukus. Hockey is asked about what Trump\u2019s position on climate change will mean. He says that a re-elected Trump may provide \u201cunpredictable power\u201d that will reinforce Australia\u2019s position as it seeks to re-engage with Pacific Island nations on climate change. At the end of the day, if \u2013 the United States \u2013 the thing about Donald Trump is he\u2019s not afraid to exercise power and he\u2019s not afraid to threaten to use power. If he does that, then it actually emboldens Australia\u2019s position, doesn\u2019t weaken it because it means we have an entry point into that unpredictable power that others don\u2019t. Hockey confident Aukus deal will remain despite result Hockey says Australia will be able to manage a new tariff war triggered by a re-elected Trump administration as \u201cwe have done it before\u201d. On Aukus, he says he believes Trump will not seek to change the relationship or pull out of the regional alliance. I think Trump is \u2013 I know that Donald Trump sees Australia very favourably when it comes to issues like national security. I think that will flow through to Aukus that he won\u2019t want to change the relationship with Aukus. He will, however, put a greater priority on building up the US defence system, its reservoir of not only talent, but also importantly the hardware, be it F-35s or Virginia-class subs. So might mean we go down the pecking order on the Virginia-class subs, but again it will rely heavily on our advocacy with Trump. Hockey says he does not believe a Harris administration would back out of the deal. Whatever the case, I think, you know, we\u2019ll be in a good position with Harris as well. Trump\u2019s tariffs will have \u2018profound impact\u2019: Hockey Hockey says that Trump\u2019s tariff policies will \u201chave a profound impact on Australia and the rest of the world\u201d. It will stimulate inflation in the United States, it will have a dramatic impact on the US dollar, it will have a dramatic impact on US interest rates, and there\u2019s no win out of Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies for anyone, including in particular the consumers here in the United States. On the other side \u2013 and the key thing about his tariff policies is that they don\u2019t need congressional approval. So he can do it by executive order as he has done before. That\u2019s what makes his tariff policies real. During his tenure as federal treasurer under the Abbott Coalition government, Hockey was a fierce supporter of free trade and deeply hostile to government support for industry, who oversaw the closure of the Australian car industry after he dared General Motors Holden to \u201ccome clean\u201d about its intentions. Hockey says neither candidate will be able to win both houses needed to get their policy agenda over the line. Hockey cites \u2018unbelievable\u2019 coalitions of both candidates Hockey says his read on the election is that the difference comes down to policy, with both candidates having pulled together \u201cunbelievable\u201d coalitions. For Trump supporters, they want lower tax, they want less regulation, they want a stronger border. For Harris candidates \u2013 the overwhelming unifying factor is that Kamala Harris is not Donald Trump. That has brought together an unbelievable coalition that stretches from Bernie Sanders on the left to Liz Cheney who would be a very, very conservative Republican on the right. I mean, that\u2019s a very broad coalition. That\u2019s up against Donald Trump whose coalition stretches from Elon Musk to the head of the Teamsters Truck Driving union. Now, you couldn\u2019t get a bigger differentiation in that cohort as well. Hockey expects US election will be close Hockey, speaking to ABC Insiders which is being broadcast from Detroit, Michigan, says he expects the election will be close and the result will not be known for \u201cfour or five days\u201d. He says North Carolina will be a key seat, with the former federal treasurer expecting it will be won easily by Trump. I think North Carolina will come in early if it is a strong result for Trump and it will be a precursor to a \u2013 an overall victory for Trump. But if it\u2019s close, then obviously it\u2019s going to make it a very interesting night. \u2018Most Americans have made up their mind\u2019: Hockey Former US ambassador Joe Hockey says he thinks \u201cmost Americans have made up their mind\u201d in the final stages of the US presidential election. Hockey says there are several unknowns in this contest, ranging from how many will turn out to vote and no one has a clear understanding of which way the outcome will swing. It is a result that no one is able to predict and it\u2019s going to come as a surprise to Australians, given there are so many polls that were in a position where we can\u2019t pick the winner, but the fact is no one knows how big the turnout is going to be. Unlike Australia where we have compulsory turnouts in elections, here it is a mystery how many new voters will come out and how they\u2019re going to vote. South Australian police have charged two men after a bushfire in Adelaide\u2019s north on Saturday afternoon. The grass fire burnt 33 hectares (82 acres) at Penfield around Womma Road in Adelaide\u2019s north which burnt several glass houses and a shed. Three people were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation. The fire is believed to have begun when a spark from an angle grinder ignited the blaze which proceeded to burn out of control. South Australian police have arrested two men in connection with the fire and charged them which cause a bushfire being recklessly indifferent. The last major fire to affect the agricultural was the Pinery Creek fire that threatened Gawler and the Barossa region in 2015. The former ambassador Joe Hockey will speak with ABC Insiders host, David Speers, on Sunday morning ahead of the US election. Coalition senator Simon Birmingham appeared on Sky News earlier on Sunday. We will bring you all the latest as it happens. All Australians will have their student debt cut by 20% next financial year, as part of a major federal government overhaul designed to boost access to education and address \u201cintergenerational unfairness\u201d. The change, which will be outlined by the prime minister at a campaign rally in Adelaide on Sunday, will wipe about $16bn worth of debt and is being sold as a cost-of-living measure for young Australians. According to government figures, a university graduate with an average debt of $27,600 will save $5,520. The 20% reduction is not capped and also applies to VET loans and apprenticeship support loans. When combined with changes to how the indexation on student loans is set, as detailed in the May budget, close to $20bn of student debt will be removed for 3 million Australians. For more on this story, read the Guardian Australia\u2019s full reporting here: And welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog. Anthony Albanese has announced a plan to wipe a fifth of all student debt if his government his re-elected.

      "bodyText": "It is commonly claimed that democracy can\u2019t work unless you have journalism, and a free media at that. How are people to decide how to cast a vote if they don\u2019t access independent, reliable information? With the US election upon us, we may be about to find out. Because, more than ever before, the people who decide the election will be those who are least engaged with professional news media \u2013 the kind of researched, fact-checked content that you are likely to find in the New York Times or, for that matter, the Guardian. Forty-three per cent of US citizens avoid the news, according to the latest Digital News Report \u2013 a worldwide survey of media use conducted by the Reuters Institute for Journalism at Oxford University. Most of these people nevertheless encounter some news \u2013 not because of loyalty to a brand or because they actively seek out a preferred outlet, but because it comes at them, so to speak. And what comes for free is either partisanly motivated, or funded by advertising \u2013 which means heavy with content pitched to draw eyeballs \u2013 sensationalism and clickbait. It is the low news consumers on which the campaigning candidates are concentrating, and on which the result of the election depends. There are significant things about news consumption that are different, this time around, from the last US election. But before I get to how things have changed since 2020, the facts I have already given mean that all the controversies, among the politically engaged, about whether mainstream media are \u201csanewashing\u201d Trump, or whether or not outlets such as the Washington Post or the Los Angeles Times publish editorial endorsements of a candidate, won\u2019t affect the election result. It is a debate of principal and morality, playing out among people who, overwhelmingly, have already made up their minds on how to vote. The citizens who will decide the election probably don\u2019t even know about these controversies, and if they did they probably wouldn\u2019t care. The researchers at the Reuters Institute report that once disengaged from the news, people struggle to get back in, even if they want to. Benjamin Toff, the author of a book on news avoidance, writes: \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to tune into the fourth episode season of Game of Thrones without knowing who these people are, or what difference any of this makes. For a lot of people, that\u2019s their feeling about the news.\u201d Traditionally, the journalistic mission has included making the important understandable, seeking to engage the disengaged. But while this still forms part of the rhetoric of the profession, the truth is that most serious news organisations publishing political news are not serving the politically disengaged. Instead, with so much advertising having disappeared from media outlets to online platforms, the path to financial sustainability for serious journalism outlets lies in trying to get people who already read the news to spend more time with the outlet, and to convert them into paying subscribers. This is essential to survival, for serious media. Yet also represents a failure of the journalistic mission. All this challenges our conventional ideas about the connections between democracy and journalism. It is true that democracy and journalism grew up together, and that each strengthens the other, but they are not as indivisible as the journalism profession suggests. Ancient Greece had democracy (though not for slaves) but no journalism. Al Jazeera provides journalism, but has its headquarters in non-democratic Qatar. And, in today\u2019s western democracies, we now have political journalism that risks no longer being mass media, but elite media. And then on top of that, playing to the mass, we have content. All kinds of content, much of it partisan, distorted and sometimes straight-out lies. In the last US election in 2020, we worried about misinformation and conspiracy theories spread through social media, and Facebook in particular. Four years later, news consumption on Facebook is in decline across the world, largely because owner Meta has actively discouraged it. TikTok is on the rise as a source of news, overtaking X (formerly Twitter). Facebook and Twitter, for all their faults, did carry content from mainstream media outlets to new audiences. But now, increasingly, it is podcasters and vodcasters and influencers who reach new audiences on social media. And they have at least some chance of reaching the disengaged and persuadable. That is why both Trump and Harris have been spending time with them. It is fashionable to blame all our current societal ills on social media. Blocking access to social media for the young is now bipartisan \u2013 if ill-defined \u2013 policy in Australia. It is, after all, so much easier as a response to the mental health crises among the young than tackling the climate change crisis, which makes depression and anxiety almost inevitable. Likewise, traditional news media outlets tend to blame social media for the spread of misinformation and the undermining of quality journalism. But that is only partly right. Surveys in Australia and the USA have shown that mainstream news media was in a crisis of trust from at least the 1970s, long before the internet, let alone Facebook and TikTok. It was therefore in rotten shape to respond to the challenges of the means of publication being in many more hands. Meanwhile, a recent research paper published in Nature suggests, based on a survey, that fake news and misinformation is not as influential as we may think. The survey showed that most people have low exposure to false and inflammatory content, and they tend to distrust it. However a narrow, partisan fringe seeks it out, believing content that confirms already hard-set views. This suggests that political partisanship drives consumption of misinformation at least as much as the other way round. There are a few bright spots in all this. The Reuters Digital News Media survey shows that countries that have strong investment in public service media \u2013 such as the public broadcasters of the BBC in Britain and the ABC in Australia - have much higher rates of engagement with news and more political engagement. But that doesn\u2019t apply to the USA, where public broadcasting is tiny. Solutions? I don\u2019t have any easy answers, and the problems are fast-moving targets. By the time of the next US election, many citizens may be consuming news written by artificial intelligence. If we are lucky, or if governments have been smart with their regulatory responses, the robots will be aggregating reliable sources. But we have been neither smart nor lucky so far. In the meantime, with the sands shifting beneath us, if we want voters to be well informed, we have to find a way of financially supporting and reinvigorating the journalistic mission \u2013 beyond internal chatter among an elite.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has all but declared victory over the inflation crisis in an upbeat campaign rally speech promising more free Tafe places and cost of living support. On Sunday the prime minister addressed a rally in Adelaide, declaring that Australia had navigated through the \u201cglobal storm\u201d of high prices and has \u201cnew reasons for optimism and new proof the worst is behind us\u201d. The Labor government, which must face an election by May 2025, is slightly behind in the polls as increasing costs including housing and a string of negative stories about Albanese enjoying perks of office including free Qantas flight upgrades weigh on his popularity. In an attempt to reset the political narrative, Albanese told the rally that the principle of \u201cno one held back and no one left behind\u201d had \u201cguided me my whole life\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve never lost sight of that, I\u2019ve never forgotten the people we are here to serve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why my colleagues and I work every day to make a positive difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Albanese said he was \u201cdetermined to win the next election \u2026 to help people through these cost of living pressures, to get more homes built, to get energy prices down, to get more Australians into good jobs, to get Medicare back to its best\u201d. Looking back at the past term, in which Labor revamped income tax cuts to benefit low and middle income earners and delivered two surpluses, Albanese said \u201cour economic plan has prioritised helping people under pressure while also fighting inflation\u201d. \u201cWhen we came to government annual inflation had a six in front of it and was rising. \u201cNow it has a two in front of it, and it\u2019s falling. \u201cOur responsible economic management has brought inflation down to its lowest level in almost four years.\u201d Albanese acknowledged that \u201cthe past few years have been difficult\u201d. \u201cI know workers, families and small businesses have all done it hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut while there are still challenges to meet, still problems to solve, still people under pressure who need our help, when we look at the economy today, we can see new reasons for optimism and new proof the worst is behind us. \u201cTogether, we have faced a global storm \u2013 and we have navigated it the Australian way, the Labor way. \u201cNot by cutting the services Australians count on, not by denying families the help they need in hard times.

Albanese said that half a million students had enrolled in fee-free Tafe vocational education and training, accusing the Coalition of framing this policy as \u201cwasteful spending\u201d. \u201cToday I am proud to announce our government will lock-in free TAFE and make it permanent, nationwide,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will legislate to guarantee 100,000 fee-free TAFE places, each and every year.\u201d The new places will be created every year from 2027, after earlier commitments to 180,000 places in 2023 and 300,000 places over three years from 2024. Labor has pledged to cut all student debts by 20% and raise the income threshold for repayments. Albanese said the debt cut \u2013 which will cut the average debt by $5,500 \u2013 will be \u201cthe first thing we do in our second term\u201d and take effect from 1 June 2025. Raising the student debt repayment threshold from $54,00 to $67,000 would save someone earning $70,000 about $1,300 a year, he said. \u201cIt helps everyone repaying a student debt right now \u2013 and it delivers a better deal for every student in the years ahead. \u201cPermanent, structural reform to boost take home pay for young Australians. \u201cThis is about putting money back into your pocket \u2013 and putting intergenerational equity back into the system.\u201d Albanese said the policies \u201care our next big step\u201d in Labor\u2019s agenda to \u201chelp Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn\u201d, adding \u201cand they won\u2019t be the last\u201d.

On one end of this conversation, there are paeans to male loneliness and discussions of the male suicide rate, quasi-poetic odes to their depths of despair and acute feeling: women just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be sad the way that men are sad.</p> <p>On the other end, writers and commentators point to more recent cultural trends that they say have alienated men, making them feel attacked or unnecessary. They point, apparently seriously, to the fact that some young feminists online have used the term \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d which they say makes men feel bad, bad enough that their feelings are an emergency for the nation. They point to those t-shirts that were popular in 2017 that said, \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201d This, too, is reflective of a great social pathology, a sign that we as a nation have failed men and boys.

Instead, the city of 135,000 people will wait until election day to verify and tabulate more than 20,000 mail-in ballots.</p> <p>The potential delay from Warren has worried some Democratic leaders that it could leave the results appearing artificially high for Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday evening, and that the former president would seek to exploit the situation by falsely declaring victory in the state before all votes were in.</p> <p>\u201cIf the state is close at all and we don\u2019t have returns from Warren, which is our third-largest city, it\u2019s going to create all kinds of concerns,\u201d said Mark Brewer, an attorney and the former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very worrisome.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6726000e8f080a1fc5f94e9a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/roberttait\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-02T10:34:41.911Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Are the polls 'improbably tight'? Some experts think so</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\"> Kamala Harris</a> in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday.</strong></p> <p>At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump\u2019s racially charged rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about \u201cgarbage\u201d being levelled left and right, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic.</p> <p>Nationally, Harris, the Democratic nominee, has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of error of most polls.</p> <p>The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, often seen as the most important swing state because it has the most electoral votes (19). Harris has single-point leads in the two other blue-wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump is marginally ahead in the Sun belt: up by 1% in North Carolina and 2% in Georgia and Arizona. In Nevada, his average advantage in the polls is less than a percentage point.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/state-poll-results-show-ties-are-tied-voters-pollsters-rcna177703\">Writing on NBC\u2019s website</a>, Josh Clinton, a politics professor at Vanderbilt University, and John Lapinski, the network\u2019s director of elections, pondered whether the tied race reflected not the sentiments of the voters, but rather risk-averse decision-making by pollsters. Some, they suggested, may be wary of findings indicating unusually large leads for one candidate and introduce corrective weighting.</p> <p>Of the last 321 polls in the battlegrounds, 124 \u2013 nearly 40% \u2013 showed margins of a single point or less, the pair wrote. Pennsylvania was the most \u201ctroubling\u201d case, with 20 out of 59 polls showing an exact tie, while another 26 showed margins of less than 1%.</p> <p>This indicated \u201cnot just an astonishingly tight race, but also an improbably tight race\u201d, according to Clinton and Lapinski.</p> <p>Read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/what-polls-mean-so-far-trump-harris-election-voters\">Dead-heat poll results are astonishing \u2013 and improbable, these experts say</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-02T16:03:15.942Z\">at 4.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6725e19b8f080a1fc5f94e12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nataliya-gumenyuk\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-02T10:24:28.785Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Around a month before the US elections, in the Kharkiv region, I sat down with a group of Ukrainian infantry soldiers together with the American historian Timothy Snyder.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us today. This has been Cecilia Nowell reporting on the latest US elections headlines this Saturday. Here\u2019s a summary of the day: In a startling reversal, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows Kamala Harris ahead of Donald Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters as the presidential race comes down to its final days. Vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 who was recently reported to be up for a role in US health and food safety in Trump\u2019s administration \u2013 said in a social media post that he would remove fluoride from all public water if Trump wins the election. Harris and Trump criss-crossed the country today, as both candidates tried to drum up support in the final weekend ahead of the presidential election. Both candidates began the day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, before Harris departed for Atlanta and then Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump also traveled to North Carolina, before heading to a rally in Virginia. Both candidates\u2019 running mates appeared at events in Nevada and Arizona. Tim Walz knocked on doors in Henderson, Nevada, before speaking alongside Indigenous leaders in Flagstaff and then courting Latino voters in Tucson. Meanwhile, JD Vance spoke in Las Vegas before heading to a gun store in Scottsdale. Americans took to the streets in cities across the country for a day of women\u2019s marches. Marches were planned in all 50 states for the eighth annual gathering, which began the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017. Joe Biden spoke at a carpenters\u2019 union in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by his granddaughter, a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania. The national guard is on standby in at least three states \u2013 Washington, Oregon and Nevada \u2013 and Washington DC as the election approaches, as fears of civil unrest grow. A record number of wealthy Americans are planning to leave the country as election day approaches, NBC News reports, citing fears that the election could spur political and social unrest regardless of its outcome. In Tucson, Arizona, Tim Walz has pulled out his \u201cmind your own damn business\u201d mantra again. \u201cThis guy is not John McCain\u2019s Republican party,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cHe means government should have the freedom to be in your exam room, to be in your bedroom, to tell you what books to read and make those decisions. If they just mind their own damn business, we\u2019ll mind our own damn business and we\u2019ll all be better.\u201d The latest Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll shows Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump, a startling reversal for political analysts who had all but written off the state as a win for Republicans. The poll shows Harris ahead of Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters as the presidential race comes down to its final days. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,\u201d pollster J Ann Selzer, president of Selzer &amp; Co, said to the Des Moines Register. \u201cShe has clearly leaped into a leading position.\u201d The poll of 808 likely Iowa voters, which include those who have already voted as well as those who say they definitely plan to vote, was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co from 28-31 October. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Michelle Obama has taken the stage at a rally in Montgomery county in Pennsylvania. She was preceded by musician Alicia Keys, who encouraged the crowd to keep fighting for feminist causes. \u201cThis is not some dystopian Netflix show I\u2019m talking about. This is the platform the other side is running on. They want to turn back the clock,\u201d Keys said, hinting at the points in Project 2025. Michelle Obama is campaigning again for Kamala Harris this afternoon alongside singer Alicia Keys at an event in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Earlier today, supporters were gathered outside the local high school where Obama will appear. Trump has wrapped up his speech in Salem, Virginia, in his usual manner, reciting his Maga chants that have come to mark the ends of his rallies: \u201cWe will make America great again \u2026 we will make America strong again!\u201d This time, he has pointedly added a new chant before leaving the stage: \u201cWe will make America healthy again!\u201d, perhaps in reference to recent reports that Robert F Kennedy Jr could assume some control over US health and food safety in a second Trump administration. According to the Washington Post, Kennedy has met with Trump transition officials to help draw up an agenda for a new administration and could take a broad \u201chealth tsar\u201d position that would not require confirmation by the Senate. Tim Walz has made his fifth visit to Arizona for a final campaign pitch for Kamala Harris as the US 2024 presidential race enters its final days. Harris and Trump are locked in a fierce battle for the swing state and have made several trips to court voters. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Trump leads Harris by 2.2 points in the state. More than 1.2 million Arizonans have already cast their ballots in this election. As the candidates continue a busy day of events, Donald Trump and Tim Walz are still expected to make at least one more appearance each this evening. Trump is returning to North Carolina, where he\u2019ll speak at a rally in Greensboro at 7.30pm ET while Walz heads to Tucson, Arizona. In a post on X, Robert F Kennedy Jr has said that he would remove fluoride from all public water if Donald Trump is elected and gives him responsibility over the nation\u2019s health agencies. \u201cFluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Although fluoride is associated with some health issues, dentists strongly recommend adding it to public water to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is naturally occurring in drinking water at varying levels. US district judge Edward Chen ruled on 24 September that the Environmental Protection Agency must take action regarding fluoride in drinking water, claiming his finding does not \u201cconclude with certainty\u201d any harmful effects but that there is evidence of the risk of cognitive decline. The ruling stems from an August report from the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which found that drinking water that contained more than twice the recommended limit of fluoride was \u201cconsistently associated\u201d with lower IQ in children. Despite this ruling, the American Dental Association said in a statement in September that it remains \u201cstaunchly in support\u201d of adding fluoride to community drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. Speaking to the crowd in Virginia, Trump is once again fixated on his hair. \u201cI\u2019m having a bad hair day! I have to have a bad hair day in front of Virginia? That\u2019s not good,\u201d Trump said, turning around presumably to look into a monitor that shows the back of his head. Trump\u2019s hair \u2013 and his appearance, in general \u2013 has lately become a standard talking point during his long and rambling campaign speeches \u2013 although he insists he does not ramble but employs a style of speech he calls \u201cthe weave\u201d. Donald Trump has implied that elections are rigged in blue states such as California and New York, falsely claiming that election officials will be executed if they ask to see voter ID. \u201cIf we had an honest election in California, we would win California,\u201d he said. Speaking at his rally in Salem, Virginia, Donald Trump has denounced a trans woman who was allowed to join Roanoke College\u2019s women\u2019s swim team last year. He said that seven members of the college\u2019s swim team had joined him backstage, before welcoming the teammates to the stage. \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have advocated for and pushed for this anti-woman sex-based discrimination to continue all over this country,\u201d swimmer Lily Mullens said. \u201cWe are so lucky to have a leader like Donald Trump with common sense,\u201d she said, thanking the ex-president for \u201cstanding with women\u201d. Donald Trump has taken the stage at his second rally of the day, this time in Salem, Virginia \u2013 a state that his rival Kamala Harris is leading by a wide margin. \u201cWe win Virginia, we win the whole thing without question,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that without winning Virginia we\u2019re going to win the whole thing too.\u201d Trump was introduced by Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin, who led attendees in a prayer before the ex-president began speaking. Campaigning in Scottsdale, Arizona, JD Vance has called on voters to \u201cmake this thing too big to rig\u201d. He focused much of his remarks on immigration, an issue that is central to many Arizona voters. In a new video, actor Harrison Ford has endorsed Kamala Harris. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been voting for 64 years. Never wanted to talk about it very much,\u201d Ford said, before referencing the former Trump administration officials who\u2019ve denounced the ex-president. \u201cI\u2019ve got one vote \u2013 same as anyone else \u2013 and I\u2019m going to use it to move forward. I\u2019m going to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d Donald Trump Jr has concluded speaking ahead of JD Vance in Scottsdale, Arizona. In his remarks, the ex-president\u2019s son echoed misinformation his father has spread regarding Fema relief efforts following hurricanes Helene and Milton, Haitian immigrants, Hunter Biden and the media. He also implied that Democrats had tried to assassinate his father in July, and encouraged attendees to make sure their friends voted Republican down-ballot. Kamala Harris\u2019 rally in Charlotte, North Carolina has otherwise proceeded much like her other campaign events, with the vice-president delivering a familiar version of her stump speech. She\u2019s encouraged attendees to make a plan for voting if they haven\u2019t done so already. \u201cWe need everyone to vote, North Carolina. You all will make the difference in this election.\u201d JD Vance is currently campaigning at a gun store in Scottsdale, Arizona alongside Donald Trump Jr. \u201cWe have the opportunity to put not just my father in the White House, but have you seen the team around him,\u201d Trump said from the stage at Dillon Precision, touting roles his father has promised Robert F Kennedy Jr, Tulsi Gabbard and Elon Musk. Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Charlotte was briefly interrupted by pro-Palestine protestors. \u201cOne of the reasons we are here is because we are fighting for a democracy, and the right of people to speak their mind, but right now I am speaking,\u201d Harris said. \u201cDemocracy can be complicated, it\u2019s all right. This is what democracy looks like.\u201d Kamala Harris is speaking at her second rally of the day, this time in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ahead of her appearance, Roy Cooper, the state\u2019s governor, urged Republicans and independents to vote for the vice-president. \u201cListen to the ultraconservative, well-respected leaders who worked with Donald Trump,\u201d Cooper said, referencing longtime Republicans like Liz Cheney who\u2019ve endorsed Harris. \u201cHe is a danger to our country, and he should never be president again.\u201d Preparing for potential social unrest ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, the national guard is on standby in at least three states and Washington DC, CNN reports. In Washington, governor Jay Inslee has announced that the national guard is on standby following recent ballot box fires there. Meanwhile, in neighboring Oregon, governor Tina Kotek says the national guard is prepared to respond to potential uncertainty, following another ballot box fire in Portland. And in Nevada, governor Joe Lombardo says 60 troops are prepared to oversee a \u201csafe and smooth election day\u201d. Meanwhile, law enforcement is preparing for election day in Washington DC, where more than 3,000 police officers will work in 12-hour shifts. Tim Walz is campaigning this afternoon in Flagstaff, Arizona, alongside interior secretary Deb Haaland. The city, which is located just outside the borders of the Navajo Nation, is also home to Northern Arizona University. Walz, whose lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan, will become the first female Indigenous governor in the United States if he and Harris are elected Tuesday, has focused many of his campaign stops on Native voters in Arizona, including by visiting the capital of the Navajo Nation last week. Speaking ahead of Walz, Haaland evoked her childhood growing up in a pueblo household and encouraged attendees to \u201cas Coach would say, leave it all on the field\u201d. Navajo Nation president Jonathan Nez was also in attendance. \u201cThe sovereignty of our Indigenous tribes is paramount,\u201d Walz said, noting his recent visit to Window Rock, Arizona, before encouraging voters to get to the polls. \u201cWe get to shape not just the next four years, but generations to come.\u201d As the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC kicks off, women and supporters are gathering across the country in the 8th annual march since the 21 January 2017 march spurred by Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and the Access Hollywood tapes. Here\u2019s the latest from around the country: After starting the morning side by side on the tarmac in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Kamala Harris\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s planes are now lined up once again in Charlotte, North Carolina. Both candidates are criss-crossing the country in a final blitz of campaign stops before Tuesday\u2019s election. Visiting the carpenter\u2019s union in Scranton this afternoon, Joe Biden used some of the unvarnished language that has come to endear him to many Americans (and gotten him in some hot water lately). Speaking about Republicans who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the Chips Act, as well as cut social security, Biden said: \u201cThese are the kinds of guys you like to smack in the ass,\u201d according to a White House pool report. This week, Florida will be one of 10 states where voters will weigh in on measures to expand abortion rights. The debate in Florida \u2013 which has turned from purple to red in recent years \u2013 has been particularly intense as Republican party leadership campaigns against Amendment 4. Here\u2019s Carter Sherman with more: As she stood in the parking lot of an auto supply store on Friday evening, Brittany Robinson was practically vibrating. With just a few days left before the 2024 presidential election, the 32-year-old Floridian needed an outlet for her anxiety. So Robinson decided to go knock on strangers\u2019 doors in support of Amendment 4, a ballot measure that, if passed, would enshrine abortion rights into Florida\u2019s constitution and overturn the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban. \u201cI wish I started earlier,\u201d said Robinson, a native of the Tampa Bay area who had never before canvassed for a political campaign. Living under Florida\u2019s ban, she said, is \u201cterrifying\u201d. When she was a freshman in college 13 years ago, Robinson discovered she was seven weeks pregnant and had an abortion a week later. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that now,\u201d Robinson said. As Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make their closing arguments ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, Americans are preparing to take to the streets in cities across the country for a day of Women\u2019s marches. Marches are planned in all 50 states. \u201cNo matter where you\u2019re voting, we are in a choice between freedom and fascism,\u201d Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, executive director of Women\u2019s March, told ABC News Live today. Harris and Trump have taken different approaches to earning female voters\u2019 support, with Harris campaigning largely on issues of reproductive freedom and abortion access, while Trump says he will be a \u201cprotector\u201d of women. Here are some photos from marches across the country \u2013 we\u2019ll keep you updated on any developments as the largest march in Washington DC kicks off: In the final days of the election, Taylor Swift\u2019s fans are trying to get out the vote among \u201clow propensity Swiftie voters across Pennsylvania\u201d. The pop star endorsed Kamala Harris shortly after the September presidential debate. \u201cSwifties for Kamala (S4K) sent over 250,000 mail pieces encouraging Pennsylvania voters to vote for Kamala Harris for President and take a pledge to vote. Included in 50,000 of the mailers was an exclusive \u2018Voting Era\u2019 friendship bracelet,\u201d the press release reads. \u201cAs of this release, over 4,600 pledges to vote have been submitted because of the mailer.\u201d The FBI is working to dispel misinformation about the election, saying today that two videos circulating on social media are false. One claims that the bureau had \u201capprehended three linked groups committing ballot fraud\u201d and another concerns second gentleman Doug Emhoff. \u201cThese videos are not authentic, are not from the FBI, and the content they depict is false,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. While Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaign on the east coast today, their running mates are hosting events out west. JD Vance spoke at a rally in Las Vegas this morning while Tim Walz campaigned in Henderson, Nevada. This afternoon, both candidates will travel to Arizona, where Vance will speak in Scottsdale and Walz will attend events in Flagstaff and Tucson. Speaking in Atlanta this afternoon, Kamala Harris delivered a familiar version of her stump speech, addressing the future of the Affordable Care Act, Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, abortion and contraception, Project 2025 and bipartisanship. \u201cI pledge to you to listen to experts and to listen to people who disagree with me, because unlike Donald Trump I don\u2019t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe wants to put them in jail, I will give them a seat at the table. That\u2019s what real leaders do. That\u2019s what strong leaders do. \u201cI pledge to you to always put country above party and self and I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.\u201d Harris will speak again in North Carolina later this afternoon \u2013 where Trump is currently holding a rally. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris-Walz campaign, said the team was \u201cfeeling very good about where we are right now\u201d. She pointed to the release of a new ad that draws from Harris\u2019s interactions with voters she met on the trail during her 100-day campaign, as an opportunity to create a \u201chigh impact moment\u201d in the final days of the election. \u201cWe are continuing to operate on this very broad map of the battleground states, where all seven of our battleground states are within the margin of error, completely in play,\u201d she told reporters on Saturday. O\u2019Malley Dillon repeated what the campaign has been saying for days, that late-deciding voters have been \u201cbreaking\u201d decisively in Harris\u2019s favor. Her campaign has pointed to Trump\u2019s vitriol-filled Madison Square Garden rally as a key factor. \u201cThese undecided voters, we believe, over the course of the last week, have been breaking in our direction,\u201d she said. The campaign also said that Harris was planning to vote by mail but were not sure if she had submitted her ballot yet. Kamala Harris has been introduced by Justin Martinez Posadas, a first-time voter and high school senior, at her Atlanta rally. \u201cI\u2019m the son of a factory worker and the child of immigrants. Vice-President Harris is the daughter of a single mother from a middle-class family,\u201d Martinez Posadas said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was honored to cast my first ever ballot for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\u201d He added that his grandparents, who recently became US citizens, also cast their first ballots for Harris. Joe Biden is speaking in his home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he has been joined by his granddaughter Natalie, who is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and the daughter of his deceased son, Beau. Addressing members of the carpenters union, Biden said: \u201cA lot of politicians have trouble saying the word union, but I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d Following a chorus of cheers, the president added: \u201cBy the way, neither does Kamala.\u201d Director Spike Lee and Georgia senator Jon Ossoff have begun speaking at Kamala Harris\u2019s rally in Atlanta, as Donald Trump addresses supporters at a rally in Gastonia, North Carolina. Tapping into current fears that there will be voter suppression in this election, Ossoff told attendees in Atlanta: \u201c[Trump] tried to throw out your votes. You all remember the phone call.\u201d \u201cYou know what has been given for the struggle for voting rights in the state of Georgia, and across the American south,\u201d Ossoff added. Meanwhile, Trump is speaking about the support he\u2019s received from customs and border patrol agents (saying agents have told him \u201che\u2019s the greatest president in the history of our country\u201d), the economy and the election (\u201cwe\u2019re just three days away from the greatest political victory in world history\u201d). JD Vance is expected to begin speaking soon in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Joe Biden will be addressing a carpenters union in his home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Harris campaign has released a new closing ad titled \u201cBrighter Future\u201d that will air tomorrow afternoon during NFL games on CBS and Fox. In the two-minute ad, Harris pledges to be \u201ca president for all Americans\u201d and promises to \u201cbuild a brighter future for our nation\u201d as her campaign seeks to draw out the differences between the vice-president and her opponent in the final days of the election cycle. Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declined to endorse Kamala Harris at a United Auto Workers union rally yesterday. The only Palestinian American in Congress, Tlaib has criticized the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza. Her non-endorsement comes as a voter survey published on Friday suggested that 43% of Muslim American voters support the Green party candidate, Jill Stein. Here\u2019s Edward Helmore with more on Tlaib: And here\u2019s Erum Salam with more on the Arab and Muslim Americans campaigning for Harris despite the Biden administration\u2019s support for Israel: As election day approaches, state and federal officials are preparing for social unrest and political upheaval that could suppress votes. Yesterday, the justice department announced it will send election monitors to 86 jurisdictions, the most in two decades. Meanwhile, Washington state governor Jay Inslee announced that the state will put national guard members on standby this week to support law enforcement and protect key infrastructure in the event of social unrest. The Washington state announcement comes just days after someone set fire to a ballot drop box there and in neighboring Portland, Oregon, damaging hundreds of ballots. A deep dive inside Donald Trump\u2019s campaign published today in the Atlantic shows how the ex-president has struggled to balance his chaotic tendencies with running a disciplined campaign. The report notes that after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, Trump\u2019s advisers encouraged him to stick to planned criticism of the Biden-Harris administration while the ex-president instead longed to attack Harris personally. As a result, Trump began communicating with two of his 2016 campaign managers, Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski, citing fears that he was being overly \u201cmanaged\u201d by his current advisors. The report includes two other notable asides: Trump wanted to start calling the current president \u201cRetarded Joe Biden\u201d but was dissuaded by current aides, and broke ties with far-right activist Laura Loomer when he learned she\u2019d had significant plastic surgery. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed a complaint against the Washington Post with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that the paper made illegal in-kind contributions to the Harris-Walz campaign through its advertising, the Post reports. A copy of the complaint released by the Trump campaign cites a Semafor article that suggests the Post purchased ads to increase readership of articles it had published that were critical of the ex-president \u2013 after the newspaper\u2019s announcement that it would not endorse a candidate sparked backlash and a wave of unsubscriptions. In the complaint, the Trump campaign calls the advertising a \u201cdark money corporate campaign in opposition to President Donald Trump\u201d. In response, a Washington Post spokesperson said the allegations were \u201cwithout merit\u201d and that \u201cpromoted posts across social media platforms reflect high-performing content across all verticals and subjects\u201d. A rally for Kamala Harris is filling Atlanta Civic Center on Saturday, \u201cthree days before we remind the world that the south has something to say\u201d, said US representative Nikema Williams, quoting the iconic Atlanta hip-hop group OutKast. \u201cThis election is too important to sit out,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is battleground Georgia.\u201d Just over 4 million Georgia voters have already cast a ballot, about 80% of the 2020 figure and 55.3% of registered voters in the state, according to the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office. Fulton and DeKalb counties, the two counties with the largest number of Democratic voters in Georgia, are slightly ahead of state averages for early turnout, but the election remains too close to call judging by early voting turnout. Errors in polling models are likely to be larger than the ultimate margin. Harris is expected to appear at 1pm. Donald Trump today announced a rally in Macon for Sunday. Morehouse College graduate Spike Lee and recording artist Pastor Troy opened the rally, with Troy performing Vice Versa. A record number of wealthy Americans are planning to leave the country as election day approaches, NBC News reports, citing fears that the election could spur political and social unrest regardless of its outcome. Immigration attorneys at high-powered firms such as Lesperance and Associates and Henley &amp; Partners told NBC that they\u2019re seeing greater demand for services regarding possible moves overseas than ever before. \u201cA survey by Arton Capital, which advises the wealthy on immigration programs, found that 53% of American millionaires say they\u2019re more likely to leave the US after the election, no matter who wins,\u201d the outlet added. President Biden is set to land in Scranton, the city where he was born, for a visit shortly and I spotted this truck parked on Biden street downtown. Scranton is a key piece in Democratic hopes to win Pennsylvania, a key battleground state this election. Hillary Clinton lost tremendous ground here in 2016 when she lost the state, but Joe Biden improved on that in 2020. Democrats are hoping to build even further on those gains this year, or at least not lose ground. In the final days before the 2024 election, Donald Trump is growing increasingly anxious, Axios reports. Although the former president\u2019s campaign is projecting confidence, a campaign official close to Trump tells Axios that the ex-president is asking more questions about polling and demanding more work from his aides in late-night and early morning calls. Before heading to North Carolina today, Kamala Harris will rally voters in Atlanta alongside director Spike Lee, rapper Monica and singer Victoria Mon\u00e9t. The vice-president will also be joined by senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and will be introduced by a first-time voter, according to the campaign. Then Harris will head to Charlotte, North Carolina \u2013 a state that both she and Donald Trump are visiting today. It\u2019s the fourth day in a row that both candidates will appear in the same state on the same day, as they attempt to swing through the most important battleground states one last time before Tuesday. At Harris\u2019s rally in Charlotte, her campaign says, Harris will be joined by actor Kerry Washington and again introduced by a first-time voter. The event will also feature performances by Brittney Spencer, Jon Bon Jovi, Khalid and the War and Treaty. Good morning, Cecilia Nowell here taking over from my colleague Tom Ambrose. As the final weekend before election day gets under way, Donald Trump called into Fox &amp; Friends Weekend to comment on the state of the race \u2013 and criticize a recent Harris campaign ad telling women they don\u2019t have to tell their husbands whom they vote for. \u201cCan you imagine a wife not telling a husband who she\u2019s voting for? Did you ever hear anything like that? Even if you have a \u2026 bad relationship, you\u2019re going to tell your husband. That\u2019s a ridiculous ad. So stupid,\u201d Trump said. During the call, Trump also critiqued Mark Cuban\u2019s recent comments that the ex-president avoids \u201cstrong, intelligent women\u201d, said he didn\u2019t know the comedian who made an offensive joke about Puerto Rico at the Madison Square Garden rally last week and responded to concerns regarding his comments about shooting former congresswoman Liz Cheney. He also shared that he has sued CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and thought the outlet should lose its broadcasting license. Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump head to North Carolina on Saturday to try to clinch support in the south-eastern battleground state just three days before Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. It will be the fourth day in a row that vice-president Harris and former president Trump visit the same state on the same day, underlining the critical importance of the seven states likely to decide the race, which opinion polls show to be on a knife\u2019s edge, Reuters reported. Trump and Harris battled to woo voters in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin on Friday, as the presidential campaign enters its final stretch. Harris made several appearances in Wisconsin on Friday, including one that featured the musician Cardi B, while Trump visited both Michigan and Wisconsin. At his rally in Warren, Michigan, on Friday afternoon, Trump tried to energize his voters, delivering an address replete with his characteristic fear-mongering about immigrants and tangents including musings about his hair. At a Wisconsin rally on Friday, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5 hour-long meandering speech that touched on top campaign issues including the economy and foreign policy \u2013 but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump during his opening remarks, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929 style depression,\u201d said Trump. Top Republicans have called on the White House to produce all documents and internal communications regarding president Joe Biden\u2019s statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump. White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden\u2019s statement, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press. The office of Arizona Democratic attorney general Kris Mayes is \u201clooking into\u201d whether Donald Trump broke state law when he said on Thursday that Liz Cheney should face rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d to see how she feels about sending troops to fight. \u201cThe Arizona attorney general\u2019s office is looking into whether Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Liz Cheney violated Arizona law,\u201d Richie Taylor, communications director for the AG\u2019s office, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe office has no additional comments to make at this time.\u201d Officials in the US battleground state of Michigan said they worry that the Democratic-leaning city of Warren could lag behind the rest of the state in reporting the results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, raising early doubts about the state\u2019s vote count. Warren, unlike Detroit and most other cities in Michigan, opted not to take advantage of changes enacted in a 2022 state law allowing for up to eight days of pre-processing of absentee ballots, Reuters reported. Instead, the city of 135,000 people will wait until election day to verify and tabulate more than 20,000 mail-in ballots. Elon Musk\u2019s troubled canvassing operation on behalf of Donald Trump and the Republican party is now facing a lawsuit in southern California filed by two women who say they were cheated out of wages and expenses as they knocked on doors for an embattled Republican congresswoman. The suit accuses Musk\u2019s America PAC, which has poured more than $100m into this year\u2019s election campaign, of \u201cwillful violations of the California labor code\u201d by paying the plaintiffs less than it promised and refusing to make up the difference. The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday. At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump\u2019s racially charged rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Guardian and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about \u201cgarbage\u201d being levelled left and right, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic. That\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Cecilia Nowell will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from the US election. On the second to last Sunday in July, Kamala Harris had just finished making pancakes and bacon for her grandnieces at the vice-president\u2019s residence in Washington, and was sitting down with them to work on a jigsaw puzzle when Joe Biden called. \u201cI got up to take the call, and then life changed,\u201d Harris recounted later. Biden, isolating with Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and facing calls from all corners of his party to step aside, had reached the history-altering decision to end his bid for re-election. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Harris said she asked the US president. \u201cBecause what a big decision.\u201d With Biden\u2019s endorsement, Harris, still wearing her workout clothes and hooded sweatshirt from her alma mater, Howard University, leapt into action. Time was of the essence. Over the next 10 hours, with pizza boxes littered around her, she placed 100 calls to Democrats whose support she would need to secure the nomination. A year punctuated by two assassination attempts, high levels of threats and harassment, and a number of troubling, violent incidents in the lead-up to election day will culminate on Tuesday with an election deemed existential by all sides. It\u2019s the first presidential election since the January 6 insurrection, a reminder of the ways political violence can manifest that leaves Americans with a fear that such an attack could happen again. Those who study the attack and its participants say they aren\u2019t convinced criminal convictions against them will fully deter those involved on January 6 from future political violence, but that the biggest threat is a lone actor, not a large, coordinated event. In the last few weeks, a man in Arizona was allegedly stockpiling weapons and plotting a \u201cmass casualty\u201d event, according to police who arrested him for shooting at Democratic party offices. The person behind explosive devices that burned hundreds of ballots in two drop boxes in Oregon and Washington is suspected to be a metalworker who could be planning more attacks. Arguments at polling places over political paraphernalia, banned at the polls in some places, have become physical. A young man waved a machete at a polling place in Florida. The risk of political violence only increases after election day, experts say, once races are called. Certain places could become targets of people or groups upset about results or who claim fraud. In the last week, the US saw numerous attacks on the voting process and threats of violence, and extremism experts are bracing for what comes after voting has ended. The goal of people committing these acts is often to create fear and distrust around voting or to sabotage the functioning of democracy. Still, election officials stress that voting is safe, and voters should not be deterred from voting because of any threats to the process, which are rare. Here is a timeline of the political violence seen so far during the voting period in the US. Elon Musk\u2019s troubled canvassing operation on behalf of Donald Trump and the Republican party is now facing a lawsuit in southern California filed by two women who say they were cheated out of wages and expenses as they knocked on doors for an embattled Republican congresswoman. The suit accuses Musk\u2019s America PAC, which has poured more than $100m into this year\u2019s election campaign, of \u201cwillful violations of the California labor code\u201d by paying the plaintiffs less than it promised and refusing to make up the difference. The women, Tamiko Anderson and Patricia Kelly, say they were hired last month and promised an hourly wage \u2013 about $25, according to their lead lawyer \u2013 to help turn out votes for Michelle Steel, who represents a closely contested swing district in Orange county, south of Los Angeles. It was only once the women started working, the suit alleges, that they found out they were being paid instead by the number of houses they visited. The suit further alleges that they were not reimbursed for work-related expenses, including the use of personal cellphones to track their movements along their designated routes. Musk\u2019s ground-game operation has come under repeated scrutiny in recent days following a report in the Guardian that canvassers may have skipped as many as a quarter of the houses they claimed to have visited in Arizona and Nevada, and a second report in Wired that revealed hired canvassers in Michigan were not told which campaign they were working for until they had already signed on. If Donald Trump re-enters the White House on 20 January he will do so emboldened by a power that no previous incoming president has ever enjoyed: immunity from criminal prosecution for any act carried out in his official capacity. The protection, awarded in a July ruling from the far-right supermajority of the US supreme court, changes fundamentally the dynamics of the Oval Office. \u201cThe justices wrote a how-to guide for a president who wants to break the law,\u201d said Michael Waldman, president of the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIn practical terms, if you are a president who wants to break the law, make sure your co-conspirators are also government employees \u2013 then you\u2019re off the hook.\u201d The immunity ruling, in Trump v United States, is the clearest example yet of the judicial feedback loop that the former president established during his 2017 to 2021 presidency. With the active support of Republicans in the US Senate, then President Trump appointed three new hard-right justices to the country\u2019s top court, creating a 6-3 conservative-to-liberal supermajority. Is it any surprise that \u201cphoto op\u201d is a phrase imported into British English from the United States? Of course it came from there, the land where the visual image sits right at the centre of the culture, with politics no exception. It was the Nixon White House that came up with it, specifically a press aide by the name of Bruce Whelihan. According to Washington legend, whenever the president was meeting a visiting dignitary, Richard Nixon\u2019s hardball press secretary, Ron Ziegler, would turn to his underling with an order to summon the snappers. \u201cGet \u2019em in for a picture,\u201d Ziegler would say. Too polite to put it that way himself, Whelilan would clear his throat and announce to the ladies and gentlemen of the Washington press corps, \u201cThere will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.\u201d) The photo op was born. Joe Biden promised a \u201crecovery for everybody\u201d as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow. One of two candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor \u2013 will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world\u2019s largest economy fared under Biden. The shock waves unleashed by Covid-19 were still rippling across the world when Biden took office in January 2021. In the US, and many other economies, they set the stage for an extraordinary rise in inflation. For months, the White House and Federal Reserve insisted the factors driving this surging price growth were \u201ctransitory\u201d. By the time the consumer price index peaked, reaching its highest level in a generation in June 2022, officials had changed their minds. The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle inflation in March 2022. Interest rates \u2013 cut to close to zero at the outset of the pandemic \u2013 were increased at 11 meetings, to a two-decade high. Suddenly the central fear looming over the US economy was not runaway inflation, but the specter of recession. As the Fed scrambled to cool activity in an attempt to tackle prices, warnings of a prolonged downturn cast a shadow. There\u2019s one story of the 2024 presidential contest that says that this election is all about men, and their anger. Men, in this account, have gotten a raw deal: the decline of the industrial economy in the years since the postwar boom means that many of the jobs that gave dignity, structure, and steady paychecks to their fathers are now gone, and some men, especially those without college degrees, have fallen into a cycle of desperation and despair, unable to make the kind of living for which they could respect themselves. This economic argument about men is usually followed by a cultural one: that women aren\u2019t as nice to men as they should be, or maybe not as nice to men as they used to be. On one end of this conversation, there are paeans to male loneliness and discussions of the male suicide rate, quasi-poetic odes to their depths of despair and acute feeling: women just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be sad the way that men are sad. On the other end, writers and commentators point to more recent cultural trends that they say have alienated men, making them feel attacked or unnecessary. They point, apparently seriously, to the fact that some young feminists online have used the term \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d which they say makes men feel bad, bad enough that their feelings are an emergency for the nation. They point to those t-shirts that were popular in 2017 that said, \u201cThe Future Is Female.\u201d This, too, is reflective of a great social pathology, a sign that we as a nation have failed men and boys. Why, they plead, can\u2019t the future be male? Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump head to North Carolina on Saturday to try to clinch support in the south-eastern battleground state just three days before Tuesday\u2019s US presidential election. It will be the fourth day in a row that vice-president Harris and former president Trump visit the same state on the same day, underlining the critical importance of the seven states likely to decide the race, which opinion polls show to be on a knife\u2019s edge, Reuters reported. More than 70 million Americans have already cast ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida, below the record early-voting pace in 2020 during Covid-19, but still indicating a high level of voter enthusiasm. Saturday also marks the last day of early voting in North Carolina, where over 3.8m votes have been cast, while the state\u2019s western reaches are still recovering from Hurricane Helene\u2019s deadly flooding. Harris plans appearances with rock star Jon Bon Jovi in Charlotte, the biggest city in North Carolina, which is tied with Georgia for the second-biggest prize of the swing states. Each has 16 votes in the Electoral College, where 270 are needed to secure the presidency. North Carolina backed Trump in 2020 but elected a Democratic governor on the same day, giving hope to both parties. Losing an election for the highest office is a crushing blow that no candidate forgets. But when the American electorate delivers its verdict next week, the personal stakes for Donald Trump will be uniquely high. His fate will hover between the presidency and the threat of prison. If he claims victory, Trump will be the first convicted criminal to win the White House and gain access to the nuclear codes. If he falls short, the 78-year-old faces more humiliating courtroom trials and potentially even time behind bars. It would be the end of a charmed life in which he has somehow always managed to outrun the law and duck accountability. For Trump, Tuesday is judgment day. \u201cHe branded himself as the guy who gets away with it,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, adding that, should he lose, \u201che is facing a lot of moments of reckoning. He could go to jail. He could end up considerably less wealthy than he is. No matter what happens, and no matter whether he wins or loses, there will be a reckoning over his health. Death, ill health, dementia \u2013 those are things even he can\u2019t escape.\u201d The property developer and reality TV star has spent his career pushing ethical and legal boundaries to the limit, facing countless investigations, court battles and hefty fines. Worthy of a novel, his has been a life of scandal on a gargantuan scale. Officials in the US battleground state of Michigan said they worry that the Democratic-leaning city of Warren could lag behind the rest of the state in reporting the results of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, raising early doubts about the state\u2019s vote count. Warren, unlike Detroit and most other cities in Michigan, opted not to take advantage of changes enacted in a 2022 state law allowing for up to eight days of pre-processing of absentee ballots, Reuters reported. Instead, the city of 135,000 people will wait until election day to verify and tabulate more than 20,000 mail-in ballots. The potential delay from Warren has worried some Democratic leaders that it could leave the results appearing artificially high for Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday evening, and that the former president would seek to exploit the situation by falsely declaring victory in the state before all votes were in. \u201cIf the state is close at all and we don\u2019t have returns from Warren, which is our third-largest city, it\u2019s going to create all kinds of concerns,\u201d said Mark Brewer, an attorney and the former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very worrisome.\u201d The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday. At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump\u2019s racially charged rally in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about \u201cgarbage\u201d being levelled left and right, the Guardian\u2019s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic. Nationally, Harris, the Democratic nominee, has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of error of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, often seen as the most important swing state because it has the most electoral votes (19). Harris has single-point leads in the two other blue-wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump is marginally ahead in the Sun belt: up by 1% in North Carolina and 2% in Georgia and Arizona. In Nevada, his average advantage in the polls is less than a percentage point. Writing on NBC\u2019s website, Josh Clinton, a politics professor at Vanderbilt University, and John Lapinski, the network\u2019s director of elections, pondered whether the tied race reflected not the sentiments of the voters, but rather risk-averse decision-making by pollsters. Some, they suggested, may be wary of findings indicating unusually large leads for one candidate and introduce corrective weighting. Of the last 321 polls in the battlegrounds, 124 \u2013 nearly 40% \u2013 showed margins of a single point or less, the pair wrote. Pennsylvania was the most \u201ctroubling\u201d case, with 20 out of 59 polls showing an exact tie, while another 26 showed margins of less than 1%. This indicated \u201cnot just an astonishingly tight race, but also an improbably tight race\u201d, according to Clinton and Lapinski. Read the full piece here: Around a month before the US elections, in the Kharkiv region, I sat down with a group of Ukrainian infantry soldiers together with the American historian Timothy Snyder. I suggested they ask questions of him not only as an American historian, but also as an American citizen. The servicemen were curious about the upcoming election, but mainly the chances of receiving significant military aid any time soon. They expressed pity that many Americans still don\u2019t understand that the Ukrainian fight is not just about us. It\u2019s in the world\u2019s interests to support the fight against blatant breaches of the international order. The anxiety of the American elections is felt more strongly in Kyiv among Ukrainian officials and civil society leaders because Ukraine has become a partisan issue, and part of US domestic politics. These groups have been trying for years to be on good terms with both Democrats and Republicans in the US. This was especially true during the long delays in Congress over the vote for security assistance to Ukraine. But engaging with the Maga camp has become difficult. This only got worse when it was revealed what Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, said in 2022: \u201cI gotta be honest with you, I don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d During the race, Vance has characterised Vladimir Putin as an \u201cadversary\u201d and \u201ccompetitor\u201d, rather than an enemy, and has generally argued that the US should be focusing on China, not Russia. This is what happens when successive US governments fail to tackle inequality. While millions of people live in poverty, a handful grow unimaginably rich. Wealth begets wealth, and they acquire political power to match. It was inevitable that one of them \u2013 now the richest man on Earth \u2013 would launch what looks like a bid for world domination. A vote for Donald Trump next week is a vote for Elon Musk. Just as Trump is using Musk, Musk could be using Trump as a springboard to perhaps even greater power than the US president can wield. Musk\u2019s secret conversations with Vladimir Putin, reported by the Wall Street Journal last week, and his contacts with other extremist world leaders, suggest a pattern of power-seeking that could be even more alarming than the prospect of a second Trump presidency. Trump, if he wins, will do to the nation what Musk did to Twitter: the US will be e-Muskulated. What this means is that those with the power to swarm, harass and crush people who do not share their noxious ideology will be unleashed. Elon Musk claims to be a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d. But his absolutism seems to extend only to his allies. Since he bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform has complied with 83% of requests by governments for the censorship or surveillance of accounts. When the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, demanded the censorship of his opponents before the last general election, the platform obliged. When Indian government officials asked it to remove a hostile BBC documentary, X did as they asked, and later deleted the accounts of many critics of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Top Republicans have called on the White House to produce all documents and internal communications regarding president Joe Biden\u2019s statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump. White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden\u2019s statement, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press. The Republican lawmakers said they question whether the decision to create \u201ca false transcript and manipulate or alter the accurate transcript\u201d produced for the National Archives and Records Administration was a violation of federal law. Representative James Comer, Republican chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik demanded the White House produce the records. They also called on the White House to make available for a briefing the top supervisor of its stenography office. Comer and Stefanik said: The White House cannot simply rewrite president Biden\u2019s rhetoric. We are concerned with the latest reporting of the White House\u2019s apparent political decision to protect the Biden-Harris administration, instead of following longstanding and proper protocols. At a Wisconsin rally on Friday, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5 hour-long meandering speech that touched on top campaign issues including the economy and foreign policy \u2013 but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump during his opening remarks, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929 style depression,\u201d said Trump. On immigration, Trump\u2019s message was characteristically dark. The campaign played a painful video of a mother describing her daughter\u2019s murder and blaming Harris for allowing the accused to enter the US without authorization. Studies overwhelmingly refute Trump\u2019s claim that immigrants are disproportionately responsible for crime in the US, but such claims are a feature of his campaign. \u201cThe day I take office, the migrant invasion ends,\u201d said Trump. He vowed to launch the \u201clargest deportation program in American history\u201d and said cities and towns had been \u201cconquered\u201d by immigrants, whom he referred to as \u201canimals\u201d. Since his Madison Square Garden rally \u2013 which showcased racist and misogynistic comments from a lineup of speakers, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d \u2013 Trump and his allies have sought to recast the former president and his Maga base as unfairly maligned. \u201cKamala has spent the final week of her campaign comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history,\u201d said Trump at the Wisconsin rally. \u201cVice-president Harris thinks you are Nazis, fascists,\u201d said the Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who spoke at the rally. Johnson praised Trump for bringing into his campaign Robert F Kennedy Jr, who ended his presidential bid as a third party candidate in August; and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who announced she had left the party in 2022. Johnson accused Democrats of \u201cdestroying America\u201d and credited Trump with making \u201cthe Republican Party the party of the working men and women of America.\u201d The office of Arizona Democratic attorney general Kris Mayes is \u201clooking into\u201d whether Donald Trump broke state law when he said on Thursday that Liz Cheney should face rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d to see how she feels about sending troops to fight. \u201cThe Arizona attorney general\u2019s office is looking into whether Donald Trump\u2019s comments about Liz Cheney violated Arizona law,\u201d Richie Taylor, communications director for the AG\u2019s office, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe office has no additional comments to make at this time.\u201d Trump made the comments about Cheney, one of the former president\u2019s biggest Republican critics and the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, to former Fox News Host Tucker Carlson at a campaign event in Glendale on Thursday, AP reported. \u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how she feels about it.\u201d He repeated his aggressive attack at his rally in Warren, Michigan, on Friday afternoon. \u201cShe\u2019s tough one. But if you gave Liz Cheney a gun, put her into battle facing the other side with guns pointing at her. She wouldn\u2019t have the courage or the strength or the stamina to even look the enemy in the eye,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I broke up with her,\u201d Trump commented, prompting some laughs. In an interview on Friday with 12News, a local television station in Arizona, Mayes said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d \u201cI have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona\u2019s laws,\u201d Mayes told 12News. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared now to say whether it was or it wasn\u2019t, but it is not helpful as we prepare for our election and as we try to make sure that we keep the peace at our polling places and in our state,\u201d she continued. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I\u2019m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest from the campaign trail throughout this morning. We start with news that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris battled to woo voters in the key swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin on Friday, as the presidential campaign enters its final stretch. Harris made several appearances in Wisconsin on Friday, including one that featured the musician Cardi B, while Trump visited both Michigan and Wisconsin. At his rally in Warren, Michigan, on Friday afternoon, Trump tried to energize his voters, delivering an address replete with his characteristic fear-mongering about immigrants and tangents including musings about his hair. He repeated his aggressive attack on Liz Cheney, one day after he first said the former Republican US representative should be under fire with rifles \u201cshooting at her\u201d. Harris meanwhile sought to draw a contrast, emphasizing at a rally in Wisconsin in the afternoon that she is looking to be a political consensus builder. \u201cHere is my pledge to you. Here is my pledge to you as president. I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI pledge to listen to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make. I will listen to experts. I will listen to the people who disagree with me. Because, you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy.\u201d \u201cHe wants to put them in jail,\u201d Harris said, repeating a line she\u2019s has frequently invoked of late. \u201cI\u2019ll give them a seat at the table.\u201d During his appearance in Warren in the afternoon and in Milwaukee in the evening, Trump repeatedly stoked fears about immigrants. In Warren, he said: \u201cevery state is a border state\u201d and falsely claim immigrants were being flown into the south-west. He repeated some of his most racist tropes, saying: \u201cAll of our jobs are being taken by the migrants that come into our country illegally and many of those migrants happen to be criminals, and some of them happen to be murderers.\u201d For more on last night\u2019s events, see our full report here: In other news: Harris told her crowd at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center that with four days to go, there was still work to do, but \u201cwe like hard work\u201d. Minutes beforehand, during a raucous warmup, the rapper Cardi B referred to Trump as \u201cDonnie Dunk\u201d and told the crowd: \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going to protect women whether they like it or not. Well, if his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want it!\u201d Earlier, Harris said Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric about Cheney \u201cmust be disqualifying\u201d as far as his suitability for the presidency is concerned. \u201cRepresentative Cheney is a true patriot who has shown extraordinary courage in putting country above party.\u201d Cheney for her part warned the public against dictatorship and a presidential candidate who \u201cwants to be a tyrant\u201d. Republicans\u2019 latest offensive and misogynistic comments have boosted Democratic hopes of turning out women on election day in a contest where the rights of women have been a central issue for the Harris campaign. At his Milwaukee rally on Friday, Trump called Harris a \u201clow-IQ person\u201d and vowed to save the economy \u201cfrom total obliteration\u201d in a 1.5-hour-long meandering speech that touched on the economy and foreign policy but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. \u201cI will stop the criminal invasion of this country,\u201d said Trump, promising to usher in a new \u201cgolden age\u201d. \u201cCan you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters are laying the ground for rejecting the result of the election if he loses, according to warnings from Democrats as well as anti-Maga Republicans. As well as baseless and/or failed lawsuits, suspicions have been voiced over partisan polls run by groups with Republican links in battleground states that mainly show Trump leading \u2013 the idea being that if Trump loses, the polls can be proferred as \u201cevidence\u201d that he was cheated out of the win. The New York author and journalist Michael Wolff has released audio tapes that appear to detail how Trump had a close social relationship with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that he has long denied. Wolff says the recordings were made during a 2017 discussion with Epstein about writing his biography. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges two years later. Trump\u2019s campaign said the claims, made on Wolff\u2019s podcast Fire and Fury, amounted to \u201coutlandish false smears\u201d. A federal judge rejected an attempt by Elon Musk\u2019s America Pac to have charges of running an illegal lottery heard in federal court, instead of the courts of Pennsylvania, where Musk is running the sweepstakes to help Trump get re-elected. The case has been sent back to the Pennsylvania state court for a further hearing on Monday. Racism and misogyny; a firing squad death threat to a former congresswoman; the Republican candidate for president dressing up as a sanitation worker in the cab of a garbage truck. Donald Trump\u2019s final full week on the campaign trail was as unedifying as it was bizarre \u2013 Richard Luscombe sums it up. A valuable Republican voting bloc in Arizona is seeing a shift of its members towards Harris in numbers that Democrats believe could make the difference for them in an election where the latest polls have Trump slightly ahead. That bloc is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2013 the Mormons.",

Whether that will be enough to make it 16<sup>th</sup> time lucky is anyone\u2019s guess, but <strong>Forever Young, </strong>from Japan, and <strong>Fierceness, </strong>the big US-trained hope, will be among the dirt-hardened opponents looking to exploit any hesitancy from the off.</p> <p>City Of Troy\u2019s run in the Classic was always going to be the focal point of today\u2019s proceedings, but there are, of course, eight more races to think about too, including four on the turf where European runners had a 3-3 clean sweep on Friday.</p> <p><strong>Bradsell</strong> and <strong>Big</strong> <strong>Evs</strong>, with <strong>Hollie</strong> <strong>Doyle</strong> and her husband, <strong>Tom</strong> <strong>Marquand</strong>, aboard respectively, will leave the outside stalls for the Turf Sprint at 19.41GMT, while <strong>Rebel\u2019s Romance </strong>and <strong>Emily Upjohn, </strong>with Frankie Dettori in the plate, head the betting for the <strong>Turf </strong>at 21.01. And once the Classic is done and dusted, there will still be time to run the <strong>Filly &amp; Mare Turf</strong> (22.25) and the <strong>Mile</strong>, where <strong>Notable Speech, </strong>the 2,000 Guineas winner, is expected to start favourite.</p> <p>It was a hugely promising start for the Europeans on Friday, but there is still much work to be done on Saturday before this can be filed away as a good weekend for the visitors. <strong>Japan</strong>, too, will be looking for a winner or two from the remaining runners in its unusually strong team for the meeting.</p> <p>It\u2019s going to be a thrilling ride with, no doubt, a big surprise or three along the way, and the Breeders\u2019 Cup action will be underway at 19.00GMT with the <strong>Filly &amp; Mare Sprint</strong>. Once we are underway, the action will be unrelenting, but keep tuning in here for video previews of all nine race, live results, betting, post-race quotes and more.</p> <p>For racing fans everywhere, it is time\u2026</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBNgKgYkuBE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sBNgKgYkuBE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Reveille \u2026</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s a wrap for the 2024 Breeders\u2019 Cup, a meeting that will be remembered by many for City Of Troy\u2019s no-show in the Classic but saw five of the turf races head back across the Atlantic and Aidan O\u2019Brien join D Wayne Lukas on 20 winners at the meeting. It is as certain as anything in racing that he will be back here at Del Mar next year looking for No.21. This is Greg Wood at Del Mar, signing off after Breeders\u2019 Cup 41. 1. FULL SERRANO, 2. Post Time, 3. Domestic Product. Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile! Three minutes to post time for the Dirt Mile, and Chad Brown\u2019s Domestic Product is the narrow favourite, he was a Grade One winner last time out. Bob Baffert\u2019s Muth is also attracting support. He was last of six on his most recent start but was a decent winner of the Arkansas Derby back in March. Victory for the three-year-old would make it a three-way go on 20 apiece in the all-time winners\u2019 list. There is one potential outcome of serious interest in the race, however, as D Wayne Lukas\u2019s Seize The Grey is the likely favourite to give his trainer a 21st Breeders\u2019 Cup win, and sole ownership of the all-time record once again. He won the Pennsylvania Derby at Parx last time out: It would be very hard to argue that the Dirt Mile is a suitable climax to the Breeders\u2019 Cup\u2019s main card \u2013 for most of the meeting\u2019s 41 runnings, it always built towards the Classic as the shadows started to draw in, which made for a terrific atmosphere. A European fan (or journalist, for that matter) can\u2019t really complain about the Classic\u2019s move towards the middle of the card, as it meant that the race was off at a much more viewer-friendly time back home. But there is already an exodus for the gates with 24 minutes to post for the final race and it will be run in front of half-empty stands, at best. That ends the meeting for European challengers, with five winners representing an excellent return from the two days but perhaps not quite what some were contemplating earlier in the day. Japan\u2019s wait for a winner, meanwhile, goes on, with only the outsider T O Saint Denis to come in the concluding Dirt Mile. Not to be for Notable Speech, who had every chance but was left standing as More Than Looks and Jose Ortiz produced a power-packed finish from some way off the pace. 1. MORE THAN LOOKS, 2. Johannes, 3. Notable Speech. Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile! Here\u2019s the vid of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic from the Cup\u2019s Twitter/X feed: The local punters are homing in on Notable Speech and he is a 2-1 shot on the tote. Personally I\u2019d rather have the power-packed finish of Porta Fortuna on my side at around 7-2, but it has to be said that my picks have not covered themselves in too much glory so far. The Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile is now relatively imminent \u2013 18 minutes to post \u2013 and a great chance for Europe to get a sixth win on the board. Notable Speech, the 2,000 Guineas winner, is in stall six with William Buick still looking for a double, while Tom Marquand is next to him in seven on Donnacha O\u2019Brien\u2019s wonderful filly, Porta Fortuna. Donnacha\u2019s dad, incidentally, has missed out on his last chance to get to 21 Breeders\u2019 Cup winners after the scratching of Diego Velazquez, while Chad Brown\u2019s Carl Spackler, from the widest draw in 12, is the biggest US-trained challenger to the big two from Europe according to the betting. It\u2019s not an ideal pitch for Carl Spackler but he was drawn wide in the Turf Mile at Keeneland too and it didn\u2019t stop him grabbing the lead. 1. STRAIGHT NO CHASER, 2. Bentornato, 3. Millikin Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Sprint! It\u2019s five minutes to post time for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Sprint, Mullikin, the Forego Stakes winner at Saratoga, is 3-1 favourite to give Flavien Prat a third win in a row on the night. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s immediate reaction to City Of Troy\u2019s defeat in the Classic was to blame himself \u2026 He lost it at the start and obviously I didn\u2019t have him prepared to come out quick enough. We thought we did but we didn\u2019t. He missed it and left Ryan with no chance really, the race was over at the start. 1. MOIRA, 2. Cinderella\u2019s Dream, 3 Didia. Full Count Felicia kicks for home but Moira has the finishing speed, Cinderella\u2019s Dream finishing fast too but \u2026 Moira holds on for Flavien Prat. Full Count Felicia leads, Content is mid-division. Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf! The pace in this race is likely to come from Full Count Felicia, and it wouldn\u2019t be the biggest surprise if she managed to cling on, as she did in the EP Taylor Stakes. Europe is still on for a clean sweep of the turf races, and Content has useful backup in the form of the likely favourite, Cinderella\u2019s Dream, who will be bidding to give Charlie Appleby and William Buick a double on the night. She finished seventh in the 1,000 Guineas in May but has since been having a high old time of it in the States, with at Grade One win in New York in July and a Grade Two success at Saratoga the following month. O\u2019Brien has an immediate chance to bounce back, however, and also take sole possession of all-time record for Breeders\u2019 Cup winners when Content goes to post for the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, due off in 16 minutes. So, Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s search for a Classic winner continues, he\u2019s now 0-16 with runners in the race on dirt and some of the US racing writers in the press room here are after-timing like mad \u2026 Here\u2019s the closing stages of the Classic from the At The Races Twitter/X feed: Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith are in the winner\u2019s enclosure to greet Sierra Leone, and looking suitably delighted. That was his first win since April 2024, although he has been keeping very hot company in his four races since. City Of Troy, sadly, was never a factor, he missed the kick and never threatened to get competitive. In a weird turn of events, though, his owners \u2013 the \u201clads\u201d from the Coolmore Stud syndicate \u2013 are also the part-owners of Sierra Leone, the runner-up in the Kentucky Derby and now the winner of the Classic. 1. SIERRA LEONE, 2. Fierceness, 3. Forever Young. And a no-show by City Of Troy \u2026 Into the stretch, Fierceness leads but here\u2019s Sierra Leone \u2026 Fast fractions, perhaps they will come back to City Of Troy Fierceness is second, then Forever Young, Newgate mid-division, City Of Troy third-last City Of Troy slow to stride Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic! Going behind, won\u2019t be long \u2026. Approaching the gates for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, Fierceness is now favourite at 3-1 with City Of Troy on 4-1 The betting is hotting up at the track and it feels as though plenty of money is finding its way into the market from Asia, because Forever Young is 3-1 favourite. Then it is: 7-2 City Of Troy, 4-1 Fierceness, 6-1 Sierra Leone, 11-1 Next, 15-1 bar. The third member of the \u201cBig Three\u201d, meanwhile, is Forever Young, who might well have become Japan\u2019s first ever Kentucky Derby winner but for the persistent interference of Sierra Leone in the stretch. Fierceness, the shortest-priced local hope, was a convincing winner of the Travers and the form has already been franked here today by Thorpedo Anna: Not the best of notes on which to move on to the Classic, but the time is now and City Of Troy will attempt to write his name into the history books in just under 20 minutes\u2019 time. Here\u2019s his last run in the International Stakes, when he was quick from the stalls and set a strong pace before quickening again in the closing stages \u2013 the characteristics, it could be argued, of a really good dirt horse. Sad news after the Turf: Jayarebe suffered a suspected \u201ccardiac event\u201d on the far side of the track while being pulled up. He was reportedly unconscious when vets arrived to attend to him seconds later and is thought to have died almost instantly. Emily Upjohn, meanwhile, was held up well off the pace by Frankie Dettori, who then launched an audacious bid to find a path up the stands\u2019 rail in the stretch. But the gaps did not appear, and she pretty much crossed the line without ever coming off the bridle. A concerning postscript to the Turf: Brian Meehan\u2019s Jayarebe collapsed on the track after crossing the line and is currently being assessed by the track vets. That\u2019s five-from-five for the Europeans on turf as William Buick seizes control of the race with a quarter of a mile to run. He fired Rebel\u2019s Romance into the lead on the final turn and threw down a challenge to his rivals to chase him down in the short home stretch, and while Rousham Park was gaining rapidly in the final stages, Christophe Lemaire ran out of turf. 1. REBEL\u2019S ROMANCE, 2. Rousham Park, 3. Shahryar. Rebel\u2019s Romance goes on on the home turn \u2026 he\u2019s got a big lead, here comes Rousham Park finishing really well, lead is shrinking but \u2026. Rebel\u2019s Romance reclaims the Turf crown! Far Bridge right there too, no move yet from Frankie on Emily Upjohn Rebel\u2019s Romance settled in third, Luxembourg close behind, Emily Upjohn one from last as they pass the post first time Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf! A delighted Kenny McPeek is in the interview room after Thorpedo Anna\u2019s win in the Distaff: She\u2019s so easy, she never misses a meal. A bit like me. Post time for the Turf is in 12 minutes, and the latest betting show from the track is: 9/5 Rebel\u2019s Romance, 5-1 Emily Upjohn, 6-1 Far Bridge, 7-1 Luxembourg, 9-1 Shahryar, 10-1 bar. Far Bridge, the shortest-priced home-trained runner, took the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Stakes at Aqueduct in September. If the Europeans are going to lose their winning streak on the turf, Shahryar, from Japan, could be the one to do it. He was a close third in this race at Santa Anita last year, and runner-up \u2013 behind Rebel\u2019s Romance \u2013 in the Sheema Classic at Meydan in March. Emily Upjohn is without a win since the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June 2023, but she has been keeping very strong company and was a close third behind the subsequent 1-2 in the Arc, Bluestocking and Aventure, in the Prix Vermeille in September: We move swiftly on to the Turf, where there is another strong team from Europe \u2013 perhaps the strongest for any of the turf races. Rebel\u2019s Romance, the winner two years ago, is back for another crack, while Emily Upjohn, Luxembourg and Jayarebe \u2013 whose trainer, Brian Meehan, has won this twice already \u2013 provide strong backup. Here\u2019s Rebel\u2019s Romance winning back in 2022: That was also a hugely popular win for trainer Kenny McPeek, a multiple Grade One winner over the years who became the first trainer for 72 years to win both the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks in the same season back in May. Coming into this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup, however, he was 0-37 at the meeting. A straightforward win for the favourite, who was quickly into the lead which she never seemed likely to surrender. 1. THORPEDO ANNA, 2. Raging Sea, 3. Candied. Raging Sea, the Personal Ensign winner at Saratoga, is the only rival attracting any money to beat the favourite: Two outsiders have gone in at the top of the Breeders\u2019 Cup card here, and the local punters will be hoping for some respite when Thorpedo Anna sets off for the Distaff in five minutes\u2019 time. She is a red-hot favourite at 1-5, not least because Idiomatic, who was expected to give her plenty to think about, was ruled out of the race last week. She has the form to back up the short odds, though, having finished second behind Fierceness \u2013 the big US-trained fancy for the Classic \u2013 in the Travers Stakes, and won all five of her other starts this year, four at Grade One level. This is her win in the American Oaks at Saratoga in the summer: Rossa Ryan is in the interview room: It was just one of those days, luck was on my side and it all opened so well. Hearing that Ryan Moore has bruising but will be fine to ride City Of Troy in the Classic. It\u2019s official, Ralph Beckett and Rossa Ryan have a Breeders\u2019 Cup win to go with their Arc success last month, and Europe is 4-4 on the turf so far! 1. STARLUST, 2. Motorious, 3. AG Bullet. There is also no news as yet of whether Ryan Moore is ok after being unshipped by Believing before that race. He is due to be aboard City Of Troy in the Classic in under two hours\u2019 time. HOLD ALL TICKETS! The provisional result is Starlust beating Motorious, AG Bullet and Star Of Mystery, but Rossa Ryan edged right and nudged unplaced Isivunguvungu inside the final furlong. That\u2019s a brilliant ride by Rossa Ryan on Ralph Beckett\u2019s outsider \u2013 but there\u2019s an inquiry! Bradsell chased up into second place on the turn, but Cogburn leads, he\u2019s clear \u2026 Cogburn three up turning in, starting to tire tho\u2026 deep inside the final furlong, Cogburn gives way and Starlust comes through to win! Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint! They got the saddle off Believing very quickly and she was led away. Starting to reload. Believing has been scratched and the runners have been taken out of the gates. Believing playing up in the stalls, Ryan Moore unseated. Heading to the gates for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint, the Europeans were three-from-three on the turf yesterday so can they extend the streak? Big Evs, who is drawn 11, is currently showing at 18-1 on the local tote, with Bradsell, who is widest of all in 12, in single-figure odds at 8-1. Cogburn, meanwhile, is odds-on at 4-5 to repeat his blitz at Saratoga, with Charlie Appleby\u2019s Star Of Mystery \u2013 a regular in north American turf sprints this year though with only one win, in a Grade 3 at Saratoga, also attracting support. I think I\u2019m right in saying that Cogburn was the first horse ever to dip below 60 seconds over that course at Saratoga. It\u2019s a slightly unusual trip, but even so, there have been plenty before him that tried. Bradsell and Big Evs will be very familiar to European fans, and their riders, Hollie Doyle and Tom Marquand, are, of course, are very familiar to each other, having tied the knot in 2022. Both horses and their riders were in the Nunthorpe at York in August, where Bradsell emerged victorious with Believing, who is also in the field here, in second. Wi-fi has returned for the moment, so fingers crossed. It\u2019s 20 minutes to post time for the Turf Sprint, which features a strong challenge from Europe \u2013 Big Evs, Believing and Bradsell are the headliners \u2013 up against a top-notch US-trained sprinter in Steve Asmussen\u2019s Cogburn. The Americans have dubbed him \u201cthe fastest horse in the world\u201d after he broke the track record in the Jaipur at Saratoga: The latest interruption arrived just as the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint was approaching its climax, and what a finish it proved to be. Scylla and Ways And Means were among the horses in a four-way go for the lead inside the final furlong \u2026 only for Soul Of An Angel, who missed the kick and all but tailed off after a furlong, to sweep around them all for an upset win. Please accept my apologies for the frequent interruptions to the service at the moment. Not for the first time, the richest and most powerful nation on earth is apparently incapable of organising a stable wi-fi connection in the media room for a global sporting event. Ways And Means moves alongside the lead Society and Scylla close to the lead, a sub-22 second opening quarter Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Sprint! They are heading towards the gates, Vahva and Scylla, with riding legend Mike Smith in the plate, are popular with the punters too. Steve Asmussen\u2019s Society is next in the betting, she won the Ballerina Handicap at Saratoga last time out: We have been racing here since what felt like dawn \u2013 American fans feel short-changed by anything much less than a dozen races on a card \u2013 but the Breeders\u2019 Cup races are underway in around 20 minute with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint over seven furlongs. The likely favourite here is Ways And Means, a Grade One winner at Saratoga in August who comes in on a three-race winning streak. A little bit about Del Mar. This is a beautiful and historic track, co-founded by the legendary crooner and turf fan, Bing Crosby, who was on the gate to personally hand out the first ticket on opening day in July 1937. The current season here, in fact, which runs until 1 December, is officially the \u201cBing Crosby\u201d season, and this is a track that likes to acknowledge and celebrate its place in racing history. It was the scene of a famous match race between the great Seabiscuit and Ligaroti a year after its opening \u2026 \u2026 and there are displays, photographs and old posters on the walls throughout the grandstand \u2013 did you know, for instance, that Betty Grable was a keen racehorse owner and fan here? Anyone wanting a really deep dive into Del Mar\u2019s past, meanwhile, should check out this page on their website, which goes through the decades in granular detail. Hello from Del Mar racecourse, 20 miles north of San Diego in southern California: where \u201cthe turf meets the surf\u201d and also where City Of Troy will bid to make history in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic later this afternoon, in the middle of the nine-race main card at the 2024 Breeders\u2019 Cup. When the gates slam open at around 21.41GMT, we can expect the most intense and compelling two minutes of racing action this year, and perhaps for many a year, as the Derby winner attempts to complete an unprecedented double with a win in America\u2019s most prestigious and valuable all-aged race. Fifteen horses from the Aidan O\u2019Brien stable have attempted to win the Classic, but none have had the mix of pedigree, class and racing style that City Of Troy will bring to his first (and last) race on dirt today. Whether that will be enough to make it 16th time lucky is anyone\u2019s guess, but Forever Young, from Japan, and Fierceness, the big US-trained hope, will be among the dirt-hardened opponents looking to exploit any hesitancy from the off. City Of Troy\u2019s run in the Classic was always going to be the focal point of today\u2019s proceedings, but there are, of course, eight more races to think about too, including four on the turf where European runners had a 3-3 clean sweep on Friday. Bradsell and Big Evs, with Hollie Doyle and her husband, Tom Marquand, aboard respectively, will leave the outside stalls for the Turf Sprint at 19.41GMT, while Rebel\u2019s Romance and Emily Upjohn, with Frankie Dettori in the plate, head the betting for the Turf at 21.01. And once the Classic is done and dusted, there will still be time to run the Filly &amp; Mare Turf (22.25) and the Mile, where Notable Speech, the 2,000 Guineas winner, is expected to start favourite. It was a hugely promising start for the Europeans on Friday, but there is still much work to be done on Saturday before this can be filed away as a good weekend for the visitors. Japan, too, will be looking for a winner or two from the remaining runners in its unusually strong team for the meeting. It\u2019s going to be a thrilling ride with, no doubt, a big surprise or three along the way, and the Breeders\u2019 Cup action will be underway at 19.00GMT with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. Once we are underway, the action will be unrelenting, but keep tuning in here for video previews of all nine race, live results, betting, post-race quotes and more. For racing fans everywhere, it is time\u2026",
