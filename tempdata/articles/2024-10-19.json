Harris has evolved from being interview-shy to embracing an interview blitz.

It\u2019s not something that can be done via executive orders.\u201d</p> <p>Griffen Thorne, also an attorney specializing in cannabis, felt the promise was \u201cclearly political\u201d, given the announcement came just three weeks before the election. Thorne and other experts the Guardian spoke to suspect Harris\u2019s campaign is attempting to shore up numbers with Black voters, particularly Black men, who are currently less likely to support Harris than they were Biden, according to a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html\"> New York Times</a> poll.</p> <p>\u201cFederal marijuana legalization is a sound policy and supporting it is a smart strategy \u2013 not just with Black voters, but with Americans across the board,\u201d said Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation with Drug Policy Action.</p> <p>\u201cAs a Black woman and the first person of color to regulate marijuana for both medical and adult use, I understand the challenges in creating legal marijuana markets that work for Black men.

Trump was joined on stage by running mate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance\">JD Vance</a> and billionaire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>. But if he was looking for moral support from his family, he would have to settle for Eric. His other children \u2013 and his wife \u2013 were notably absent.</p> <p>The no-shows at Trump\u2019s recent marquee event were indicative of a divided family keeping a lower profile than in past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">election</a> cycles. When he took the political establishment by storm in 2016, the Trump family business was part of his brand. This time, at campaign stops where he gives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/06/trump-behavior-final-meltdown\">disjointed and demagogic speeches</a>, he cuts a more isolated figure.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, is sitting the election out while his younger daughter, Tiffany, is pregnant. His youngest son, Barron, 18, has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/barron-trump-nyu-stern-business-school-bf02754085db99a49429efbb47b64626\">begun his freshman year</a> of college at New York University.

But appearances can be deceptive. Off stage, Don Jr is more influential than ever as a political operative.

Her <a href=\"https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FMfcgzQXJZxzLGgcKmSNQSXCRKXShwxJ.pdf\">stated plans</a> include increasing access to the cannabis industry and educational opportunities that would expand pathways to \u201cgood-paying jobs \u2026 [regardless of] a college degree\u201d.</p> <p>But some pollsters say that panic around Black male voters is exaggerated and that such narratives ignore their historical support of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>. They also note that the focus on Black men elides deeper nuances about Black Republican support as well as gender differences in voting among Black people altogether.</p> <p>\u201cTo say that for any reason we need to worry about Black men not supporting Harris or the Democrats is completely overblown,\u201d said Chris Towler, founder of the Black Voter Project (BVP), a polling initiative about Black voting behavior. \u201cI think a lot of the story around this need to regain Black voters is coming from a mainstream media narrative built around really poor polling on Black voters.\u201d</p> <p>The latest national data shows that Black men and women overwhelmingly prefer Harris for president, the largest amount of Democratic support she has from any demographic. Still, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/upshot/trump-black-hispanic-voters-harris.html\">some polls suggest</a> that such support is eroding. A recent New York Times/Siena College national poll reported that 70% of likely Black male voters support Harris (down from 85% of Black men who turned out for Biden in 2020) versus 83% of likely Black female voters. Twenty per cent of Black male voters said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, according to the poll, a six-point increase from the percentage of <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/\">those who voted for the former president in 2016</a>.</p> <p>Here\u2019s more context:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/harris-black-male-vote-polls\">Harris is panicking over the Black male vote \u2013 but polls don\u2019t show full picture</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T16:36:52.505Z\">at 5.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6713c6d08f08c6f693b78f50\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T14:57:28.507Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign is tapping into its star power ahead of the elections.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lizzo</strong> and <strong>Usher</strong> are just some of the prominent celebrities backing Harris against her rival, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us today. This blog is closing soon. Here\u2019s where things stand: Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech in Atlanta, focusing on topics revolving abortion access. Donald Trump called Kamala Harris \u201ca threat to democracy.\u201d During the former president\u2019s speech in the battleground state Pennsylvania, Trump said Harris \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be the candidate.\u201d R&amp;B star Usher spoke briefly to a crowd of about 10,000 Saturday at Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta assembled for a campaign rally for Kamala Harris with Barack Obama. The Michigan-born rapper Lizzo expressed her support for Kamala Harris at a rally in Detroit. Lizzo said she voted early, and encouraged the audience to do the same, calling an early vote \u201ca power move.\u201d Kamala Harris rallied at a high school in Detroit, Michigan. The Vice President delivered remarks at Western International High School in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday. Her comments come a day after Harris traveled across the state with presidential campaign rallies in Grand Rapids, Lansing and Oakland County. Donald Trump has wrapped up his speech in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, after attacking the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the US-Mexico border and promising to rebuild the country\u2019s military. \u201cWe will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered,\u201d Trump said, repeating the anti-immigrant remarks present at all his rallies. Donald Trump invited Republican Senate candidate David McCormick to the stage. McCormick is challenging Senator Bob Casey for the seat in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put you back in the White House,\u201d McCormick told Trump, \u201cto fight back on this crazy liberal agenda, the weakness of Kamala Harris that is taking us over.\u201d Donald Trump is over an hour into his speech in Pennsylvania. His remarks shifted from the economy to immigration. He repeated a false claim about the Tren de Aragua gang taking over an apartment building in a Colorado town. Trump then called General Mark Milley, who has labeled the former president as a fascist, a \u201cwoke general.\u201d Referring to the handling of immigration, Trump said: \u201cWe have to go back to 1798, when we had real people running our country.\u201d At Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Pennsylvania, a group of more than a dozen steelworkers took the stage. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero,\u201d said one of the members of \u201cSteelworkers for Trump.\u201d He said that, if his rival Kamala Harris is elected, \u201cPennsylvania will be an economic wasteland.\u201d The former president is set to hold another rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, this time in Lancaster. Donald Trump spoke about Pennsylvania-specific issues, including fracking, steel mills and energy prices. \u201cPennsylvania was the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the United States,\u201d he said. Trump told the audience that Democrats \u201cannihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs, and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and foreign nations all over the world.\u201d He repeated his plan to to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing. During the former president\u2019s speech in the battleground state Pennsylvania, Trump said Harris \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be the candidate.\u201d \u201cThey should have picked a candidate fairly, not just given it to her because they want to be politically correct,\u201d Trump added. The Republican presidential nominee said that Representative Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer approached Joe Biden about his candidacy and \u201ctook it away\u201d from him. \u201cI think he might have done better than she\u2019s going to do, because all we had to do is expose her as a lunatic,\u201d Trump said, referring to Harris. At a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump called the word \u201ctariff\u201d the \u201cmost beautiful word in the dictionary.\u201d \u201cMore beautiful than love, more beautiful than respect, no less beautiful than religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make our country rich.\u201d Trump expressed his appreciation for SpaceX founder Elon Musk\u2019s endorsement. The former president narrated the time he saw a SpaceX rocket fly across the sky. Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is scheduled to host a town hall in Pittsburgh on Sunday in support of Trump. The billionaire\u2019s political action committee, America PAC, did not say where Musk will hold the rally. Usher, an influential R&amp;B musician and bedrock of Atlanta\u2019s musical contributions, spoke briefly to a crowd of about 10,000 Saturday at Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta assembled for a campaign rally for Kamala Harris with Barack Obama. Usher did not perform, though he has two concerts scheduled in Atlanta this weekend. He appeared on stage ahead of Obama. \u201cI feel that this is a momentous opportunity for each and every one of us,\u201d Usher said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to choose a new generation of leadership for our country. ...\u201cShe fights for everyone\u2019s rights. For freedom. ... We have to strive to not allow our past to define our future.\u201d Usher, like every other speaker so far at the rally, pressed the crowd to vote early and to reach friends and family for votes. \u201cHow we vote \u2013 I mean everything that we do in the next 17 days will affect our children, our grandchildren, all the people we love the most.\u201d Donald Trump asked the crowd: \u201cAre you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d The audience yelled \u201cNo!\u201d in unison. He attacked Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration for its handling of the southern US border and the Middle East crisis. Trump then falsely claimed that \u201cthey stole the election from an American president.\u201d Trump is has recently started delivering his speeches on schedule. He began by telling the story of the Pennsylvanian golfer Arnold Palmer. Trump is holding his rally at the airport in Latrobe named after the golfer. Former president Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver his remarks at a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania soon. Trump will stage a rally at the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport. We\u2019ll be following his comments in the battleground state. Senator Bob Casey showed support for some Trump-era policies in his new ad, which aired on Friday in parts of the state, The ad features a Republican-Democrat couple from Old Forge praising Casey as an independent leader. They say he opposed Biden on fracking and backed Trump on trade issues like ending NAFTA and imposing tariffs on China. Barack Obama will hold an event on Saturday to rally voters for Kamala Harris on the first day of early voting in Nevada. The Harris campaign said the former president will encourage voters to turn out and vote for Harris, Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Democrats up and down the ballot. Former NFL star Antonio Brown is in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for Donald Trump\u2019s latest rally. Brown has continued to show his support for the former president before next month\u2019s US presidential election. The ex-Steelers star addressed the crowd of Trump supporters after teasing his appearance on social media earlier this week. In Detroit, Kamala Harris was asked whether the war in Gaza could cost her the election. She didn\u2019t directly answer the question, but she pointed to the Biden administration\u2019s calls for peace days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. \u201cThis creates an opening that I believe we must take full advantage of to dedicate ourselves to ending this war and bringing hostages home,\u201d Harris told reporters in Michigan. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and the Democratic vice-presidential pick, paid a visit to the city of Chicago before heading to a rally in Omaha, Nebraska. He spoke at a hotel ballroom in the city\u2019s downtown area and was introduced by Senator Dick Durbin. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the tired, divisive and old rhetoric of Donald Trump matches the tired, divisive and old Donald Trump,\u201d Walz said. Americans are paying attention to Kamala Harris\u2019s media blitz and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies, according to a CNN poll. A CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees throughout the race revealed that the word most commonly used in describing the news about Harris was \u201cinterview\u201d. Survey respondents referenced appearances on CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes and the podcast Call Her Daddy, as well as interviews with Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert. When Americans were asked to describe the news about Trump, \u201crally\u201d was the second-most commonly used word in response. Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters she\u2019s seeing \u201crecord turnouts\u201d of early voting in North Carolina and Georgia. \u201cIn Michigan, I will challenge the folks here to do the same,\u201d Harris said during a campaign stop in Detroit. Kamala Harris told reporters that she\u2019s dedicated more time on the campaign trail and called former president Donald Trump \u201cincreasingly unstable and unhinged\u201d as she rallied in Detroit, Michigan. The vice-president was asked about her rapid response toward her rival, which seems like a more aggressive shift than the way she was handling his attacks before. \u201cIt requires that response,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American people deserve better than someone who actually seems to be unstable.\u201d On Friday, the Democratic vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, joined sportscaster Rich Eisen to discuss his football coaching past, which included a high school state championship. He also talked about his love for sports in general. \u201cLook, people come here to get away from it like I do, I don\u2019t watch political programs on TV. I watch ESPN, I watch sports,\u201d Walz said. \u201cIt gives us that commonality. And I think there\u2019s people that are hungry for that, and I\u2019ve seen that at sporting events.\u201d Montana park ranger says Senate candidate Tim Sheehy lied about combat wound A former Montana park ranger has now publicly accused Tim Sheehy \u2013 a Republican running for a US Senate seat in the state \u2013 of lying about getting shot while at war in Afghanistan. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Friday, 67-year-old Kim Peach went on the record about how Sheehy \u2013 a former US navy seal \u2013 actually shot himself on a family trip in 2015 at Glacier national park. Peach\u2019s account explicitly contradicts Sheehy\u2019s claim that he was shot in the arm during military combat, a story that the Republican candidate has shared throughout his US Senate campaign. Peach said that Sheehy\u2019s allegedly self-inflicted wound left him with a bullet lodged in his right arm at Glacier national park in Montana\u2019s Rocky Mountains. He told the Post that he first met Sheehy at a hospital in the area of the park during the aftermath of the 2015 episode. Read the full story here: The Vice President delivered remarks at Western International High School in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday. Her comments come a day after Harris traveled across the state with presidential campaign rallies in Grand Rapids, Lansing and Oakland County. \u201cWe\u2019re not falling for the other guy trying to get rid of the Department of Education, because we know what we stand for,\u201d Harris said, referring to her rival Donald Trump. Donald Trump has previously said he wants to shut down the US Department of Education, saying that it should be disbanded to \u201cmove everything back to the states where it belongs\u201d. Lizzo, who\u2019s real name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, showed her pride in being a Detroit native during the rally. \u201cThey say, if Kamala wins, then this whole country will be like Detroit. Well, I say proud, like Detroit. I say resilient, like Detroit,\u201d said the singer. \u201cThis is the same Detroit that innovated the auto industry and the music industry. So put some respect on Detroit\u2019s name.\u201d Lizzo said she voted early, and encouraged the audience to do the same, calling an early vote \u201ca power move.\u201d \u201cThis is the swing state of all swing states. So every single last vote here counts,\u201d she said. Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman said Elon Musk as a surrogate in the Trump campaign \u201ccould resonate with a demographic in Pennsylvania.\u201d In an interview with Politico, the Democratic lawmaker recognized Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is perfoming well in Pennsylvania. \u201cHe\u2019s undeniably popular, and it\u2019s going to be very close,\u201d Fetterman said. He said that Musk, who\u2019s been recently campaigning for the former President, is a \u201cmeaningful surrogate in a business where most surrogates really are not that critical.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced it will host a \u201cBlack Men\u2019s Barbershop Talk Roundtable Event\u201d on Sunday in Philadelphia. \u201cThis event will focus on the challenges facing Black men today, including economic struggles, community safety, and the negative impact of Kamala Harris\u2019 policies on the Black community,\u201d reads the campaign email. Florida Representative Byron Donalds and local community leaders are scheduled to host the roundtable at 4 pm ET. Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, shared a photo from her mother Ethel Kennedy\u2019s memorial, showing her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., alongside President Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders. The image includes Kennedy family members gathered around a portrait of Ethel Kennedy, with Biden at the center next to Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife Cheryl Hines, seen at the edge, were notably unsmiling. Many family members, including Kerry, criticized Robert\u2019s challenge to Biden, and he now campaigns for Donald Trump after suspending his bid in August. As the US presidential election looms, the billionaire Mark Cuban has emerged as an energetic campaign surrogate for Kamala Harris. Making the case for business leaders to support the Democrat over Donald Trump, Cuban has drawn on his experience (in tech, investments, healthcare and now sports, as minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team), celebrity (as a lead \u201cshark\u201d for 15 seasons of ABC\u2019s Shark Tank) and willingness to confront Trump-supporting billionaires, Elon Musk prominent among them. The road has not been smooth. Last week, Cuban clashed with congressional progressives after criticizing Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, over her tech-sector antitrust work. That issue and others, including Cuban\u2019s thoughts on Trump\u2019s championing of tariffs and the perennial question of whether Cuban harbors presidential ambitions of his own, are addressed below, in emailed answers to 10 questions posed by Guardian writers and editors. Read the full interview here: The Undertaker said that \u201cElectionMania\u201d was coming up on November 5, and the people had the choice. The WWE star told viewers to choose wisely, as the nation depended on it. Donald Trump said that it should be an easy choice. It\u2019s not the first time Trump gets an endorsement from a WWE legend. Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan also endorsed Trump, and spoke at the Republican National Convention in July. From Fox News to Call Her Daddy: how Kamala Harris turned up election heat in pivot to media blitz First came \u201cjoy\u201d, with some cosy but unmemorable TV sit-downs with sympathetic hosts, a Vogue cover, and a billion dollars to spend on TV ads. Then reality hit: Kamala Harris\u2019 strategy to win over a mysterious sliver of undecided US voters was not working and she was slipping back in the polls. So the vice president went on Fox News, part of a pitch to white working-class women, who voted for Trump more strongly in 2020 than 2016. It was a win for Fox\u2019s news division \u2013 7.8m viewers, or four times host Bret Baier\u2019s nightly average \u2013 but was it a win for the Harris campaign? Showing herself to be assertive, Harris avoided serving up a unintelligible word salad, pushed back on Baier\u2019s line of questioning, aired some Democratic talking points, and ran down the clock until the 25-minute slot was up. \u201cLet me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI represent a new generation of leadership. I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington DC.\u201d Then the spin machine started up: according to Democrat voices, Fox News had helped Harris win November\u2019s election. \u201cI think she had a mission she wanted to do and maybe she wanted to have a viral moment,\u201d Baier later said. \u201cAnd I think she may have gotten that.\u201d But Fox\u2019s primetime opinion hosts spent three subsequent hours eviscerating her. Donald Trump congratulated Baier \u201con a tough but very fair interview, one that clearly showed how totally incompetent Kamala is\u201d. With $15bn spent on this election cycle, the candidates are still grasping for a campaign formula that will give them an edge. Harris has evolved from being interview-shy to embracing an interview blitz. She followed other Democrats on to Fox News because that\u2019s where, the theory goes, independent and Trump-neutral Republican voters are. But will any of it matter? There are no guarantees that undecided or unengaged voters today will be any less undecided in two-and-a-half weeks\u2019 time. Read more on Harris\u2019s media blitz here: Kamala Harris is upping her fire against Trump, pointing to his stamina and physical performance. On Saturday, the Harris campaign posted on the social media platform X a compilation of videos of her rival \u201cconfusing words over and over\u201d. At a rally on Friday, Harris mocked Trump for avoiding debates and cancelling interviews. She questioned whether he has the stamina for a second presidency if voters choose him over her in November\u2019s election. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign may be failing to reach thousands of voters they hope to turn out in Arizona and Nevada, with roughly a quarter of door-knocks done by America Pac flagged by its canvassing app as potentially fraudulent, according to leaked data and people familiar with the matter. The potentially fake door-knocks \u2013 when canvassers falsely claim they visited a home \u2013 could present a serious setback to Trump as he and Kamala Harris remain even in the polls with fewer than 20 days to an election that increasingly appears set to be determined by turnout. The Trump campaign earlier this year outsourced the bulk of its ground game to America Pac, the political action committee founded by Elon Musk, betting that spending millions to turn out Trump supporters, especially those who don\u2019t typically vote, would boost returns. But leaked America Pac data obtained by the Guardian shows that roughly 24% of the door-knocks in Arizona and 25% of the door-knocks in Nevada this week were flagged under \u201cunusual survey logs\u201d by the Campaign Sidekick canvassing app. The Arizona data, for example, shows that out of 35,692 doors hit by 442 canvassers working for Blitz Canvassing in the America Pac operation on Wednesday, 8,511 doors were flagged under the unusual survey logs. The extent of the flagged doors in America Pac\u2019s operation underscores the risk of outsourcing a ground-game program, where paid canvassers are typically not as invested in their candidate\u2019s victory compared with volunteers or campaign staff. America Pac denied it was experiencing that level of actual fraud in Arizona and Nevada and declined to comment on reporting for this story. A person familiar with the America Pac operation said: \u201cSidekick was never expected to handle the auditing of America Pac\u2019s door operation. The reason the Pac is confident in its numbers is because of the auditing procedures each canvassing firm puts in place and the auditing procedures of the Pac writ large.\u201d Here\u2019s more on the potentially fake door-knocks: Kamala Harris promises full marijuana legalization \u2013 is that a gamechanger? Kamala Harris announced on Monday that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level \u2013 the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition. As part of her pledge, she said she would take steps to ensure that Black men, disproportionately incarcerated and disfranchised by the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, would stand to profit from the industry. Vince Sliwoski, a partner at the cannabis law firm Harris and Sliwoski, said he \u201cwas happy to see it, because I like the messaging\u201d, but added: \u201cShe can\u2019t just snap her fingers and do it when she gets into office. It\u2019s not something that can be done via executive orders.\u201d Griffen Thorne, also an attorney specializing in cannabis, felt the promise was \u201cclearly political\u201d, given the announcement came just three weeks before the election. Thorne and other experts the Guardian spoke to suspect Harris\u2019s campaign is attempting to shore up numbers with Black voters, particularly Black men, who are currently less likely to support Harris than they were Biden, according to a New York Times poll. \u201cFederal marijuana legalization is a sound policy and supporting it is a smart strategy \u2013 not just with Black voters, but with Americans across the board,\u201d said Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation with Drug Policy Action. \u201cAs a Black woman and the first person of color to regulate marijuana for both medical and adult use, I understand the challenges in creating legal marijuana markets that work for Black men. I also recognize the profound harms caused by federal prohibition.\u201d Packer added that it makes sense for Harris\u2019s plan to include provisions that will remove barriers for Black men in cannabis and other domains. Notably, the pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority. During his administration, Biden made a number of promises on cannabis, including to expunge criminal records for possession convictions and get cannabis rescheduled so that it is eligible for FDA approval. The DEA has made progress on rescheduling, but it won\u2019t go through before the election. And Biden only expunged a small fraction of cannabis-related convictions during his administration. \u201cIt was kind of embarrassing, because he kept up on his website all this stuff he was promising,\u201d said Sliwoski. Read more on Harrris\u2019s pledge to fully legalize adult recreational cannabis: Kamala Harris will join Liz Cheney on Monday for a slew of moderated conversations in suburban communities across key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. The vice-president and Cheney plan to warn voters about \u201cthe risk of a second Trump term for America\u201d, according to a campaign email. Cheney represented Wyoming for three terms in Congress as a Republican. She was a staunch supporter of former president Donald Trump until he tried to overturn the 2020 election. The former lawmaker joined the House panel investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, turning Republicans against her as they sought to drive her out of her leadership position. The events on Monday will be held in Chester county, Pennsylvania, Waukesha county, Wisconsin, and Oakland county, Michigan. Could the once united Trump family be fading in this election? In late afternoon sunshine, Eric Trump shook his fist and led chants of \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d The second son of Donald Trump told a fervent crowd: \u201cThey tried to smear us, they tried to bankrupt us, they came after us, they impeached him twice \u2026 then, guys, they tried to kill him.\u201d A who\u2019s who of the Maga movement had gathered for a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, less than three months after the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt there. Trump was joined on stage by running mate JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk. But if he was looking for moral support from his family, he would have to settle for Eric. His other children \u2013 and his wife \u2013 were notably absent. The no-shows at Trump\u2019s recent marquee event were indicative of a divided family keeping a lower profile than in past election cycles. When he took the political establishment by storm in 2016, the Trump family business was part of his brand. This time, at campaign stops where he gives disjointed and demagogic speeches, he cuts a more isolated figure. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, is sitting the election out while his younger daughter, Tiffany, is pregnant. His youngest son, Barron, 18, has begun his freshman year of college at New York University. Eric, executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, makes occasional appearances on the campaign trail alongside his wife, Lara, who is now co-chair of the Republican National Committee. \u201cI get to go to bed every single night and wake up every single morning listening about voter integrity,\u201d Eric, 40, joked in Butler, with Lara at his side. \u201cIt\u2019s really great. I\u2019m really, really excited for November 6 when Lara can turn over in the morning and not talk about voter integrity.\u201d Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, 46, has been less prominent on the campaign trail than in previous election cycles. But appearances can be deceptive. Off stage, Don Jr is more influential than ever as a political operative. He has built a loyal following in the Maga universe via his Triggered podcast on Rumble and gained powerful allies such as Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point USA. Here\u2019s more on the Trump family\u2019s absence: Harris is panicking over the Black male vote \u2013 but polls don\u2019t show full picture With the US election only 17 days away, Kamala Harris is courting one demographic with particular fervor: Black male voters. As new polls warn that Black voters \u2013 who have consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates,at rates of at least 80% since 1994 \u2013 may be less enthusiastic about the Democratic party, Harris has released a new slate of policies specifically aimed at Black men. Her stated plans include increasing access to the cannabis industry and educational opportunities that would expand pathways to \u201cgood-paying jobs \u2026 [regardless of] a college degree\u201d. But some pollsters say that panic around Black male voters is exaggerated and that such narratives ignore their historical support of Democrats. They also note that the focus on Black men elides deeper nuances about Black Republican support as well as gender differences in voting among Black people altogether. \u201cTo say that for any reason we need to worry about Black men not supporting Harris or the Democrats is completely overblown,\u201d said Chris Towler, founder of the Black Voter Project (BVP), a polling initiative about Black voting behavior. \u201cI think a lot of the story around this need to regain Black voters is coming from a mainstream media narrative built around really poor polling on Black voters.\u201d The latest national data shows that Black men and women overwhelmingly prefer Harris for president, the largest amount of Democratic support she has from any demographic. Still, some polls suggest that such support is eroding. A recent New York Times/Siena College national poll reported that 70% of likely Black male voters support Harris (down from 85% of Black men who turned out for Biden in 2020) versus 83% of likely Black female voters. Twenty per cent of Black male voters said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, according to the poll, a six-point increase from the percentage of those who voted for the former president in 2016. Here\u2019s more context: Lizzo and Usher are just some of the prominent celebrities backing Harris against her rival, Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Lizzo revealed that she voted early for Harris, and Usher said last month that he was endorsing Harris. This week, the campaign announced a fundraising sweepstakes to win tickets to an upcoming get-out-the-vote concert featuring \u201csuperstar musicians\u201d. \u201cThis one\u2019s a real show-stopper,\u201d read a fundraising email signed by Harris\u2019s running mate, Tim Walz. Other celebrities endorsing Harris include Taylor Swift, Barbra Streisand, Ariana Grande, Beyonc\u00e9, Billie Eilish and others. Good morning, and welcome to our continuing coverage of the run-up to the US election. We sit just 16 days from election day. Today, Kamala Harris is hosting a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit, Michigan, for the city\u2019s first day of early voting, alongside Michigan-born rapper Lizzo. The Democratic presidential nominee will then travel to Atlanta, Georgia, for a rally with pop singer Usher. The eight-time Grammy-winning singer is currently headlining a three-day sold-out concert tour in the Atlanta. Early voting started in Georgia on Tuesday. Harris is also preparing to campaign in several battleground states next week when she will be joined by former Republican congressowman Liz Cheney. Later today, Donald Trump will hold a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where the former president and Republican nominee is scheduled to deliver remarks at the Arnold Palmer regional airport. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Harris questions whether Trump is \u201cfit to do the job\u201d of president again. She used a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday to seize on reports that Donald Trump had been canceling media interviews to question whether he has the stamina for a second presidency if voters choose him over her in November\u2019s election. In the past week, Trump has gone further than ever in branding his political opponents \u201cthe enemy within\u201d and talking about deploying the military against them. The latest polling figures seem to mirror such sharply polarised rhetoric, with the seven crucial swing states almost split down the middle in allegiance. Harris announced this week that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level \u2013 the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition. The pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority.",

But the vote for the major parties is now dropping to levels low enough that more and more alternatives are making it through. This means that voters disillusioned with the major parties have a bunch of options \u2013 Greens on the left, One Nation, Libertarians and many others on the right, and various independents across the spectrum. And there\u2019s no sign that this trend has hit its peak. The Liberal party will remain a force in northern Sydney, and I have no doubt that many of the seats held by independents will return to the party at some point. But northern Sydney is no longer the rock-solid heartland the party once used to supply so many of its leaders. And I don\u2019t think those days are coming back. \u2022 Ben Raue is an electoral analyst and blogger who writes about elections in Australia at www.tallyroom.com.au",

CNN reports that the documents which date from 15 and 16 October started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. Israeli airstrikes on Beit Lahiya in Gaza have killed at least 73 people, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday evening. In addition to several houses being destroyed by Israeli forces, multiple people have been injured, according to emerging reports. In a new statement on Saturday, Benjamin Netanyahu said: \u201cThe attempt by Iran\u2019s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.\u201d Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d, adding that Israel would continue to \u201celiminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them\u201d. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister\u2019s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d on his life. In a joint statement released on Saturday, G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel\u2019s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: \u201cWe \u2026 are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil\u2019s security.\u201d The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces\u2019 \u201cposture adjustments\u201d. Those include the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel\u2019s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, Austin said. \u201cThe number of civilian casualties have been far too high,\u201d Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in the Italian city of Naples. The history of \u201cdecapitation strategies\u201d tells us it is almost impossible to know what effect assassinating a key figure such as Yahya Sinwar will have, the Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke reports: Israelis and others have welcomed the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas and the mastermind of the 7 October 2023 attacks, as an \u201cOsama bin Laden moment\u201d. This reflects how many in Israel feel about the death of a man responsible for the murder of 1,200 people, mostly civilians and their compatriots, but terrorism experts have long debated the efficacy of eliminating the leaders of violent extremist groups, with some suggesting the strategy is counter-productive. The truth is that no one is sure. There are some cases where the elimination of a leader has brought definitive success. When the Mossad killed Wadie Haddad, leader of a breakaway faction of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and responsible for a string of spectacular terrorist attacks in the 1970s, probably with poisoned chocolates, his group disintegrated. Hijackings and bombings continued, but were carried out by others. Read the full story below: The US government is investigating an alleged leak about classified US intelligence on Israel\u2019s strikes against Iran, CNN reports, citing people familiar with the matter. According to one US official speaking to the outlet, the leak is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. CNN reports that the documents, which date from 15 and 16 October, started circulating on Friday on Telegram through an account called the Middle East Spectator. It added that the documents were marked top secret and were reserved only for the Five Eyes \u2013 the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The documents describe Israel\u2019s preparations for a potential strike against Iran and were reportedly compiled by National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, CNN reports. It added that the documents included plans about Israel transporting munitions around. Another document cited the National Security Agency and outlines Israeli air force exercises involving surface-to-air missiles, CNN reports. According to the outlet, a US official said that the investigation into the leaks surrounds who had access to the confidential documents. The UN acting under-secretary general humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, Joyce Msuya, said that Palestinians in northern Gaza are enduring \u201cunspeakable horrors\u201d as a result of Israel\u2019s siege. Israeli airstrikes on Beit Lahiya in Gaza have killed at least 73 people, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday evening. In addition to several houses being destroyed by Israeli forces, multiple people have been injured, according to emerging reports. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke to Benjamin Netanyahu after reports of an attempted drone attack on the Israeli prime minister\u2019s holiday home in Saturday. According to a Downing Street spokesperson, Starmer told Netanyahu that he was alarmed to hear about what Netanyahu called an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d on his life. The statement reads: The Prime Minister spoke to the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon. The prime minister said he was alarmed to hear about the drone launched towards Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s home this morning. They discussed the situation in the Middle East following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who the prime minister said was a brutal terrorist and that the world is a better place without him. He also discussed with Prime Minister Netanyahu the opportunity presented by Sinwar\u2019s death to halt the fighting and get the hostages out. The prime minister [Starmer] also stressed the importance of getting much more aid into Gaza. Finally, the leaders also discussed Lebanon and the importance of making progress on a political solution. Israeli raids have killed three people and wounded one other person in Zafta, south Lebanon, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Israeli forces also raided a car in Jounieh and killed two additional people, the ministry added. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Lebanon, where Israeli forces have killed more than 2,300 people \u2013 including at least 28 healthcare workers \u2013 in recent weeks while forcibly displacing 1.2 million people across the country: In a joint statement released on Saturday, G7 defence ministers expressed their concern over Israel\u2019s latest attacks on Unifil in Lebanon. The group, which has been meeting in Naples, Italy, said: We \u2026 are concerned by the latest events in Lebanon and the risk of further escalation. We express concern over all threats to Unifil\u2019s security. The protection of peacekeepers is incumbent upon all parties to a conflict. We also reaffirm the importance of supporting Unifil and the Lebanese armed forces in their role of ensuring the stability and security of Lebanon.\u201d The group also condemned Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks and said it was \u201cunited in supporting the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and a sustainable pathway to a two-state solution.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel\u2019s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated following the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, write Bethan McKernan and William Christou. The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister\u2019s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time. Israel\u2019s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, did not claim responsibility for the attack but said it fired several barrages of rockets at northern and central Israel, which killed a 50-year-old man in Acre. The rocket attacks came after Hezbollah said on Friday it had entered a new phase of the full-scale war that began with Israel\u2019s ground invasion of southern Lebanon earlier this month. The Shia group, allied to Iran, said it planned to send more guided missiles and explosive drones into Israel. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday, reviewing US forces\u2019 \u201cposture adjustments\u201d, including the recent deployment of an anti-missile system to reinforce Israel\u2019s defences against regional threats, the Pentagon said in a statement. Austin also told Gallant that he was relieved that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was safe after a drone attack reportedly targeted his holiday home in Caesarea, the Pentagon said. The US would like to see Israel scale back some of its strikes in and around the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said. \u201cThe number of civilian casualties have been far too high,\u201d Austin told reporters at a G7 defence gathering in the Italian city of Naples. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see Israel scale back on some of the strikes it\u2019s taking, especially in and around Beirut, and we\u2019d like to see things transition to some sort of negotiation that will allow civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes.\u201d The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said on Saturday that the killing of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the attack that ignited the war in the Gaza Strip, presented an opportunity for a ceasefire in the Middle East. \u201cThis creates an opening that I believe we must take full advantage of to dedicate ourselves to ending this war and bringing the hostages home,\u201d Harris told reporters. \u201cAs it relates to the issues in the Middle East and in particular in that region, it has never been easy. But that doesn\u2019t mean we give up. It\u2019s always going to be difficult.\u201d In a new statement on Saturday, Benjamin Netanyahu said: The attempt by Iran\u2019s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake. Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d, adding that Israel will continue to \u201celiminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them\u201d. Reports had emerged of his house in northern Israel being targeted on Saturday. The prime minister and his wife, Sara, were not home at the time. Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park. Two patients at a hospital in north Gaza have died during an Israeli siege of the facility, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. Agence France-Presse reports that Israeli forces have surrounded and attacked the Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahiya since dawn, Gaza\u2019s health officials said. \u201cIsraeli tanks have completely surrounded the hospital, cut off electricity and shelled the hospital, targeting the second and third floors with artillery,\u201d the facility\u2019s director, Marwan Sultan, said, AFP reports. \u201cThere are serious risks to medical staff and patients,\u201d he added. In the past year, Israel has routinely attacked healthcare facilities across the strip along with healthcare workers. In addition to restrictions imposed on medical aid, Israel\u2019s attacks on and sieges of hospitals have left tens of thousands of patients in Gaza without care. The Palestine Red Crescent Society has launched a second-dose campaign for polio and vitamin A vaccinations for children under 10 in Khan Younis. The vaccination points have been set up at Al-Amal Hhospital, Kuwait Red Crescent field hospital, Al-Quds field hospital, Ma\u2019an clinic, Mawasi clinic, and Qarara Mawasi clinic, the few remaining healthcare facilities that Israel has not destroyed across the strip. The Lebanese National News Agency is reporting a series of Israeli raids on multiple towns across the country. They include Yatar, Zubfin, Aita al-Shaab, Marouhin, Ramia and Beit Lif. The Lebanese city of Nabatieh is reeling following deadly Israeli airstrikes that targeted the city\u2019s mayor and civil defense workers. The Guardian\u2019s William Christou reports: Hussein Jaber, the head of Nabatieh\u2019s civil defence station, picked his way through a mess of shattered concrete and twisted metal piled knee high, surveying what was left of the city\u2019s Ottoman open-air market, built in 1910 and destroyed by Israeli airstrikes last Saturday. \u201cWhen we were kids, everyone would come here to buy their things. This market wasn\u2019t just for Nabatieh, but for all the villages around,\u201d said Jaber, 30, gesturing at the ruined promenade, still smoking five days later. Children\u2019s clothes, computer parts and products from the now-levelled stores that used to line the market littered the ground, all covered in a layer of grey ash. Also hidden among the rubble was a fragment of the US-made munition that destroyed the marketplace. The tail fin of a joint direct attack munition (Jdam) \u2013 the guidance kit which turns dumb bombs ranging from 500-2,000lbs (230-910kg) into GPS-guided bombs \u2013 was found by the Guardian and verified by the crisis, conflict and arms division of Human Rights Watch. A week earlier, another US munition was found at the site of an Israeli airstrike that killed 22 people in central Beirut. For the full story, click here: It is approaching 6pm in Gaza, Tel Aviv and Beirut. We will be handing this blog over to our US colleagues shortly. Here is a recap of the latest developments: Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza on Saturday showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message that \u201cHamas will no longer rule Gaza\u201d, echoing language used by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cWhoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace,\u201d the leaflet, written in Arabic, read, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online. Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of Gaza\u2019s eight historical refugee camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents. Israeli officials said the orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied that there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas, but local people and medical officials said forces were bombing houses and besieging hospitals, preventing medical and food supplies from entering to force them to leave the camp. After reports of a drone being launched towards Netanyahu\u2019s home in the northern Israel town of Caesarea earlier on Saturday, Israeli media published a video of the prime minister walking in a park. Earlier Netanyahu\u2019s spokesperson said the premier had not been in the vicinity of the drone. \u201cNothing will deter us, we will keep going until victory,\u201d Netanyahu said in the video filmed by one of his aides. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said on Saturday that more than 400 Palestinians were killed in the north of the territory over the past two weeks during a military assault Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas militants from regrouping. \u201cWe have recovered more than 400 martyrs from the various targeted areas in the northern Gaza Strip, including Jabalia and its camp, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, since the start of the military operation by the occupation army\u201d on 6 October, a Gaza civil defence agency spokesperson, Mahmud Bassal, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). Israeli airstrikes hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Saturday, Lebanese state media said, shortly after Israel ordered residents to evacuate, marking the first attacks in three days on Hezbollah\u2019s main stronghold. Israeli emergency services said a man was killed by shrapnel near the port city of Acre on Saturday after a barrage of rockets was fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. \u201cParamedics have pronounced the death of a man, around 50 years old, who was struck by shrapnel while sitting in his vehicle,\u201d the Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement. At least nine people were injured in northern Israel amid a Hezbollah attack on the Haifa area and western Galilee this morning, reported the Times of Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 55 rockets had been fired in the attack, including 20 at the Haifa area. Earlier, Hezbollah said it had fired rockets on Saturday towards Haifa in response to Israeli attacks on its strongholds in southern Lebanon. \u201cThe large rocket salvo\u201d came in retaliation for Israeli attacks on south Lebanon villages, said Hezbollah. Lebanese authorities said two people were killed in an Israeli strike on Saturday in Jounieh, north of Beirut, in the first strike on the area since Hezbollah and Israel started trading fire last year. The health ministry said an \u201cIsraeli enemy raid\u201d hit a car in Jounieh, with Lebanese state media saying the attack occurred on a key highway linking the capital to the country\u2019s north. Lebanon state media said four people including a mayor were killed on Saturday in an Israeli strike on a town in the eastern Bekaa valley region. The strike hit a residential building in the town of Baaloul, killing four, the official National News Agency said, adding that the dead include Haidar Shahla, the mayor of the nearby town of Sohmor. Israel\u2019s attacks in Lebanon and Gaza are pushing Iran to take \u201clegitimate steps\u201d, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said on Saturday, in an apparent show of support for Tehran\u2019s 1 October missile attack on Israel. \u201cIsrael\u2019s aggressive stance is forcing Iran to take legitimate steps,\u201d Hakan Fidan said at a joint press conference in Istanbul with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi. The European Commission vice-president, Josep Borrell, said on Saturday the killing of Sinwar opened a \u201cnew perspective\u201d for a ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cCertainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,\u201d Borrell told journalists on the sidelines of a G7 defence summit. Borrell also suggested the UN peacekeepers\u2019 mandate should be beefed up by the UN security council to give them more scope to act amid repeated attacks they say Israeli forces are conducting on their positions. More than \u00a311m has been raised in two days after a UK appeal to help those affected by conflict in the Middle East. King Charles, Queen Camilla, and the Prince and Princess of Wales are among those who donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee\u2019s (DEC) appeal, launched on Thursday. Two patients in intensive care at Gaza\u2019s Indonesian hospital died \u201cas a result of the hospital\u2019s siege and the power outage and medical supplies\u201d, the Gaza health ministry said. \u201cThe Israeli occupation is intensifying its targeting of the health system in the northern Gaza Strip, by besieging and directly targeting the Indonesian hospital, Kamal Adwan hospital, and al-Awda hospital during the past hours and its insistence on putting them out of service,\u201d the Gaza health ministry said. Israel\u2019s military said the troops operating in the area had been \u201cbriefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure\u201d. At the al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the building\u2019s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press (AP) reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the al Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An AP journalist also counted the bodies at the hospital. At least 42,519 Palestinians have been killed and 99,637 others injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. Gaza\u2019s health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Supporters of pro-Iran armed groups in Iraq ransacked offices affiliated with a Saudi TV channel in Baghdad early on Saturday, two security sources said, after the broadcaster aired a report referring to commanders of Tehran-backed militant groups as \u201cterrorists\u201d. After midnight, between 400 and 500 people attacked the studios of a production company in Baghdad that works for the Saudi broadcaster MBC. An adviser to al-Qaida\u2019s probable current leader is calling for Hamas to release its Israeli hostages held in Gaza, according to an US jihadist monitoring organisation, Site. Attention given to recovering the Israeli hostages, dead and alive, was overshadowing the fate of Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel, said Mustafa Hamid, also known as Abu Walid al-Masri, who is father-in-law to Saif al-Adel, the man widely believed to now head al-Qaida, in an online declaration. Naval drills hosted by Iran with the participation of Russia and Oman and observed by nine other countries began in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, Iran\u2019s state TV said. Israeli airstrikes hit the southern suburbs of Beirut on Saturday, Lebanese state media said, shortly after Israel ordered residents to evacuate, marking the first attacks in three days on Hezbollah\u2019s main stronghold, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). AFP footage showed plumes of smoke rising over the area, less than an hour after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order. Lebanon\u2019s official National News Agency reported two Israeli strikes on the same building in the neighbourhood of Haret Hreik, and later added that \u201cIsraeli warplanes\u201d had struck the Al-Umara neighbourhood in nearby Choueifat. According to AFP, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued an \u201curgent warning to residents of the southern suburb (of Dahiyeh), specifically those in \u2026 Haret Hreik neighbourhood\u201d. \u201cYou are located near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah, against which the IDF (Israeli military) will be operating in the near future,\u201d he wrote in Arabic on X. He later also issued warnings for the Burj al-Barajneh and Choueifat neighbourhoods. An adviser to al-Qaida\u2019s probable current leader is calling for Hamas to release its Israeli hostages held in Gaza, according to an US jihadist monitoring organisation, Site. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the online declaration was made on Friday by Mustafa Hamid, also known as Abu Walid al-Masri, who is father-in-law to Saif al-Adel, the man widely believed to now head al-Qaida, according to Site. In it, Hamid claimed the attention given to recovering the Israeli hostages, both dead and alive, was overshadowing the fate of Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. He also hailed Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s leader whom Israel announced a day earlier it had killed. Hamas must now \u201cimmediately\u201d return the hostages and their bodies, and \u201cthis file must be closed and not opened again, as we know its consequences,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cNo one cares about the Palestinian prisoners, neither in the media, in negotiations, nor in demonstrations,\u201d it said. Al-Qaida, held responsible for the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, was the target of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, where it was traditionally based. Its then-leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces in neighbouring Pakistan in 2011. Bin Laden\u2019s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was killed by a US drone strike in July 2022. The core al-Qaida organisation survives, and its de facto leader is believed to be Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian special forces lieutenant-colonel whose presence has been reported in Iran. Several experts consulted by AFP say Hamid is close to higher-ups in the core al-Qaida organisation. AFP reports that the group, which has spawned regional affiliates in Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Mali, has little leverage over Hamas, which is backed by Iran. Hamas on Friday vowed not to release any hostages under the Gaza war ends. According to AFP, analysts said that, with no successor to Sinwar named and a vacuum in Hamas\u2019s leadership, it will be difficult to find someone to negotiate their release. Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of Gaza\u2019s eight historical refugee camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents, reports Reuters. Israeli officials said evacuation orders were aimed at separating Hamas fighters from civilians and denied that there was any systematic plan to clear civilians out of Jabalia or other northern areas. Residents and medical officials said Israeli forces were bombing houses and besieging hospitals, preventing medical and food supplies from entering to force them to leave the camp. Reuters reports that health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army to evacuate the hospital or leave the patients, many in a critical condition, unattended. \u201cThe Israeli occupation is intensifying its targeting of the health system in the northern Gaza Strip, by besieging and directly targeting the Indonesian hospital, Kamal Adwan hospital, and al-Awda hospital during the past hours and its insistence on putting them out of service,\u201d the Gaza health ministry said. It said two patients in intensive care at the Indonesian hospital died \u201cas a result of the hospital\u2019s siege and the power outage and medical supplies\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said the troops operating in the area had been \u201cbriefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure\u201d. \u201cIt is emphasised that the hospital continues to operate without disruption and in full capacity, and there was no intentional fire directed at it,\u201d it said. Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza on Saturday showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message that \u201cHamas will no longer rule Gaza\u201d, echoing language used by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reports Reuters. The move came as Israeli military strikes killed at least 32 people across the Gaza Strip and tightened a siege around hospitals in Jabalia in the north of the territory, Palestinian health officials said. \u201cWhoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace,\u201d the leaflet, written in Arabic, read, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online, reports Reuters. The leaflet\u2019s wording was from a statement by Netanyahu on Thursday after Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers operating in Rafah, in the south near the Egyptian border, on Wednesday. After reports of a drone being launched towards Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s home in the northern Israel town of Caesarea on Saturday (see 8.43am BST), Israeli media have published a video of the premier, reports Reuters. According to the news agency, the video shows Netanyahu walking in a park. \u201cNothing will deter us, we will keep going until victory,\u201d he said in the video filmed by one of his aides. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said on Saturday that more than 400 Palestinians were killed in the north of the territory over the past two weeks during an ongoing military assault Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas militants from regrouping. \u201cWe have recovered more than 400 martyrs from the various targeted areas in the northern Gaza Strip, including Jabalia and its camp, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, since the start of the military operation by the occupation army\u201d on 6 October, Gaza civil defence agency spokesperson, Mahmud Bassal, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). Lebanon state media said four people including a mayor were killed on Saturday in an Israeli strike on a town in the eastern Bekaa valley region, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The strike hit a residential building in the town of Baaloul, killing four, the official National News Agency said, adding that the dead include Haidar Shahla, the mayor of the nearby town of Sohmor. More than \u00a311m has been raised in two days after a UK appeal to help those affected by conflict in the Middle East. King Charles, Queen Camilla, and the Prince and Princess of Wales are among those who have donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee\u2019s (DEC) appeal, launched on Thursday, reports the Press Association (PA). Millions in Gaza, Lebanon and the wider region urgently require food, shelter and medical care after fleeing their homes in search of safety, the DEC said. As donations from Britons, corporate partners and supporters surpassed \u00a311m by Saturday, DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said he was \u201cextremely grateful\u201d. He said: Every donation will make a real difference to people at this time. The levels of need are huge and millions are displaced, hungry and desperately in need of a lifeline of support. Giving through the DEC is the most effective way for us to get widespread and coordinated assistance to those most in need right now across Gaza, Lebanon and the wider region. DEC member charities are responding now and providing lifesaving food, water, shelter, medicine and so much more, where the needs are greatest.\u201d Madara Hettiarachchi of the DEC said that in Gaza crops have been destroyed, meaning access to fresh food has become \u201cseverely limited\u201d and prices are too expensive. She went on: As winter approaches the need is growing, and we urgently need more funds. The risk of famine is real. Without humanitarian access and support, hunger in Gaza will only increase.\u201d The UK government is matching pound for pound the first \u00a310m donated by the public, the DEC said. Agence France-Presse (AFP) have more on the comments by European Commission vice-president Josep Borrell that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar opened a \u201cnew perspective\u201d for a ceasefire in Gaza. According to AFP, Borrell told reporters there was much to discuss at the G7 defence summit being held in Naples, Italy, including recent strikes on the UN\u2019s peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, and the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cCertainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,\u201d Borrell told journalists. A morning session included discussions over recent strikes on Unifil, the UN\u2019s Lebanon peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah. According to AFP, Borrell suggested the peacekeepers\u2019 mandate should be beefed up by the UN security council to give them more scope to act amid repeated attacks on their positions they say are being conducted by Israeli forces. \u201cThey cannot act by themselves, it is certainly a limited role,\u201d he said. Earlier Saturday, Borrell wrote on social media that \u201ca more robust mandate for Unifil\u201d was needed. As the Naples talks began, Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto told the group that the \u201ccritical situation in the Middle East\u201d, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, \u201cprofound instability\u201d in sub-Saharan Africa and \u201cincreasing tension\u201d in the Asia-Pacific region \u201chighlight a deteriorated security framework with forecasts for the near future that cannot be positive\u201d. The Israel army has issued a new evacuation call for southern Beirut residents, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). No other details have been provided. Writing for the Guardian, William Christou spoke to those in Nabatieh, a city in Lebanon that saw its mayor and 15 others killed by an Israeli strike on Wednesday. Hussein Jaber, the head of Nabatieh\u2019s civil defence station, picked his way through a mess of shattered concrete and twisted metal piled knee high, surveying what was left of the city\u2019s Ottoman open-air market, built in 1910 and destroyed by Israeli airstrikes last Saturday. \u201cWhen we were kids, everyone would come here to buy their things. This market wasn\u2019t just for Nabatieh, but for all the villages around,\u201d said Jaber, 30, gesturing at the ruined promenade, still smoking five days later. Children\u2019s clothes, computer parts and products from the now-levelled stores that used to line the market littered the ground, all covered in a layer of grey ash. Also hidden among the rubble was a fragment of the US-made munition that destroyed the marketplace. The tail fin of a joint direct attack munition (Jdam) \u2013 the guidance kit which turns dumb bombs ranging from 500-2,000lbs (230-910kg) into GPS-guided bombs \u2013 was found by the Guardian and verified by the crisis, conflict and arms division of Human Rights Watch. A week earlier, another US munition was found at the site of an Israeli airstrike that killed 22 people in central Beirut. Similar scenes of destruction were repeated across Nabatieh, the second most populated city in south Lebanon, now eerily silent and devoid of life after a week of punishing airstrikes. European Commission vice-president Josep Borrell said on Saturday the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar opened a \u201cnew perspective\u201d for a ceasefire in Gaza, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cCertainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,\u201d Borrell told journalists on the sidelines of a G7 defence summit. Israeli emergency services said a man was killed by shrapnel near the port city of Acre on Saturday after a barrage of rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel. \u201cParamedics have pronounced the death of a man, around 50 years old, who was struck by shrapnel while sitting in his vehicle,\u201d the Magen David Adom emergency service said in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Supporters of pro-Iran armed groups in Iraq ransacked offices affiliated with a Saudi TV channel in Baghdad early on Saturday, two security sources said, after the broadcaster aired a report referring to commanders of Tehran-backed militant groups as \u201cterrorists\u201d. After midnight, between 400 and 500 people attacked the studios of a production company in Baghdad that works for the Saudi broadcaster MBC, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThey wrecked the electronic equipment, the computers, and set fire to a part of the building,\u201d an interior ministry source told AFP on condition of anonymity. He said the fire had been extinguished and the crowd dispersed by police. \u201cSecurity forces are still deployed near the building,\u201d he added. There were no immediate reports of arrests. On Saturday morning, a large police presence remained in the area, blocking access to the site, according to an AFP photographer. \u201cThe demonstrators arrived at the offices before reinforcements of riot police were sent in,\u201d a police source told AFP, also speaking on condition of anonymity. The second source confirmed that the offices had been \u201cset on fire\u201d and \u201cbadly ransacked\u201d. At least 42,519 Palestinians have been killed and 99,637 others injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Saturday. Gaza\u2019s health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. At least nine people were injured in northern Israel amid a Hezbollah attack on the Haifa area and western Galilee this morning, reports the Times of Israel. According to the publication, a 28-year-old was left in\u201c light-to-moderate condition after being hit by shrapnel\u201d after a home was hit in Kiryat Ata and a man and women in their forties were treated by Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom emergency services. The Times of Israel reported that \u201cin a separate rocket impact on a road in the western Galilee, MDA says four people were wounded, including a man in his 30s in moderate condition after being hit by shrapnel, and three others who were lightly hurt by the blast\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 55 rockets had been fired in the attack, including 20 at the Haifa area. Earlier, Hezbollah said it had fired rockets on Saturday towards Haifa in response to Israeli attacks on its strongholds in southern Lebanon. \u201cThe large rocket salvo\u201d came in retaliation for Israeli attacks on south Lebanon villages, said Hezbollah. Israel\u2019s attacks in Lebanon and Gaza are pushing Iran to take \u201clegitimate steps\u201d, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister said on Saturday, in an apparent show of support for Tehran\u2019s 1 October missile attack on Israel, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cIsrael\u2019s aggressive stance is forcing Iran to take legitimate steps,\u201d Hakan Fidan said at a joint press conference in Istanbul with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi. Hezbollah said it fired rockets on Saturday towards a region north of Israel\u2019s Haifa in response to Israeli attacks on its strongholds in southern Lebanon, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cThe large rocket salvo\u201d came in retaliation for Israeli attacks on south Lebanon villages, Hezbollah announced after the Israeli army said a barrage of projectiles was fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, with sirens blaring at regular intervals. Here are some of the latest images coming in via the news wires: Naval drills hosted by Iran with the participation of Russia and Oman and observed by nine other countries began in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, Iran\u2019s state TV said, according to Reuters. The exercises, dubbed \u201cIMEX 2024\u201d, are aimed at boosting \u201ccollective security in the region, expand multilateral cooperation, and display the goodwill and capabilities to safeguard peace, friendship and maritime security\u201d, the English-language Press TV said. Participants would practice tactics to ensure international maritime trade security, protect maritime routes, enhance humanitarian measures and exchange information on rescue and relief operations, it said. The exercises coincide with heightened tensions in the region as Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza rages and Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels retaliate by launching attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Reuters reports that in response to regional tensions with the US, Iran has increased its military cooperation with Russia and China. In March, Iran, China and Russia held their fifth joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman. Countries observing the current drills include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Thailand. More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, reports the Associated Press (AP). The Palestinian health ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospital\u2019s building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff (see 8.33am BST). At the al-Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the building\u2019s top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital where the casualties were taken. An AP reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the al Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An AP journalist also counted the bodies at this hospital. G7 defence ministers started talks on Saturday against a backdrop of escalation in the Middle East and mounting pressure on Ukraine as it faces another winter of fighting, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Italy, holding the rotating presidency of the G7 countries, organised the body\u2019s first ministerial meeting dedicated to defence, staged in Naples, the southern city that is also home to a Nato base. Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto welcomed each of the attenders, who also included Nato chief Mark Rutte. \u201cI believe that our presence today \u2026 sends a strong message to those who try to hinder our democratic systems,\u201d Crosetto told ministers as he opened the event, reports AFP. Crosetto said on Friday in Brussels he had requested the summit, given the many conflicts facing the international community. \u201cAmple space\u201d would be given to discussing the escalating Middle East conflict during the one-day summit, Crosetto said. The meeting comes two days after Israel announced it had killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sinwar\u2019s death in the Palestinian territory signalled \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of the war against Hamas, while US president Joe Biden saying it opened the door to \u201ca path to peace\u201d. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was in Lebanon on Friday, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah. Speaking in Beirut, Meloni slammed attacks on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon as \u201cunacceptable\u201d after the UN force accused Israel of targeting their positions. Italy has about 1,000 troops in the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which has soldiers from more than 50 countries. Further to the report earlier that at least two people were killed in an Israeli strike near the town of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Reuters has some more detail on the story. The news agency reports that an Israeli military spokesperson said the report of the strike in Jounieh was being looked into. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah. The Lebanese health ministry said the Israeli strike targeted a car. Two witnesses told Reuters they heard a small blast and saw a Honda sports utility vehicle travelling on the main highway south in the direction of Beirut begin to lose control. The car stopped about 100 metres down the highway and a man and a woman ran out of the vehicle and into a grassy area on the side of the highway before another blast, the witnesses said. One witness told Reuters they had then seen the charred remains of a person in the grassy area. Agence France-Presse (AFP) have more detail on the story that a drone was launched towards Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s house. Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement: A UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) was launched toward the prime minister\u2019s residence in Caesarea. The prime minister and his wife were not at the location, and there were no injuries in the incident.\u201d It was not immediately clear whether the structure hit as reported earlier by the military (see 8.43am BST) was his residence, reports AFP. Reuters reports that a drone was launched towards Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s home in the northern Israel town of Caesarea on Saturday, citing his spokesperson. The spokesperson added that Netanyahu was not in the vicinity and there were no casualties. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the Israeli military said a drone was spotted crossing into the country from Lebanon on Saturday and struck the central town of Caesarea. It said two other drones were intercepted. The drone \u201chit a structure in the area of Caesarea\u201d without causing any casualties, the military said, without elaborating. Health authorities in Gaza said Israeli forces surrounded and shelled the Indonesian hospital in the territory\u2019s northern town of Beit Lahiya at dawn on Saturday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). \u201cIsraeli tanks have completely surrounded the hospital, cut off electricity and shelled the hospital, targeting the second and third floors with artillery,\u201d said the facility\u2019s director, Marwan Sultan. He added: There are serious risks to medical staff and patients.\u201d In a statement, Gaza\u2019s health ministry also said Israel had targeted the upper floors, adding there were \u201cmore than 40 patients and wounded in addition to the medical staff\u201d present. \u201cHeavy gunfire\u201d towards the hospital and its courtyard had sparked a \u201cstate of great panic\u201d among patients and staff, it added. Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza earlier this month, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there. Gaza\u2019s civil defence agency said an Israeli strike the night before in nearby Jabalia killed 33 people. The UN humanitarian affairs agency on Friday continued \u201cto sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment.\u201d Lebanese authorities said two people were killed in an Israeli strike on Saturday in Jounieh, north of Beirut, in the first strike on the area since Hezbollah and Israel started trading fire last year, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The health ministry said an \u201cIsraeli enemy raid\u201d hit a car in Jounieh, with Lebanese state media saying the attack occurred on a key highway linking the capital to the country\u2019s north. At least 72 Palestinians were reportedly killed on Friday as Israel launched new airstrikes and sent more troops into Gaza, dashing brief hopes among many residents of the territory that Thursday\u2019s killing of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, could bring an end to the war. At least 33 people were killed and 85 injured in Israeli strikes that hit several houses on Friday in Jabalia in northern Gaza, medics said, where residents said tanks blew up roads and houses. Reuters reported that the Hamas-run Gaza government media office said the death toll from the strikes could rise because some people were believed to be trapped under the rubble, and the Palestinian official news agency Wafa said children were among those killed. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Other Israeli strikes killed at least 39 Palestinians across Gaza on Friday, 20 of them in Jabalia, the Gaza health ministry said. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s supreme leader said Hamas would survive after Sinwar\u2019s death. \u201cHis loss is certainly painful for the resistance front\u201d against Israel, \u201cbut it will not end at all with the martyrdom of Sinwar\u201d, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement. In Jabalia, residents said Israeli tanks had reached the heart of the camp after pushing through suburbs and residential districts. They said the Israeli army was destroying dozens of houses daily, from the air and the ground, and by placing bombs in buildings then detonating them remotely. The Israeli military says its operation in Jabalia is intended to stop Hamas fighters regrouping for more attacks. Residents said Israeli forces had effectively isolated the far northern Gazan towns of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahiya from Gaza City, blocking movement except for those families heeding evacuation orders and leaving the three towns. They said communications and internet services had been cut, disrupting rescue operations. In other developments: Hamas confirmed the death of Yahya Sinwar in a defiant message that vowed the group would be undeterred by his killing. Senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said its leader\u2019s death \u201cwill only increase the strength and solidity of our movement\u201d, adding that the group will not release the hostages it is holding captive in Gaza until Israel ends the war. Hamas\u2019s armed wing, the Qassam brigades, vowed to keep fighting Israel until the \u201cliberation of Palestine\u201d as it mourned Sinwar\u2019s death. Israeli military officials said Israel was sending reinforcements to bolster its operation in Jabalia, raising fears of an escalation of violence there. Israel has issued evacuation orders for inhabitants in almost all of northern Gaza, but many cannot or do not want to comply. Tens of thousands of civilians are thought to be trapped in Jabalia, where conditions are deteriorating. Health officials have appealed for fuel, medical supplies and food to be sent immediately to three northern Gaza hospitals overwhelmed by the number of patients injured in Israeli attacks. Supporters of pro-Iran armed groups in Iraq ransacked the offices of a Saudi TV channel in Baghdad early on Saturday, a security source said, after the broadcaster aired a report referring to commanders of Tehran-backed militant groups as \u201cterrorists\u201d. Agence France-Presse reported that 400 to 500 people attacked the Baghdad studios of Saudi broadcaster MBC after midnight. \u201cThey wrecked the electronic equipment, the computers, and set fire to a part of the building,\u201d an interior ministry source said on condition of anonymity. The fire had been extinguished and the crowd dispersed by police, he said. More than 42,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began, according to the Palestinian health ministry on Friday. Almost 100,000 have been injured. Six medical humanitarian groups were informed this week that their medical missions will now be denied entry into Gaza. The leaders of the US, the UK, France and Germany released a joint statement where they stressed the \u201cimmediate necessity\u201d for ending the war in Gaza. The leaders discussed events in the Middle East, particularly the \u201cimplications\u201d of Sinwar\u2019s death, as well as the need to \u201cbring the hostages home to their families, for ending the war in Gaza and ensure humanitarian aid reaches civilians\u201d. Biden said Sinwar\u2019s death raises \u201cthe prospect of a ceasefire\u201d and \u201crepresents a moment of justice\u201d. World leaders continued to respond to news of Sinwar\u2019s death. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said \u201cno one should mourn the death\u201d of the Hamas leader who has Israelis and Palestinians on his hands. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he hoped it would open the door to a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said the Hamas leader fought and died \u201clike a hero\u201d but that \u201cthe martyrdom of commanders, leaders and heroes will not make a dent in the Islamic people\u2019s fight against oppression and occupation\u201d. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are facing an increase in Israeli settler attacks and Israeli army violence at the start of the important olive harvest season, the UN has said. The international body\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel on Friday of using \u201cwar-like\u201d tactics in the West Bank amid a rise in killings and settler attacks since the olive harvest got under way last week. Nine people were killed by Israeli forces between 8 and 14 October, OCHA said. Israeli airstrikes killed several Lebanese citizens and injured others across Lebanon on Friday morning, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency reported, without specifying the number of casualties. A number of civilians were reportedly killed in the town of Ansar, a village in southern Lebanon, as a result of the Israeli attacks. Wafa reported the strikes also targeted various towns including al-Duwayr, Baraachit, Dabbal, Haneen, Khiam and Ramiyah. The Israeli army urged residents of 23 villages in southern Lebanon on Friday to evacuate northward as it intensifies its attacks in the region. The Israeli military\u2019s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said on X that residents were \u201cprohibited from going south\u201d and that doing so \u201ccould be dangerous to your life\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 45 people were killed and 179 injured in Israeli attacks across the country on Thursday. Al Jazeera journalist Fadi Al-Wahidi has fallen into a coma more than a week after being shot in the neck by an Israeli sniper in northern Gaza, the broadcaster reported on Friday, adding that Israel has not responded to requests to allow his evacuation for medical treatment.",

The 48-year-old told the Sunday Times that a scan in September showed a tumour in his shoulder. And a second scan two days later found the main cancer to be in his prostate which has since metastasised to Hoy\u2019s shoulder, pelvis, hip, ribs and spine and was stage 4. Hoy had announced in February that he was being treated for the disease.

A win for City would, ironically, put O\u2019Neil\u2019s job under further scrutiny having secured a solitary point this season. \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason why [there are so few English coaches in the Premier League],\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI spoke to my players: how is Lee Carsley, how is Gareth Southgate? And they speak highly of them. Said they are really good. But the decisions [to not appoint English coaches], I don\u2019t know the reasons why.\u201d",

Management consultants have been asked to explore ways to turn the scandal-hit body over to an employee-owned mutual, similar to the way the John Lewis Partnership is run, Sky News reported. The Department of Business and Trade engaged Boston Consulting Group to carry out a commercial study of the future of the Post Office. The work is said to be at an early stage but a report will be handed to Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, within months. Calls for a review of the Post Office have grown since the wrongful conviction of hundreds of subpostmasters accused of stealing cash from their branches. The cases, labelled the UK\u2019s biggest miscarriage of justice, sparked national anger after being portrayed in the ITV television drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Last night, campaigner Alan Bates cast doubt on the plan. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think this will work. Currently, the government subsidises it and will continue to have to support it. They can\u2019t just give it to the subpostmasters and say: \u2018Here you go, mate\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t think mutualisation is going to save the government or the taxpayer huge amounts of money because it\u2019s going to be subsidising the Post Office for many years once it gets off the ground, no matter how good the scheme is,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. James Arbuthnot, who also campaigned for justice, expressed doubts about subpostmasters\u2019 ability to afford it. Last year the Post Office lost about \u00a376m and has liabilities of \u00a3799m. A public inquiry into the Post Office miscarriages of justice has been told that a replacement for the Horizon IT system at the heart of the scandal could cost up to \u00a31.1bn. Previous governments have examined similar plans but abandoned them in the face of problems. Liam Byrne, chair of the parliamentary business select committee, said mutualisation was an option with lots of potential. Most post offices generate their revenues by providing a variety of government services, which have tightly controlled profit margins. Its more than 11,600 sub-post offices are privately run as franchise operations of the Post Office. A review of the Post Office by the consulting firm Teneo is expected to recommend shrinking directly employed staff from 3,500 to 1,000.",

Gibbins wrote on Instagram: \u201cMy brain is struggling to catch up with what\u2019s happening and I don\u2019t understand where you\u2019ve gone. \u201cWhat I love most about you is your ability to make me laugh, I never chuckle as much as I do when I\u2019m with you with anyone else. \u201cI\u2019m always in awe of your talent, it should be illegal to be so talented and just have the ability to not only be good at things but be bloody great at everything you attempt, without even knowing you\u2019re absolutely smashing it each time.\u201d Gibbins added: \u201cI don\u2019t feel this world was good enough or kind enough to you, and quite often over the last few years, you\u2019ve had to really try hard to overcome all that was being aimed at you. \u201cYou just wanted to be loved and to make people happy with your music. You never believed you were good enough, I hope you can now see this outpouring of love that you never received in your time. \u201cThank you for changing my life, thank you for the incredible memories, thank you for being the best brother and friend I\u2019ll ever have.\u201d A series of gatherings by fans continued this weekend with crowds attending a gathering at the Keel Wharf Bridge at Royal Albert Dock in Liverpool on Saturday.",

Dramatic comebacks, late winners and nerve-jangling victories are all very well, but title-winning teams tend to have a number of routine victories, matches in which, without expending too much nervous energy, they rack up points almost unnoticed. Since beating Wolves on the opening weekend of the season, Arsenal haven\u2019t had a single one of those. Before Saturday, they\u2019d been the better side in every game apart from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/22/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">the draw at Manchester City</a>, but whether they\u2019re having players sent off, missing chances or conceding daft goals, every&nbsp;point seems to come with the absolute maximum of fuss.

Arsenal without Saka\u2019s inswinging corner isn\u2019t quite like Stoke without Rory Delap\u2019s long-throws, but it is a weapon they miss, as was made obvious by the fact their first three corners of the game, taken by Declan Rice, were all outswingers; only 4.5% of Arsenal\u2019s corners over the past three years have been outswingers. But they had seemed fine; Bournemouth weren\u2019t threatening either. Almost nothing happened in the first half hour, the game as featureless as the pure autumnal evening sky. Then Leandro Trossard inexplicably sliced a pass in behind his own defensive line, William Saliba pulled back Evanilson and was, eventually, sent off.</p> <p>None of it made any sense. What was Trossard doing \u2013 where was he trying to play it? Why would Saliba commit the foul when Evanilson still had half the pitch to run and he may have caught up with him? And even had Evanilson scored, with an hour still to play, Arsenal surely had more chance of winning the game from 1-0 down with 11 than at 0-0 with 10. And why did the referee, Robert Jones, initially show only a yellow card for what was as&nbsp;a clear a denial of a goalscoring opportunity as you\u2019re likely to see (nothing in the law refers to how likely the forward is to take that&nbsp;opportunity)?</p> <p>It was Arsenal\u2019s third red card of the season \u2013 the first not for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/31/arsenal-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">a second yellow earned by kicking the ball away</a> \u2013 and the third game they have failed to win. Needless red cards are costing them.</p>    <p>Their fans may chant \u201ccheat\u201d and scream about corruption \u2013 Mikel Arteta, not usually slow to criticise officials, seemed notably accepting here, while Declan Rice spoke of \u201ckicking ourselves in the foot\u201d three times already this season \u2013 but errors tend to be punished. This was a defeat so self-inflicted that even the regulation under which Saliba was sent off was introduced in part as a response to the outcry about their centre-back Willie Young cynically fouling a youthful Paul Allen in the 1980 FA Cup final.</p> <p>It got worse, as Jakub Kiwior\u2019s weak backpass set Evanilson through to be tripped by David Raya for the penalty that brought the second goal. Two terrible backpasses, two fouls, a red card and a penalty; and it was all so avoidable, even before you consider the glorious chances missed by Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli. That Bournemouth\u2019s first stemmed from a corner only added salt to the wound.</p> <p>They are a team seemingly unable to handle adversity. They could not hold on to a lead when Rice was sent off with 41 minutes remaining against Brighton. Although they made an extraordinary effort to preserve their lead with 10 men against City, in the end it wasn\u2019t quite enough. It\u2019s the same pattern, again and again. Soft goals conceded, opportunities squandered, inexplicable decisions. Rice spoke of \u201cnaivety\u201d but whatever lies behind the sloppiness, if Arsenal ever are to win the title, it has to be eradicated.</p> <p>Modern champions have to demonstrate an almost impossible&nbsp;consistency. That is hard enough without giving points&nbsp;away through little more than carelessness.</p>",

It got worse, as Jakub Kiwior\u2019s weak backpass set Evanilson through to be tripped by David Raya for the penalty that brought the second goal. Two terrible backpasses, two fouls, a red card and a penalty; and it was all so avoidable, even before you consider the glorious chances missed by Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli. That Bournemouth\u2019s first stemmed from a corner only added salt to the wound. They are a team seemingly unable to handle adversity. They could not hold on to a lead when Rice was sent off with 41 minutes remaining against Brighton. Although they made an extraordinary effort to preserve their lead with 10 men against City, in the end it wasn\u2019t quite enough. It\u2019s the same pattern, again and again. Soft goals conceded, opportunities squandered, inexplicable decisions. Rice spoke of \u201cnaivety\u201d but whatever lies behind the sloppiness, if Arsenal ever are to win the title, it has to be eradicated. Modern champions have to demonstrate an almost impossible consistency. That is hard enough without giving points away through little more than carelessness.",

It has also defended Australia\u2019s supply of parts for the global supply chain for the F-35 fighter aircraft. Israel has used F-35 aircraft in Gaza.</p> \n<p>An export permit is required for any goods covered by Australia\u2019s Defence and Strategic Goods List.</p> \n<p>Defence officials told Senate estimates in June this year that Australia was \u201cnot a major defence exporter to Israel\u201d but permits were required for a range of items, including IT equipment, software, radios, electronic components and dual-use goods.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"56b6ddcc-0b95-4a68-ac18-8834b5eae802\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe

had issued about 247 permits that relate to Israel since 2019, of which about 66 remained \u201cactive\u201d.</p> \n<p>Shortly after those comments were made, Guardian Australia applied under freedom of information laws for an itemised list of the content of these 66 permits, but the Department of Defence did not meet the statutory deadline.</p> \n<p>The application is now subject to a review by the Information Commissioner.</p> \n<p>Defence officials hinted at the time that they would reassess existing permits, but Guardian Australia has since confirmed more details about the process.</p> \n<p>The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, told the House of Commons last month that the government would suspend 30 of the UK\u2019s 350 existing arms licences to Israel because of \u201ca clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law\u201d.</p> \n<p>Australian officials are working their way through each active permit, looking at the export control criteria and talking to each of the companies involved.</p> \n<p>It is understood the government has not yet revoked any of these permits but intends to finalise all decisions in one batch at the end of that review process.</p> \n<p>\u201cA permit would be refused if Australia identified an export would be used contrary to the national interest, including violating human rights,\u201d the Defence spokesperson said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "Australia is carrying out a review of all 66 defence-related export permits for Israel that were approved prior to the Gaza conflict. Guardian Australia understands the review is being done in a similar manner to the UK government\u2019s recent reassessment of arms licences to Israel, with the outcome to be announced \u201cin coming months\u201d. Sources said the Department of Defence was weighing up each permit on a case-by-case basis and considering how it fits with Australia\u2019s international obligations, including with respect to human rights. A Defence spokesperson confirmed the review was progressing: \u201cAs circumstances in the Middle East evolve, Australia continues to scrutinise pre-existing export permits to Israel to ensure they align with our calibrated approach.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The federal government has repeatedly stated that Australia \u201chas not supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years\u201d, and it continues to maintain that position. But the government has faced criticism for failing to be transparent about what each permit covers. It has also defended Australia\u2019s supply of parts for the global supply chain for the F-35 fighter aircraft. Israel has used F-35 aircraft in Gaza. An export permit is required for any goods covered by Australia\u2019s Defence and Strategic Goods List. Defence officials told Senate estimates in June this year that Australia was \u201cnot a major defence exporter to Israel\u201d but permits were required for a range of items, including IT equipment, software, radios, electronic components and dual-use goods. Officials said Australia had issued about 247 permits that relate to Israel since 2019, of which about 66 remained \u201cactive\u201d. Shortly after those comments were made, Guardian Australia applied under freedom of information laws for an itemised list of the content of these 66 permits, but the Department of Defence did not meet the statutory deadline. The application is now subject to a review by the Information Commissioner. Defence officials hinted at the time that they would reassess existing permits, but Guardian Australia has since confirmed more details about the process. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, told the House of Commons last month that the government would suspend 30 of the UK\u2019s 350 existing arms licences to Israel because of \u201ca clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law\u201d. Australian officials are working their way through each active permit, looking at the export control criteria and talking to each of the companies involved. It is understood the government has not yet revoked any of these permits but intends to finalise all decisions in one batch at the end of that review process. \u201cA permit would be refused if Australia identified an export would be used contrary to the national interest, including violating human rights,\u201d the Defence spokesperson said. \u201cPermits are required for a broad range of goods and technologies, many of which have legitimate commercial and civilian applications.\u201d Guardian Australia can also reveal that Australia has now issued 12 defence-related export permits for Israel since October 2023, when the Hamas attacks triggered the Israeli military offensive on Gaza. That figure is higher than the eight permits that were previously known at the time of the estimates committee hearing in June. Defence says these export permits are required for items to travel from Australia to Israel for the purposes of repair or overhaul by Israeli suppliers before they return to Australia. The Greens have called for an end to all two-way military trade with Israel, with the party\u2019s defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, saying Australia must not do anything to \u201cembolden Israel to continue the genocide\u201d. But the Albanese government has pushed back at the idea of ending contracts with Israeli companies that supply goods for use by the Australian Defence Force and Australian police. The review comes after an application from the Australian Centre for International Justice to the defence minister, Richard Marles, in April requesting the revocation of all current export permits to Israel and to other countries which might later make them available to Israel. The centre was acting on behalf of Palestinian human rights organisations. The centre\u2019s executive director and principal lawyer, Rawan Arraf, said the government had \u201cspent the last 12 months muddying the waters\u201d about the export control regime. She said that under the Arms Trade Treaty, Australia was obliged not to approve the export of conventional arms, munitions, parts or components when there was an overriding risk that the item could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law. \u201cThe government has been put on notice, from the international court of justice, the international criminal court, the UN general assembly and other UN bodies, that Israel is committing serious violations of international law,\u201d she said. The ICC\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, has previously said he had \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d two Israeli leaders and three Hamas leaders were responsible for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Israeli government has rejected the allegations in full, arguing the application for arrest warrants amounted to an attempt to deny the country\u2019s right of self-defence. The ICC pre-trial chamber has yet to make a decision on the arrest warrant applications. Israel said it had killed the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza on Thursday, meaning that all three Hamas figures named in Khan\u2019s application are now all believed to be dead. The Israeli embassy was contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The Victorian Labor government is set to seize planning control of some of Melbourne\u2019s most affluent suburbs in an effort to build thousands more homes, setting the stage for a fight with the opposition and local government. The premier, Jacinta Allan, will announce an overhaul of planning rules in 50 inner-Melbourne areas located near public transport, including in Brighton, Malvern and Toorak, to allow for greater density. She will argue young people are now \u201clocked out\u201d of these areas \u2013 despite being close to jobs, transport and services \u2013 due to low availability and high property prices. Twenty-five of the 50 new \u201cactivity centres\u201d to be unveiled on Sunday include Armadale, Hawksburn, Malvern and Toorak stations on the Frankston railway line, Auburn, Hawthorn and Glenferrie on the Belgrave-Lilydale line and North Brighton, Middle Brighton, Hampton and Sandringham on the Sandringham line. The planning takeover will clear the way for \u201ctaller buildings\u201d of between 10 and 20 storeys near the stations and \u201cgentle, scaled height limits and more low-rise apartments and townhouses\u201d of between three and six storeys alongside exisiting homes in the \u201cwalkable catchments\u201d surrounding them. The government said in these catchments, which will be up to 800 metres from the stations, the rights of residents to appeal development \u201cwill not change and heritage and landscape overlays will stay in place\u201d. However, residents could lose the power to appeal developments closer to stations. The remaining 25 locations will be announced in late 2024, alongside the release of Plan Victoria, the government\u2019s growth strategy for the state. The consultation process for all 50 new centres is likely to be completed by 2026, the government said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email KPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley last month released a report that showed despite the Victoria\u2019s growing population, some inner Melbourne suburbs had experienced a mass exodus of young people due to lack of affordable housing. He said these young people were likely to move to outer areas of Melbourne, putting increased strain on transport and local infrastructure. \u201cThese suburbs [named by the government] are some of the best served in the state when it comes to infrastructure \u2013 whether it\u2019s transport, schools, open space, hospitals, access to jobs,\u201d Rawnsley said. \u201cGetting more people living in there means we don\u2019t have to build new schools and other infrastructure in the western greenfields.\u201d \u201cLocal residents might be concerned about change, but we live in a city, not a museum. If you think about places like Box Hill, Brunswick or South Yarra, they\u2019ve kind of all gone through this transition over the last 30 years but still retain that suburban feel once you get away from the main activity.\u201d It follows a similar move in New South Wales, where the government has rezoned land around train stations. The move will probably be met with support by groups such as the Property Council and Yimby Melbourne, which has argued amenity-rich suburbs must shoulder the burden of new housing. But it will face fierce opposition from councils, who have been critical of the government\u2019s 10 existing activity centres, where 60,000 new homes are expected to be built by 2051. They are located in Broadmeadows, Camberwell Junction, Chadstone, Essendon North, Epping, Frankston, Moorabbin, Niddrie, Preston and Ringwood. In recent weeks, the state opposition has held a series of meetings with residents living near the 10 centres and vowed to oppose \u201cany attempt to remove third-party rights in the planning process and any attempt by Labor to remove heritage protections\u201d. Of the 25 new activity centres, 14 are located within Liberal MPs\u2019 seats, including three in the Hawthorn electorate of opposition leader, John Pesutto, three in the seat of Brighton, held by the shadow planning spokesperson, James Newbury, and seven in Michael O\u2019Brien\u2019s seat of Malvern. Just seven are located in seats held by Labor MPs: Middle Footscray, West Footscray and Tottenham stations in Footscray, and Carnegie, Hughesdale, Murrumbeena and Oakleigh in the inner-east. Three new activity centres are in the seat of Ringwood, held by expelled Labor MP turned crossbencher Will Fowles, and one is in the seat of Prahran, held by Greens MP Sam Hibbins.

Bone traders also use emojis, codewords, and hashtags to connect with each other and evade detection. They might discuss \u201coddities\u201d that are \u201chooman\u201d, for example. In a paper published in the Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology, Huffer describes one person posting: \u201cWould someone gift (wink emoji) \u2026 a man/woman femur or two?\u201d Another says: \u201cOddlings! I have something \u2026 special available. You will receive the photo plus a free vintage medical specimen \u2026 real (bone emoji). (Ship emoji) inc. payment plans available.\u201d And it\u2019s not just skeletal remains. Cremains \u2013 bone fragments left over after a body is cremated \u2013 and wet specimens such as organ slices are also traded. It has been illegal to sell human remains since 1982, when human tissue legislation was rolled out across the states and territories. But many doctors received real skeletons during their training and so collections of bones lingered on, sometimes turning up in sheds and deceased estates. \u201cMedical\u201d specimens have a kind of legitimacy because many were imported before law changes made importation of human remains illegal and due to limited exemptions for medical items. Huffer says bones in Australia had often arrived decades ago from India, Bangladesh and elsewhere. He says they were \u201cthe unclaimed, the low caste, the poor, who were taken, stripped down, sanitised [and] wired up\u201d. South Australia police are investigating the alleged sale of human skulls by auctioneers Small and Whitfield: one \u201cmedical skull\u201d sold for $600, another \u201cwith open cranium and a few vertebrae\u201d and the \u201clower jaw missing\u201d was snapped up for $1,500. A police spokesperson said the auction house was cooperating and \u201cto date no offences have been identified\u201d. \u201cDetermining the origins of all of the remains can be a complex and protracted process,\u201d the spokesperson says. The managing director at Small and Whitfield, David Kabbani, says they have received about three or four skulls over the past 20 years that weren\u2019t medical specimens. \u201cWe know the difference as auctioneers between a genuine medical piece, a skull used for medical purposes as opposed to something that\u2019s come from nobody and nowhere, that we hand in [to police],\u201d he says. Asked about the origins of the medical pieces, Kabbani says they come from retired doctors, who were legally provided them as part of their training when it was legal to import them. He says there was plenty of uncertainty about the law as it stands, including among the police. \u201cOn many occasions when we\u2019ve had questions about selling these things, we\u2019ve rung the police to get an answer and they\u2019re unsure,\u201d he says. Dr Maeghan Toews, an Adelaide Law School lecturer who teaches medical law and ethics says state and territory legislation prohibits buying and selling human tissue, from living and deceased bodies. \u201cThere are exceptions, however, which is where some of the uncertainty arises,\u201d she says. Toews points to the SA Transplantation and Anatomy Act 1983, which allows the sale or supply of tissue \u201cif the tissue has been subjected to processing or treatment and the sale or supply is made for use, in accordance with the directions of a medical practitioner, for therapeutic, medical or scientific purposes\u201d. \u201cOne point of confusion,\u201d she says, \u201cis what counts as a \u2018scientific purpose\u2019, which is not defined in the act. \u201cAnother point of confusion \u2026 is the extent of \u2018processing\u2019 that is needed to transform the tissue into sellable goods. \u201cFinally, while the requirement that the sold tissue be used \u2018in accordance with the directions of a medical practitioner\u2019 makes sense for therapeutic and medical uses, whether or not this applies (or should apply) to \u2018scientific purposes\u2019 is also unclear.\u201d The Australian Law Reform Commission started an inquiry into the state and territory laws in August. The inquiry will perhaps clear up some of these points of confusion, she says. Macabre collector subculture There is a long history of collecting human parts, as war trophies and in museums in the name of science (often racial science). Modern day collectors might explain their macabre habits as being out of an appreciation for human biology, or curiosity, or because of the gothic aesthetic, Samantha Waite says, but she believes there could be a different reason. Waite, a former hospice psychotherapist, now runs Taboo Education, which works to demystify death. She says there are various reasons people get into the bone trade, and often it\u2019s tied up with wanting to prove their identity to, and be accepted by, a specific subculture of collectors. \u201cA lot of them tend to not interact much with the living, this is their way of telling themselves they\u2019re still interacting with humans,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there can be a feeling of power. \u201cPsychology-wise, specific parts of the body tend to mean certain things and a skull is definitely one of power.\u201d Huffer says people should think about how they would feel if their loved ones were \u201ctaken out of their place of rest, dug up, circulated and recirculated with price tags\u201d. It\u2019s dehumanising, and perpetuating colonial violence, he says. \u201cThe bottom line is no one who entered the medical bone trade \u2026 none of them ever consented to being used as such,\u201d she says. \u201cWho knows, [there might be] hundreds of thousand of examples on the market, from the days before consent forms, paperwork \u2013 it\u2019s just another form of grave robbery.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Rachel Reeves is set to use one of the most pivotal budgets of recent times to call on businesses to pay more tax to help restore the NHS, amid warnings that the health service has been left with a \u00a39bn hole in its finances.</p> <p>The chancellor is expected to stake her reputation on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/10/rachel-reeves-capital-gains-tax-rise-budget\">tax-\u00adraising budget</a> designed as a reset of the public finances. She has already had to deal with cabinet skirmishes over funding unveiled alongside the statement. However, Reeves is understood to believe that the public will accept a multibillion-pound hike in business taxes if it is linked to repairing the health system\u2019s finances.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has seen new research, commissioned in the run-up to the budget by an influential thinktank with close links to the Treasury and No 10, that suggests overwhelming support for using an increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) for employers to fund extra resources for the NHS.</p> <p>Seven in 10 voters said they would approve of the move if the money raised was used to increase spending on the health service, according to a poll of more than 6,000 people commissioned by Labour Together. </p> <p>Only 18% said they would disapprove. The measure was particularly popular with a crucial group who switched from the Conservatives to Labour at the last election. About 82% of the group said they approved of it.</p>    <p>The news comes with sources warning that the NHS needs an additional \u00a39bn this financial year just to stand still, compared with the settlement it was left by the previous government. </p> <p>The figure includes about \u00a34bn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/21/reeves-hints-public-sector-workers-could-get-above-inflation-pay-rises\">increased wages</a> agreed by Reeves and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, after a recommendation by the independent public sector pay body.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves is set to use one of the most pivotal budgets of recent times to call on businesses to pay more tax to help restore the NHS, amid warnings that the health service has been left with a \u00a39bn hole in its finances. The chancellor is expected to stake her reputation on a tax-raising budget designed as a reset of the public finances. She has already had to deal with cabinet skirmishes over funding unveiled alongside the statement. However, Reeves is understood to believe that the public will accept a multibillion-pound hike in business taxes if it is linked to repairing the health system\u2019s finances. The Observer has seen new research, commissioned in the run-up to the budget by an influential thinktank with close links to the Treasury and No 10, that suggests overwhelming support for using an increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) for employers to fund extra resources for the NHS. Seven in 10 voters said they would approve of the move if the money raised was used to increase spending on the health service, according to a poll of more than 6,000 people commissioned by Labour Together. Only 18% said they would disapprove. The measure was particularly popular with a crucial group who switched from the Conservatives to Labour at the last election. About 82% of the group said they approved of it. The news comes with sources warning that the NHS needs an additional \u00a39bn this financial year just to stand still, compared with the settlement it was left by the previous government. The figure includes about \u00a34bn in increased wages agreed by Reeves and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, after a recommendation by the independent public sector pay body. The remainder comes from the 2.9% rise needed simply for the NHS to maintain its current performance because demand is growing. Sources across Whitehall said Reeves was putting the NHS front and centre of what is shaping up to be one of the most consequential budgets of recent decades. \u201cThe Conservatives crashed the economy and then they ran away, leaving the NHS with spending plans that were total fiscal fiction,\u201d said a Treasury source. Reeves has had to unveil the budget alongside agreeing the immediate spending plans for government departments, a process that led to huge fallout among several cabinet ministers last week. Some MPs remain fearful about what may happen to unprotected departments, with concerns that a Treasury desperate to find savings could opt to reduce the taxpayer subsidy applied to rail fares. That would see ticket prices go up and undermine Labour\u2019s argument that it wants to tackle the cost of living crisis. Government figures said it was now important to show people that tax rises were needed to reset the public finances and rebuild the health service. \u201cWe have to clear the decks,\u201d said a source. \u201cThis is about revealing the real state of the public finances and how we begin to fix them.\u201d While Reeves appears increasingly likely to sell an increase to employer NICs as a significant element in restoring the health service, she is already facing accusations of breaching Labour manifesto commitments as she uses a series of tax rises to bolster the public finances. The Tories state that a multibillion-pound increase in employer NICs, as well as a proposed \u00a37bn two-year freeze on income tax thresholds, would both breach the Labour election manifesto. However, government sources argue that the two measures meet the party\u2019s pledge not to increase VAT, income tax or national insurance on \u201cworking people\u201d. A Treasury source said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on tax speculation.\u201d The flurry of potential tax rises, including cuts to inheritance tax allowances and higher capital gains tax on share sales, comes amid signs that Labour is losing its grip as the party seen as best placed to handle the economy.

If you don\u2019t like that word then you can change it in the constitution. Probably best to wait for him to go home first. Because he didn\u2019t ask for that, and may be a bit embarrassed if you make a fuss about it. And the sad thing is you can see in his face, as you couldn\u2019t see in his mother\u2019s \u2013 a very engaging assertion of blamelessness. He has so often had to bear that demeanour. He is, as the late queen never was, frankly a fellow pilgrim of ours, and we all hope even if he doesn\u2019t have to pack his own bags that his pilgrimage to the Antipodes leaves him in good health. And as for blamelessness, well, he is blameless. He is not the adversary of an Australian republic. It is the enduring affection for the monarchy, particularly but not only in ageing Australians, that keeps the Australian monarchy alive. As adversaries, they dished us squarely in the referendum of 1999. I would be a bad sport not to say, \u201cGood on \u2018em\u201d. As for Charles, he has correctly and genially said it is up to us to settle the issue. This human demeanour of King Charles and Queen Camilla might be why the republican movement welcomes the royals and wishes them well. They welcome the monarchy, but then with a bit of Australian braggadocio, say it is a \u201cfarewell tour\u201d.

The opposition wants them in Tarong and Callide in Queensland; Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales; Collie in Western Australia; Loy Yang in Victoria; and the former site of the Northern power station in Port Paterson, South Australia. The sites are mostly in Coalition seats.</p> \n<p>The Queensland LNP\u2019s leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/david-crisafulli\">David Crisafulli</a>, facing an election, has been steadfast in his defiance of Dutton\u2019s plan for the Queensland sites.

With renewables \u201call going ahead\u201d, Collison says a gradual transition from coal to solar and wind is \u201ca no-brainer\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo, to me, why do you want to build a monster?\u201d</p> \n<p>Collison does not believe Crisafulli when he says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/04/queensland-election-liberal-national-party-nuclear-plan-peter-dutton\">he would defy his party\u2019s federal leader</a> \u2013 should both be elected \u2013 and reject Dutton\u2019s nuclear vision. On this basis alone, the farmhand will vote for Labor at Queensland\u2019s state election this 26 October.</p> \n<p>He will be in the minority, however, according to John Cole, a emeritus professor at the University of Southern Queensland. Cole grew up not far from here and well knows the electorate long ruled by Kingaroy peanut farmer \u2013 and Queensland\u2019s longest-serving premier \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/rip-flo-bjelke-petersen-but-lets-not-forget-johs-legacy\">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cHell will freeze over before Kingaroy votes Labor,\u201d Cole says.</p> \n<p>Crisafulli, though, is brooking no distractions as he seeks to become just the second conservative leader to win a majority of seats at a Queensland election in 38 years.</p> \n<p>\u201c[Crisafulli] needs nuclear energy like a hole in the head,\u201d Cole says.</p> \n<p>For some, that small-target strategy is working.</p> \n<p>In the village of Maidenwell, about 15km south-west of Tarong at the foothills of the Bunya Mountains, inside an old garage that has been converted to a bar, diner and gift shop, there is unease about the prospect of nuclear industry in the neighbourhood \u2013 but also some wind at its back.</p> \n<p>Perched alone at the bar is a David \u201cBushie\u201d Stewart, his long white beard flowing from under a battered felt hat and clad in a blue singlet revealing arms full of tattoos. Cracking his tinnies from behind the bar is Peter Henry. Both are retired from working in the nearby coalmine and power station; both would prefer that plants be kept online while there is coal to be dug.</p> \n<p>Henry worries about how much water a nuclear station would need to draw and whether it would have a target on it in the event of conflict.</p> \n<p>A young cook, Blake, chips in from the kitchen with his two cents\u2019 worth. \u201cI\u2019d prefer it to be out <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/woop-woop_n?tl=true\">woop woop</a>,\u201d he says of a nuclear plant.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is woop woop,\u201d Bushie counters from the bar. \u201cMore woop woop,\u201d Blake says.</p> \n<p>Peter\u2019s wife, Deborah Henry, who runs this and two other tourism-related businesses into which she has invested her life savings, is the most forthright in expressing her fears.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny human error and we\u2019ll be dead, or we\u2019ll have cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I came out here for the fresh air\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Crisafulli\u2019s anti-nuclear stance has satisfied Henry. She\u2019ll be voting LNP.</p> \n<p>Tarong\u2019s power station is largely hidden from view by forest, but five hours\u2019 north up the Burnett Highway, signs point towards a scenic lookout of the open cut coalmine and coal-fired Callide power plant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"54b3e972-feb2-48f5-86c7-57b6ee9583fc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qe8DRLFSre0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Taking in the view, dressed in blue jeans, a high viz top, her blond hair in a ponytail, is Ann Lederhose. The sales representative for a company that services the mining, oil and gas industries, she is about to drive 115km east to her home in Gladstone.</p> \n<p>Lederhose is sympathetic to communities and families reliant on its jobs, but says coal-fired power stations are \u201cvery much a thing of the past\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep digging shit out of the ground and burning it,\u201d she says. \u201cOr coal anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>Uranium, though, is a different matter. Nuclear energy, she believes, \u201cis the way we are going to have to go\u201d.</p> \n<p>Lederhose agrees too with advocates who propose a nuclear plant at Gladstone, saying it would be a \u201csensible solution\u201d for the port city home to the state\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dirty industry there that puts a lot of emissions out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo anything that they can do to clean that environment would be a massive bonus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Opposition to renewables is also more overt around Callide. Anti-renewable signs dot the landscape, including at the front gate of nearby farmer Darren Jensen\u2019s property \u201cGrandview\u201d \u2013 a vista that includes Callide\u2019s smoking stacks and cooling towers, just a few kilometres away.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Jensen says of the power station. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a problem with nuclear being there at all.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou go all over Europe and all over America and there\u2019s nuclear power stations operating safely everywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jensen does, however, have a problem with the burgeoning solar and wind industries. As well as the loss of arable land, Jensen\u2019s worries include the impact of high voltage towers upon land value, clearing of natural habitat and less secure jobs and more waste associated with ageing panels and turbines.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore often than not\u201d an LNP voter, Jensen says he may cast a protest vote for One Nation on energy.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy personal preference is nuclear, I reckon it\u2019s a great technology,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why rush? Keep burning coal until we can have that technology available.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/01/winds-of-radical-change-queensland-breaks-up-with-coal-in-stunning-week-in-energy\">Dr Amanda Cahill</a>, the chief executive of the not-for-profit The Next Economy, is picking up on angst at renewable energy in the regions and says \u201cnuclear is catching on more than some people expected\u201d.</p> \n<p>And she can understand why.</p> \n<p>Cahill says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/03/are-the-climate-wars-really-over-or-has-a-new-era-of-greenwashing-just-begun\">the climate wars that engulfed Australian politics</a> for at least the decade to 2022 meant many discussions around energy transition were held \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d.

Still, Collison can see the energy transition occurring rapidly before his eyes, with several large-scale solar and windfarms being built in this rich agricultural region to Brisbane\u2019s north-west. With renewables \u201call going ahead\u201d, Collison says a gradual transition from coal to solar and wind is \u201ca no-brainer\u201d. \u201cSo, to me, why do you want to build a monster?\u201d Collison does not believe Crisafulli when he says he would defy his party\u2019s federal leader \u2013 should both be elected \u2013 and reject Dutton\u2019s nuclear vision. On this basis alone, the farmhand will vote for Labor at Queensland\u2019s state election this 26 October. He will be in the minority, however, according to John Cole, a emeritus professor at the University of Southern Queensland. Cole grew up not far from here and well knows the electorate long ruled by Kingaroy peanut farmer \u2013 and Queensland\u2019s longest-serving premier \u2013 Joh Bjelke-Petersen. \u201cHell will freeze over before Kingaroy votes Labor,\u201d Cole says. Crisafulli, though, is brooking no distractions as he seeks to become just the second conservative leader to win a majority of seats at a Queensland election in 38 years. \u201c[Crisafulli] needs nuclear energy like a hole in the head,\u201d Cole says. For some, that small-target strategy is working. In the village of Maidenwell, about 15km south-west of Tarong at the foothills of the Bunya Mountains, inside an old garage that has been converted to a bar, diner and gift shop, there is unease about the prospect of nuclear industry in the neighbourhood \u2013 but also some wind at its back. Perched alone at the bar is a David \u201cBushie\u201d Stewart, his long white beard flowing from under a battered felt hat and clad in a blue singlet revealing arms full of tattoos. Cracking his tinnies from behind the bar is Peter Henry. Both are retired from working in the nearby coalmine and power station; both would prefer that plants be kept online while there is coal to be dug. Henry worries about how much water a nuclear station would need to draw and whether it would have a target on it in the event of conflict. A young cook, Blake, chips in from the kitchen with his two cents\u2019 worth. \u201cI\u2019d prefer it to be out woop woop,\u201d he says of a nuclear plant. \u201cThis is woop woop,\u201d Bushie counters from the bar. \u201cMore woop woop,\u201d Blake says. Peter\u2019s wife, Deborah Henry, who runs this and two other tourism-related businesses into which she has invested her life savings, is the most forthright in expressing her fears. \u201cAny human error and we\u2019ll be dead, or we\u2019ll have cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I came out here for the fresh air\u201d. But Crisafulli\u2019s anti-nuclear stance has satisfied Henry. She\u2019ll be voting LNP. Tarong\u2019s power station is largely hidden from view by forest, but five hours\u2019 north up the Burnett Highway, signs point towards a scenic lookout of the open cut coalmine and coal-fired Callide power plant. Taking in the view, dressed in blue jeans, a high viz top, her blond hair in a ponytail, is Ann Lederhose. The sales representative for a company that services the mining, oil and gas industries, she is about to drive 115km east to her home in Gladstone. Lederhose is sympathetic to communities and families reliant on its jobs, but says coal-fired power stations are \u201cvery much a thing of the past\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep digging shit out of the ground and burning it,\u201d she says. \u201cOr coal anyway.\u201d Uranium, though, is a different matter. Nuclear energy, she believes, \u201cis the way we are going to have to go\u201d. Lederhose agrees too with advocates who propose a nuclear plant at Gladstone, saying it would be a \u201csensible solution\u201d for the port city home to the state\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dirty industry there that puts a lot of emissions out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo anything that they can do to clean that environment would be a massive bonus.\u201d Opposition to renewables is also more overt around Callide. Anti-renewable signs dot the landscape, including at the front gate of nearby farmer Darren Jensen\u2019s property \u201cGrandview\u201d \u2013 a vista that includes Callide\u2019s smoking stacks and cooling towers, just a few kilometres away. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Jensen says of the power station. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a problem with nuclear being there at all. \u201cYou go all over Europe and all over America and there\u2019s nuclear power stations operating safely everywhere.\u201d Jensen does, however, have a problem with the burgeoning solar and wind industries. As well as the loss of arable land, Jensen\u2019s worries include the impact of high voltage towers upon land value, clearing of natural habitat and less secure jobs and more waste associated with ageing panels and turbines. \u201cMore often than not\u201d an LNP voter, Jensen says he may cast a protest vote for One Nation on energy. \u201cMy personal preference is nuclear, I reckon it\u2019s a great technology,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why rush? Keep burning coal until we can have that technology available.\u201d Dr Amanda Cahill, the chief executive of the not-for-profit The Next Economy, is picking up on angst at renewable energy in the regions and says \u201cnuclear is catching on more than some people expected\u201d. And she can understand why. Cahill says the climate wars that engulfed Australian politics for at least the decade to 2022 meant many discussions around energy transition were held \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. So the money and projects now pouring into the renewable sector has caught some communities by surprise. But \u201cthis whole conversation\u201d about nuclear, Cahill says, is only adding fuel to a climate of \u201cconfusion and chaos and uncertainty\u201d. \u201cAnd it\u2019s making people nervous.\u201d",

Underground water in some areas has collapsed and water quality is deteriorating, putting at risk not only a fragile natural ecosystem but a $5bn regional economy. Some of the biggest declines are close to commercial forestry plantations, particularly blue gum plantations, where monitoring by the SA Department of Environment and Water shows water table declines of several metres. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The latest alarm sounded in 2023 when a big algal bloom polluted Piccaninnie Ponds in South Australia, probably caused by low water levels and high nutrient loads. Staff from that state\u2019s National Parks and Wildlife Service working in kayaks rounded up an estimated 10 tonnes of algal sludge and closed the ponds to snorkelling and diving. The famous cave-diving site, known for its crystal-clear waters and aquatic plants, is a Ramsar-declared wetland of international significance, a conservation park and a rare Australian example of a karst rising-spring wetland, fed largely by groundwater inflows. Discharge of water from the rising-spring system, that would either be drained, used for stock watering or remain as a surface wetland, is also declining. In 2022 the discharge was the lowest on record. The SA lieutenant governor and cave diver Dr Richard Harris described what he saw after a dive at Piccaninnie as \u201cdreadful\u201d and said he feared for the future of the ponds. \u201cI am worried that what is happening at Piccaninnie Ponds and the recent dropping in levels in Ewens Ponds could potentially represent a tipping point, one of these moments where if it actually spirals out of control we could be facing a local disaster,\u201d he told the SE Voice.\u2029 Ewens Ponds, another renowned dive spot nearby, closed this year because of a reported 50cm plunge in water levels. Both Piccaninne and Ewens ponds remain closed. Signs of aquifer stress have been reported for decades but the unusually dry year has reinforced the urgency. Fourteen years ago a lower limestone coast taskforce reported drops in the water table over the \u201cpast five to 10 years\u201d and warned the region could be \u201creaching the limits of sustainable water use\u201d. In the north of the region, blue gum plantations have been blamed for a 6-metre decline in underground water levels. Big falls present another threat: increased salinity. SA\u2019s second biggest city, Mount Gambier, and the Coonawarra wine region rely on underground water, as do countless other small towns and farms. The south-east is the biggest user of underground water in the state. There is no more water available for allocation in the managed areas, according to the lower limestone coast water allocation plan. An independent conservation ecologist, Claire Harding, who has consulted with NPWS, said few aspects of the ponds hydrology were monitored. \u201cAs site managers the NPWS has limited ability to manage the issues around water quality and quantity at Piccaninnie Ponds that are likely caused by landscape-scale pressures,\u201d she said after the ponds\u2019 closure. Big dairy, irrigated crops, mining, improved pasture operations and forestry surround the ponds. Harding said all these industries occurred at a higher elevation to the ponds, with groundwater flow in the direction of the ponds. \u201cI am not aware of any systematic monitoring of agricultural pollutants, either runoff or groundwater, in this area.\u201d The SA Department of Environment and Water said it believed reduced inflows and high nutrient levels had \u201cpartially\u201d caused the bloom and it would \u201cundertake further investigation\u201d. SA\u2019s Environment Protection Agency, responsible for nutrient testing, did not respond to questions. Over the next three years, Landscape South Australia (Limestone Coast) is revising its 2013 water allocation plan. Its planning and development manager, Liz Perkins, said while the impact of continued water taking was accepted, declines in groundwater \u201care not an acceptable impact\u201d. Acceptable effects were yet to be refined, she said. Perkins said the effects of long-term use of groundwater could be \u201cirreversible\u201d. \u201cIn places where groundwater levels have declined and recharge reduced, recovery may not be possible,\u201d she said. Wetlands once covered 44% of the south-east. Drainage of agricultural properties \u2013 there are about 2,500km of drains in the region \u2013 and land clearing reduced wetlands to just 6% of the surface. In the process, a clay lining \u2013 the natural seal that retained water recharge and maintained levels \u2013 was broken. The Green Triangle, the highly productive area that covers south-west Victoria and south-east South Australia, contains 17% of Australia\u2019s forestry plantations, covering about 328,000 hectares as of 2020. The industry, a top three employer in the south-east, faces changes in how SA regulates water allocations using a framework that guides adjustments to achieve the necessary outcomes. At public information sessions for the water allocation plan review, questions were asked about how forestry and other industries with permanent plantings would handle lower water allocations if that is what the framework recommends. South Australian Forest Products Association wants water drained to the sea returned to the land. Its chief executive officer, Nathan Paine, said their plantation estates \u201chave shrunk over the past decade with around 30,000 hectares lost due to environmental and water policy that has stopped the replanting of trees in core forestry areas\u201d. It wants to ensure every tree harvested is replanted so plantations can increase. Frances Thompson lives atop the aquifer in south-west Victoria Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter",

Bournemouth are up against a relentless, ravenous Arsenal team whose only dropped points this season have come with 10 men. They\u2019ll go top if they win tonight, at least until Manchester City and Liverpool play tomorrow. They also have the chance to join a very small club. Liverpool are the only English club to have won 2000 top-flight games; Arsenal are 1999 not out.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>5.30pm.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today; thanks as always for your company and emails. RIP Andrew. As Jamie Redknapp points out on Sky, Saliba didn\u2019t need to foul Evanilson as he would almost certainly have caught him up. But he panicked, understandably, when Trossard played that weird pass and Arsenal were suddenly exposed. The foul on Evanilson was just an instinctive reaction. Read Ed Aarons\u2019 on-the-whistle report \u201cIf Arsenal are going to develop a siege mentality, their first job would be to kit themselves out in something a bit more frightening than what they were wearing today \u2013 perhaps the biohazard warning colour scheme, or something with metal spikes sticking out of it,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cToday\u2019s effort was rather like their performance \u2013 incoherent, vapid and deeply disappointing.\u201d Now you mention it, we\u2019re long overdue a big club having a bogey kit. (No offence Norwich fans.) \u201cIf you think Arteta hasn\u2019t already fostered a siege mentality,\u201d says Olly O\u2019Carroll, \u201cthe chants from the away end of \u20182-0 to the referee\u2019 and \u2018Just like City, you\u2019re paying the refs\u2019 might change your mind.\u201d Oh, I meant among the players rather than the supporters. Most football fans emerged from the womb with a siege mentality. A famous night for Bournemouth, who have beaten Arsenal for only the second time in their history. The substitutes Ryan Christie and Justin Kluivert settled a game hinged on the sending off of William Saliba after half an hour. It was a miserable night for Arsenal. Leandro Trossard\u2019s dodgy backpass led to Saliba\u2019s red card; the substitute Jakub Kiwior was taken off after his poor backpass led to Kluivert\u2019s match-sealing penalty; Gabriel Martinelli missed a terrific chance to put them ahead just before Christie\u2019s opening goal. In the parlance of our time, they\u2019ve had one. 90+3 min If it stays like this Bournemouth will jump to 10th, above Manchester United. Imagine what Andoni Iraola might do with their players. 90 min Five minutes of added time. This will be Arsenal\u2019s first away defeat in the league this year, which shows how good they\u2019ve been. It also confirms what we kind of knew already: Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka are irreplaceable, and playing with 10 men for an hour is bloody hard. 88 min A lovely run from Gabriel Jesus, who jinks past two or three defenders before running into Zabarnyi in the area. That was a little reminder of the blistering start he made to his Arsenal career down at Crystal Palace. 86 min \u201cI think of clubs like Bournemouth being thin on the bench,\u201d says Gary Stover. Ha, good point. Both goals have been scored by substitutes, albeit by players who start a high percentage of Bournemouth\u2019s games. 84 min It\u2019s been a stinker of a night for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta might use this to foster a siege mentality, something that George Graham and Arsene Wenger did so effectively en route to winning the title. That\u2019s the positive spin anyway. 82 min: Bournemouth substitution Enes Unal replaces the excellent Evanilson, whose alertness led to both Saliba\u2019s red card and Kluivert\u2019s penalty. 82 min \u201cThere are names that pop up regularly on MBMs and OBOs, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that often we\u2019re playing up to characters,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cNone of us really know each other, but we interact and ask questions and answer questions and make silly jokes. Andrew Hurley never came across as having any artifice. He was clearly knowledgeable, enjoyably forthright, and entertainingly perceptive. He disagreed with a number of points I\u2019ve made on these blogs, and, in retrospect, he was generally correct. Annoyingly so. I was going to say I hope Arsenal win tonight, but I think it\u2019s a bit late for that.\u201d 81 min: Double substitution for Arsenal Gabriel Jesus and Ethan Nwaneri replace Mikel Merino and Jakub Kiwior, who only came on himself just before half-time. Kluivert calmly sits Raya down and passes the ball into the net. An excellent penalty; he wasn\u2019t even looking at the ball. 77 min Evanilson seizes on a desperate backpass from Kiwior, goes past Raya and is fouled. This won\u2019t be overturned. 76 min Kerkez\u2019s deep cross goes behind off Calafiori. Arsenal look relatively comfortable at 0-0 but they\u2019re rattled now. The corner hits Senesi at the far post, who was falling over while being wrestled by Partey, and bounces kindly for Semenyo. He smashes a snapshot over the bar. 75 min Yes yes I wrote \u2018bath\u2019 instead of \u2018path\u2019 in the 69th minute. \u201cWas it a tap in\u201d honks Richard Neville. 73 min Fine margins and all that: just before the goal Martinelli had that terrific chance to put Arsenal ahead. Arsenal have been given a dose of their own set-piece medicine. This was a gem, straight from the training ground. A left-wing corner was curled low and hard by Cook towards the near post, where Kluivert flicked the ball nonchalantly into the space near the penalty spot. Christie arrived late in the area, opened his body and sidefooted the bouncing ball high into the net. Superb technique and a brilliant goal. Ryan Christie rams Bournemouth in front! 69 min: Fine save by Kepa! He needed to make it, too, because it was his awful pass straight to Merino that led to the chance. He waited for Martinelli\u2019s run before guiding the ball into his bpath, and Martinelli\u2019s first-time shot was superbly saved to his left by Kepa. 68 min Ben White is booked for timewasting. 67 min Apologies, I spent the last couple of minutes losing the will, during which time an Arsenal corner led to a header that was comfortably saved. It wasn\u2019t a chance. 66 min \u201cThe FA rule, I believe, is that a red card should be given for denial of an obvious (not a clear) goal scoring opportunity,\u201d says Sam. \u201cEvanilson\u2019s goal scoring opportunity was not *obvious*. One would need to know how fast Ben White is relative to Evanlison, and what the distance is that Evanilson and White would need to cover in order for White to present an obstacle to Evanilson\u2019s run on goal. One would also need to know how much Evanilson would be slowed down by keeping control of the ball on his way towards goal. White doesn\u2019t have to worry about keeping the ball at the right distance ahead of him, but Evanilson does. \u201dThere was nothing obvious about this goal scoring opportunity. That is why so few red cards are given when a foul happens that close to the halfway line, unless I am much mistaken.\u201d If there was nothing obvious about it, why did two senior referees and multiple ex-players all concur it was an obvious/clear opportunity? You can argue it was the wrong decision but to say there was \u201cnothing obvious\u201d about it is patently absurd and fr- oh I can\u2019t be bothered any more. 64 min: Arsenal substitution Gabriel Martinelli replaces Leandro Trossard. 63 min: Triple substitution for Bournemouth Dango Ouattara, Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier are replaced by Justin Kluivert, Luis Sinisterra and Ryan Christie. Antoine Semenyo was booked just before that substitution. 62 min It\u2019s a statement of the offensively obvious but you always have a chance with 10 men if you have an outstanding defence. That was the case with Arsenal in the late 1990s, when the Back Four just rolled their sleeves up even higher if somebody was sent off, and it\u2019s the same with this Arsenal team. Overall I think they\u2019ve managed the game really well since Saliba was sent off. 60 min Tavernier flicks a speculative header across goal and wide. Bournemouth are showing the first signs of impatience. I\u2019m telling you: 1-0 to the Arsenal, 98th minute, Christopher Wreh. 59 min \u201cI\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t the only one reminded of a similar sending off for Gary Rowett?\u201d sniffs Tom Hopkins. \u201cPulling back Brian Deane on the half way line in a Derby v Leeds cup game in 1996? \u201dFrom memory, some rather harsh views were aired about the probability of Deane sprinting half the length of the pitch in any circumstances. I feel that VAR is currently too objective \u2013 let\u2019s liven it up by factoring in the ability of the fouled player to take advantage of the opportunity denied him.\u201d So even if Teddy Sheringham had a 20-yard start on the defender it wouldn\u2019t count as clear goalscoring opportunity? 57 min A deep cross from the left is palmed into a dangerous area by Raya, who is relieved to see a lilac and light blue shirt get to the ball first. 56 min Havertz was a passenger in the second half at Manchester City but he is giving Arsenal an occasional outball here. 51 min There\u2019s no Bukayo Saka to waft the corner under the crossbar. Instead Rice takes and Havertz heads over at the near post. An eighth-chance at best. 50 min Havertz does superbly to win a corner for Arsenal, beating Scott and then Kerkez on the right. Gabriel wanders forward with mayhem in mind\u2026 48 min \u201cOn US television, Tim Howard thought the red card may be justified because Raya was backpedalling and not coming to meet the ball,\u201d says Adam Roberts. Raya definitely wasn\u2019t a factor. The only possible case for Arsenal is that, because Evanilson had so far to run, White might have been able to get back. But he was so far across that it feels like a bit of a reach. 47 min: Semenyo misses a great chance! Kerkez\u2019s backheel releases Ouattara on the left. He looks up and picks out Semenyo, weirdly unmarked at the far post. Semenyo watches the bounce carefully \u2013 and then sidefoots over the bar from 12 yards. That\u2019s the best chance of the match by a distance. Maybe, as Alan Smith suggests on Sky, he had too much time. 46 min Bournemouth begin the second half, having switched Semenyo from left to right. Arsenal\u2019s shape looks like 4-4-1, with Merino playing from the right and Trossard on the left. Bournemouth substitution Adam Smith replaces Julian Araujo at right-back. \u201cCan anyone explain why no one has chosen to mention that Evanilson was clearly offside but no-one thought to check during the VAR review?\u201d writes Mark. \u201cCommentators never even raised it as a possibility in discussion, and officials clearly jumped straight to sentencing. Are fouls committed in an offside position now punishable? I must have missed that EPL rule change\u2026\u201d You\u2019re right: he was clearly in an offside position. And the pass was played by Leandro Trossard, so he wasn\u2019t offside. Half-time reading A dullish tactical battle came to life when William Saliba was sent off for denying Evanilson a clear goalscoring opportunity. Arsenal hunkered down, withstood the inevitable onslaught and were looking more comfortable by the end of the half. Make no mistake, all results are still on the table. 45+4 min \u201cThought it was a red live and I think the ref did too,\u201d says Sean Orlowicz. \u201cBut he gave a yellow knowing he could double check on replay. I\u2019m okay with that approach. Ben White wasn\u2019t close enough to stop a one on one chance for Evanilson.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about that, only because the threshold for VAR intervention is much higher this season so he couldn\u2019t be sure he\u2019d be told to go to the monitor. But yes, the more you see it, the harder it becomes to argue against the decision. White was too far across and there was nobody else who could have got back to cover. 45+2 min Evanilson makes a good run in the inside-left channel, away from Kiwior, who recovers well to concede a corner. It\u2019s swung straight into the loving arms of David Raya. 45+1 min Four minutes of added time. Partey volleys over form 20 yards, an awkward chance. 45 min There\u2019s been lots of Bournemouth pressure since the red card. This reeks of 1-0 to the Arsenal, with the winning goal scored from a set-piece in the 97th minute, probably by Steve Bould. 44 min \u201cYou know what they say about red cards,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cOne is unfortunate, two is careless, but three is clearly a Premier League conspiracy.\u201d Arf. I keep thinking how preposterously good Arsene Wenger\u2019s early terms could be with 10 men. Anfield 2001, St James\u2019 Park 1996, Upton Park 1998 and so on. 41 min: Good save by Raya! Semenyo storms down the left, far too quick for Kiwior, and drives a low cross. It\u2019s spilled by the sprawling Raya, but he bounces to his feet to stop Tavernier\u2019s follow up with his outstretched right foot. Excellent save. 40 min Calafiori has stayed at left-back, with Kiwior replacing Saliba in the middle. It looks like a 4-3-2 formation with Trossard supporting Havertz. 39 min You be the ref. 38 min \u201cBad all round,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cBad by Saliba, bad for Saliba, bad for this game, bad for the next game and, who knows, bad for Arsenal\u2019s title chase. We had all been asking ourselves when this game was going get interesting. Well\u2026\u201d 37 min: Arsenal substitution Jakub Kiwior comes for Raheem Sterling. That probably means Calafiori will move to centre half. We don\u2019t know yet because Bournemouth have a series of corners. 36 min Bournemouth have come to life. Semenyo cuts inside from the left, sells both White and Sterling a delicious dummy and goes back on the outside. Then he blasts a left-foot shot from a tight angle that is pushed round the near post by Raya. 35 min: Just wide from Merino! Sterling\u2019s cross is half cleared by the diving Senesi at the near post. Merino controls it deftly, 15 yards out, and hits an instant shot that ricochets just wide off Senesi. The referee gave a goalkick but I\u2019m almost certain that took a deflection. 35 min Saliba will now miss next Sunday\u2019s Premier League game against Liverpool. Arsenal aren\u2019t exactly short of centre-halves but he is hard to replace. 34 min \ufeff\u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI was lucky enough to meet Andrew Hurley just once, briefly, but his intelligence, passion and humour shone through even to an eejit like me. Such sad news, I\u2019m an Arsenal fan tonight.\u201d He\u2019d have plenty to say about the red card. I reckon I\u2019d be receiving an email about Trossard\u2019s stupidity right about now. 33 min Gabriel comes across to make an excellent block from Semenyo\u2019s shot. Arsenal have moved Partey to right back and Ben White into the centre alongside Gabriel. 31 min The only argument for not sending Saliba off is that Ben White, on the far side, might have got across to cover. I can see both sides! It came out of nothing. Arsenal were popping the ball round near the halfway line, then suddenly Trossard lumped the ball in behind his own defence and Evanilson was away. Saliba\u2019s foul was instinctive and he probably thought the distance between Evanilson and the goal would save him. 30 min Arsenal are not happy; it\u2019s their third red card of the season. 29 min The referee is going to the monitor, and Saliba is in all sorts. 28 min Saliba is booked for pulling back Evanilson just past the centre circle. Evanilson would have been through on goal, having read an awful pass from Trossard, and there\u2019s a pretty good case for a red card. There\u2019s an ongoing VAR check. 27 min Both teams are struggling to keep the ball, although we should probably reframe that because it\u2019s been more about the quality of the pressing than the poverty of the passing. 23 min Still no shots on target at either end. It feels like one of those tactical battles we used to read about in the glory days of Serie A. 21 min Arsenal pin Bournemouth back for about a minute until Sterling overhits a chipped cross that goes behind for a goalkick. Sterling does look lively though. 18 min Sterling zips past Kerkez in the area, then for some reason decides to go back outside him before whacking a cross that is headed away. He should have had a shot, admittedly with his weaker left foot, after beating Kerkez the first time. 17 min Semenyo blasts over from 25 yards. The opportunity came after Raya\u2019s poor pass was intercepted by Scott just outside the area. He turned and squared the ball to Semenyo, who blootered it into the stand. 14 min Semenyo plays a nice angled pass to Scott, who tries to run at Saliba in the area. Saliba stays on his feet and takes the ball with laughable ease. He is so good one v one. 13 min The first 12 minutes have been more interesting than exciting. Bournemouth are keeping Arsenal at arm\u2019s length for now; from memory they often start these tough games well before being overwhelmed in the second half. 9 min Evanilson runs the right-hand channel to win the first corner of the game. Tavernier takes, Arsenal clear and they\u2019re immediately off on the break. For a split-second it looks like Sterling has managed to put Trossard through on goal from the halfway line, but Cook does well to get goalside and force him out wide. 8 min Arsenal are mixing their game up, occasionally going long to Havertz to beat the press. The evolution of this team under Mikel Arteta, particularly since they were reeled in by Manchester City in 2022-23, has been fascinating. 7 min Alex Scott is shoved over on the left wing by Ben White, a surprisingly brainless bit of defending from such a good player. Cook\u2019s deep, inswinging free-kick is headed away decisively by Calafiori. Excellent defending. 4 min Both teams have maded a really fast start, particularly without the ball. Styles make fights and this has the potential to be a really good game. 2 min Arsenal have started with Raheem Sterling on the right wing as expected. Leandro Trossard is on the left. Bournemouth are playing, a little surprisingly, with Antoine Semenyo on the left and Dango Ouattara on the right. 1 min Arsenal, in their lilac and light blue third kit, kick off from left to right as we watch. A reminder of the teams Bournemouth (possible 4-2-3-1) Kepa; Araujo, Zabarnyi, Senesi, Kerkez; Cook, Scott; Semenyo, Tavernier, Ouattara; Evanilson. Substitutes: Travers, Huijsen, Brooks, Christie, Adams, Smith, Sinisterra, Kluivert, Enes Unal. Arsenal (possible 4-1-2-3) Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Partey; Merino, Rice; Sterling, Havertz, Trossard. Substitutes: Setford, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Lewis-Skelly, Jorginho, Nwaneri, Martinelli, Jesus, Kabia. Referee Rob Jones. Andoni Iraola\u2019s pre-match thoughts We had our chances against Liverpool and Chelsea but we didn\u2019t score first. We need to start strongly and try to give them an uncomfortable game. It\u2019s a difficult game against the best defence in the Premier League, probably the world. We need the mentality to take every chance we get as if it\u2019s the last one. The Guardian MBM community lost somebody dear last week. Andrew Hurley was a huge Arsenal fan who has been a regular contributor to the football and cricket liveblogs for over a decade. This might sound odd but one of the things I loved most about Andrew is how often he disagreed with me. The best liveblogs have an ongoing discussion or riff that accompanies the on-field action. And though Andrew could be strident, he was always civil, a combination that is increasingly, depressingly rare in online discourse. He restored my faith that it\u2019s still possible to disagree agreeably. Andrew also had an enviable originality of thought. During a busy game, you might have 20 or 30 unread emails and only 10 or 15 seconds to pick one; if I saw Andrew\u2019s name I\u2019d usually go there because I knew he\u2019d have something interesting to say, even if I didn\u2019t always agree with it. Knew: the past tense. He has left us far too young, and I\u2019m just so sorry for all his friends and family. This is the first time Arsenal have started a Premier League game without both Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard since Odegaard joined the club almost four years ago. Mikel Arteta\u2019s pre-match thoughts [On Bukayo Saka\u2019s absence] We tried to get him fit but he didn\u2019t have the right feeling so there\u2019s not point pushing him. We have other options and this will be a good test for us. He has very different qualities to Martin [Odegaard], and for the type of game we expect we think he\u2019s very good. Bournemouth are very well-coached and have a lot of threat. They\u2019re a very tough team to play against. Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 West Ham Fulham 1-3 Aston Villa Man Utd 2-1 Brentford Newcastle 0-1 Brighton Southampton 2-3 Leicester Everton lead Ipswich 2-0 at Portman Road in a game that kicked off 15 minutes late. Read Ed Aarons\u2019 preview Premier League latest There\u2019s plenty going on in the 3pm games, including comebacks at St Mary\u2019s, Celtic Park and Old Trafford. Scott Murray has the latest. From the archive, but still well worth a read Bournemouth make three changes from their frustrating defeat at Leicester before the international break. Julian Araujo, Alex Scott and Dango Ouattara come in for Adam Smith, Ryan Christie and Justin Kluivert. Bukayo Saya is absent from the Arsenal squad because of a hamstring problem. Leandro Trossard replaces him in one of four changes from the win over Southampton a fortnight ago. The summer signing Mikel Merino makes his first league start and Ben White returns to the starting XI. Jorginho and Gabriel Jesus drop to the bench. Bournemouth (possible 4-2-3-1) Kepa; Araujo, Zabarnyi, Senesi, Kerkez; Cook, Scott; Semenyo, Tavernier, Ouattara; Evanilson. Substitutes: Travers, Huijsen, Brooks, Christie, Adams, Smith, Sinisterra, Kluivert, Enes Unal. Arsenal (possible 4-1-2-3) Raya; White, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Partey; Merino, Rice; Sterling, Havertz, Trossard. Substitutes: Setford, Kiwior, Zinchenko, Lewis-Skelly, Jorginho, Nwaneri, Martinelli, Jesus, Kabia. Referee Rob Jones. Andoni Iraola has an itch to scratch. Since becoming Bournemouth manager his record against last season\u2019s top six is desperate: P14 W0 D1 L13 F4 A32 Pts 1. His team are far better than that, as they\u2019ve shown against the rest, and with the odd bit of giant-killing they could easily finish in the top half. It would also enhance the reputation of Iraola ahead of the managerial silly season. All this is easier said than done, especially tonight. Bournemouth are up against a relentless, ravenous Arsenal team whose only dropped points this season have come with 10 men. They\u2019ll go top if they win tonight, at least until Manchester City and Liverpool play tomorrow. They also have the chance to join a very small club. Liverpool are the only English club to have won 2000 top-flight games; Arsenal are 1999 not out. Kick off 5.30pm.",

      "body": "<p>Arsenal\u2019s new penchant for picking up red cards had to catch up with them eventually. Mikel Arteta\u2019s side finally surrendered their unbeaten start to the season after William Saliba was sent off \u2013 their third dismissal in their opening eight league matches \u2013 as Bournemouth celebrated a famous victory thanks to goals from substitutes Ryan Christie and Justin Kluivert.</p> \n<p>It was an evening to savour for their manager, Andoni Iraola, who saw his enterprising team record their first win over a side in the top half of the table since beating Manchester United here in December. For it to come against Arteta \u2013 who grew up playing for the same youth team in San Sebastian \u2013 made it particularly sweet. But with Bukayo Saka having not made the trip to the south coast, Arsenal \u2013 who missed the chance to go top of the table with Liverpool and Manchester City not in action until Sunday \u2013 had looked short of inspiration even before Saliba\u2019s red card swung the balance of the game and they were condemned to a first away defeat of 2024.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/19/arsenal-left-counting-cost-of-naivety-says-declan-rice\">Arsenal left counting cost of naivety, says Declan Rice</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Arteta admitted before kick-off that \u201cthere was no point pushing\u201d Saka with games against Shakhtar Donetsk and Liverpool to come this week after he returned early from England duty due to a hamstring injury. Yet the Arsenal manager will be concerned with how his side struggled without their talisman and captain Martin \u00d8degaard.</p> \n<p>Iraola acknowledged this week that while their expected goals data had indicated they should be fourth in the table, the onus is on his players to \u201cbecome a more efficient team\u201d. They made their intentions clear from the start here as Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier were deployed in attacking roles supporting centre forward Evanilson and they took the game to the visitors. By contrast, Arsenal looked short of ideas and almost fell behind when David Raya was then fortunate that his wayward pass to Scott didn\u2019t result in a goal as Antoine Semenyo blazed over from distance.</p> \n<p>Iraola and Arteta spent the majority of the first half an hour cajoling on the edge of their technical areas. But the game suddenly came alive when Leandro Trossard inadvertently played the ball over his own defence and Saliba brought down Evanilson as the Brazilian raced through on goal. A red card looked to be the likely outcome, although the referee, Robert Jones, initially only cautioned the France defender.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal\u2019s new penchant for picking up red cards had to catch up with them eventually. Mikel Arteta\u2019s side finally surrendered their unbeaten start to the season after William Saliba was sent off \u2013 their third dismissal in their opening eight league matches \u2013 as Bournemouth celebrated a famous victory thanks to goals from substitutes Ryan Christie and Justin Kluivert. It was an evening to savour for their manager, Andoni Iraola, who saw his enterprising team record their first win over a side in the top half of the table since beating Manchester United here in December. For it to come against Arteta \u2013 who grew up playing for the same youth team in San Sebastian \u2013 made it particularly sweet. But with Bukayo Saka having not made the trip to the south coast, Arsenal \u2013 who missed the chance to go top of the table with Liverpool and Manchester City not in action until Sunday \u2013 had looked short of inspiration even before Saliba\u2019s red card swung the balance of the game and they were condemned to a first away defeat of 2024. Arteta admitted before kick-off that \u201cthere was no point pushing\u201d Saka with games against Shakhtar Donetsk and Liverpool to come this week after he returned early from England duty due to a hamstring injury. Yet the Arsenal manager will be concerned with how his side struggled without their talisman and captain Martin \u00d8degaard. Iraola acknowledged this week that while their expected goals data had indicated they should be fourth in the table, the onus is on his players to \u201cbecome a more efficient team\u201d. They made their intentions clear from the start here as Alex Scott and Marcus Tavernier were deployed in attacking roles supporting centre forward Evanilson and they took the game to the visitors. By contrast, Arsenal looked short of ideas and almost fell behind when David Raya was then fortunate that his wayward pass to Scott didn\u2019t result in a goal as Antoine Semenyo blazed over from distance. Iraola and Arteta spent the majority of the first half an hour cajoling on the edge of their technical areas. But the game suddenly came alive when Leandro Trossard inadvertently played the ball over his own defence and Saliba brought down Evanilson as the Brazilian raced through on goal. A red card looked to be the likely outcome, although the referee, Robert Jones, initially only cautioned the France defender. With PGMOL chief Howard Webb watching on from the stands, however, VAR thought differently and Saliba was given his marching orders that mean he will miss the meeting with Liverpool next weekend. Mikel Merino came close to finding a breakthrough on his full debut after good work from Raheem Sterling before the England forward was sacrificed for Jakub Kiwior to shore things up at the back. Semenyo had already forced Raya into a good save at his near post by then and Tavernier should have opened the scoring from his cross after Raya had initially fumbled before recovering to block the shot. Meanwhile, Arsenal\u2019s supporters made their disgruntlement known with several chants directed at Webb and their other perceived injustices. Semenyo should have done better with a golden chance that fell to him 90 seconds after the restart after a clever backheel from Milos Kerkez. But having already played the best part of 90 minutes with 10 men in the draws against Brighton and Manchester City earlier this season, at first Arsenal appeared comfortable in their rearguard action. Any hopes of a breakthrough seemed destined to come down Arsenal\u2019s right side as Dango Ouattara continued to cause Ben White problems. So it was a surprise to see him make way as Iraola made three changes just after the hour mark, while Gabriel Martinelli almost had an instant impact off the bench when his cross was cleared at the last minute by Marcos Senesi. Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s heart must have been in his mouth when he passed the ball straight to Merino, only for the Bournemouth goalkeeper to redeem himself by saving Martinelli\u2019s shot.

      "body": "<p>As the sky darkened on the National Mall in DC last Saturday, evangelical pastor Ch\u00e9 Ahn addressed the thousands of worshippers gathered there and issued a decree.</p> <p>Trump, Ahn said, was a figure akin to the biblical King Jehu, and \u201cKamala Harris is a type of Jezebel, and as you know, Jehu cast out Jezebel\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI decree in Jesus\u2019s mighty name, and I decree it by faith,\u201d said Ahn, \u201cthat Trump will win on November the fifth, he will be our 47th president, and Kamala Harris will be cast out and she will lose in Jesus\u2019s name.\u201d</p> <p>The Bible story Ahn invoked is extremely violent. In it, Jehu throws the Phoenician princess Jezebel from a window. She is then trampled by horses, her corpse left to be eaten by dogs. Ahn did not get into the particulars of this story at the DC event, but he likely didn\u2019t need to: in his world of charismatic and evangelical preachers, pastors, self-styled prophets and apostles, and their many followers, the story of Jezebel is a key narrative.</p> <p>The rally on the mall on 12 October, advertised under the name A Million Women, was billed as a gathering for women to wage spiritual warfare against changing gender norms in the US. Drawing tens of thousands, the event showcased the ability of leaders from the New Apostolic Reformation, a growing movement on the Christian right, to mobilize followers \u2013 and ply them with militant political rhetoric.</p> <p>Experts fear their spiritual message has the potential to spur real-world political violence, especially if Trump were to lose the November election.</p> <p>As Ahn spoke, the crowd that had gathered on the mall to \u201cturn back hearts to God\u201d through prayer and praise, swayed and listened. Some had heard about the rally through Bible studies and church groups and seemed unaware that many of the featured speakers were deeply involved in rightwing politics. Others had participated in the Capitol protest that devolved into a deadly riot on 6 January 2021. All received the messages of a dire, good-versus-evil vision of American politics that the speakers brought that day \u2013 and peddle regularly on podcasts, YouTube channels and Christian television and in front of their congregations.</p>    <p>Matthew Taylor, a scholar whose work has focused on the New Apostolic Reformation, said veiled calls for violence cloaked in religious rhetoric are common in the NAR, a loosely-affiliated network on the Christian right that embraces modern-day apostles and prophets.</p> <p>\u201cHaving it be a women\u2019s march, I think they kind of dialed back some of the more violent rhetoric,\u201d said Taylor, who is a senior researcher at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies. But Ahn\u2019s decree, he said, \u201cshocked\u201d him.</p> <p>\u201cI could very easily picture, if you had the right mix of charismatic identity theology that\u2019s aligned with the NAR, and unhinged, violent tendencies in an individual \u2013 yeah, that could very easily be an instigating factor in an assassination attempt,\u201d said Taylor.</p> <p>Leaders in the movement who spoke with the Guardian emphasized that they meant only to draw their followers into battle of a spiritual nature, and correctly pointed out that the rally on the mall was peaceful.</p> <p>\u201cWe were fasting, all of us on that stage were fasting,\u201d said Folake Kellogg, a pastor who helped organize the event and spoke there. \u201cWe had not eaten, we were praying. We knew that the battle is not against any human being. We love our brothers and sisters.\u201d</p> <p>Ahn disputed the idea that his decree could spur his followers to violence, writing in an email that such language was \u201call spiritual\u201d and that \u201c[a]nyone who advocates physical violence in Jesus name is not a true follower of Jesus who taught us to turn our cheeks\u201d.</p> <p>Leaders in the NAR \u201cbelieve themselves to be what they call kings and priests and [members of] a royal nation\u201d, said Jonathon Sawyer, an academic whose research focuses on religious and political extremism.

      "bodyText": "As the sky darkened on the National Mall in DC last Saturday, evangelical pastor Ch\u00e9 Ahn addressed the thousands of worshippers gathered there and issued a decree. Trump, Ahn said, was a figure akin to the biblical King Jehu, and \u201cKamala Harris is a type of Jezebel, and as you know, Jehu cast out Jezebel\u201d. \u201cI decree in Jesus\u2019s mighty name, and I decree it by faith,\u201d said Ahn, \u201cthat Trump will win on November the fifth, he will be our 47th president, and Kamala Harris will be cast out and she will lose in Jesus\u2019s name.\u201d The Bible story Ahn invoked is extremely violent. In it, Jehu throws the Phoenician princess Jezebel from a window. She is then trampled by horses, her corpse left to be eaten by dogs. Ahn did not get into the particulars of this story at the DC event, but he likely didn\u2019t need to: in his world of charismatic and evangelical preachers, pastors, self-styled prophets and apostles, and their many followers, the story of Jezebel is a key narrative. The rally on the mall on 12 October, advertised under the name A Million Women, was billed as a gathering for women to wage spiritual warfare against changing gender norms in the US. Drawing tens of thousands, the event showcased the ability of leaders from the New Apostolic Reformation, a growing movement on the Christian right, to mobilize followers \u2013 and ply them with militant political rhetoric. Experts fear their spiritual message has the potential to spur real-world political violence, especially if Trump were to lose the November election. As Ahn spoke, the crowd that had gathered on the mall to \u201cturn back hearts to God\u201d through prayer and praise, swayed and listened. Some had heard about the rally through Bible studies and church groups and seemed unaware that many of the featured speakers were deeply involved in rightwing politics. Others had participated in the Capitol protest that devolved into a deadly riot on 6 January 2021. All received the messages of a dire, good-versus-evil vision of American politics that the speakers brought that day \u2013 and peddle regularly on podcasts, YouTube channels and Christian television and in front of their congregations. Matthew Taylor, a scholar whose work has focused on the New Apostolic Reformation, said veiled calls for violence cloaked in religious rhetoric are common in the NAR, a loosely-affiliated network on the Christian right that embraces modern-day apostles and prophets. \u201cHaving it be a women\u2019s march, I think they kind of dialed back some of the more violent rhetoric,\u201d said Taylor, who is a senior researcher at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies. But Ahn\u2019s decree, he said, \u201cshocked\u201d him. \u201cI could very easily picture, if you had the right mix of charismatic identity theology that\u2019s aligned with the NAR, and unhinged, violent tendencies in an individual \u2013 yeah, that could very easily be an instigating factor in an assassination attempt,\u201d said Taylor. Leaders in the movement who spoke with the Guardian emphasized that they meant only to draw their followers into battle of a spiritual nature, and correctly pointed out that the rally on the mall was peaceful. \u201cWe were fasting, all of us on that stage were fasting,\u201d said Folake Kellogg, a pastor who helped organize the event and spoke there. \u201cWe had not eaten, we were praying. We knew that the battle is not against any human being. We love our brothers and sisters.\u201d Ahn disputed the idea that his decree could spur his followers to violence, writing in an email that such language was \u201call spiritual\u201d and that \u201c[a]nyone who advocates physical violence in Jesus name is not a true follower of Jesus who taught us to turn our cheeks\u201d. Leaders in the NAR \u201cbelieve themselves to be what they call kings and priests and [members of] a royal nation\u201d, said Jonathon Sawyer, an academic whose research focuses on religious and political extremism. Such figures \u201chave the sense that when they offer some type of decree such as this, that there is a tangible impact that will happen in the \u2018natural sphere\u2019 and in politics\u201d, he added. Because pastors like Ahn lean so heavily on biblical allegory, they are afforded a degree of plausible deniability if followers interpret their speech as an incitement to violence. And in the world that Ahn occupies, this kind of language has been thick in the air for years. Ahn\u2019s decree itself was likely familiar to some: on 5 January 2021, Ahn issued a nearly identical one at a Stop the Steal rally in Washington DC. The notion that Harris herself embodies the spirit of Jezebel has also become commonplace among preachers in the NAR. \u201cRepublicans, like Ahab in the Bible, accommodate Jezebel,\u201d said the pro-Trump, self-styled prophet Lance Wallnau on a 13 September episode of his podcast titled Trump vs The Jezebel Spirit: How Trump Can Still Win, which aired after the presidential debate.

I don\u2019t think we come back from this one if Trump cannot secure a victory,\u201d said Wallnau on his 7 October show. \u201cI think that once he\u2019s removed, the anti-Christ forces are going to start to move at a faster rate.\u201d Jenny Donnelly, the organizer of the 12 October rally, hopes the women she summoned to the National Mall \u2013 \u201cEsthers\u201d, she calls them \u2013 will be ready to fight such anti-Christ forces.

Now that they are \u201cembedded\u201d, she says, the Welsh and Scottish bans have shown that England, also, needs to ban the existing \u201creasonable chastisement\u201d defence. At the time of the Welsh ban, the then education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said there was nothing wrong with a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/04/21/education-secretary-rejects-call-smacking-ban-england/\">light smack on the arm</a>\u201d.

Even Lammy is presumably aware of research confirming that far from discouraging misbehaviour, the physical punishment of children does \u2013 surprise! \u2013 the opposite. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34197808/\">2021 summary </a>of longitudinal studies by Anja Heilmann and others offered this to policymakers: \u201cThe evidence is consistent and robust: physical punishment does not predict improvements in child behaviour and instead predicts deterioration in child behaviour and increased risk for maltreatment. There is thus no empirical reason for&nbsp;parents to continue to use physical punishment.\u201d In a further setback for hitting advocates, countries that have outlawed it have not been overwhelmed by mischievous prosecutions of virtuous parents.</p> <p>The best excuse for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/02/childrensservices.politics1\">Blair government\u2019s endorsement</a> in its Children Act of the physical chastisement of children is that, about 20 years ago, even some clinicians rejected the moral imperative to protect the defenceless. In the <em>BMJ</em>, one advised&nbsp;what was not then considered faintly obscene: punishment \u201cadministered with the&nbsp;open hand to the buttocks or the&nbsp;extremities\u201d.</p> <p>But in 2004, an amendment tabled by a Labour MP, David Hinchliffe, to give children the same legal protection as adults, was supported by every significant UK child protection agency. Incredibly, you might think, his colleagues were </p> <p>whipped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/02/childrensservices.politics1\">to ensure</a> that the perpetrators of physical punishment were the ones protected.</p> <p>Hinchliffe has since recalled Tony&nbsp;Blair telling him it was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/24/a-smacking-ban-could-have-been-imposed-years-ago-and-saved-childrens-lives\">a notch&nbsp;too far</a>\u201d. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/24/a-smacking-ban-could-have-been-imposed-years-ago-and-saved-childrens-lives\">I have often wondered</a>,\u201d he wrote to the <em>Guardian</em>, after the Welsh ban was introduced, \u201chow many of the more than 800 children killed during the near two decades since might just possibly not have lost their lives if we had introduced that very modest and quite simple reform.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Labour has neglected, like the Tories, to promise this simple reform, while <a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/statistics-briefings/child-deaths-abuse-neglect\">children continue to be killed</a> at the rate of one a week, such speculation is likely to persist.

After the 2012 London riots, for instance, David Lammy said Labour-imposed constraints on chastisement had contributed to disorder. \u201cWe should return to the law as it existed for 150 years before it was changed in 2004\u201d. The then mayor, Boris Johnson, whose upbringing means he probably knows more about domestic hitting than most, sympathised: \u201cThere ought to be some confirmation that the benefit of the doubt will always be given to parents in these matters...\u201d It could be a sign of infinitesimal progress that in the aftermath of the recent riots no serious politician suggested that with a bit more parental barbarity, younger rioters might have held back. Even Lammy is presumably aware of research confirming that far from discouraging misbehaviour, the physical punishment of children does \u2013 surprise! \u2013 the opposite. A 2021 summary of longitudinal studies by Anja Heilmann and others offered this to policymakers: \u201cThe evidence is consistent and robust: physical punishment does not predict improvements in child behaviour and instead predicts deterioration in child behaviour and increased risk for maltreatment. There is thus no empirical reason for parents to continue to use physical punishment.\u201d In a further setback for hitting advocates, countries that have outlawed it have not been overwhelmed by mischievous prosecutions of virtuous parents. The best excuse for the Blair government\u2019s endorsement in its Children Act of the physical chastisement of children is that, about 20 years ago, even some clinicians rejected the moral imperative to protect the defenceless. In the BMJ, one advised what was not then considered faintly obscene: punishment \u201cadministered with the open hand to the buttocks or the extremities\u201d. But in 2004, an amendment tabled by a Labour MP, David Hinchliffe, to give children the same legal protection as adults, was supported by every significant UK child protection agency. Incredibly, you might think, his colleagues were whipped to ensure that the perpetrators of physical punishment were the ones protected. Hinchliffe has since recalled Tony Blair telling him it was \u201ca notch too far\u201d. \u201cI have often wondered,\u201d he wrote to the Guardian, after the Welsh ban was introduced, \u201chow many of the more than 800 children killed during the near two decades since might just possibly not have lost their lives if we had introduced that very modest and quite simple reform.\u201d Now that Labour has neglected, like the Tories, to promise this simple reform, while children continue to be killed at the rate of one a week, such speculation is likely to persist. As is the reluctance of neighbours to report what sounds like extreme punishment when it might only be a traditional, Zahawi-style \u201clight slap\u201d. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Her work ranges from the philosophical examination of being, belief and morality to urgent engagements with environmental catastrophe; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/22/james-salter\">James Salter</a> wrote of her that she belongs in the company of C\u00e9line and Flannery O\u2019Connor.

The brevity of these glimpsed gifts was essential to their mysterious power and effect \u2013 power over me at least. I don\u2019t feel I can put something like this together again.</p> <p><strong>For many years, you\u2019ve written about the climate emergency and environmental destruction. I wonder if your thinking about how to represent that in fiction has developed, and where you think it might go?<br></strong>I\u2019m always trying to convince myself that fiction <em>will</em> rise up and throw away the crutches that have been supporting it for far too long. The comfy story has got to change. It needs to be more uncanny, less personal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Marilynne Robinson says she read Moby-Dick when she was nine. I wish I could say such a thing! </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You grew up in Maine, an </strong><strong>only child, and your father was a </strong><strong>congregational minister</strong><strong>. Were there particular aspects of your upbringing that shaped you as a writer?<br></strong>That does sound gothic. But it was unfashionably ordinary.</p> <p><strong>Would you describe yourself as a metaphysical writer? There are many concrete, earthly details in your work, but you seem overall concerned with reaching the kinds of truth that are not immediately observable or provable.<br></strong>There\u2019s always been this strain, a strong strain in American writing. I\u2019ve always found an awareness of guilt, an immaterial longing and hope of transformation essential to the American voice. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/18/john-cheever-blake-bailey\">Cheever</a> has it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/dec/20/observer-profile-cormac-mccarthy\">Cormac McCarthy</a> most definitely.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re not alone in this \u2013 </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/15/marilynne-robinson-interview-givenness-of-everything\">Marilynne Robinson</a></strong><strong> is one example, and in their different ways writers </strong><strong>such as </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/don-delillo-mccrum-interview\">Don DeLillo</a></strong><strong>, </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/29/playground-richard-powers-review-ai-ocean\">Richard Powers</a></strong><strong> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/31/writing-this-book-was-like-a-drug-high-rachel-kushner-on-her-booker-listed-novel\">Rachel Kushner</a></strong><strong>. Do you think there\u2019s a particular American tradition of this kind of writing?<br></strong>Marilynne Robinson says she read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\">Moby-Dick</a></em> when she was nine. I wish I could say such a thing! I was reading horse books, dog books, the Baba Yaga stories in <em>Jack and Jill</em> magazine: my library card was my most treasured possession, but I didn\u2019t read with much discrimination.</p> <p><strong>You started writing quite early in your life \u2013 you were </strong><strong>published at 22</strong><strong>. What kind of a writer did you want to be, and think you might be?<br></strong>I wrote my first story when I was in high school. It was about a lonely girl travelling on a bus home toward some unspecified tragedy that had occurred, and her thoughts. I sent it to <em>Seventeen</em> magazine. They were having a fiction contest. I never heard from them. My parents said it must have been lost in the mail.</p> <p><strong>Which writers were important to you as you got older? I believe Emily Dickinson was one of them\u2026<br></strong>In college I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/13/emily-dickinson-lyndall-gordon\">Emily Dickinson</a>. I sent a paper off to a scholarly magazine about a photograph of Emily which shows very clearly the two sides of her personality, her very being; her face is practically cleaved in half \u2013 darkness and light. I never heard back from them either.</p> <p><strong>When you were studying at </strong><strong>Iowa</strong><strong>, </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/27/raymond-carver-editor-influence\">Raymond Carver</a></strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Richard Yates</strong><strong> were around. Did either make an impression on you?<br></strong>I was a friend of Ray\u2019s and his wife, Maryann. He was writing poetry at Iowa but I was in a few fiction classes with him before he left the programme: he gave me his copy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2006/nov/02/rememberingwilliamstyron192\">William Styron</a>\u2019s novel <em>Lie Down in Darkness</em>. I guess he didn\u2019t need it. Richard Yates visited for a year. He seemed anxious. His collection <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\">Eleven Kinds of Loneliness</a></em> had just come out and the stories seemed so antique to me. Students are cruel, of course. The last thing they want is to be impressed by the previous generation.</p> <p><strong>I read about a lecture you once gave in which you quoted </strong><strong>Mark Twain</strong><strong>\u2019s phrase about a writer needing a pen that had been \u201c</strong><strong>warmed-up in hell</strong><strong>\u201d to write truthfully and substantially. What has that meant in your work?<br></strong>Yes, these pens are essential to have: not enough of them available. A writer needs to be angry too and have a sense of wonder. There really is something so unfathomable about us being here.</p> <p><strong>How do you write, I mean physically and logistically? I ask because I don\u2019t think you use a computer, or ever have.<br></strong>I have a number of typewriters, all of which have something wrong with them. I sent my favourite one off for cleaning and UPS lost it. Now I don\u2019t have a favourite. This is not ideal.</p> <p><strong>Is there a book or a writer you regularly return to?<br></strong>I\u2019m always reading poetry, and the commentaries and writings of Maurice Nicoll.</p> <p><strong>What have you enjoyed reading recently?<br></strong>I just finished Mann\u2019s <em>Dr Faustus</em> for the first time, and the amazing novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/18/andrei-platonov-robert-chandler\">Andrei Platonov</a>. Most recently I was impressed by Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-message-9780241724187/\">The Message</a></em>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Concerning the Future of Souls: 99 Stories of Azrael</em> is published by Tuskar Rocks (\u00a312.99).

I\u2019m always trying to convince myself that fiction will rise up and throw away the crutches that have been supporting it for far too long. The comfy story has got to change. It needs to be more uncanny, less personal. You grew up in Maine, an only child, and your father was a congregational minister. Were there particular aspects of your upbringing that shaped you as a writer? That does sound gothic. But it was unfashionably ordinary. Would you describe yourself as a metaphysical writer? There are many concrete, earthly details in your work, but you seem overall concerned with reaching the kinds of truth that are not immediately observable or provable. There\u2019s always been this strain, a strong strain in American writing. I\u2019ve always found an awareness of guilt, an immaterial longing and hope of transformation essential to the American voice. Cheever has it, Cormac McCarthy most definitely. You\u2019re not alone in this \u2013 Marilynne Robinson is one example, and in their different ways writers such as Don DeLillo, Richard Powers and Rachel Kushner. Do you think there\u2019s a particular American tradition of this kind of writing? Marilynne Robinson says she read Moby-Dick when she was nine. I wish I could say such a thing! I was reading horse books, dog books, the Baba Yaga stories in Jack and Jill magazine: my library card was my most treasured possession, but I didn\u2019t read with much discrimination. You started writing quite early in your life \u2013 you were published at 22. What kind of a writer did you want to be, and think you might be? I wrote my first story when I was in high school. It was about a lonely girl travelling on a bus home toward some unspecified tragedy that had occurred, and her thoughts. I sent it to Seventeen magazine. They were having a fiction contest. I never heard from them. My parents said it must have been lost in the mail. Which writers were important to you as you got older? I believe Emily Dickinson was one of them\u2026 In college I read Emily Dickinson. I sent a paper off to a scholarly magazine about a photograph of Emily which shows very clearly the two sides of her personality, her very being; her face is practically cleaved in half \u2013 darkness and light. I never heard back from them either. When you were studying at Iowa, Raymond Carver and Richard Yates were around. Did either make an impression on you? I was a friend of Ray\u2019s and his wife, Maryann. He was writing poetry at Iowa but I was in a few fiction classes with him before he left the programme: he gave me his copy of William Styron\u2019s novel Lie Down in Darkness. I guess he didn\u2019t need it. Richard Yates visited for a year. He seemed anxious. His collection Eleven Kinds of Loneliness had just come out and the stories seemed so antique to me. Students are cruel, of course. The last thing they want is to be impressed by the previous generation. I read about a lecture you once gave in which you quoted Mark Twain\u2019s phrase about a writer needing a pen that had been \u201cwarmed-up in hell\u201d to write truthfully and substantially. What has that meant in your work? Yes, these pens are essential to have: not enough of them available. A writer needs to be angry too and have a sense of wonder. There really is something so unfathomable about us being here. How do you write, I mean physically and logistically? I ask because I don\u2019t think you use a computer, or ever have. I have a number of typewriters, all of which have something wrong with them. I sent my favourite one off for cleaning and UPS lost it. Now I don\u2019t have a favourite. This is not ideal. Is there a book or a writer you regularly return to? I\u2019m always reading poetry, and the commentaries and writings of Maurice Nicoll. What have you enjoyed reading recently? I just finished Mann\u2019s Dr Faustus for the first time, and the amazing novels of Andrei Platonov. Most recently I was impressed by Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s The Message. \u2022 Concerning the Future of Souls: 99 Stories of Azrael is published by Tuskar Rocks (\u00a312.99).

Could this be the end then, beautiful friend?\u201d \u2013 Karen Asad</p> <p>\u201cI am VERY much looking forward to today\u2019s action, especially THE match of the day, for once coming from north of the border, with Lord Ferg\u2019s old club in great form and with a chance to do what Rangers have failed to do these last few seasons. But I\u2019m also fascinated to see how the curse of Ratcliffe (see also Ineos Britannia, Ineos Grenadiers, Ineos Formula One...) plays out on the greensward this afternoon. Clearly, Brentford will score inside 2 mins and that will then be a proper test of the United crockery. Squillions of quid invested and not a single trophy to show for it.

Time to pop over to the MBM, where Rob Smyth will guide you through all the action at Dean Court, where Bournemouth take on an Arsenal side shorn of Bukayo Saya but now with added Mikel Merino. Thanks for reading! Match report: Celtic 2-2 Aberdeen. \u201cAt half-time, the billing of this fixture as a top of the table extravaganza felt like a breach of the Trades Descriptions Act,\u201d begins Ewan Murray at Parkhead. \u201cWhat happened next owed plenty to Celtic defensive deficiency and Aberdeen\u2019s refusal to wilt.\u201d Match report: Southampton 2-3 Leicester City. Here\u2019s how the Foxes stunned Southampton with a dramatic comeback at St Mary\u2019s. Match report: Ipswich Town 0-2 Everton. \u201cHere was a hard lesson that playing the right way will not always land the right result,\u201d observes John Brewin from Portman Road. Match report: Newcastle United 0-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. \u201cA PhD student could surely have used these 102 minutes on Tyneside as the basis for a thesis on the vagaries of the game\u2019s fluctuating fortunes,\u201d suggests Louise Taylor at St James\u2019 Park. Match report: Manchester United 2-1 Brentford. \u201cRasmus H\u00f8jlund\u2019s winner was a strike of certifiable skill and will bring a calmer vibe to Erik ten Hag,\u201d begins Jamie Jackson, reporting from Old Trafford. Match report: Fulham 1-3 Aston Villa. \u201cWhen will the Unai Emery era reach its ceiling?\u201d wonders Ben Bloom at Craven Cottage. Back to the Championship. None of the drama provided by the Premier League or Scottish Premiership, but here\u2019s the table nonetheless, for Clockwatch completists worldwide. \u2026 that aforementioned Simon McMahon / James Humphries love-in. And a day of contrasts for our Dundee United and Motherwell supporting heroes north of the border. SIMON: I\u2019m sure James is a lovely guy, but I\u2019m sorry, the 1991 Scottish Cup final is still just too raw. JAMES: Apologies to McMahon; finished 0-1 to Dundee. I can only conclude that the ref got his heart broke by a Motherwell girl, but nonetheless we could have played all bloody day and not scored. Christ, it\u2019s time for a pint. SIMON: Oh my days! 3-2 United, 90+3 and 90+8. Football, eh, bloody hell. Scottish Premiership table. For a wee while there, Celtic looked to have put 1985-style pretenders Aberdeen in their place. But then the second half happened, and now look! Meanwhile at the bottom, Hearts leapfrog their city rivals Hibs, who capitulated late at Tannadice. Speaking of which \u2026 Premier League table. Aston Villa\u2019s win at Fulham draws them level on points with Manchester City and Arsenal. Brighton also move on up after their win at Newcastle, although their victory is tempered by the back injury suffered by Danny Welbeck. Manchester United make it back into the top half with a come-from-behind defeat of Brentford. And it\u2019s good news for Leicester and Everton at the bottom, but a complete sickener for Southampton, who gave up a two-goal lead at home to crumble to a seventh defeat from eight. They now prop up the entire division, and their manager Russell Martin is passed the Crisis Baton by a relieved Erik ten Hag. Scottish Premiership full-times. Celtic 2-2 Aberdeen Dundee United 3-2 Hibernian Heart of Midlothian 4-0 St Mirren Motherwell 0-1 Dundee St Johnstone 3-0 Ross County Championship full-times. Blackburn Rovers 1-0 Swansea City Cardiff 5-0 Plymouth Argyle Luton Town 3-0 Watford Middlesbrough 0-2 Bristol City Millwall 1-1 Derby County Oxford United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion Preston North End 1-0 Coventry City Queens Park Rangers 1-2 Portsmouth Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Burnley Stoke City 1-1 Norwich City Fulham 1-3 Aston Villa Ipswich Town 0-2 Everton Manchester United 2-1 Brentford Newcastle United 0-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Southampton 2-3 Leicester City A doddle for in-form Everton, who are easing themselves out of the relegation picture. Ipswich\u2019s promising start to their Premier League campaign is beginning to curdle, a heavy defeat at West Ham now followed by this no-show. Elsewhere in the Scottish Premiership \u2026 now then \u2026 Dundee United were 2-1 down at home to Hibernian with five minutes to play. Then the Hibees captain Joe Newell got himself sent off, picking up a second yellow card. Cue capitulation. Luca Stephenson forced an equaliser after three minutes of injury time, and then in the ninth additional minute, Meshack Obuchioma completed the comeback of comebacks on a day of comebacks. The match finishes 3-2 to the Tangerines, and we expect to hear from Simon McMahon soon, providing somebody can scrape him off the ceiling. Nope! Then the whistle goes, and it\u2019s honours even in the top-of-the-table clash in Scotland! Both teams lose their 100 percent records, but it\u2019ll be the Dons who\u2019ll be the happier. Celtic 2-2 Aberdeen. Some late drama in the tenth minute of injury time! Slobodan Rubezic fouls Luke McCowan inches outside the Aberdeen box, but it\u2019s just a free kick. That\u2019s deflected over the bar, and from the resulting corner, Duk blocks on the line. Penalty? It\u2019s been a day of comebacks in the Premier League. Villa respond magnificently to falling behind early doors and Unai Emery\u2019s side are right in the title mix! Newcastle had their chances, but Danny Welbeck took his. Here\u2019s sending the subsequently stricken striker best wishes and hopes of a speedy recovery. Another comeback victory, and this one offers some much-needed succour for the under-fire Erik ten Hag! Does this feel worse than the infamous 0-9? By the sounds of the boos ringing around St Mary\u2019s, possibly. Russell Martin goes up to the referee and gives him the what-for. Shades of Graham Taylor\u2019s broadside at the Uefa official during England\u2019s USA \u201894 qualifying defeat in the Netherlands? Saints concede another last-gasp goal at St Mary\u2019s! Jordan Ayew coverts from a corner to complete Leicester\u2019s turnaround, and boos ring out from the home support. Russell Martin\u2019s time possibly running out, along with the Southampton fans\u2019 patience. Newcastle 0-1 Brighton. Dan Burn breaks clear and dinks home, but he\u2019s clearly offside and the flag pops up. Two yellow cards for Jaden Philogene, the second soft one for a light shove. Southampton 2-2 Leicester. Facundo Buonanotte is this close to completing the turnaround for the Foxes against ten-man Saints. His curler whistles past the post. Ipswich 0-2 Everton. Ipswich are doing absolutely nothing at Portman Road. No shots on target, and Everton are completely comfortable as they look to see out this relegation six-pointer. Everton, closing in on seven points from the last nine, and unbeaten since shipping a two-goal lead at Aston Villa in mid-September, might not be in the relegation picture for much longer. Newcastle 0-1 Brighton. According to Sky, Danny Welbeck took an accidental knee in the back from Fabian Sch\u00e4r. He was given gas before being stretchered straight to an ambulance. Manchester United 2-1 Brentford. United remain in control at Old Trafford. Brentford not offering much. Newcastle 0-1 Brighton. Worrying news at St James\u2019 Park, where the goalscorer Danny Welbeck is carried off having injured his back. A seven-minute stoppage. God speed. Issa Diop diverts Lucas Digne\u2019s cross into his own net, and the three points are Villa\u2019s, unless some absurd drama is about to heave into view. Handball. Elbow-ball, to be precise. VAR. So scrub that. That\u2019s this entry. This is sensational. That\u2019s the entry. Jamie Vardy picks himself up, dusts himself down, and hauls Leicester level from 12 yards! Saints stunned at home again, and their dream of breaking that three-point duck is fast going up in smoke. Ryan Fraser is the culprit, and he\u2019s sent packing. The referee points to the spot. Southampton 2-1 Leicester. Saints are on the rack at St Mary\u2019s. Jamie Vardy looks to have been pulled back by a defender, and the referee is called over to the VAR screen. United complete the turnaround! Rasmus Hojlund dinks over Mark Flekken, and here\u2019s another initially promising game going south for a side from west London. Joachim Andersen, the last man, pulls down Ollie Watkins and an initially promising afternoon for Fulham is beginning to turn seriously sour. Ipswich 0-2 Everton. The second half has started in Suffolk. Facundo Buonanotte scores his third goal of the season, and Southampton\u2019s first three-point haul of the campaign doesn\u2019t look quite so secure now. Game on at St Mary\u2019s. Graeme Shinnie sends a deflected pearler past Kasper Schmeichel, and Aberdeen party like it\u2019s 1985! Youri Tielemans whips in a corner, Ollie Watkins eyebrows home, and Andreas Pereira\u2019s penalty miss looks super-costly now. Manchester United 1-1 Brentford. So yes, that controversial opening goal. Here\u2019s another / a different reason why United were so animated, courtesy of Chris Mayo: \u201cThe issue is that the goal went in way past the allotted injury time, there weren\u2019t any further stoppages in injury time. So why the extra time?\u201d Manchester United 1-1 Brentford. Alejandro Garnacho, having levelled things up in short order, nearly puts the hosts in front with a determined slalom and shot. Mark Flekken is up to the task of palming it away. United in full flow and with the wind behind! That hairdryer, you see. The Dons aren\u2019t finished quite yet! Slovenia striker Ester Sokler, one of two subs sent on by the visitors at half-time, doesn\u2019t take long to make his mark at Parkhead. An instant response by the hosts at Old Trafford, Alejandro Garnacho sidefooting an adroit equaliser! Erik ten Hag finally getting Alex Ferguson\u2019s old hairdryer to work? Ipswich 0-2 Everton. It\u2019s half-time at Portman Road, where the match was delayed for 15 minutes due to turnstile issues. As things stand, Kieran McKenna\u2019s wait for a first Premier League victory looks likely to go on. Half-time claret-soaked postbag. \u201cToday\u2019s events are United in a nutshell these days: a bleeding mess!\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh \u201cOf course it\u2019s the officials\u2019 fault for not letting De Ligt stay on the field when he was still bleeding from the side of his head, and absolutely not the fault of the other nine outfielders for not marking or challenging Pinnock at the corner\u201d \u2013 Andy \u2018Not That One\u2019 Flintoff \u201cDanny Welbeck\u2019s highest total goals in one was season was 12 in 2011-12, and since then he\u2019s just twice reached ten. Even if he slacks off a bit, he\u2019s on track for his best season ever. Next month he\u2019ll turn 34 years old. He\u2019s the fine wine of football\u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius Scottish Premiership half-times. Celtic 2-0 Aberdeen Dundee United 1-1 Hibernian Heart of Midlothian 1-0 St Mirren Motherwell 0-1 Dundee St Johnstone 2-0 Ross County \u201cIt\u2019s 1-1 between Dundee United and Hibs at halftime,\u201d begins Simon McMahon, of north-of-the-border turf-war fame. \u201cJames Humphries will be receiving a letter from my solicitor ordering him to remove his tanks from my lawn if Motherwell don\u2019t overturn an 1-0 deficit at home to Dundee. And can\u2019t believe I forgot about the Eric Morecombe derby where it\u2019s, disappointingly, Forfar 0 East Fife 0.\u201d Humphries responds: \u201cThe dark blues are one up; ref\u2019s their best player by a mile. This has not been a top-class half of football.\u201d This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Championship half-times. Blackburn Rovers 1-0 Swansea City Cardiff 5-0 Plymouth Argyle (FT) Luton Town 3-0 Watford (FT) Middlesbrough 0-2 Bristol City Millwall 0-0 Derby County Oxford United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion (FT) Preston North End 1-0 Coventry City (FT) Queens Park Rangers 1-1 Portsmouth Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Burnley Stoke City 1-1 Norwich City Michael Keane doubles Everton\u2019s lead \u2026 not with a header, as you\u2019d expect, but a through-the-laces whistler into the top corner! That controversy, then, over Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s head injury and Brentford\u2019s subsequent goal scored in his absence. On Sky, former Premier League referee Mike Dean says: \u201cHe went off three times \u2026 first time it doesn\u2019t work \u2026 you either keep him off a little bit longer or sub the player \u2026 there\u2019s no fault whatsoever on the match officials \u2026 once he\u2019s bleeding, he cannot stay on the pitch \u2026 he tried his hardest to wipe the blood on his shirt, because his shirt is red, thinking he was going to get away with it \u2026 but it was all over his face \u2026 the referee has no choice whatsoever to send him off to get treated \u2026 you can\u2019t blame the ref \u2026 blame their medical team for not stopping the bleeding.\u201d Fulham 1-1 Aston Villa Ipswich Town 0-1 Everton (L) Manchester United 0-1 Brentford Newcastle United 0-1 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Southampton 2-0 Leicester City Manchester United 0-1 Brentford. While players and staff fume \u2013 Erik ten Hag is booked for telling it as he sees it - some of the United faithful boo. Old Trafford rarely turns on the manager, so most likely that\u2019s aimed at the officials. Matthijs de Ligt, still dripping with blood, is ordered off to be patched up for a third time. In his absence, Brentford take a corner, and Ethan Pinnock crashes a header into the net. United are livid at being forced down to ten men, but with De Ligt channelling his inner Terry Butcher, it\u2019s not clear what option the officials had. Manchester United 0-0 Brentford. Matthijs de Ligt\u2019s head wound splits open again, requiring more treatment. Once again he\u2019s patched up and sent back to work. Not ideal, though, with United already missing a few of their defenders through injury. They\u2019ll hope to patch up the Dutch international properly during the break. Ipswich 0-1 Everton. The referee is hauled over to the screen. A quick look, and the decision is reversed. No penalty. Ipswich 0-1 Everton. Jack Clarke is brought down by Dwight McNeil and a penalty is awarded. Or has Clarke kicked the back of McNeil\u2019s leg? The referee has awarded a spot kick, but VAR is taking a long look. Manchester United 0-0 Brentford. United have had a couple of extremely presentable chances, but Christian Eriksen and Alejandro Garnacho have been unable to take advantage. The story of United\u2019s season. OK, one of the stories of United\u2019s season. Newcastle 0-1 Brighton. That was a big blow for the Toon, who had been on top. Moments earlier, Alexander Isak was sent scampering clear on goal, but couldn\u2019t convert. Danny Welbeck\u2019s response, reward for a cute one-two, was Brighton\u2019s first whack at goal. It\u2019s six in ten for former Manchester United and Arsenal striker Danny. \u201cAm I the only United supporter who looks at Young and Welbeck in their respective line-ups and wonders hmm?\u201d writes Su. \u201cWe\u2019ve got rid of some better players than we currently have.\u201d Iliman Ndiaye latches onto Jack Clarke\u2019s poor clearance and the sort-of-in-form Toffees take the lead. Saints were seconds away from their first win of the Premier League season in their last home match, against Ipswich, only to be denied. They\u2019re on course to finally making it this time, though, with Joe Aribo doubling their lead at St Mary\u2019s. Blessed relief for Russell Martin is now within reach; Steve Cooper\u2019s coat isn\u2019t on a shoogly peg quite yet, but as a former Forest employee, there\u2019s a bit of give in that fixing. Kyogo, having set up Reo Hatate for the opener, makes it two in short order at Parkhead. The champions asserting themselves and no mistake! Fulham 1-1 Aston Villa. Matty Cash handles, the ball headed onto his outstretched arm. Penalty! But when Andreas Pereira takes, Emi Martinez guesses the right way, and flops on the weak effort. Chance to retake the lead spurned by the hosts! Ah well, there goes the dream of a first non-Old-Firm champion since 1985. Ipswich 0-0 Everton. Early opportunities at both ends, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jack Clarke missing fine chances. File under: Worth Waiting For, Nearly. Celtic 0-0 Aberdeen. No goals yet at Parkhead. Or in the match between Motherwell and Dundee, which is being watched by James Humphries, reporting from north of the border / performing donuts in a tank on Simon McMahon\u2019s lawn: \u201cAnother beautiful day in Lanarkshire; ten minutes in at Fir Park and Lennon Miller has already done three impossible things. He\u2019s gonna be a great player for Celtic one day (he said, wearily).\u201d Manchester United 0-0 Brentford. Matthijs de Ligt is fine to continue, despite that whack drawing plenty of blood. He\u2019s patched and cleaned up, and away we go again. Ipswich 0-0 Everton. The game has finally started at Portman Road. Manchester United 0-0 Brentford. \u2026 meanwhile on the pitch, Matthijs de Ligt has taken a whack upside the head from Kevin Schade, injuring himself while making a heavy challenge. He\u2019s currently getting it fixed by the physio as the game goes on. Manchester United 0-0 Deptford Brentford. No sign of former Manchester United ambassador Sir Alex Ferguson in the Old Trafford stand. That\u2019s because of a long-standing prior arrangement, according to the United PR people, who Sir Jim Ratcliffe will note are earning their money for sure this afternoon. An instant response from Villa. See, they\u2019re not going down, mid-to-late-80s style. Unai Emery &gt; Billy McNeill. QED. Saints flew out of the blocks at St Mary\u2019s, and they\u2019ve got their reward. Russell Martin gets his, too, for recalling Cameron Archer. Speaking of mid-1980s revivals, a long punt up the middle of the field is enough to do the trick for Fulham early doors. Only difference being, Villa are very unlikely to be relegated this time round. Before Brentford score their usual early goal, let\u2019s have a quick rummage around the pre-match postbag. \u201cGreetings from California at sunrise! Thanks for the respite from my country\u2019s existential dread of another Trump administration with a cracking schedule of football. I am trying to adopt a more positive attitude towards my Everton six-pointer fixture with Ipswich but my ulcer isn\u2019t co-operating at the moment. Hopefully Pickford used up his quota of Howlers versus Greece. Come on you Blue\u201d \u2013 Mary Waltz \u201cBetween Brentford\u2019s fast starts and Man Utd\u2019s sleepy, all-sorts midfield and defense, there is about 600 ways this could go wrong from here till Wednesday! Could this be the end then, beautiful friend?\u201d \u2013 Karen Asad \u201cI am VERY much looking forward to today\u2019s action, especially THE match of the day, for once coming from north of the border, with Lord Ferg\u2019s old club in great form and with a chance to do what Rangers have failed to do these last few seasons. But I\u2019m also fascinated to see how the curse of Ratcliffe (see also Ineos Britannia, Ineos Grenadiers, Ineos Formula One...) plays out on the greensward this afternoon. Clearly, Brentford will score inside 2 mins and that will then be a proper test of the United crockery. Squillions of quid invested and not a single trophy to show for it. You have to admire the depth of his pockets, while wondering how much longer he will feel like dipping his hand in them. Come on you Nylons!\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Boyce Ipswich v Everton. There\u2019s going to be a 15-minute delay at Portman Road. Turnstile issues, it\u2019s reported. It\u2019s 3pm and whistles sound across the land. Here we go, kids! Speaking of the old fitba, here\u2019s Clocko\u2019s old pal from the banks of the rolling waters of the River Tay, Simon McMahon. \u201cContinuing the 1980s nostalgia theme, Dundee United are at Pittodrie next week, after today\u2019s visit of Hibs to Tannadice. 40 years since this, in the same year Dundee United took a 2-0 lead to Rome in the European Cup semi finals, and the year after Aberdeen became the last side to defeat Real Madrid in a European final. How times change.\u201d \u2026 and seeing we\u2019re also keeping a beady eye on the Celtic-Aberdeen clash, here\u2019s how things stand in the Scottish Premiership. Is it possible that Jimmy Thelin will become the Alex Ferguson to Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Davie Hay? Ewan Murray allows himself to dream a little dream before deciding naw. There have been four early games in the Championship as well. Here are the luncheon-infused classifieds. Cardiff City 5-0 Plymouth Argyle Luton Town 3-0 Watford Oxford United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion Preston North End 1-0 Coventry City Cardiff spring from the bottom of the table by routing the extremely hard-to-predict Plymouth Argyle. Luton also enjoy themselves with a big win, theirs coming over M1 rivals Watford. Coventry City, who in a parallel universe are the holders of the FA Cup, continue their worrying decline with defeat at Preston. And Oxford continue to go along nicely, like it was the mid-80s all over again, a late equaliser earning a point against promotion hopefuls West Brom. All of which means the table looks like this going into the 3pms \u2026 The Premier League table. Here\u2019s how everyone sits after Tottenham\u2019s rout of their London rivals and ahead of the 3pms. Aston Villa, Brighton, Newcastle, Fulham and Brentford all have a chance to make some waves towards the top, but it\u2019s down below where the real action is this afternoon, with relegation six-pointers involving Ipswich, Everton, Saints and Leicester. Manchester United meanwhile are loitering on the Purgatory Mezzanine, so expect plenty more noise coming from off-stage afterwards if they don\u2019t pick up three points at Old Trafford. FULL TIME: Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 West Ham United. The lunchtime match has just finished, and this time it\u2019s been West Ham\u2019s turn to implode in the second half. Spurs rebound from their capitulation at Brighton to move into sixth place in the Premier League \u2026 for a couple of hours at least. Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side were full of the usual attacking verve, though the Hammers were a desperate shambles and Julen Lopetegui trotted off down the tunnel with a face on. Rob Smyth has all the details. Kyogo, who replaced Adam Idah during Celtic\u2019s 2-1 win at Ross County, does so from the start this time. Aberdeen meanwhile are unchanged; 13 wins out of 13 matches this season, you see. Celtic: Schmeichel, Johnston, Trusty, Scales, Valle, Engels, McGregor, Hatate, Furuhashi, Kuhn, Maeda. Subs: Sinisalo, Palma, Idah, Yang, McCowan, Bernardo, Forrest, Ralston, Welsh. Aberdeen: Mitov, Devlin, Rubezic, Molloy, MacKenzie, Shinnie, Nilsen, Keskinen, Clarkson, McGrath, Nisbet. Subs: Doohan, Lopes, Besuijen, Palaversa, Sokler, Morris, Milne, MacDonald, Ambrose. Cameron Archer replaces Ross Stewart, who went off injured during Southampton\u2019s surprisingly resilient display at Arsenal. Leicester also make a switch in attack, calling up Bilal El Khannouss. Southampton: Ramsdale, Sugawara, Harwood-Bellis, Bednarek, Walker-Peters, Manning, Dibling, Aribo, Downes, Fernandes, Archer. Subs: McCarthy, Smallbone, Armstrong, Lallana, Sulemana, Taylor, Fraser, Ugochukwu, Onuachu. Leicester City: Hermansen, Justin, Faes, Okoli, Kristiansen, Ndidi, Skipp, Buonanotte, El Khannous, Mavididi, Vardy. Subs: Ward, Coady, Fatawu, Winks, De Cordova-Reid, Ayew, Ricardo Pereira, Soumare, Edouard. It\u2019s all about the big-name strikers at St James\u2019 Park, the spiritual home of the archetypal number nine. Alexander Isak is back for Newcastle while comeback kings Brighton, high after their 3-2 win over Spurs, welcome back Evan Ferguson. Newcastle United: Pope, Livramento, Schar, Burn, Hall, Tonali, Guimaraes, Joelinton, Jacob Murphy, Isak, Gordon. Subs: Vlachodimos, Barnes, Krafth, Osula, Almiron, Kelly, Willock, Longstaff, Miley. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: Verbruggen, Veltman, Dunk, Igor, Kadioglu, Rutter, Baleba, Hinshelwood, Ayari, Welbeck, Ferguson. Subs: Steele, Lamptey, Gruda, Enciso, Moder, Mitoma, Wieffer, van Hecke, Estupinan. Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Casemiro return for United after the goalless draw at Aston Villa. Brentford are unchanged following their 5-3 rout of Wolves. Manchester United: Onana, Dalot, de Ligt, Evans, Martinez, Casemiro, Eriksen, Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford, Hojlund. Subs: Bayindir, Lindelof, Mazraoui, Zirkzee, Diallo, Antony, Ugarte, Wheatley, Fletcher. Brentford: Flekken, van den Berg, Collins, Pinnock, Ajer, Janelt, Norgaard, Mbeumo, Damsgaard, Lewis-Potter, Schade. Subs: Roerslev, Trevitt, Konak, Meghoma, Yarmolyuk, Mee, Carvalho, Wissa, Valdimarsson. Luke Woolfenden and Cameron Burgess step up for Ipswich in the wake of the 4-1 loss at West Ham. Everton also make two changes, after their goalless draw with Newcastle, Vitaly Mykolenko and Idrissa Gueye getting a start. Ipswich Town: Muric, Woolfenden, O\u2019Shea, Burgess, Davis, Morsy, Phillips, Burns, Hutchinson, Jack Clarke, Delap. Subs: Walton, Harrison Clarke, Chaplin, Taylor, Ogbene, Townsend, Szmodics, Hirst, Broadhead. Everton: Pickford, Young, Tarkowski, Keane, Mykolenko, Doucoure, Gueye, Harrison, McNeil, Ndiaye, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Virginia, Begovic, Patterson, Mangala, Beto, O\u2019Brien, Coleman, Armstrong, Dixon. Emile Smith Rowe returns for Fulham, who are attempting to bounce back from their brave 3-2 defeat at Manchester City. Aston Villa welcome back Diego Carlos, Amadou Onana and Jacob Ramsey, with goal machine Jhon Duran lurking on the bench, hoping to add to his season\u2019s tally of six. Fulham: Leno, Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Robinson, Pereira, Berge, Traore, Smith Rowe, Iwobi, Jimenez. Subs: Benda, Reed, Wilson, Rodrigo Muniz, Cairney, Nelson, King, Sessegnon, Diop. Aston Villa: Martinez, Cash, Diego Carlos, Torres, Digne, Onana, Tielemans, Bailey, Rogers, Ramsey, Watkins. Subs: Gauci, Konsa, Barkley, McGinn, Duran, Buendia, Philogene-Bidace, Maatsen, Kamara. We chased our international pleasures here, dug our Nations League treasures there, and now we\u2019ve broken through to the other side. The Premier League is back, baby, after its latest interminable hiatus, and while the Doors aren\u2019t exactly a fashionable reference point these days, it was either them or the Mike Sammes Singers again. Anyway, here are the 3pm kick-offs \u2026 Fulham v Aston Villa Ipswich Town v Everton Manchester United v Brentford Newcastle United v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Southampton v Leicester City \u2026 and in Scotland there\u2019s the small matter of Celtic v Aberdeen, so we\u2019ll have news of that 1980s nostalgia trip as well. We\u2019ll post all the team news as it comes in. Forward we go.",

      "body": "<p>In the 102nd minute, beyond five o\u2019clock, time was called on an extraordinary encounter. The final act, fittingly, was an outstanding goal line block from Duk to deny Alistair Johnston.</p> \n<p>Celtic huffed and puffed as they sought to snatch the odd goal in five and place daylight between themselves and Aberdeen at the summit of Scotland\u2019s Premiership. That there was no winner felt appropriate, given Aberdeen\u2019s contribution to this epic. Whether or not Jimmy Thelin\u2019s rejuvenation of Aberdeen will result in major honours remains to be seen. What feels pretty clear is that this, as game of the season, is unlikely to be beaten. This took place in front of Sir Alex Ferguson, who made a specialism out of bringing Aberdeen teams to Glasgow and inflicting bloody noses. The great man must have approved.</p> \n<p>Even Celtic\u2019s followers should not begrudge Aberdeen their point. The same support should be fearful of what will transpire in Bergamo on Wednesday, should Celtic be so defensively generous against Atalanta. Without Cameron Carter-Vickers, who missed this game through injury, the Celtic back line is shaky. The unwillingness of Brendan Rodgers to speculate on Carter-Vickers\u2019s situation with Atalanta in mind did not sound particularly hopeful. To his credit, Rodgers did not sugarcoat Celtic\u2019s capitulation from 2-0 ahead here. \u201cWe got punished for being careless,\u201d Rodgers said. The Celtic manager cut an irritated figure.</p> \n<p>Thelin made attacking substitutions at half-time and totally altered the flow of the match. If that was not worthy of enough praise, Aberdeen\u2019s refusal to wilt during 12 minutes of stoppage time was striking. Lesser teams would have folded. Thelin has a good thing going at Pittodrie. And still going it is, after the most stringent test of all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"217204fc-4b39-4edc-801b-a21b1a433c23\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Neil Critchley enjoyed a dream debut as <b>Hearts</b> manager as they recorded their first victory of the season with an emphatic 4-0 win over <b>St Mirren</b>. Kenneth Vargas broke the deadlock following a slick team move, with Daniel Oyegoke's unbelievable strike, academy graduate James Wilson's first professional goal and Blair Spittal's late effort securing a much-needed and thoroughly deserved win.</p>\n    <p><b>Dundee United</b> scored twice in stoppage time to secure an incredible 3-2 victory over <b>Hibernian</b> at Tannadice. The hosts took the lead through Sam Dalby but Warren O'Hora equalised before the break and substitute Dwight Gayle headed the visitors in front. Hibs had captain Joe Newell sent off late on and Luca Stephenson levelled three minutes into stoppage time before Meshack Ubochioma sensationally won it six minutes later.</p>\n    <p><b>Dundee</b> earned their first victory in six matches after edging out <b>Motherwell</b> in a scrappy encounter at Fir Park. Lyall Cameron powered home the only goal of the game in the 37th minute.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Benjamin Kimpioka's first-half double helped <b>St Johnstone</b> to their first home league win of 2024 as they defeated nine-man <b>Ross County</b> 3-0 at McDiarmid Park.

Nicky Clark had a goal ruled out by VAR before County substitute Charlie Telfer was given a straight red card on a miserable afternoon for the Staggies. Makenzie Kirk then added a third goal in stoppage time to wrap up the victory.&nbsp;<b>PA Media</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At the break, even the most optimistic of Aberdeen\u2019s followers could not have envisaged what was to come. Dimitar Mitov, the Aberdeen keeper, was indecisive as Arne Engels played a through pass to Kyogo Furuhashi. The Japan forward seized his time and opportunity, pulling the ball back for Reo Hatate. Hatate gave Mitov no chance from 12 yards. Kyogo helped himself to Celtic\u2019s second. Hatate\u2019s shot was blocked by the arms of Gavin Molloy, meaning a penalty was likely heading Celtic\u2019s way anyway. Furuhashi removed the need for a video assistant referee check by pouncing on the loose ball. Celtic Park celebrated in a manner which suggested Aberdeen\u2019s heady days were over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Thelin rightly spotted that the best way to defend against Celtic is to attack. Enter Ester Sokler and Duk, who offered mobility in forward areas. Sokler\u2019s maiden act was to latch onto Jamie McGrath\u2019s through ball and slot beyond Kasper Schmeichel. Celtic failed to heed the warning. A Daizen Maeda error allowed Graeme Shinnie to fire in a shot, which flew past Schmeichel with the aid of a deflection. Shock rippled through the stands.</p> \n<p>Aberdeen believed they had completed an astonishing comeback when Slobodan Rubezic\u2019s header from a McGrath free-kick found the net via Duk. The problem was, Duk had used an elbow to deflect the ball. The goal was correctly ruled out.</p> \n<p>The sight of 10 minutes on the fourth official\u2019s board would have caused palpitations among the vociferous visiting support. James Forrest forced Mitov into a smart stop as Celtic rallied. Auston Trusty missed a glorious chance from a Paolo Bernardo corner. Adam Idah had the ball in the Aberdeen net but Mitov had been fouled. Luke McCowan won a Celtic free-kick just inches from the penalty area. Mitov saved brilliantly from Idah before Celtic claimed a spot-kick for handball from that incredible Duk intervention.</p> \n<p>Thelin, who is calm by nature, smiled as he reflected on \u201ccrazy moments\u201d as the clock ticked on, and on, and on. \u201cThe players sacrificed themselves,\u201d added the Swede. \u201cThey tried with absolutely everything they had. I am proud of them.\u201d He should be equally proud of himself. Aberdeen in this form are made of proper stuff.</p> \n<p>Celtic have only a few days to rediscover their mettle.</p>",

The same support should be fearful of what will transpire in Bergamo on Wednesday, should Celtic be so defensively generous against Atalanta. Without Cameron Carter-Vickers, who missed this game through injury, the Celtic back line is shaky. The unwillingness of Brendan Rodgers to speculate on Carter-Vickers\u2019s situation with Atalanta in mind did not sound particularly hopeful. To his credit, Rodgers did not sugarcoat Celtic\u2019s capitulation from 2-0 ahead here. \u201cWe got punished for being careless,\u201d Rodgers said. The Celtic manager cut an irritated figure. Thelin made attacking substitutions at half-time and totally altered the flow of the match. If that was not worthy of enough praise, Aberdeen\u2019s refusal to wilt during 12 minutes of stoppage time was striking. Lesser teams would have folded. Thelin has a good thing going at Pittodrie. And still going it is, after the most stringent test of all. At the break, even the most optimistic of Aberdeen\u2019s followers could not have envisaged what was to come. Dimitar Mitov, the Aberdeen keeper, was indecisive as Arne Engels played a through pass to Kyogo Furuhashi. The Japan forward seized his time and opportunity, pulling the ball back for Reo Hatate. Hatate gave Mitov no chance from 12 yards. Kyogo helped himself to Celtic\u2019s second. Hatate\u2019s shot was blocked by the arms of Gavin Molloy, meaning a penalty was likely heading Celtic\u2019s way anyway. Furuhashi removed the need for a video assistant referee check by pouncing on the loose ball. Celtic Park celebrated in a manner which suggested Aberdeen\u2019s heady days were over. Thelin rightly spotted that the best way to defend against Celtic is to attack. Enter Ester Sokler and Duk, who offered mobility in forward areas. Sokler\u2019s maiden act was to latch onto Jamie McGrath\u2019s through ball and slot beyond Kasper Schmeichel. Celtic failed to heed the warning. A Daizen Maeda error allowed Graeme Shinnie to fire in a shot, which flew past Schmeichel with the aid of a deflection. Shock rippled through the stands. Aberdeen believed they had completed an astonishing comeback when Slobodan Rubezic\u2019s header from a McGrath free-kick found the net via Duk. The problem was, Duk had used an elbow to deflect the ball. The goal was correctly ruled out. The sight of 10 minutes on the fourth official\u2019s board would have caused palpitations among the vociferous visiting support. James Forrest forced Mitov into a smart stop as Celtic rallied. Auston Trusty missed a glorious chance from a Paolo Bernardo corner. Adam Idah had the ball in the Aberdeen net but Mitov had been fouled. Luke McCowan won a Celtic free-kick just inches from the penalty area. Mitov saved brilliantly from Idah before Celtic claimed a spot-kick for handball from that incredible Duk intervention. Thelin, who is calm by nature, smiled as he reflected on \u201ccrazy moments\u201d as the clock ticked on, and on, and on. \u201cThe players sacrificed themselves,\u201d added the Swede. \u201cThey tried with absolutely everything they had. I am proud of them.\u201d He should be equally proud of himself. Aberdeen in this form are made of proper stuff. Celtic have only a few days to rediscover their mettle.",

He could not resist making a play for the scrum-half over the top of a ruck.

Batley nicked the ball off the ground deep in his own 22, Randall set Harding away, he linked with Alan MacGinty, who dummied one way, then turned the other to send Fricker to the line. Breathtaking and Bristol were 32-17 up. In a previous era that would have been it for any self-respecting rugby match in the English autumn. But we all knew Saracens would come back. Up stepped Elliot Daly. Two tries from him, the second featuring a break by a sixth brilliant winger, young Brandon Jackson, and a penalty from Lozowski brought Saracens within a point with eight minutes to play. Then, with a relentless certainty, they resisted intense pressure from a Bristol side desperate to put them away, before building one last attack themselves. Bristol seemed to be holding firm just outside their 22, Goode lurking an unlikely distance away for the attempted drop goal, only for Ibitoye, of all people, to infringe. He could not resist making a play for the scrum-half over the top of a ruck. And so Lozowski had his shot. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a long time,\u201d said Mark McCall. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a win like that one.\u201d Well, you say that but there will probably be a better one next week.",

      "body": "<p>Like many people, I read a lot during the Covid-19 lockdown, and one of the books I enjoyed most in those strange, silent months was a memoir by the novelist Mich\u00e8le Roberts called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/18/negative-capability-by-michele-roberts-review-the-novelists-wisdom-casts-a-spell\">Negative Capability</a></em>: an account of being alone, but not lonely. In the face of what people on social media like to call (ugh) self-care, Roberts wrote of her efforts to be good to herself after a painful rejection without recourse either to self-pity or to yoga. Four years on, I still sometimes pull it from the shelf when I\u2019m feeling embattled. Radiant and meditative, a few pages are all I need to get going again; to remind myself to pay attention to everything, and by doing so both to recognise and to give thanks for what great good fortune I have.</p> <p>I was, then, pleased but not wholly surprised to learn that Roberts is shortly to publish a cookbook: a charming little paperback that smells lightly of roasted endives and anchovy butter (obviously I\u2019m speaking metaphorically; my early copy carries the scent of fresh paper, though I predict this will change quite soon). To make a proper supper for yourself is, after all, a kind and tender thing to do if you\u2019re under pressure \u2013 and her book contains only recipes for one person. For the absence of doubt, however, I must stress it isn\u2019t the kind of manual that has you making lasagne, to be frozen in individual portions. The dishes included are at once more simple and more luxurious than that. Mussel salad with ravigote sauce. Rabbit with mustard. Steak with bordelaise sauce. So many micro feasts, and every one of them nourishment for body and soul.</p> <p>Its title is <em>French Cooking for One</em>, and it is a gentle riff on Edouard de Pomiane\u2019s classic of 1930, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/10/50-best-cookbooks-edouard-pomiane\">French Cooking in Ten Minutes</a></em>. De Pomiane\u2019s book was subtitled \u201cAdapting to the rhythm of modern life\u201d, and it is from this that Roberts takes her steer. Cooking for one person is all about rhythm, and not only because, as she notes, it requires \u201cstreamlined, no-fuss, foolproof techniques\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Roberts is half-French, and her text is edged like an old tablecloth with the spirit of her maternal grandparents\u2019 kitchen </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t live alone these days, and as a result cook only for myself less often than I used to (though I\u2019m now rather longing for T to go out for the night, the better that I might make Roberts\u2019s diminutive but luxurious cheese souffl\u00e9, perhaps with a lily-gilding bowl of Normandy-style green beans on the side). But when I did, ritual and punctuation were all. If it was too easy to slump in front of the telly with a slice of toast, it was difficult-verging-on-impossible to conjure a meal that would be delicious, achievable and a means of pressing pause on the stresses of the day.</p> <p>Roberts is half-French, and her text is edged like an old tablecloth with the spirit of her maternal grandparents\u2019 kitchen as well as her own domestic expertise. Most of the recipes, short and uncomplicated, aim to deliver the perfect effort-to-taste ratio; if she has an Elizabeth David-like briskness on the page, she\u2019s also a sensualist, a part-time sybarite. But even if you\u2019re not in the mood for cooking, simply to read them is to encourage rumination. She is such a noticing writer, and in her hands you find yourself doing the same, a dowdy cauliflower suddenly beautiful, a slab of marbled meat a world unto itself.</p> <p>It is odd how relatively rarely food writers dare to embark on the territory of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/18/perils-of-a-table-for-one-rachel-cooke-dining-alone\">solitary cooking and eating</a>, even in 2024. Aren\u2019t we told again and again that ever increasing numbers of people now find themselves living alone? The last book I owned on the subject was Delia Smith\u2019s <em>One </em><em>is Fun</em>, which came out in 1985 (though I\u2019m sure there have been others since). The thought, I suppose, is that those who are unencumbered by other human beings can please themselves. What would they want with a recipe? But freedom cuts both ways. It doesn\u2019t have to mean culinary impoverishment. The woman who is at liberty to eat a quick tin of sweet corn without even bothering to sit down as she does so also has the latitude, if she so chooses, to spend a little time rustling up a couple of fat stuffed tomatoes, a delicate plate of trout with almonds, a comforting bowl of melting pork with prunes. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Like many people, I read a lot during the Covid-19 lockdown, and one of the books I enjoyed most in those strange, silent months was a memoir by the novelist Mich\u00e8le Roberts called Negative Capability: an account of being alone, but not lonely. In the face of what people on social media like to call (ugh) self-care, Roberts wrote of her efforts to be good to herself after a painful rejection without recourse either to self-pity or to yoga. Four years on, I still sometimes pull it from the shelf when I\u2019m feeling embattled. Radiant and meditative, a few pages are all I need to get going again; to remind myself to pay attention to everything, and by doing so both to recognise and to give thanks for what great good fortune I have. I was, then, pleased but not wholly surprised to learn that Roberts is shortly to publish a cookbook: a charming little paperback that smells lightly of roasted endives and anchovy butter (obviously I\u2019m speaking metaphorically; my early copy carries the scent of fresh paper, though I predict this will change quite soon). To make a proper supper for yourself is, after all, a kind and tender thing to do if you\u2019re under pressure \u2013 and her book contains only recipes for one person. For the absence of doubt, however, I must stress it isn\u2019t the kind of manual that has you making lasagne, to be frozen in individual portions. The dishes included are at once more simple and more luxurious than that. Mussel salad with ravigote sauce. Rabbit with mustard. Steak with bordelaise sauce. So many micro feasts, and every one of them nourishment for body and soul. Its title is French Cooking for One, and it is a gentle riff on Edouard de Pomiane\u2019s classic of 1930, French Cooking in Ten Minutes. De Pomiane\u2019s book was subtitled \u201cAdapting to the rhythm of modern life\u201d, and it is from this that Roberts takes her steer. Cooking for one person is all about rhythm, and not only because, as she notes, it requires \u201cstreamlined, no-fuss, foolproof techniques\u201d. I don\u2019t live alone these days, and as a result cook only for myself less often than I used to (though I\u2019m now rather longing for T to go out for the night, the better that I might make Roberts\u2019s diminutive but luxurious cheese souffl\u00e9, perhaps with a lily-gilding bowl of Normandy-style green beans on the side). But when I did, ritual and punctuation were all. If it was too easy to slump in front of the telly with a slice of toast, it was difficult-verging-on-impossible to conjure a meal that would be delicious, achievable and a means of pressing pause on the stresses of the day. Roberts is half-French, and her text is edged like an old tablecloth with the spirit of her maternal grandparents\u2019 kitchen as well as her own domestic expertise. Most of the recipes, short and uncomplicated, aim to deliver the perfect effort-to-taste ratio; if she has an Elizabeth David-like briskness on the page, she\u2019s also a sensualist, a part-time sybarite. But even if you\u2019re not in the mood for cooking, simply to read them is to encourage rumination. She is such a noticing writer, and in her hands you find yourself doing the same, a dowdy cauliflower suddenly beautiful, a slab of marbled meat a world unto itself. It is odd how relatively rarely food writers dare to embark on the territory of solitary cooking and eating, even in 2024. Aren\u2019t we told again and again that ever increasing numbers of people now find themselves living alone? The last book I owned on the subject was Delia Smith\u2019s One is Fun, which came out in 1985 (though I\u2019m sure there have been others since). The thought, I suppose, is that those who are unencumbered by other human beings can please themselves. What would they want with a recipe? But freedom cuts both ways. It doesn\u2019t have to mean culinary impoverishment. The woman who is at liberty to eat a quick tin of sweet corn without even bothering to sit down as she does so also has the latitude, if she so chooses, to spend a little time rustling up a couple of fat stuffed tomatoes, a delicate plate of trout with almonds, a comforting bowl of melting pork with prunes.",

A small army of runners are in with a chance, including <strong>Thunder Run </strong>\u2013 with Ryan Moore booked to ride \u2013 and the well-backed <strong>Bopedro, </strong>whose owner, Georginio Rutter, is likely to be in action for Brighton against Newcastle at St James\u2019 Park while the race is underway. My eye was drawn to the 20-1 shot <strong>Elnajmm, </strong>the mount of Tom Marquand, when I was working through the card yesterday, as things have not really panned out for William Haggas\u2019s runner in two starts since his course-and-distance win in July, but an each-way bet with a bookie offering extra places is the safest way to go.</p> <p><strong>SELECTION: ELNAJMM</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6713ca678f08d025c3e95d6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T15:17:34.229Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Anmaat, who could have been backed at 1,000-1 in running after he got into all sorts of trouble in running in the home straight, pulled off a huge shock to win the Champion Stakes at Ascot.</p> <p>The winner stunned the field to sweep to a surprise victory. A 40-1 chance for trainer Owen Burrows and jockey Jim Crowley, the bay was overlooked in the build-up to the contest as it was presumed to be a clash between Economics and Calandagan.</p> <p>The latter horse was making progress on the inside up the straight, but picking his way through the field behind him was Anmaat. Crowley was forced to wait for a gap to launch his challenge, but when the space came, Anmaat showed a fine turn of pace to seize the opportunity.</p> <p>He then swept past 6-4 favourite Calandagan in the dying strides to win by half a length, with 25-1 shot Royal Rhyme back in third.</p> <p>Crowley told ITV Racing: \u201cI had nowhere to go - I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to win when I was all tucked up with nowhere to go and I can\u2019t say it on air what I felt.\u201d</p> <p>Burrows himself said: \u201cLast year after he won his Group One in race I fancied him to go on and win more races but he had a complex foor injury. Last time it just went wrong in France in a muddling old race.</p> <p>\u201cI had to persuade the owner to come and let him run today \u2013 how he\u2019s done it has surprised me as I put my binoculars down when he got into trouble in the closing stages. He\u2019s got some heart to come back from that injury.\u201d</p> <p>The race was far from ideal for favourite Calandagan, who was a close second after losing ground at the start when coming out of the stalls slowly and did not enjoy the clearest of passages in the home straight as well.</p> <p>The well-fancied Economics finished unplaced with trainer William Haggas reporting: \u201cHe was a bit disappointing and his rider said the ground was a bit soft. There was a little blood in his nose so we\u2019ll sort that out.\u201d</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T15:33:45.970Z\">at 4.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6713c9408f08156d157764d6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T14:59:50.479Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Champion Stakes (3.55pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/997871\">Anmaat </a></strong>40/1<br>2 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1112839\">Calandagan</a> </strong>6/4 fav<br>3 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1053335\">Royal Rhyme </a></strong>25/1</p>  <!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field --> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T15:03:53.628Z\">at 4.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6713c84c8f08d025c3e95d39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T14:55:19.725Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Champion Stakes (3.55pm) <br><br></strong>And they\u2019re off \u2026 Caladangan is slowly away and Economics is a bit free \u2026 Continuous leads with Los Angeles close \u2026 King\u2019s Gambit is close as they turn for home \u2026 Economics comes late and Calandagan is trying to get there but Anmaat, a big 40-1 outsider, wins a very messy race.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T14:58:14.271Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6713c65f8f08156d157764b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T14:47:44.056Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Novus is a non-runner in the Champion Stakes (3.55pm) after reportedly getting worked up in the pre-parade ring.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6713c5d18f08d025c3e95d15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T14:45:01.987Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Is the next contest, the big one of the afternoon, a two-horse race?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ascot/status/1847648491104764071\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Calandagan is ready.

Mares Stakes (2.35pm) preview</strong></p> <p>Aidan O\u2019Brien, who is within sight of a new record for prize money won in a British season, started the day without a winner on this card since Magical landed the Champion Stakes in 2019, and his overall record in the Group Ones on Champions Day since the meeting\u2019s inception in 2011 is five wins from 64 starters, a strike-rate of just under 8pc. That feels distinctly sub-par for such an outstanding trainer, and the fact that many of his fancied runners are attempting to back up quickly after a big run at the Arc meeting in Paris is one possible explanation to bear in mind here, as both <strong>Content </strong>and <strong>Grateful </strong>were in action just two weeks ago. <strong>Grateful </strong>won <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lBd6ZNQ_otc?si=PGkxmN2tPpbvcnKA\">the Group One Prix de Royallieu</a>, while Content was a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/neDVlhxkcYU?si=XMBv1aSRkp9hEqAA\">no-show in the Prix de l\u2019Opera</a>, but she is the mount of Ryan Moore today and preferred in the market too. The likely favourite, meanwhile, is the progressive <strong>Kalpana,</strong> who started the season running off 78 in a Newmarket handicap \u2013 a 10-length victory there makes her one of the hindsight bets of the season \u2013 and she has a fine chance on the form of her win in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RQqAi1IYXBo?si=xpNFXI1-2vB4KeOM\">the Group Three September Stakes</a> on the all-weather at Kempton. Soft ground is an unknown for her, however, which is not the case for Andreas Suborics\u2019s contender, <strong>Quantanamera,</strong>and she has a live chance on her winning form in a Group Two at Deauville in August.</p> <p><strong>SELECTION: QUANTANAMERA</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6713acfc8f08156d157763d5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T13:00:37.427Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>1 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1141274\">Kind Of Blue</a> </strong>10/1<br>2 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1059601\">Swingalong </a></strong>17/2<br>3 <strong><a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/1102338\">Flora Of Bermuda </a></strong>25/1</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1847623697605283999\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kind Of Blue lands the Group 1 QIPCO British Champions Sprint Stakes at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ascot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Ascot</a> for James Fanshawe and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/the_doyler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@the_doyler</a>... <a href=\"https://t.co/jh1KU6AkFz\">pic.twitter.com/jh1KU6AkFz</a></p>&mdash; At The Races (@AtTheRaces) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1847623697605283999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T13:02:07.861Z\">at 2.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6713ab378f08d025c3e95c0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T12:57:27.994Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm)<br><br></strong>This will be fast and furious \u2026 and they\u2019re off \u2026 Art Power and Swingalong out fast but Audience leads \u2026 Kind Of Blue is up there and Montassib is at the back \u2026 Swingalong kicks for home but Kind Of Blue just holds on!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T12:58:28.080Z\">at 1.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6713a8258f08d025c3e95bf3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T12:39:10.661Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm) betting</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Kinross 11/2</p></li> <li><p>Montassib 13/2</p></li> <li><p>Kind Of Blue 8/1</p></li> <li><p>Beauvatier 9/1</p></li> <li><p>Audience 10/1</p></li> <li><p>Swingalong 10/1</p></li> <li><p>Elite Status 11/1</p></li> <li><p>Mill Stream 14/1</p></li> <li><p>Flora Of Bermuda 16/1</p></li> <li><p>Unequal Love 16/1</p></li> <li><p>22/1 Bar \u2013 20 Runners</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.oddschecker.com/horse-racing/ascot/13:55/winner\">Full betting via Oddschecker here</a></p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6713a68a8f08156d157763a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-19T12:32:10.126Z\">1.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm) preview</strong></p> <p>A maximum field for the first Group One of the afternoon, a race which was won by a 40-1 chance (Art Power) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DHVlKxgo9_A?si=6iMBb9IVTdHs-lOS\">racing from stall one 12 months ago</a>, on similar ground.

A wet start to the day was the last thing anyone wanted, as it may well put at least a slight dent in the \u201cwalk-up\u201d ticket sales, but anyone within easy reach of the track who is at a loose end should be aware that there are even occasional patches of blue sky appearing over Berkshire at present.</p>    <p>As was the case last year, the action in the three events on the round course will unfold on the tight inner track due to concerns over the going. It\u2019s not a great look for a day designed to celebrate the summer code that it has ended up on Ascot\u2019s hurdles track for three of the last six years, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone too much 12 months ago and the field sizes are unusually strong, so hopefully not many spectators will notice that the runners are a little further away than ideal.</p> <p>The Champion Stakes, with \u00a31.3m in the pot, is the feature at 3.55, and the overnight rain seems to be behind a distinct move in favour of Francis-Henri Graffard\u2019s <strong>Calandagan, </strong>who has form on soft ground and also stays 12 furlongs, in the betting this morning. The King Edward VII Stakes winner is now top-priced at around 13-8, with his fellow three-year-old, <strong>Economics, </strong>the Irish Champion Stakes winner, as big as 9-4.</p> <p><strong>Charyn, </strong>another winner at the Royal meeting in June, also heads the market at around 13-8 in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on the straight mile at 3.15, while the emerging talent <strong>Kalpana </strong>is the likely favourite for the Fillies\u2019 &amp; Mares\u2019 and it is anyone\u2019s guess which of the runners will set off as the punters\u2019 pick for the 16-strong Sprint.</p> <p>You can follow all the action as it happens here on our live blog from the first race to the last (the only handicap on the card, at 4.35) and we are underway on the track at 1.20, when the dual Gold Cup winner, <strong>Kyprios</strong>, will attempt to get favourite-backers off and running at odds-on in the Long Distance Cup.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for Champions Day for another year. I think we did anoint a couple of genuine champions at Ascot today with Kyprios winning the Long Distance Cup and Charyn winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes but there was a spectre at the feast and that was City Of Troy who would surely have won the Champion Stakes if he had lined up given how he dealt with the runner-up Calandagan at York in the summer. City Of Troy, trained by champion trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien, is instead heading to Del Mar in the United States for the Breeders\u2019 Cup on the first weekend in November. Will he prove himself a great there? Timeform, the racing ratings experts, discussed the matter this week and concluded: \u201cA Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic for O\u2019Brien would be both special and something we haven\u2019t seen before. It would certainly give extra substance to the \u2018City Of Troy is O\u2019Brien\u2019s best\u2019 argument, as well. For some racing fans and the likes of Timeform to agree, though, a career-defining wow performance will be needed.\u201d That\u2019s some race to look forward to and Greg Wood will be live blogging on the big night. Good night and good luck until then. Balmoral Handicap (4.35pm) result 1 Carrytheone 14/1 2 Lattam 18/1 3 Witch Hunter 25/1 4 Thunder Run 7/2 fav Balmoral Handicap (4.35pm) And they\u2019re off \u2026 Mirsky and Thunder Run (with four others on the stands side) are the early leaders \u2026 Holloway Boy now has the lead and the runners have all grouped as one now \u2026 Carrytheone is coming with a withering run and will go on to win! Balmoral Handicap (4.35pm) betting Thunder Run 5/1 State Actor 8/1 Bopedro 8/1 Daysofourlives 9/1 Mr Professor 11/1 Toimy Son 12/1 Carrytheone 12/1 Mexicali Rose 14/1 Mirsky 16/1 Elnajmm 18/1 20/1 BAR \u2013 22 Runners Full betting via Oddschecker here Balmoral Handicap (4.35pm) preview The only handicap on the card and a race that has been won by runners starting at 25-1 and 80-1 in the last two seasons, so a getting-out race to treat with caution. A small army of runners are in with a chance, including Thunder Run \u2013 with Ryan Moore booked to ride \u2013 and the well-backed Bopedro, whose owner, Georginio Rutter, is likely to be in action for Brighton against Newcastle at St James\u2019 Park while the race is underway. My eye was drawn to the 20-1 shot Elnajmm, the mount of Tom Marquand, when I was working through the card yesterday, as things have not really panned out for William Haggas\u2019s runner in two starts since his course-and-distance win in July, but an each-way bet with a bookie offering extra places is the safest way to go. SELECTION: ELNAJMM Anmaat, who could have been backed at 1,000-1 in running after he got into all sorts of trouble in running in the home straight, pulled off a huge shock to win the Champion Stakes at Ascot. The winner stunned the field to sweep to a surprise victory. A 40-1 chance for trainer Owen Burrows and jockey Jim Crowley, the bay was overlooked in the build-up to the contest as it was presumed to be a clash between Economics and Calandagan. The latter horse was making progress on the inside up the straight, but picking his way through the field behind him was Anmaat. Crowley was forced to wait for a gap to launch his challenge, but when the space came, Anmaat showed a fine turn of pace to seize the opportunity. He then swept past 6-4 favourite Calandagan in the dying strides to win by half a length, with 25-1 shot Royal Rhyme back in third. Crowley told ITV Racing: \u201cI had nowhere to go - I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to win when I was all tucked up with nowhere to go and I can\u2019t say it on air what I felt.\u201d Burrows himself said: \u201cLast year after he won his Group One in race I fancied him to go on and win more races but he had a complex foor injury. Last time it just went wrong in France in a muddling old race. \u201cI had to persuade the owner to come and let him run today \u2013 how he\u2019s done it has surprised me as I put my binoculars down when he got into trouble in the closing stages. He\u2019s got some heart to come back from that injury.\u201d The race was far from ideal for favourite Calandagan, who was a close second after losing ground at the start when coming out of the stalls slowly and did not enjoy the clearest of passages in the home straight as well. The well-fancied Economics finished unplaced with trainer William Haggas reporting: \u201cHe was a bit disappointing and his rider said the ground was a bit soft. There was a little blood in his nose so we\u2019ll sort that out.\u201d 1 Anmaat 40/1 2 Calandagan 6/4 fav 3 Royal Rhyme 25/1 Champion Stakes (3.55pm) And they\u2019re off \u2026 Caladangan is slowly away and Economics is a bit free \u2026 Continuous leads with Los Angeles close \u2026 King\u2019s Gambit is close as they turn for home \u2026 Economics comes late and Calandagan is trying to get there but Anmaat, a big 40-1 outsider, wins a very messy race. Novus is a non-runner in the Champion Stakes (3.55pm) after reportedly getting worked up in the pre-parade ring. Is the next contest, the big one of the afternoon, a two-horse race? Champion Stakes (3.55pm) betting Calandagan 7/4 Economics 2/1 Los Angeles 13/2 Kings Gambit 16/1 Iresine 18/1 Royal Rhyme 25/1 Anmaat 33/1 Continuous 33/1 Nashwa 40/1 See The Fire 50/1 Persica 50/1 Full betting here via Oddschecker Champion Stakes (3.55pm) preview The day\u2019s feature event and the market is headed by two three-year-olds in Calandagan and Economics that would have been worthy contenders for the Derby and the Arc had circumstances \u2013 including a gelding operation, in the case of Calandagan \u2013 not conspired against them. Economics was steered around Epsom by William Haggas after his convincing success in the Dante Stakes at York in May as the trainer did not feel his colt was ready for the race at that stage of his career, and his patience has been repaid with two subsequent wins, in a Group Two at Deauville and then the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September. Calandagan, meanwhile, ran away with the King Edward VII Stakes \u2013 the \u201cAscot Derby\u201d \u2013 over a mile-and-a-half here in June and then ran the outstanding City Of Troy to a length in the International Stakes at York. Los Angeles is also worthy of consideration after finishing just over a length behind Economics in Ireland, although that klaxon for Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained runners coming here from Longchamp is sounding again as he was third in the Arc just 13 days ago. There has been each-way money for a few of the outsiders this morning, including Hollie Doyle\u2019s mount, Nashwa, but for many punters, this will come down to a straight assessment of the relative merits of the Irish Champion form versus the International. SELECTION: CALANDAGAN 1 Charyn 13/8 fav 2 Facteur Cheval 11/2 3 Tamfana 7/2 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (3.15pm) And they\u2019re off \u2026 Henry Longfellow, as expected, takes the lead and Prague races solo on the stands side \u2026 Ice Max is prominent \u2026 Charyn comes there very strongly but Facteur Cheval challenges \u2026 it\u2019s neck and neck but Charyn battles on for a tough win. Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (3.15pm) betting Charyn 7/4 Tamfana 4/1 Facteur Cheval 6/1 Henry Longfellow 7/1 Prague 11/1 Quddwah 16/1 Metropolitan 18/1 Checkandchallenge 50/1 Poker Face 50/1 Dancing Gemini 50/1 Ice Max 80/1 Lord Massusus 80/1 Full betting via Oddschecker here Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (3.15pm) preview A fascinating renewal of Ascot\u2019s autumn championship event for milers, and a race in which several of the leading contenders are facing each other for the first time. The key races to consider include Tamfana\u2019s win in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket two weeks ago, Charyn\u2019s course-and-distance win in the Queen Anne at the Royal meeting and Henry Longfellow\u2019s close second in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes on the round course the same afternoon. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s runner has struggled to reach the same lever in two outings since, however, and Dylan Cunha\u2019s Prague has also needs to be factored into calculations after his win in the Joel Stakes last month. SELECTION: CHARYN 1 Kalpana 10/3 fav 2 Wingspan 12/1 3 Tiffany 13/2 Champion Filles &amp; Mares Stakes (2.35pm) And they\u2019re off \u2026 War Chimes is slowly away \u2026 Village Voice kicks early but it\u2019s Wingspan who will dictate from the front in the early stages \u2026 Content is last at the midway stage \u2026 Tiffany is just behind the leader as they turn for home \u2026 a slow pace again in this race \u2026 Kalpana kicks for home and is going to be hard to catch \u2026 and kicks well clear for a smooth win. Seems Ms Vorderman has worked out the form correctly. Going now changed to Soft, Heavy in places! Champion Filles &amp; Mares Stakes (2.35pm) betting Kalpana 4/1 Content 6/1 Quantanamera 7/1 Tiffany 8/1 Sumiha 11/1 Doha 12/1 Queen Of The Pride 14/1 Wingspan 14/1 Grateful 16/1 Village Voice 18/1 22/1 BAR \u2013 14 Runners Full betting here via Oddschecker Champion Filles &amp; Mares Stakes (2.35pm) preview Aidan O\u2019Brien, who is within sight of a new record for prize money won in a British season, started the day without a winner on this card since Magical landed the Champion Stakes in 2019, and his overall record in the Group Ones on Champions Day since the meeting\u2019s inception in 2011 is five wins from 64 starters, a strike-rate of just under 8pc. That feels distinctly sub-par for such an outstanding trainer, and the fact that many of his fancied runners are attempting to back up quickly after a big run at the Arc meeting in Paris is one possible explanation to bear in mind here, as both Content and Grateful were in action just two weeks ago. Grateful won the Group One Prix de Royallieu, while Content was a no-show in the Prix de l\u2019Opera, but she is the mount of Ryan Moore today and preferred in the market too. The likely favourite, meanwhile, is the progressive Kalpana, who started the season running off 78 in a Newmarket handicap \u2013 a 10-length victory there makes her one of the hindsight bets of the season \u2013 and she has a fine chance on the form of her win in the Group Three September Stakes on the all-weather at Kempton. Soft ground is an unknown for her, however, which is not the case for Andreas Suborics\u2019s contender, Quantanamera,and she has a live chance on her winning form in a Group Two at Deauville in August. SELECTION: QUANTANAMERA 1 Kind Of Blue 10/1 2 Swingalong 17/2 3 Flora Of Bermuda 25/1 Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm) This will be fast and furious \u2026 and they\u2019re off \u2026 Art Power and Swingalong out fast but Audience leads \u2026 Kind Of Blue is up there and Montassib is at the back \u2026 Swingalong kicks for home but Kind Of Blue just holds on! Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm) betting Kinross 11/2 Montassib 13/2 Kind Of Blue 8/1 Beauvatier 9/1 Audience 10/1 Swingalong 10/1 Elite Status 11/1 Mill Stream 14/1 Flora Of Bermuda 16/1 Unequal Love 16/1 22/1 Bar \u2013 20 Runners Full betting via Oddschecker here Champion Sprint Stakes (1.55pm) preview A maximum field for the first Group One of the afternoon, a race which was won by a 40-1 chance (Art Power) racing from stall one 12 months ago, on similar ground. That was the second success for a big outsider in the last five runnings, and an odd race all round, as Art Power raced alone for much of the way. He is back for another crack today, and at a big price again too, but is unlikely to get the run of the race from stall 12. The key piece of recent formis probably the Sprint Cup at Haydock won by Montassib in September, when the 16-strong field included no fewer than 13 of today\u2019s runners, including leading fancies Kinross, Elite Status, Audience, Kind Of Blue and my pick, Swingalong. Karl Burke\u2019s filly was an excellent fourth in this race last year, goes on any ground and has fared much better in the draw than she did at Haydock. SELECTION: SWINGALONG 1 Kyprios 8/11 fav 2 Sweet William 8/1 3 Trawlerman 5/1 Long Distance Cup (1.20pm) And they\u2019re off \u2026 Sweet William needs to be pushed along already! The Euphrates and Kyprios, the stable companions, are in the lead and dictating the pace \u2026 Burdett Road is pulling far too hard \u2026 the pace is just a steady one, dictated by the Aidan O\u2019Brien pair up front \u2026 now the pace quickens \u2026 Sweet William makes a challenge \u2026 Kyprios and Sweet William fight it out but Kyprios has won a race that his stable controlled! And remarkably that\u2019s the first win at this meeting for the all-conquering O\u2019Brien team since 2019. The favourite Kyprios looks well as he limbers up for the first race. Carol Vorderman has arrived for those who need help with the odds! Long Distance Cup (1.20pm) betting Kyprios 4/5 Al Nayyir 5/1 Trawlerman 11/2 Sweet William 10/1 The Euphrates 25/1 Belloccio 33/1 Burdett Road 33/1 Alsakib 66/1 Caius Chorister 80/1 Full betting here at Oddschecker Long Distance Cup (1.20pm) preview The first and, in all likelihood, the only odds-on shot on the card as Kyprios, one of the outstanding stayers of recent decades, attempts to go one better than in 2022 and complete a seven-race season unbeaten. To this point, his schedule has been identical to the race \u2013 including Group One wins in the Gold Cup here at Ascot, the Goodwood Cup, the Irish St Leger and the Cadran at Longchamp on Arc weekend. Kyprios did not line up for this race two years ago, but he was favourite last year after an injury-affected campaign, only to come up a neck short behind Trawlerman. The fact that Kyprios has six races to his name already this season, including a soft-ground victory at the Arc meeting in Paris just two weeks ago, alongside his trainer\u2019s poor record on this card with horses backing up quickly after Longchamp, makes him a dodgy favourite to my mind, and while Al Nayyir appears rejuvenated after a switch to the Tom Clover stable, I\u2019ll go with the fresh Trawlerman to repeat last year\u2019s win. SELECTION: TRAWLERMAN At the end of a long season and often run on testing ground this is not normally a meeting for backing short-priced favourites but punters are getting stuck in. Oddschecker inform me that these are the three best-backed horses so far: Kyprios 4/5 (1.20pm) Charyn 7/4 (3.15pm) Calandagan 6/4 (3.35pm) The treble, they tell me, pays 11-1. It\u2019s not the end of the Flat turf season yet but the champions will be crowned today, including the top jockey Oisin Murphy. One of the hot favourites on the day has arrived It\u2019s squidgy ground (that\u2019s officially soft!) and will be tough going but at least the rain has stopped falling now. Good afternoon. These are the races to look forward to on a cracking card at Ascot. 1.20pm: QIPCO British Champions Long Distance Cup, Group 2 1.55pm: QIPCO British Champions Sprint Stakes, Group 1 2.35pm: QIPCO British Champions Fillies &amp; Mares Stakes, Group 1 3.15pm: Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (sponsored by QIPCO), Group 1 3.55pm: QIPCO Champion Stakes, Group 1 4.35pm: Balmoral Handicap (sponsored by QIPCO) Good afternoon from Ascot, where the rain that has been falling fairly persistently for much of the last 12 hours is \u2013 hopefully \u2013 starting to ease ahead of Britain\u2019s most valuable afternoon at the races: Qipco Champions Day, with \u00a34.1m and four Group One races up for grabs. The track updated its expectations to a 29,000 crowd on Friday evening, not far short of the attendance to see Frankie Dettori draw the curtain on his British career 12 months ago. A wet start to the day was the last thing anyone wanted, as it may well put at least a slight dent in the \u201cwalk-up\u201d ticket sales, but anyone within easy reach of the track who is at a loose end should be aware that there are even occasional patches of blue sky appearing over Berkshire at present. As was the case last year, the action in the three events on the round course will unfold on the tight inner track due to concerns over the going. It\u2019s not a great look for a day designed to celebrate the summer code that it has ended up on Ascot\u2019s hurdles track for three of the last six years, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother anyone too much 12 months ago and the field sizes are unusually strong, so hopefully not many spectators will notice that the runners are a little further away than ideal. The Champion Stakes, with \u00a31.3m in the pot, is the feature at 3.55, and the overnight rain seems to be behind a distinct move in favour of Francis-Henri Graffard\u2019s Calandagan, who has form on soft ground and also stays 12 furlongs, in the betting this morning. The King Edward VII Stakes winner is now top-priced at around 13-8, with his fellow three-year-old, Economics, the Irish Champion Stakes winner, as big as 9-4. Charyn, another winner at the Royal meeting in June, also heads the market at around 13-8 in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on the straight mile at 3.15, while the emerging talent Kalpana is the likely favourite for the Fillies\u2019 &amp; Mares\u2019 and it is anyone\u2019s guess which of the runners will set off as the punters\u2019 pick for the 16-strong Sprint. You can follow all the action as it happens here on our live blog from the first race to the last (the only handicap on the card, at 4.35) and we are underway on the track at 1.20, when the dual Gold Cup winner, Kyprios, will attempt to get favourite-backers off and running at odds-on in the Long Distance Cup.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign may be failing to reach thousands of voters they hope to turn out in Arizona and Nevada, with roughly a quarter of door-knocks done by America Pac flagged by its canvassing app as potentially fraudulent, according to leaked data and people familiar with the matter. The potentially fake door-knocks \u2013 when canvassers falsely claim to have visited a home \u2013 could present a serious setback for Trump as he and Kamala Harris remain even in the polls with fewer than 20 days until an election. The Trump campaign earlier this year outsourced the bulk of its ground game to America Pac, the political action committee founded by Elon Musk, betting that spending millions to turn out Trump supporters, especially those who don\u2019t typically vote, would boost returns. But leaked America Pac data obtained by the Guardian shows that roughly 24% of the door-knocks in Arizona and 25% of the door-knocks in Nevada this week were flagged under its internal \u201cunusual survey logs\u201d, a metric used to determine faked doors. The Arizona data, for example, shows that out of 35,692 doors hit by 442 canvassers working for Blitz Canvassing in the America Pac operation on Wednesday, 8,511 doors were flagged under the unusual survey logs. The extent of the flagged doors in America Pac\u2019s operation underscores the risk of outsourcing a ground-game program, where paid canvassers are typically not as invested in their candidate\u2019s victory compared with volunteers or campaign staff. America Pac denied it was experiencing that level of actual fraud in Arizona and Nevada and declined to comment on reporting for this story. \u201cSidekick was never expected to handle the auditing of America Pac\u2019s door operation. The reason the Pac is confident in its numbers is because of the auditing procedures each canvassing firm puts in place and the auditing procedures of the Pac writ large,\u201d a person familiar with the America Pac operation said. The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But multiple people familiar with the Campaign Sidekick app, including a recent auditor for Blitz Canvassing and a senior executive at another vendor who signed a non-disclosure agreement with America Pac, agreed the unusual activity logs were an effective tool to detect cheaters. The unusual activity logs, for instance, showed a canvasser who was marked by GPS as sitting at a Guayo\u2019s On the Trail restaurant half a mile away from the doors he was supposedly hitting in Globe, Arizona. Another canvasser was recorded marking voters as \u201cnot home\u201d two blocks away from that apartment. The Guardian also conducted its own test to see whether manually removing instances of \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2013 doors wrongly marked as fraudulent \u2013 would show the unusual activity logs were too sensitive. Using a randomly picked sample of 26 canvassers in Arizona, the rate of suspected fakes was in line with the overall rate. Suspicious doors The Trump campaign took a gamble this cycle when it outsourced the bulk of its ground game to political action committees, after the Federal Election Commission earlier this year for the first time allowed campaigns to coordinate its voter turnout efforts with outside groups. The campaign initially envisaged multiple pacs helping to drive the Trump vote, but America Pac ultimately became the largest and most ambitious of the outside groups as it poured more than $29.8m into its field operation for Trump and became the only Pac with a material presence in every battleground state. The largest of the other Pacs involved with doing field work, such as Turning Point Action and America First Works, have a smaller footprint. Turning Point\u2019s team in Wisconsin has also since been subsumed into America Pac\u2019s operation, two people familiar with the matter said. As a result of its heavy investment, America Pac has been able to post impressive numbers of door-knocks in only a matter of months through its network of several vendors and dozens of subcontractors under those vendors in each of the battleground states. But in the final stretch toward the election, as the total door-knocks have increased, so too have suspected fakes, according to the leaked data. On 15 October, 20.1% of doors in Arizona were flagged under the unusual activity logs. On 16 October, it rose to 23.8% and on 17 October, it hit 26.9%. The uptick was also reflected in Nevada. On 15 October, 21.2% were flagged by the unusual survey log, a figure that rose on 16 October to 23.8% and then jumped dramatically on 17 October to 30.1%. Under normal circumstances, a canvasser walks up to the door of a home where a Trump voter lives. The canvasser then navigates to a list of questions on the smartphone app and records responses to the survey. An unusual activity report on the Campaign Sidekick app is auto-generated when a survey is filled out by a canvasser some distance from the location of the target voter\u2019s home. The app has built-in tolerances and generates an unusual survey report after taking into account several factors, such as how quickly the canvasser at issue is supposedly hitting doors and whether the responses are recorded more than 100ft away from the target door. America Pac has said its auditing is done by its vendors. In Arizona and Nevada, Blitz Canvassing is understood to audit the numbers at least every five days and, when a canvasser is caught cheating, they are immediately fired with their walkbooks reassigned to another canvasser. \u201cThe America Pac field program is the most robust and effective outside canvassing effort ever, knocking on more doors with more people in more isolated terrain than has ever been done before,\u201d America Pac\u2019s vendors Blitz Canvassing, Echo Canyon, Synapse Group, Patriot Grassroots and Campaign Sidekick said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are fully confident in the authenticity of our door counts thanks to the rigorous auditing infrastructure each canvassing firm deploys to supplement Campaign Sidekick\u2019s strong capabilities, and we are on pace to exceed every single one of our door goals,\u201d the statement said. But that auditing system used in Arizona and Nevada only works if the fraudulent canvassers are caught quickly, which has not always been the case. In one instance, one canvasser was terminated for blatant fraud only after he had worked for five days and supposedly hit 796 doors \u2013 with every single one flagged as suspicious. Part of the problem with paid canvassing, in general, is that canvassing vendors are disincentivized to fire canvassers the more doors they hit because the vendors are paid by the door. If the doors are not hit, the vendor owes money back to the client or owes that many \u201cfree\u201d doors. For America Pac, there is further disincentive for vendors to fire canvassers who might only be frauding one door out of every 10 \u2013 effectively someone who just cuts corners \u2013 because the labor supply of canvassers is diminished this late in the cycle and hiring a replacement is increasingly difficult, two people familiar with the situation said.",

Common among the causes were overdoses, chronic disorders brought on by drugs and alcohol, and accidents. It&nbsp;is of course hardly surprising that people struggle to cope with these levels of scrutiny, criticism and praise.

Imagine not even being able to go to the shops without being somehow \u201cgot at\u201d \u2013 the fan wanting a picture, the non-fan wanting to provoke. No wonder it is the rare famous teen who gets out unscathed.</p> <p>The documentary<em> </em><em>One Direction</em>: <em>This Is Us</em> showed a punishing tour schedule that began almost immediately the band was formed.

Would it really&nbsp;be such an incalculable loss to the culture if producers had to shelter teen singers for a few more years before releasing them to the public? And what if future films and TV shows had no substantial parts for children? Would it really matter all that much?</p> <p>It\u2019s interesting that we have at last&nbsp;come to recognise the damaging&nbsp;nature of fame in the case&nbsp;of certain young people: the children of royals and celebrities, whom we go to some lengths to protect. The difference, I think, is that we see these youngsters as \u201cinnocent\u201d; they have not \u201cchosen\u201d fame, and therefore do not&nbsp;\u201cdeserve\u201d&nbsp;to be hounded.</p> <p>But can a teenage boy who chooses to be a famous pop star when the opportunity is offered fully comprehend the price he might&nbsp;have to pay?</p> <p>\u2022 Martha Gill is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Imagine your teen self looking a bit rubbish or doing something stupid, and then finding this has been documented as fact in 15 separate tabloid headlines the very next day. Imagine not even being able to go to the shops without being somehow \u201cgot at\u201d \u2013 the fan wanting a picture, the non-fan wanting to provoke. No wonder it is the rare famous teen who gets out unscathed. The documentary One Direction: This Is Us showed a punishing tour schedule that began almost immediately the band was formed. In one scene, Payne recalls, amused, that one fan \u201ctried to literally grab\u201d his ear off. Later, he told interviewers of his struggles with mental health, drink and drugs. It\u2019s time, I think, that we created a law protecting children under 18 from the kind of work that leads to massive global fame. Would it really be such an incalculable loss to the culture if producers had to shelter teen singers for a few more years before releasing them to the public? And what if future films and TV shows had no substantial parts for children? Would it really matter all that much? It\u2019s interesting that we have at last come to recognise the damaging nature of fame in the case of certain young people: the children of royals and celebrities, whom we go to some lengths to protect. The difference, I think, is that we see these youngsters as \u201cinnocent\u201d; they have not \u201cchosen\u201d fame, and therefore do not \u201cdeserve\u201d to be hounded. But can a teenage boy who chooses to be a famous pop star when the opportunity is offered fully comprehend the price he might have to pay? \u2022 Martha Gill is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When the Mossad killed Wadie Haddad, leader of a breakaway faction of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and responsible for a string of \u00adspectacular terrorist attacks in the 1970s, probably with poisoned \u00adchocolates, his group disintegrated. Hijackings and bombings \u00adcontinued, but were carried out by others.</p> <p>Velupillai Prabhakaran, the head of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in Sri Lanka, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/19/tamil-tiger-prabhakaran-boday-found\">died in 2009 in&nbsp;a </a>skirmish with government forces after a brutal campaign with \u00admany civilian casualties \u2013 about the same number who have died in Gaza. This decisively closed a bloody decades-long civil war with complex social, ethnic, religious and&nbsp;economic roots.</p> <p>Targeted killings were a mainstay of US strategy during the \u201cwar on terror\u201d that followed the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the work of Bin Laden and his al-Qaida. The advent of drones was one reason, but so was the growing reluctance to risk western soldiers\u2019 lives in combat.</p> <p>In Afghanistan, the killing of a series of Taliban leaders was lauded at the time but did \u00adnothing to change the circumstances, regional and local, that ultimately lent the movement its strength. \u201cHunting man is a difficult game,\u201d one British brigadier blithely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/25/afghanistan.jasonburke\">said in Kabul in 2006</a>. It was also a futile one. The&nbsp;Taliban were \u00adundoubtedly hurt&nbsp;by their losses, and some \u00adstudies show their capabilities \u00adsuffered, but they were still able to retake power in 2021.</p> <p>In Iraq, the US killed successive leaders of Sunni extremist \u00adjihadist groups. The elimination in 2006 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/09/iraq.iraq\">of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, the first prominent leader of al-Qaida\u2019s \u00adaffiliate there, merely cleared the way for competent, low-\u00adprofile local men to rebuild. These too were killed, eventually allowing the \u00adlittle known but ruthlessly effective Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to take over. He unleashed Islamic State on the region and eventually western Europe too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This combination of \u2018decapitation\u2019 and straightforward attrition is virtually unprecedented.

Subsequently, under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-obituary\">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, al-Qaida gave up international attacks and entrenched itself in local communities.

The truth is that no one is sure. There are some cases where the elimination of a leader has brought definitive success. When the Mossad killed Wadie Haddad, leader of a breakaway faction of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and responsible for a string of spectacular terrorist attacks in the 1970s, probably with poisoned chocolates, his group disintegrated. Hijackings and bombings continued, but were carried out by others. Velupillai Prabhakaran, the head of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in Sri Lanka, died in 2009 in a skirmish with government forces after a brutal campaign with many civilian casualties \u2013 about the same number who have died in Gaza. This decisively closed a bloody decades-long civil war with complex social, ethnic, religious and economic roots. Targeted killings were a mainstay of US strategy during the \u201cwar on terror\u201d that followed the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the work of Bin Laden and his al-Qaida. The advent of drones was one reason, but so was the growing reluctance to risk western soldiers\u2019 lives in combat. In Afghanistan, the killing of a series of Taliban leaders was lauded at the time but did nothing to change the circumstances, regional and local, that ultimately lent the movement its strength. \u201cHunting man is a difficult game,\u201d one British brigadier blithely said in Kabul in 2006. It was also a futile one. The Taliban were undoubtedly hurt by their losses, and some studies show their capabilities suffered, but they were still able to retake power in 2021. In Iraq, the US killed successive leaders of Sunni extremist jihadist groups. The elimination in 2006 of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the first prominent leader of al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate there, merely cleared the way for competent, low-profile local men to rebuild. These too were killed, eventually allowing the little known but ruthlessly effective Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to take over. He unleashed Islamic State on the region and eventually western Europe too. Al-Baghdadi was killed in 2019, but the IS leaders who followed have been lacklustre \u2013 when they have stayed alive. The current head is thought to be a minor preacher and faction leader in a remote part of east Africa. So that could be counted as a win for those who support assassination as a strategy. Then there\u2019s Hezbollah. Hassan Nasrallah became leader of the Lebanon-based organisation in 1992 after his predecessor was killed by Israel, then ruled skilfully and effectively for 32 years, evading multiple efforts to end his life. Last month Israel killed not just Nasrallah but the entire top leadership echelon. This combination of \u201cdecapitation\u201d and straightforward attrition is virtually unprecedented. Unsurprisingly, Hezbollah is reeling. The US had its literal \u201cBin Laden moment\u201d in 2011 when the founder and leader of al-Qaida was tracked to a Pakistani hide-out and killed by US special forces. Subsequently, under Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaida gave up international attacks and entrenched itself in local communities. Al-Zawahiri was killed in 2022 and we still don\u2019t really know who al-Qaida\u2019s current leader is, not least because there is no one who has the profile of either predecessor. Al-Qaida is still around, though it does not pose much of an international threat at the moment. This is less true of IS, which is gaining ground in Africa, active in Afghanistan and continues to inspire attacks elsewhere. Israel has of course already killed many of the leaders and most capable operatives of Hamas in the past 20 years. Each death has forced change, but rarely that anticipated. If the chequered history of decapitation strategies tells us anything, it is that it is almost impossible to predict what effect killing a leader will have. This may not matter to those who order the killings or to those who rejoice at the news of a successful assassination. Politics and entirely understandable desire for retribution and justice are important factors. But any jubilation in Israel or elsewhere at the death of Sinwar should be tempered with an awareness that no one can know what will come next. It may indeed be the beginning of the end of the war in Gaza, as Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested. But the history of such killings suggests that, in the long term, any decisive victory will remain elusive. \u2022 Jason Burke is the international security correspondent of the Guardian \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2024. An earlier version said that more people had died in Gaza than in the 2009 campaign in Sri Lankan where Velupillai Prabhakaran was killed. In fact, both conflicts have had about the same number of deaths, about 40,000.",

It comes with a \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 guide price for next month\u2019s 24-hour auction. It is one of many observation posts built during the 1950s, according to the auctioneer Trevor Blythe, from Brown&amp;Co estate agents. He said there were about 1,500 similar bunkers built around the UK and some of them had sold for good money. He said: \u201cObservation posts like the one we are selling were built to provide protective, but extremely limited, accommodation for three observers in the event of a nuclear attack.\u201d The former military observation post sits under land owned by a local farmer, just a few feet into a field on Church Road. Fred Sharman, the owner, told the BBC: \u201cThere\u2019s no facilities of electric, toilet or water but there is what I call a \u2018bucket and chuck-it\u2019 toilet. I think it\u2019s going to be someone a bit quirky. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the everyday person\u2019s sort of thing but it\u2019s whatever floats your boat and maybe that person\u2019s out there. \u201cI saw one advertised and I thought: I\u2019ve got one of those, and thought I\u2019d see what I could do with it. If someone sees it and it\u2019s something that they want, and it\u2019s in their money margin, then I\u2019ve got nothing to lose. It\u2019s just a lump of concrete to me.\u201d Blythe said the bunker was not very practical nowadays. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any specific use for it. Maybe a wine cellar, but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t think of any other use for it except to come down and enjoy it for what it is; a hole in the ground.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When he started secondary school in Hackney, east London, at the age of 11, Sam* had high attainment levels and loved learning. At the end of the introductory week, he was given an award for being a \u201cstar\u201d. Less than two weeks later, a courier delivered a letter to his home saying that he had been permanently excluded. Government data released this summer showed there were a record 9,400 permanent exclusions in 2022-23, up 45% from 6,500 in 2021-22. Sam, who lives on a council estate with his Cameroonian mother and has been diagnosed with ADHD and autism, is among the most likely children in the country to be thrown out of school. Children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), those on free school meals and black Caribbean children are among those who are significantly more likely to be permanently excluded. After a headteacher decides to permanently exclude a pupil, it must be reviewed by the school\u2019s governing body, although experts say they tend to simply \u201crubber stamp\u201d it. A parent who has got nowhere with the governing body can challenge it at an independent review panel but, without legal help, is unlikely to succeed. Now a group of 200 lawyers has come together to, as they put it, \u201cput boots on the ground\u201d in exclusion hearings.

No other British bird is simultaneously reviled and celebrated; depending, it seems, on whether we are looking at one or two starlings, or thousands of them.</p> <p>A closer look at an individual starling reveals some striking qualities. The plumage \u2013 which from a distance appears black \u2013 is actually a subtle blend of greens, browns and purples, with pale spots and, during the breeding season, an iridescent sheen. The song, while not exactly tuneful, is a complex outpouring of rattles, whistles, warbles and buzzes, interspersed with what sounds like&nbsp;static from an analogue radio. The starling was once described as \u201cthe one-man band of the bird world, with no particular tune to play\u201d, which sums it up rather well.</p>    <p>Starlings are also gifted \u00admimics: impersonating telephone \u00adringtones, car alarms, referees\u2019 whistles and even the sound made by \u00adfalling bombs during London\u2019s blitz. Admirers of their musical skills included Samuel Pepys, who wrote of \u201ca starling which doth \u00adwhistle and&nbsp;talk the most and best that ever&nbsp;I heard in my life\u201d.</p> <p>Mozart was another early fan, keeping a pet starling and, when it died, holding a solemn funeral procession in its honour. The bird might even have inspired him to write his Piano Concerto No 17 in G&nbsp;Major, which contains several familiar, whistle-like sounds.</p> <p>Meanwhile, starlings \u2013 whose native home is Europe and \u00adwestern Asia \u2013 have conquered the rest of the world, having been \u00adintroduced into Australia, New Zealand, South&nbsp;Africa (by none other than Cecil Rhodes) and the Pacific island nation of Fiji.</p> <p>Today, the starling is not only one of the most widespread and successful species on the planet, but also one of the most reviled, because of its negative impact on native bird \u00adspecies. Nowhere is this more true than in North America, where they were introduced in the late 19th century.</p> <p>One fine March day in 1890, a wealthy New Yorker named Eugene Schieffelin released a flock of 60 starlings, brought across the Atlantic by ship from England, into&nbsp;New&nbsp;York\u2019s Central Park.</p> <p>Within a few decades their descendants had spread across the entire continent. Today the \u00adstarling is one of North America\u2019s most \u00adcommon birds, with as many as 140 million individuals \u2013 almost half the entire world population. But because they destroy crops, and \u00adoutcompete some native species, they have become America\u2019s avian public enemy No 1.</p> <p>The blame for their presence has been placed squarely on Schieffelin himself, with special ridicule reserved for his infamous plan to introduce every species of bird mentioned by Shakespeare into North America.</p> <p>Now, however, doubt has been cast on this oft-repeated tale. In&nbsp;2021, environmental \u00adhumanists John MacNeill Miller and Lauren Fugate provided irrefutable \u00adevidence that starlings were in fact introduced into the US and Canada almost two decades earlier. And the idea that Schieffelin was \u00admotivated by his love of the Bard did not \u00adsurface until 1948, almost half a century after his death. The story, it seems, is an early example of an urban myth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2024/feb/07/flights-of-fancy-starlings-murmurations-in-pictures\">Flights of fancy: starling murmurations \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back on the Avalon Marshes, more and more starlings are arriving, their \u00adnumbers building until they fill the \u00addarkening sky, performing astonishing \u00adaerial acrobatics.

The plumage \u2013 which from a distance appears black \u2013 is actually a subtle blend of greens, browns and purples, with pale spots and, during the breeding season, an iridescent sheen. The song, while not exactly tuneful, is a complex outpouring of rattles, whistles, warbles and buzzes, interspersed with what sounds like static from an analogue radio. The starling was once described as \u201cthe one-man band of the bird world, with no particular tune to play\u201d, which sums it up rather well. Starlings are also gifted mimics: impersonating telephone ringtones, car alarms, referees\u2019 whistles and even the sound made by falling bombs during London\u2019s blitz. Admirers of their musical skills included Samuel Pepys, who wrote of \u201ca starling which doth whistle and talk the most and best that ever I heard in my life\u201d. Mozart was another early fan, keeping a pet starling and, when it died, holding a solemn funeral procession in its honour. The bird might even have inspired him to write his Piano Concerto No 17 in G Major, which contains several familiar, whistle-like sounds. Meanwhile, starlings \u2013 whose native home is Europe and western Asia \u2013 have conquered the rest of the world, having been introduced into Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (by none other than Cecil Rhodes) and the Pacific island nation of Fiji. Today, the starling is not only one of the most widespread and successful species on the planet, but also one of the most reviled, because of its negative impact on native bird species. Nowhere is this more true than in North America, where they were introduced in the late 19th century. One fine March day in 1890, a wealthy New Yorker named Eugene Schieffelin released a flock of 60 starlings, brought across the Atlantic by ship from England, into New York\u2019s Central Park. Within a few decades their descendants had spread across the entire continent. Today the starling is one of North America\u2019s most common birds, with as many as 140 million individuals \u2013 almost half the entire world population. But because they destroy crops, and outcompete some native species, they have become America\u2019s avian public enemy No 1. The blame for their presence has been placed squarely on Schieffelin himself, with special ridicule reserved for his infamous plan to introduce every species of bird mentioned by Shakespeare into North America. Now, however, doubt has been cast on this oft-repeated tale. In 2021, environmental humanists John MacNeill Miller and Lauren Fugate provided irrefutable evidence that starlings were in fact introduced into the US and Canada almost two decades earlier. And the idea that Schieffelin was motivated by his love of the Bard did not surface until 1948, almost half a century after his death. The story, it seems, is an early example of an urban myth. Back on the Avalon Marshes, more and more starlings are arriving, their numbers building until they fill the darkening sky, performing astonishing aerial acrobatics. Then, as the flock passes over our heads, their wings momentarily make a soft, whooshing sound \u2013 the origin of the word murmuration \u2013 before they plummet into the reedbed. The whole event lasts just 20 minutes or so, after which the birds chatter noisily before settling down to sleep. As dusk falls, and the crowds head back to the car park, we share a collective sense of wonder. We have briefly enjoyed a few special moments with a bird that was once taken for granted, scorned and despised, but is now being redeemed. We are finally learning to appreciate starlings for what they are: common, yes \u2013 but never commonplace. Stephen Moss is an author and naturalist based in Somerset.

      "body": "<p>This column comes to you as a break from listening to a riveting podcast series called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/12/the-week-in-audio-kill-list-call-her-daddy-boj-kate-have-a-lot-on-their-plate-johnny-walker-review\">Kill List</a></em>. It\u2019s about a secret website that journalist and <a href=\"https://demos.co.uk/people/carl-miller/\">author Carl Miller</a> discovered on the dark web, the slimy underbelly of the internet. The site essentially runs what one might call an \u201cassassination market\u201d or a murder-for-hire service. Customers identify and profile someone whom they wish to have killed and pay (in bitcoin, natch) for the service they require. Hence the title of the podcast series.</p> <p>The story starts in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic lockdown when a gifted IT expert and hacker, Chris Monteiro, was browsing the site and found a security vulnerability that, once exploited, gave him complete access to it. Inside, he found a \u201ckill list\u201d, rather like an Excel spreadsheet, of 175 people all over the world whom clients wanted murdered. For each target, there was usually lots of detailed information \u2013 address, photographs, habits, routes regularly travelled etc. It looked, I guess, superficially mundane \u2013 until you read the \u201cinstructions\u201d attached for each one. \u201cHow much bitcoin should I pay?\u201d \u201cTell me the execution time in advance \u2013 I can\u2019t be there.\u201d \u201cI would just like this person to be shot and killed. Where, how and what with does not bother me at all.\u201d You get the idea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The horrendous torrents of misogyny on social media tell us something useful about men</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, the website was a scam run by a Romanian crook who pocketed the cryptocurrency and had no intention of ever providing the requested services. So far, so predictable \u2013 and criminally fraudulent. But in a way this was a scam that revealed something <em>much</em> darker: that there were people all over the world who might be in real danger \u2013 and were probably unaware of the fact that someone out there wanted them dead. The risk was that if some of those bad actors realised they had been scammed \u2013 that there was no hitman coming \u2013 they might in anger or exasperation be willing to do the job themselves. Which did happen at least once \u2013 to a woman in Minneapolis whose suicide was faked by her ostensibly God-fearing husband.</p> <p>This sinister spreadsheet, though, presented Miller with the kind of ethical challenge that few journalists have faced: what to do with a list of people whose lives could credibly be regarded as being in danger? His first response was to go to the police. The Metropolitan police sent two cops in a van, who listened politely but also inquired if he had any history of, er, mental illness. Eventually, the Met told him that they had passed the list to Interpol because so many of those on it lived elsewhere in the world. This was in principle useful but in practice only meant that Interpol would pass it to national police authorities \u2013 which in most cases probably meant that nothing would be done.</p> <p>In the end, Miller decided that he would have to find a way of contacting everyone on the list. He assembled a team of journalistic colleagues to devise a way of doing it. They found it impossible to get the message through by phone, for the very good reason that if someone phones out of the blue to tell you your life may be in danger, you hang up. In the end, they used local journalists to meet targets face to face in the hope that this would persuade them to talk to Miller and his team. And that proved more successful.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a long haul, but it makes for a gripping story, which is why choosing to tell it via a podcast series was a shrewd move. Podcasting is a medium made for this kind of storytelling; if journalism is, as someone once said, \u201cthe first draft of history\u201d, then maybe podcasting is the second. As a medium, it has a wider intellectual bandwidth than broadcasting, which has to address mass audiences, whereas podcasting can serve niche interests and make more assumptions about the listeners\u2019 appetite for detail. People listen to podcasts in their own time, not the broadcasters\u2019. And the relationship between author and audience can be more intimate because so many people listen to podcasts on headphones.</p> <p><em>Kill List</em> provides a graphic reminder of how the internet holds up a mirror to human nature. \u2019Twas ever thus. During the early years of the web, when there was a moral panic about online pornography, I naively suggested that perhaps the prevalence of porn might be telling us something useful about human nature; after all, pornographers are not philanthropists, so there must be a market for their stuff. (Readers were not impressed by this view.) Similarly, the horrendous torrents of misogyny on social media tell us something useful about men. It\u2019s also visible in Miller\u2019s list, by the way. \u201cThe majority of the cases,\u201d <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/i-infiltrated-an-assassins-for-hire-website-then-i-warned-the-victims-3318550\">he said</a>, \u201cwere men targeting women, often wives or girlfriends. I think it says something about modern masculinity and what happens when people do lose control of a partner, and then lose control of themselves.\u201d</p> <p>In one example, an estranged husband, an American doctor, put in an order and paid to have his wife kidnapped, tortured and injected with heroin until she agreed to return to him.

      "bodyText": "This column comes to you as a break from listening to a riveting podcast series called Kill List. It\u2019s about a secret website that journalist and author Carl Miller discovered on the dark web, the slimy underbelly of the internet. The site essentially runs what one might call an \u201cassassination market\u201d or a murder-for-hire service. Customers identify and profile someone whom they wish to have killed and pay (in bitcoin, natch) for the service they require. Hence the title of the podcast series. The story starts in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic lockdown when a gifted IT expert and hacker, Chris Monteiro, was browsing the site and found a security vulnerability that, once exploited, gave him complete access to it. Inside, he found a \u201ckill list\u201d, rather like an Excel spreadsheet, of 175 people all over the world whom clients wanted murdered. For each target, there was usually lots of detailed information \u2013 address, photographs, habits, routes regularly travelled etc. It looked, I guess, superficially mundane \u2013 until you read the \u201cinstructions\u201d attached for each one. \u201cHow much bitcoin should I pay?\u201d \u201cTell me the execution time in advance \u2013 I can\u2019t be there.\u201d \u201cI would just like this person to be shot and killed. Where, how and what with does not bother me at all.\u201d You get the idea. In fact, the website was a scam run by a Romanian crook who pocketed the cryptocurrency and had no intention of ever providing the requested services. So far, so predictable \u2013 and criminally fraudulent. But in a way this was a scam that revealed something much darker: that there were people all over the world who might be in real danger \u2013 and were probably unaware of the fact that someone out there wanted them dead. The risk was that if some of those bad actors realised they had been scammed \u2013 that there was no hitman coming \u2013 they might in anger or exasperation be willing to do the job themselves. Which did happen at least once \u2013 to a woman in Minneapolis whose suicide was faked by her ostensibly God-fearing husband. This sinister spreadsheet, though, presented Miller with the kind of ethical challenge that few journalists have faced: what to do with a list of people whose lives could credibly be regarded as being in danger? His first response was to go to the police. The Metropolitan police sent two cops in a van, who listened politely but also inquired if he had any history of, er, mental illness. Eventually, the Met told him that they had passed the list to Interpol because so many of those on it lived elsewhere in the world. This was in principle useful but in practice only meant that Interpol would pass it to national police authorities \u2013 which in most cases probably meant that nothing would be done. In the end, Miller decided that he would have to find a way of contacting everyone on the list. He assembled a team of journalistic colleagues to devise a way of doing it. They found it impossible to get the message through by phone, for the very good reason that if someone phones out of the blue to tell you your life may be in danger, you hang up. In the end, they used local journalists to meet targets face to face in the hope that this would persuade them to talk to Miller and his team. And that proved more successful. It\u2019s been a long haul, but it makes for a gripping story, which is why choosing to tell it via a podcast series was a shrewd move. Podcasting is a medium made for this kind of storytelling; if journalism is, as someone once said, \u201cthe first draft of history\u201d, then maybe podcasting is the second. As a medium, it has a wider intellectual bandwidth than broadcasting, which has to address mass audiences, whereas podcasting can serve niche interests and make more assumptions about the listeners\u2019 appetite for detail. People listen to podcasts in their own time, not the broadcasters\u2019. And the relationship between author and audience can be more intimate because so many people listen to podcasts on headphones. Kill List provides a graphic reminder of how the internet holds up a mirror to human nature. \u2019Twas ever thus. During the early years of the web, when there was a moral panic about online pornography, I naively suggested that perhaps the prevalence of porn might be telling us something useful about human nature; after all, pornographers are not philanthropists, so there must be a market for their stuff. (Readers were not impressed by this view.) Similarly, the horrendous torrents of misogyny on social media tell us something useful about men. It\u2019s also visible in Miller\u2019s list, by the way. \u201cThe majority of the cases,\u201d he said, \u201cwere men targeting women, often wives or girlfriends. I think it says something about modern masculinity and what happens when people do lose control of a partner, and then lose control of themselves.\u201d In one example, an estranged husband, an American doctor, put in an order and paid to have his wife kidnapped, tortured and injected with heroin until she agreed to return to him. Welcome to the worst devils of our nature.

      "bodyText": "There is a danger that Labour will suffer the Macron effect when the budget is unveiled at the end of the month. Emmanuel Macron, who was first elected president of France in 2017, put business investment and building a culture of entrepreneurialism at the top of his to-do list \u2013 only to be condemned later as a friend of the rich. Rachel Reeves speaks a similar language when she says economic growth is her priority and that business people should be offered more support than even the Tories were prepared to countenance. Already the Treasury has slipped out an announcement about tax breaks for small business owners that will cost \u00a33bn a year in lost tax revenue. An extension of the Enterprise Investment Scheme and its cousin, the Venture Capital Trust scheme, for the rest of the parliament, it offers those who invest in a business an upfront discount of up to 30% from their income tax bill. Those pensioners who are going to lose their winter fuel allowance, saving the government an expected \u00a31.4bn, might wonder whether the chancellor has got her priorities right, especially when the Treasury has failed to commission a report since the tax break was first launched almost 30 years ago to discover whether it is actually money well spent. In his first year at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace, Macron replaced France\u2019s \u201csolidarity tax\u201d on wealth, which was levied on assets above \u20ac1.31m (\u00a31.09m), with a much reduced 30% tax on capital gains from interest and dividends. It amounted to a 70% tax cut on the gains from financial assets. An admirer of the UK\u2019s Anglo-Saxon capitalist model, Macron designed his budget reforms to encourage investment and spur growth. They included a cut in corporation tax to 25% (the same rate as the UK\u2019s today) and less generous unemployment benefits. However, a report in 2022 examining the effects found there was no evidence that abolition of the wealth tax had sparked the economy into life \u2013 or indeed brought any positive effect at all. France Strat\u00e9gie, an independent thinktank established by the former Socialist French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to analyse social, environmental and economic issues, concluded that the main beneficiaries were the bank accounts of France\u2019s richest 3,800 families. In the context of government budgets in France and the UK that top \u00a31tn a year, these measures are small. Yet, as Macron found, they can set the tone for the administration and become the lens through which the public views the leadership\u2019s broader efforts. Macron was quickly dubbed the president of the rich, and the moniker stuck. Labour could be similarly tarred if all the budgetary enthusiasm is directed at entreating the owners of UK businesses to lavish a bit more cash on their company assets, while leaving the rest of the population feeling like the 14 years of austerity it has already endured is never going to end. Reeves is well aware that she is not in the position enjoyed by Labour\u2019s Gordon Brown in the early part of the century, when a growing economy allowed him both to court business with generous tax breaks and to boost welfare payments, in the process bringing down child poverty. And while the chancellor is hinting that inheritance tax privileges and an increase in capital gains tax are among her preferred ways to make those with the broadest shoulders contribute a bit more, a major test will be how she addresses calls to end the two-child benefit cap, which the Resolution Foundation has clearly shown will increase child poverty if it is maintained. The cap, which restricts child tax credit and universal credit in most households to the first two children, affects about 1.6 million children, and will cost the government between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a33.6bn this year to abolish. The foundation said it found a \u201cvery strong relationship\u201d between local levels of child poverty and the share of families affected by the measure introduced by the previous Conservative government.

Michael Morris, a Columbia university professor of leadership, argues in a new book, Tribal, that it is imperative to understand the pervasive influence of tribalism in contemporary politics to comprehend the uphill battle both candidates have in establishing an advantage. \u201cThe idea that some sort of tribal drive to hate outsiders has atavistically reawakened [people] and now the genie can\u2019t be put back into the bottle, and democracy is over \u2026 makes for good stories \u2013 but not good policy,\u201d he says. Morris argues that political disagreement comes from a conformist instinct because we absorb opinions from the people and signals we spent time around. Over the past few decades, US liberals moved to the coastal cities and conservatives to the suburbs and heartlands. \u201cEach became accustomed to form different understandings of factual matters that then make us distrust the other side, become baffled and distrust that they believe the things they say are sincere,\u201d Morris says. \u201cPartisanship is a byproduct of the way we process information.\u201d Interviews with candidates on perceived liberal or conservative corporate media that the viewer already distrusts achieve little, he argues. But podcasts can be different. \u201cThe podcast medium creates the illusion that someone from the other side is really just a friend of a friend \u2013 a chat with someone you trust,\u201d says Morris, noting that the listener is not so confronted \u2013 they may be commuting or working out on a treadmill. \u201cTrump\u2019s conversation with Theo Von made him seem like a real person and sound empathetic,\u201d he says. Harris\u2019s conversation with Howard Stern, he adds, had a similar effect. \u201cShe\u2019s not seemingly like a leader from the other side \u2013 she\u2019s just Howard\u2019s conversation partner, and they trust Howard.\u201d Under those circumstances, the candidates are less like arch enemies. \u201cPerhaps your mind is more open, and tribal psychology helps us understand that.\u201d",

Thorne and other experts the Guardian spoke to suspect Harris\u2019s campaign is attempting to shore up numbers with Black voters, particularly Black men, who are currently less likely to support Harris than they were Biden, according to a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/12/us/politics/poll-black-voters-harris-trump.html\"> New York Times</a> poll.</p> \n<p>\u201cFederal marijuana legalization is a sound policy and supporting it is a smart strategy \u2013 not just with Black voters, but with Americans across the board,\u201d said Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation with Drug Policy Action.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a Black woman and the first person of color to regulate marijuana for both medical and adult use, I understand the challenges in creating legal marijuana markets that work for Black men.

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris announced on Monday that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level \u2013 the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition. As part of her pledge, she said she would take steps to ensure that Black men, disproportionately incarcerated and disenfranchised by the war on drugs, would stand to profit from the industry. Vince Sliwoski, a partner at the cannabis law firm Harris and Sliwoski, said he \u201cwas happy to see it, because I like the messaging\u201d, but added: \u201cShe can\u2019t just snap her fingers and do it when she gets into office. It\u2019s not something that can be done via executive orders.\u201d Griffen Thorne, also an attorney specializing in cannabis, felt the promise was \u201cclearly political\u201d, given the announcement came just three weeks before the election. Thorne and other experts the Guardian spoke to suspect Harris\u2019s campaign is attempting to shore up numbers with Black voters, particularly Black men, who are currently less likely to support Harris than they were Biden, according to a New York Times poll. \u201cFederal marijuana legalization is a sound policy and supporting it is a smart strategy \u2013 not just with Black voters, but with Americans across the board,\u201d said Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation with Drug Policy Action. \u201cAs a Black woman and the first person of color to regulate marijuana for both medical and adult use, I understand the challenges in creating legal marijuana markets that work for Black men. I also recognize the profound harms caused by federal prohibition.\u201d Packer added that it makes sense for Harris\u2019s plan to include provisions that will remove barriers for Black men in cannabis and other domains. Notably, the pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority. During his administration, Biden made a number of promises on cannabis, including to expunge criminal records for possession convictions and get cannabis rescheduled so that it is eligible for FDA approval. The DEA has made progress on rescheduling, but it won\u2019t go through before the election. And Biden only expunged a small fraction of cannabis-related convictions during his administration. \u201cIt was kind of embarrassing, because he kept up on his website all this stuff he was promising,\u201d said Sliwoski. Meanwhile, Trump has changed his tune on cannabis during this election season, including by supporting an upcoming Florida ballot initiative that would legalize recreational cannabis. But the decisions he made during his presidency left a lasting sense of distrust among advocates. \u201cOne of the first things he did was appoint war on drugs zealot Jeff Sessions as his attorney general,\u201d said Sliwoski, \u201cThe industry was really on edge, at least for the first couple of years of Trump\u2019s regime,\u201d he explained. Harris also distinguishes herself from Trump in calling for social equity provisions that help Black men benefit from the industry. But making such provisions work is tricky. Even when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress during Biden\u2019s administration, Thorne pointed out that they were unable to successfully pass cannabis policy reform \u2013 in part because of disagreements about whether social equity provisions went far enough. \u201cThey let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\u201d said Thorne. While some Republicans in Congress now support cannabis reform, Thorne adds, they are less likely to vote for bills with a lot of social equity stipulations. Sliwoski suggests looking at the More Act to try to get a sense of what kind of provisions Harris might support if elected president. Harris co-sponsored the bill when it was introduced in Congress in 2019. The act would require the Bureau of Labor Statistics to track demographic information about cannabis business owners and employees, and create a trust fund devoted to initiatives that help communities hurt by the war on drugs. State-level laws have attempted similar initiatives, but they often fail \u2013 the state legal cannabis industry is still heavily dominated by already wealthy white men. \u201cInequities in the cannabis industry are due in part to banking restrictions and the high cost of entry into the market,\u201d said Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University. \u201cIndividuals need to have money at the beginning of the process, or they need wealthy investors, and white men tend to have more of both.\u201d Social equity initiatives didn\u2019t fully address barriers to entry in the industry, and sometimes gave funding to people with dubious connections to the marginalized communities they were intended to serve, according to reporting from Politico.

Neonicotinoids are a controversial class of chemicals used in insecticides spread on over 150m acres of US cropland to treat for pests, in addition to being used on lawns. The pesticides work by destroying an insect\u2019s nerve synapse, causing uncontrollable shaking, paralysis and death \u2013 but a growing body of science has found it harms pollinators, decimates bee populations and kills other insects not targeted by the chemical. Neonicotinoids are similar in chemical structure to nicotine, and impact the same human neurotransmitters that are responsible for nervous system development and ongoing health. Though scientists long thought that neonicotinoids only impacted insects, they break down into smaller compounds that are as potent as nicotine in their effects on the human brain, Donley said. Recent research has found the chemicals in the bodies of over 95% of pregnant women, and in human blood and urine at alarming levels. While agricultural workers face the highest exposures, the chemicals are water soluble, easily leach into soils and streams, and are common in drinking water. Neonicotinoid residue is also regularly found on produce. The EPA is required by law to review pesticides for safety every 15 years, and the industry research reviewed by Donley\u2019s team is part of that process. The low- to-mid level exposures in water and food are what concerns the paper\u2019s authors. The pesticide industry did not submit data for these levels in many cases despite the EPA asking for it, Donley said. Still, the EPA seems poised to set new regulations without the data and has simply claimed that mid- to low-level exposures are safe, Donley added. But the available data points to health risks and research that supports the industry claim is missing. \u201cThe strategy by pesticide companies seems to be to ignore the EPA, and instead of receiving any consequence, the EPA just kind of shrugs its shoulders and gives it a rubber stamp,\u201d Donley said. In another instance, EPA management overruled one of its own scientists that raised concern about neurotoxic effects, and instead adopted a statistical analysis that claimed lower doses do not have neurotoxic effects, Donley said. It is unclear why the EPA is not demanding more data. However, it is the latest in a long string of controversies surrounding the pesticides division largely stemming from its alleged ties to the pesticide makers, and its financial reliance on them. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that industry is gaming the system and we don\u2019t have anyone calling them out on it,\u201d Donley said. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2024 to clarify that the Center For Food Safety co-authored the paper. A previous version incorrectly stated it was Food &amp; Water Watch.",

      "body": "<p>My most typed Google inquiry? Roast chicken recipes. As irresistible as a golden-hued, crisp-skinned roast chicken is, I often feel like I should occasionally break away from its perfect clutches. The recipe opposite is the one I go to. Its three types of chilli heat conspire to create a warmth that tingles rather than blows your head off and makes a rich, chickeny, spicy shallot sauce. And it gifts you the most brilliant leftovers as the meat is already infused with so much character.</p> <p>When I\u2019ve had a long week and can\u2019t think what to cook, I&nbsp;find leftover chicken waiting in the fridge is what saves me. I\u2019ll&nbsp;buy the biggest bird I can find, and always the highest possible quality I can afford. I\u2019ll roast it at the weekend (ideally having bathed it in a 5%&nbsp;brine with a few herbs such as thyme or rosemary for at least 24 hours beforehand), share it with friends if I have to, then use its leftovers throughout the week in different ways. A curry is mandatory, as is a fresh, punchy, crunchy, herby salad. And as I get to the end of the bounty, I\u2019ll make a sandwich. It feels a bit too obvious to cover it in mayo, so I often make a shawarma-style pitta as I&nbsp;always have the store-cupboard ingredients to hand.</p> <p><strong>A note on storing leftovers<br></strong>I always try to keep the cooked chicken as intact as possible to stop it drying out. Leave it on the carcass, or if you want to make stock immediately, take it off in big chunks before placing it in a&nbsp;storage container and pouring&nbsp;over any remaining gravy. I find the gravy is then great to add to whatever I make during the week&nbsp;to add some chickeny&nbsp;oomph.</p> <h2>Chicken alla diavola</h2>    <p>If you want to retire your reliable roast recipe for a bit, this should be its stand in.</p> <p>For full-on devil chicken, I\u2019d recommend using a couple of scotch bonnets as your red chilli or substitute the pul biber for regular dried chilli flakes.</p> <p>I like to eat this with slightly more low-key sides to let the chicken take the starring role. Both of them can be made in advance and reheated. The parmesan mash is particularly fun as it uses the starchy cooking water to enrich the potatoes instead of cream or milk. If you don\u2019t fancy mash, this is also great with cooked white beans; just distribute around the chicken when you remove the lid.</p> <p>Use the chicken cooking time as a guide \u2013 the truth is that for perfectly cooked chicken a meat thermometer is essential, as all our ovens are different. Start with 40 minutes with the lid on, then take its temperature every 10&nbsp;minutes until you get to 72-75C.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 3 tsp <br><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2 <br><strong>mild red chilli</strong> 1, roughly chopped<br><strong>garlic</strong> 6 cloves<br><strong>pul biber (aleppo pepper)</strong> 2 tsp, or 1 tsp dried chilli flakes<br><strong>olive oil </strong>4 tbsp <br><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>banana shallots</strong> 3, peeled and finely sliced<br><strong>thyme</strong> 4 sprigs <br><strong>best possible quality chicken</strong> 1.8-2kg, at room temperature<br><strong>red wine vinegar</strong> 75ml</p> <p><em><strong>For the parmesan mash</strong></em><br><strong>floury potatoes</strong> 1kg, peeled and cut into equal chunks (maris piper or king edward work well)<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>100ml <br><strong>parmesan</strong> 75g, grated</p> <p><em><strong>For the fennel </strong></em><em><strong>and garlic cavolo nero</strong></em><br><strong>cavolo nero or kale</strong> 400g, leaves separated from stem<br><strong>olive oil </strong>4 tbsp <br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, sliced<br><strong>fennel seeds</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas&nbsp;mark 6.</p> <p>Crush the peppercorns and 1&nbsp;bay leaf in a mortar and pestle, then add the chilli, 2 of the garlic cloves and 1 heaped teaspoon of salt, and bash together until you have a rough paste. Stir in the pul biber, 2 tablespoons of the oil and the tomato puree (if you do the oil first the puree will slide beautifully off the spoon).</p> <p>Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over a medium heat in your largest casserole dish/dutch oven with a lid (if you don\u2019t have one big enough, use a baking tray and tin foil to roast the chicken). Add the shallots, remaining garlic, remaining bay leaf, the thyme and a big pinch of salt and pepper, and gently fry for 5 minutes while you prepare the chicken.</p> <p>Slather the chilli paste all over the chicken, going under the skin if you want.</p> <p>Sit the chicken on top of the cooked shallots and pour around the vinegar. Put a lid on top and place in the oven for 40 minutes until the chicken is almost cooked through, then remove the lid, and return to the&nbsp;oven for a further 15-20 minutes until dark on top and the juices run clear when you push a skewer into the thickest&nbsp;part of the leg (or a thermometer reads 72-75C). Remove the chicken from the pan to rest for at least 20 minutes. You should have some delicious spicy, saucy shallots left in the pan; keep warm.</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve taken the lid off the chicken (after 40 minutes), get on with everything else. To make the parmesan mash, place the potatoes in a large pan, cover with cold water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to the boil and cook until soft, about 15 minutes, then drain, keeping a cup of cooking water. Return the potatoes to the pan and mash vigorously to your desired&nbsp;texture. Stir in the oil, parmesan and enough cooking water to make a creamy mash \u2013 you\u2019ll probably need at least half a cup. Season to taste and keep warm.</p> <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the cavolo nero or kale for 5-6 minutes until tender, then drain. Dry the pan, and over a medium heat warm the olive oil and add the sliced garlic. Fry gently until it begins to feel sticky, then add the fennel seeds and cook for a&nbsp;further minute to warm them through, then add the drained cavolo nero and stir through until it\u2019s nicely coated. Season well and put to one side until you\u2019re ready to eat. This can be done in advance and quickly warmed up just before serving.</p> <p>Carve up the chicken and serve it alongside the mash and cavolo with plenty of the reserved spicy shallot sauce.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <h2>Goi g\u00e0 \u2013 Vietnamese chicken salad</h2>    <p>Make this salad even more delicious by making your own fried shallots. Yes, they\u2019re a bit of a faff (so do just buy them if you fancy), but they\u2019re incredibly moreish and the shallot oil is one of life\u2019s greatest byproducts to use with braised greens, in salads dressing and in your mash.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have that much chicken, bulk this out with some cucumber and finely sliced peppers. If you can find Vietnamese coriander and mint, even better.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><em><strong>For the fried shallots</strong></em><br><strong>banana shallots</strong> 2, peeled<br><strong>sunflower or vegetable oil</strong> 350ml</p> <p><em><strong>For the dressing</strong></em><br><strong>lime</strong> juice of 1, plus extra, to serve<br><strong>caster sugar </strong>2 tbsp <br><strong>red chilli </strong>\u00bd-1 (depending on taste), deseeded and finely chopped<br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 small clove, finely chopped<br><strong>fish sauce</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>rice wine vinegar</strong> 1\u00bd tbsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the salad</strong></em><br><strong>hispi or white cabbage</strong> 1 small head, finely sliced<br><strong>red onion</strong> \u00bd small, finely sliced<br><strong>carrots</strong> 2, peeled and shredded with a mandoline<br><strong>coriander</strong> 2 handfuls, stem and leaves, roughly chopped<br><strong>mint leaves</strong> 2 handfuls, roughly chopped<br><strong>salted roasted peanuts</strong> 4 handfuls, finely chopped<br><strong>leftover cooked chicken </strong>200g-250g, roughly shredded<br><strong>fried shallots</strong> 8 tbsp, homemade (see above) or shop-bought, to serve</p> <p>Make the shallots first. Set yourself up with a sieve over a small bowl and line a large plate with kitchen paper. Using a mandoline (this is essential for even frying), slice the shallots into rounds about 2 credit cards thick. Separate them into individual rings, then place in a small, thick-bottomed pan and pour over enough oil to just cover. Place over high heat and bring to a vigorous simmer, stirring often. After about 10-15 minutes (depending on the size of your pan) of simmering, they\u2019ll begin to turn golden and clump a little. As soon as you get to pale golden, pour into the sieve, then transfer to the kitchen paper. Leave to cool \u2013 they\u2019ll crisp up as they cool. Be sure to keep the oil.</p> <p>Make the dressing next. Squeeze the lime into the sugar and stir vigorously until it dissolves, then add the other ingredients. Let it stand while you prepare the rest of the salad.</p> <p>Combine the salad ingredients, except for the peanuts and shallots, in a large bowl and pour over the dressing. Toss well and transfer to plates. Sprinkle generously with the peanuts and shallots, and serve with a wedge of lime on the side. </p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <h2>Chicken saag</h2>    <p>A super quick, wholesome yet comforting leftovers dish. If you&nbsp;have any cavolo nero remaining from the diavola recipe, this is a great place to use it. Just chuck it into the blender along with the spinach. In fact, feel free to use any cooked or raw greens you have lying about.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t got quite enough chicken, bulk this out with leftover boiled potatoes, roast pumpkin or any cooked root veg, such as celeriac. This is also a great way to use up any leftover spicy shallots from the original recipe \u2013 just add them in at the end.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><strong>frozen spinach</strong> 300g, defrosted<br><strong>olive or rapeseed oil</strong> 3 tbsp<br><strong>cumin seeds</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>bay leaf</strong> 1<br><strong>onions</strong> 2 small, chopped<br><strong>garlic</strong> 3 cloves, finely chopped or grated<br><strong>ginger</strong> a thumb, finely chopped or&nbsp;grated<br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 2 medium, roughly chopped<br><strong>sea salt</strong> 1 tsp<br><strong>turmeric</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>Kashmiri chilli powder</strong> \u00bd-1 tsp, or&nbsp;other mild chilli powder (start with \u00bd and add more if you like)<br><strong>garam masala</strong> 2 tsp<br><strong>leftover cooked chicken </strong>about 300-400g, roughly shredded<br><strong>Greek or natural yoghurt</strong> 5-6 tbsp<br><strong>chapatis and basmati rice</strong> to serve</p> <p>Whizz the spinach in a blender with a few splashes of water to make a vibrant puree.</p> <p>Warm the oil in a large deep pan over medium heat, and toast the cumin seeds and bay leaf for a minute or so before adding the onion and frying until golden, about 8-10 minutes.</p> <p>Add the garlic and ginger and once they smell fragrant, about 2-3&nbsp;minutes, add the tomatoes and&nbsp;1 heaped teaspoon of salt. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until they begin to break down.</p> <p>Lower the heat slightly and add the turmeric, chilli powder and garam masala, followed by the spinach puree. Cook, stirring, until the spinach is hot and has mingled a bit with the spices, then stir in the chicken and yoghurt. Add a few splashes of water to loosen it a bit, then cook for just a few moments until they\u2019re both warmed through, then serve with rice and chapatis.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <h2>Chicken shawarma pitta</h2>    <p>If you don\u2019t have quite enough chicken for this, trying bulking it out with chickpeas and cucumber. If you can\u2019t find a suitable pitta, feel free to put this between&nbsp;any two pieces of bread, ciabatta would be particularly delicious. This is also another wonderful home for any spicy roasted shallots you might have leftover from the diavola recipe.</p> <p><em><strong>Makes 2 pitta</strong></em><br><strong>garam masala</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>turmeric</strong> a pinch <br><strong>ground cumin</strong> \u00bc tsp <br><strong>smoked paprika</strong> \u00bc tsp <br><strong>tahini</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>Greek or natural yoghurt </strong>4 tbsp <br><strong>lemon</strong> juice of \u00bd <br><strong>leftover cooked chicken</strong> 200g-250g</p> <p><em><strong>To assemble</strong></em><br><strong>cucumber pickle </strong>1, sliced (ideally a&nbsp;sour pickle)<br><strong>pittas</strong> 2 large, to serve<br><strong>fries</strong> to serve</p> <p><em><strong>For the salad</strong></em><br><strong>shredded hispi or white cabbage</strong> 2 handfuls <br><strong>parsley leaves</strong> 2 handfuls <br><strong>tomato</strong> 1 medium, thinly sliced<br><strong>sumac</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>Combine all the spices in a mixing bowl, then stir in the tahini, yoghurt and lemon juice.

As irresistible as a golden-hued, crisp-skinned roast chicken is, I often feel like I should occasionally break away from its perfect clutches. The recipe opposite is the one I go to. Its three types of chilli heat conspire to create a warmth that tingles rather than blows your head off and makes a rich, chickeny, spicy shallot sauce. And it gifts you the most brilliant leftovers as the meat is already infused with so much character. When I\u2019ve had a long week and can\u2019t think what to cook, I find leftover chicken waiting in the fridge is what saves me. I\u2019ll buy the biggest bird I can find, and always the highest possible quality I can afford. I\u2019ll roast it at the weekend (ideally having bathed it in a 5% brine with a few herbs such as thyme or rosemary for at least 24 hours beforehand), share it with friends if I have to, then use its leftovers throughout the week in different ways. A curry is mandatory, as is a fresh, punchy, crunchy, herby salad. And as I get to the end of the bounty, I\u2019ll make a sandwich.

Chicken alla diavola If you want to retire your reliable roast recipe for a bit, this should be its stand in. For full-on devil chicken, I\u2019d recommend using a couple of scotch bonnets as your red chilli or substitute the pul biber for regular dried chilli flakes. I like to eat this with slightly more low-key sides to let the chicken take the starring role. Both of them can be made in advance and reheated.

Crush the peppercorns and 1 bay leaf in a mortar and pestle, then add the chilli, 2 of the garlic cloves and 1 heaped teaspoon of salt, and bash together until you have a rough paste.

This is their third America\u2019s Cup win in a row and there was little doubt after they came back from a nervy start in race seven. A momentous win. Leg 5 of 6: Ineos Britannia close the gap again. Team NZ cross as they click into a right hand shift and then tack on top of their opponents. The Defender are at the port marker at 43 knots with a lead of 17sec. Leg 4 of 6: The gap has widened again and there is a big right hand shift at the bottom of the course. Ineos Britannia are still in this but they need to pick up the pace because, right now, Team NZ are two legs away from winning the 2024 America\u2019s Cup. Leg 3 of 6: Ineos comes back on starboard with the lead down to 50 metres and the Kiwis tack immediately on their bow. The Defender are forced to \u2026 well defend, and there is just enough room for them to maintain the lead. It\u2019s a drag race to the top gate with only 10m between the two boats. Leg 2 of 6: The gap now goes up to 325m and a third of the race distance is done for the Defender. Many predicted that the slower conditions would favour Ineos Britannia but Team NZ are proving that is not even remotely the case. Leg 1 of 6: The Brits are a bit faster at the start and the two boats go back in forth a bit but Team NZ then gain a healthy lead of about 250m. Ineos Britannia end the first leg 0:19 behind the Defender. The race committee has just confirmed that race nine is a go. The wind has finally picked up to gusts up to 11 knots but in the lull areas it\u2019s only at around five \u2013 the two teams will have to be careful to avoid those areas. We will be off in a few moments! An email to keep up company while we wait! Andy writes: I tuned into the live feed a little late and was delighted to see Brittania in the lead. With some gentle fist pumps I switched to the Guardian live blog \u2026 only to find I was watching the replay from Wednesday. All I can hope for now its some foreshadowing and that Brittania keeps the contest alive, at least until the second race. Indeed, we are now watching a replay of race 6 and judging by the chat alongside the YouTube live feed and viewers on X, you are not the only one Andy! Wind has yet to pick up 10 minutes after the scheduled start time and the sailors are now being told that race nine has officially been delayed 30 minutes. Start is slightly delayed due to the calmer winds, but the meteorologists are confident that conditions will pick up. The wind is now only at about 6 knots. The teams are already on the water waiting on their boats. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the weather. The offshore wind from the north-west is still present but by midday it should subside and leave light conditions for the early afternoon. Sea state will be calm and the sky should clear up. It should be sunny with temperatures of up to 21C. Their backs are against the waves wall but Ben Ainslie has not given up yet. There\u2019s no second chances. We\u2019ve got to win every race from now on in. In some ways, that helps the scenario. The siege mentality really kicks in and you\u2019re in the ultimate fight. We still think we can go further in this competition and we\u2019re determined to do that. The story of the America\u2019s Cup so far this year is Team New Zealand\u2019s ability to start fast and make the right decision when it comes to how best to utilise the win. From Andy Bull\u2019s report yesterday: Emirates Team New Zealand tacked right into the stronger wind down the side of the course and swept ahead into an insurmountable lead. By the start of the last leg of the race, they were almost a kilometre in front. Read the full verdict from Barcelona here. It is do or die for Ineos Britannia in Barcelona today. They are 6-2 down in a first-to-seven race for the 2024 America\u2019s Cup and now need to win every single race ahead of them in order to become the first team from Britain to win the Auld Mug. The Defender, Team Emirates New Zealand, cruised to wins in yesterday\u2019s two races. They started strong in both and there seemingly was no questions about who would cross the finish line first. But today\u2019s a new day! Can Ben Ainslie and his crew defy all the odds? Start time for race nine is scheduled for 1.10pm BST. Let\u2019s get to sailing.",

      "bodyText": "Jacob Steinberg was at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for us. I\u2019ll leave you with his report. The first half was tough, honestly, but when I equalised I knew we were gonna win. When we play good we are unbelievable, but we have to defend much better and we have to train on that more. [On the half-time substitution of James Maddison] The balance was not good enough in the first half, we were a little bit too offensive, so we have to look at that before the next game. I think Pape [Sarr] changed the game for us. When we click we can score four goals in four minutes. More of that please! A restorative afternoon for Spurs, who came from behind to overwhelm West Ham and draw a line under that Brighton nonsense. Dejan Kulusevski and Son Heung-min both scored and were outstanding; they also combined for an own goal that was harshly credited to Alphonse Areola. That was the second of three goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half. The game was petering out when Mohammed Kudus, who had put West Ham ahead, tried to start a riot and was sent off. He might face an extended ban for booting Micky Van de Ven around like an old sock. 90+3 min It\u2019s definitely petering out now. The official player of the match is Dejan Kulusevski, who was menacing throughout and played a big part in the first and third goals. 90 min Seven minutes of added time, mainly for all those fun and games with Kudus. West Ham may well lose him for more than three matches. 87 min: Spurs substitution Archie Gray is on for Destiny Udogie. 86 min His noggin went completely for about 10 seconds. I think he\u2019s been sent off for slapping Van de Ven round the chops. 85 min There\u2019s a VAR check, so Kudus will surely be off here. The kick in the back was by far the more egregious offence, but he\u2019ll probably be off for raising hands to both Van de Ven and Pape Sarr (I think). 84 min: Kudus and Van de Ven are booked! That\u2019s astonishing. I cannot believe Kudus hasn\u2019t been sent off for either offence. The ball got trapped under the falling Van de Ven. Kudus kicked him in the back then, when Van de Ven sprang to his feet, shoved him in the face. He\u2019s going off surely. The kick was well out of order, not dissimilar (though nowhere near as bad) as Pepe\u2019s infamous kick that led to a long suspension. 83 min: It\u2019s kicking off! Mohammed Kudus is in trouble here. Van de Ven ended up on the floor, as did Richarlison. 81 min: Double substitution for Spurs Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur replace Yves Bissouma and Dominic Solanke. 80 min The West Ham fans are buggering off en masse. Rightly or wrongly, it feels like Julen Lopetegui has lost any goodwill he received after that Ipswich game. 79 min Maybe the match is starting to peter out now. Plenty more football to come, though, and Scott Murray has the team news for the big 3pm games. 76 min Spurs still want more. Kilman makes a vital lunging tackle on Johnson on the edge of the area, then Werner\u2019s header from Porro\u2019s deep cross is pushed away by Areola. Not sure whether it took a deflection; if not it was a fairly comfortable save. 73 min Apparently Spurs\u2019 third has gone down as an Areola own goal, which is a bit strange. 72 min A misjudgement from Van de Ven allows Kudus to lead a West Ham break. They faff around for a bit, allowing Spurs to get back, but then Kudus curls a good shot from distance that is pushed away to his right by Vicario. He did well because it came through a crowd and bounced awkwardly just in front. 71 min: West Ham substitution Konstantino Mavropanos replaces poor old Guido Rodriguez, who worked extremely hard to keep West Ham in the game for the first 50 minutes. 70 min: Spurs substitution Timo Werner replaces Son Heung-min, who was increasingly magnificent on his return to the side. 69 min \u201cAnge Postecoglou\u2019s teams seem, to me, to need adversity to work,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cWhen things go too well, the intensity drops, the players run slower, take time to ponder, and their opponents are free to make use of the vast acres of space that Angeball leaves unoccupied all across the pitch. But when things are going wrong, that extra burst of energy that comes with panic allows the players to cover that extra yard, to fizz that unexpected pass, to shoot without thinking. It might be better for teams to let Spurs score two early on, and then go for broke in the second half.\u201d Heh, that\u2019s an interesting theory. Sometimes I think the opposite, certainly against really good teams \u2013 that they can get deflated if there\u2019s no eye in the opposition needle. 67 min Soler, just on as sub, is booked for something or other. 67 min: Good save! Areola dives low to his right to repel Johnson\u2019s shot, an excellent save, and Solanke just can\u2019t get to the loose ball in front of goal. 66 min \u201cBeing a Spurs fan nowadays is a strange thing,\u201d writes Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. \u201cWhen we\u2019re losing 1-0 you\u2019re always confident they\u2019ll get an equalszer, but when they\u2019re 3-1 up you\u2019re fretting they might throw it away. Still prefer this drama to the Mourinho/Conte drama.\u201d As a neutral I feel the same. But I do miss the rants and the alibis. 65 min Now Kulusevski curls not far wide from the edge of the area. Spurs look like scoring every time they go forward. 62 min: Off the line by Udogie! West Ham want a penalty for handball. The ball ricocheted across the six-yard box to Kudus, whose shot hit the arm of Udogie \u2013 which was held tight to his chest \u2013 and flew behind for a corner. There\u2019s a VAR check but no penalty. 61 min: Son hits the post! Spurs are rampant. Rodriguez did well to cut out a through pass but could only divert it to Son, who cracked a first-time shot from the edge of the area. It beat Areola, hit the inside of the post and rolled across the goalline to safety. 60 min: Triple substitution for West Ham Lopetegui actually wanted to make this change at 2-1. Crysencio Summerville, Edson Alvarez and Carlos Soler replace Soucek, Antonio and Lucas Paqueta. Son has been quite brilliant since half-time and now he\u2019s made it 4-1. It came on the break, with Wan-Bissaka caught miles upfield. Son ran at the backpedalling Todibo, dizzied him with a couple of stepovers, shifted the ball onto his left foot and rifled it through Areola at the near post. Lovely goal. The main man is back! 56 min Soucek is booked for throwing Johnson off the field. That was a bit weird. Son collected the ball in the centre circle, flicked another lovely outside-of-the-foot pass out to Kulusevski and kept running. Kulusevski cut inside on the edge of the area, then reversed a pass to give Son a clear chance. His shot was fairly tame but Areola could only push it against Todibo, after which it dribbled miserably into the net. An unlucky own goal from Jean-Clair Todibo gives Spurs a two-goal cushion. Edit: the own goal has since been credited to Alphonse Areola. 54 min Kudus breaks dangerously, reaching the edge of the area before hitting a shot that is blocked. He should really have played in Wan-Bissaka to his right, but he didn\u2019t, and now\u2026 Son, on the touchline, flicked a delicious out-of-the-boot pass to the underlapping Udogie in the area. He turned back outside Wan-Bissaka, near the byline, and laid the ball back to the onrushing Bissouma on the edge of the area. Bissouma hit his shot into the wrong but it wrongfooted Areola, who expected him to go across goal, and bobbled into the net. Of all the goalscorers! 51 min Udogie enlivens the crowd with a shot from the edge of the area that deflects behind for Spurs 482nd corner. Son takes, Soucek stoops to head clear at the near post. 50 min \u201cYou mention \u2018a Pep Guardiola No8\u2019 re Kulusevski in the first half,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure about a No10 and a No6, but I can\u2019t be alone in being unclear about a No8. Any enlightenment welcome to someone who used to read FourFourTwo.\u201d Really? David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne in Pep\u2019s first great City teams are perfect examples of a modern No8. Martin Odegaard, Dominik Szoboszlai, Andres Iniesta, Socrates, Xavi (late period), etc, etc. 49 min It\u2019s been a slow start to the second half from Spurs, and a quiet one from their fans. That\u2019s a surprise because they battered West Ham for the second half of the first half. 47 min Maddison hasn\u2019t looked as natural as Kulusevski in the No8 role but it\u2019s still a surprise to see him hooked at half-time. He\u2019s sitting on the bench, arms folded, with a face like a you know what. 46 min No hay lesion: apparently Maddison was taken off for football reasons. Spurs substitution Pape Sarr is on for James Maddison in midfield; you\u2019d assume that\u2019s because of injury. Half-time reading Spurs are never dull. That was a richly entertaining first half that could easily have finished 3-2. Mohammed Kudus forced a terrific save from Guglielmo Vicario before putting West Ham in front; the outstanding Dejan Kulusevski, playing like a Pep Guardiola No8, drove Spurs forward and eventually scored the equaliser. 45+1 min Another chance for Spurs right at the lot. Romero\u2019s cross reaches Son beyond the far post, but he sees it late and his touch is slightly heavy. That takes him too wide for a shot so he rifles a low cross that is booted away from under the crossbar. 43 min: Great effort from Porro! Kulusevski\u2019s clever flick finds Udogie on the left of the area. He clips a cross back towards the edge of the area, where his fellow Pedro Porro arrives late, reads the bounce and hits a ridiculous scissor-kick that flashes just wide. That would have been some goal. 43 min Paqueta is booked for a tactical foul on Johnson. 40 min Kulusevski wanders over the left, beats Wan-Bissaka and has a shot blocked. He\u2019s been brilliant. 39 min The underlapping Porro whacks a low cross that is desperately cleared by Wan-Bissaka, with Son waiting behind him to score. Spurs\u2019 response to going behind has been admirable; they just keep coming. West Ham lost the ball in the Spurs half and were immediately in trouble. Maddison broke four v four and gave the ball to Kulusevski on the right. He danced across the edge of the area and reversed a surprise shot which the unsighted Areola could only push onto the inside of the near post. The ball bounced across the line, hit the far post and spun into the net. Spurs are rewarded for their irrepressibility! 34 min: Fine save by Areola! Spurs take a short corner and work the ball infield to Porro, 25 yards out. His first touch is excellent, teeing himself up for a fierce shot that takes a deflection and is really well stopped low to his left by Areola. It was pretty central but he had to change direction sharply because of the deflection, then get down to the shot and ensure he didn\u2019t palm it out in front o goal. 31 min Johnson overhits a relatively simple pass to Kulusevski in the area, which allows Kilman to make an important tackle. Lots of openings for Spurs, but no clear chances yet. 29 min The resulting corner eventually leads to a speculative overhead kick from Solanke that is saved comfortably by Areola. 28 min: Chance for Spurs! Son plays in the underlapping Udogie, who teases a cross towards the far post. Johnson comes on the blindside of Paqueta, misses an attempted header, and the ball hits Paqueta\u2019s shoulder before bouncing fractionally wide of the near post. Johnson can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t make contact, although it was awkward as he was running away from goal and had to come round Paqueta. 26 min Son collects a headed clearance on the left of the area, moves outside Wan-Bissaka and hits a shot that goes behind for yet another corner. Spurs have had at least seven in the first 26 minutes, and they\u2019ve done bugger all with any of them; this one from Maddison goes behind for a goalkick on the far side. 25 min It\u2019s not often Spurs and West Ham fans come together but they did before the game to protest against the reduction \u2013 and in some cases removal \u2013 of concessionary tickets. 22 min Spurs\u2019 passing and movement is of a really high quality and West Ham are having to work extremely hard in defence. Emerson heads behind for a corner which is then nodded away by Rodriguez. He might be working the hardest of all of them. 21 min Kudus has a very similar chance earlier in the game. He connected sweetly with that and didn\u2019t score, whereas the goal wasn\u2019t cleanly struck at all. Theer\u2019s a moral in that story I\u2019m sure. Spurs struggled to clear after a bit of pinball in the area. Bowen collected the ball on the right, shuffled away from Udogie a bit too easily and tried to cut the ball back. It deflected towards Kudus, who scuffed a shot into the net from 10 yards. I think it took a touch off the sliding Johnson; either that or Kudus hit it into the ground. The hell he\u2019ll care. All that possession for Spurs and it\u2019s West Ham who take the lead! 18 min The overworked Rodriguez concedes his third corner on the Spurs left. Maddison swings it too close to Areola. 16 min: Lovely effort from Son! Spurs probe patiently until Son receives possession on the left edge of the area. He beats Wan-Bissaka through sleight of hip, not even needing to touch the ball, and shapes a textbook curling shot that goes just wide of the far post. 13 min Bowen is starting to threaten. He runs through Van de Ven on the edge of the area, benefitting from a ricochet Preben Elkjaer-style, forcing Bissouma to get back and sweep up. Bowen would otherwise have been through on goal. 11 min: Fine save by Vicario! Bowen runs at Van de Ven and screws a low cross towards Kudus, charging onto the ball at the far post. He sweeps a first-time shot towards goal and Vicario reacts superbly to push it over the bar. It was close to him but he still needed abnormal reaction speed to make the save. 9 min Udogie underlaps nicely to win another corner for Spurs. Both were conceded by Guido Rodriguez, who has already had to put out a few fires. 8 min The corner is cleared, which gives West Ham their first opportunity to break. Antonio is held up on the left wing and the Spurs players have time to shuttle back. 8 min Kulusevski wins a corner for Spurs, who are all over West Ham like a cheap cliche. 6 min A terrific effort from the in-form Brennan Johnson. A loose ball bounced towards him on the right side of the area, the angle far too tight for a shot. Or so it seemed: Johnson watched the bounce and cut across a beautiful shot that swooshed just wide of the far post. 4 min Spurs have started with a spring in their step; they usually do. Kulusevski looks particularly bright. 2 min Areola springs from his line to beat Solanke to a through ball from the right. He kicked the ball out for a throw-in instead of picking it up, but ultimately he got rid of the danger. 1 min Peep peep! After the players on both sides take a knee, Spurs kick off from right to left as we watch. The Premier League table at the start of play A reminder of the teams, who are about to stroll onto the pitch. Spurs (4-1-2-3) Vicario; Pedro Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bissouma; Kulusevski, Maddison; Johnson, Solanke, Son. Substitutes: Forster, Dragusin, Gray, Bentancur, Sarr, Bergvall, Moore, Richarlison, Werner. West Ham (4-1-4-1) Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Emerson; Rodriguez; Bowen, Soucek, Paqueta, Kudus; Antonio. Substitutes: Fabianski, Cresswell, Soler, Coufal, Summerville, Mavropanos, Guilherme, Ings, Alvarez. Referee Andy Madley. Julen Lopetegui\u2019s pre-match thoughts It will be our most demanding away match so far and we have to be ready to be very competitive. We know what this means to the fans so we have to be all our focus on the pitch. This is a nice piece about Kate Cross\u2019s dad I am frustrated and upset to have read recent misleading and inaccurate press articles, published in both England and Brazil, claiming to disclose information about my case. Big Ange talks to TNT Sports Look out! Son Heung-min has recovered from a hamstring injury and replaces Timo Werner on the left wing. Yves Bissouma is preferred to Rodrigo Bentancur in the only other change from the Brighton defeat. West Ham are unchanged. Spurs (4-1-2-3) Vicario; Pedro Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bissouma; Kulusevski, Maddison; Johnson, Solanke, Son. Substitutes: Forster, Dragusin, Gray, Bentancur, Sarr, Bergvall, Moore, Richarlison, Werner. West Ham (4-1-4-1) Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Emerson; Rodriguez; Bowen, Soucek, Paqueta, Kudus; Antonio. Substitutes: Fabianski, Cresswell, Soler, Coufal, Summerville, Mavropanos, Guilherme, Ings, Alvarez. Referee Andy Madley. It\u2019s time for Tottenham to get back on the horse. Ange Postecoglou has had two weeks to dwell on their horrid collapse at Brighton, where they lost 3-2 after being 2-0 up at half-time. And while there\u2019s no chance of him changing his philosophy, he\u2019d quite like Spurs to stop flattering to deceive. Spurs have played brilliantly at times this season, yet they\u2019re only two points clear of a West Ham side who have been criticised from all angles. Things look a bit better for Julen Lopetegui after a 4-1 win over Ipswich before the international break; a win today really would endear him to the West Ham fans. Kick off 12.30pm.",

      "body": "<h2>Satan is a feminist now</h2> <p>The devil works hard, but the Republican party works harder. Not a day seems to go by without anti-abortion zealots on the right advancing some cunning new plan to strip women of their bodily autonomy. As well as shutting down abortion clinics, Republican states are trying to essentially outlaw abortion pills: on Friday, Missouri, Kansas and Idaho renewed a legal push to drastically <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pill-mifespristone-state-lawsuit-f03bfe0d9b9fc04e4c8b01a1c6d16851\">reduce access</a> to mifepristone.</p> <p>Amid this hellscape, help may be at hand from a somewhat unlikely source: Satan. Or, to be more accurate \u2013 and since the devil is in the details \u2013 the Satanic Temple.</p> <p>Founded in 2012, <a href=\"https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us?srsltid=AfmBOoqwS4LBVNttUjQO10uj2fttdIeI0AaZ0BKoAME5ATZ7aM6tKdXD\">the Satanic Temple</a> (which is not to be confused with the very different Church of Satan) is not about devil worship. Rather, it is about raising hell to fight for freedom from the religious right\u2019s crusade to impose their beliefs on everyone else. \u201cRight now, we have a minority religious theocratic movement, so entrenched in politics and getting away with whatever they want,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/friend-of-satan-how-lucien-greaves-and-his-satanic-temple-are-fighting-the-religious-right\">co-founder Lucien Greaves</a> told the Guardian earlier this year.</p> <p>Recognized as a religion by the IRS, the Satanic Temple uses the religious right\u2019s tactics, and their victories, against them. When a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/satan-ten-commandments-oklahoma-city\">Ten Commandments monument</a> was erected at the Oklahoma state capitol in 2012, for example, the temple submitted an application to put a 7ft-tall statue depicting Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, alongside it. In its application, it argued that the decision to have a Ten Commandments monument paved the way for satanic representation. (They weren\u2019t the only ones protesting: the satirical Church of the Flying <a href=\"https://www.spaghettimonster.org/\">Spaghetti Monster</a> also requested a monument.) In the end, the Ten Commandments statue was <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/alabamas-chief-judge-ordered-remove-ten-commandments-monument-courthouse\">removed</a> by order of the state\u2019s supreme court and the Horned One did not get immortalized in Oklahoma.</p> <p>Over the years, the Satanic Temple has taken on issues like prayer in the classroom, after-class Bible study groups, and the distribution of Bibles in schools. Now, for obvious reasons, it\u2019s increasingly turning its not-so-evil eye to abortion rights. Last year, it opened an online abortion clinic in New Mexico called The Samuel Alito\u2019s Mom\u2019s Satanic Abortion Clinic, in reference to the conservative justice who wrote the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-samuel-alito-66c301d223759e842ad95e89f597d587\">majority opinion</a> that overturned Roe v Wade. \u201cIn 1950, Samuel Alito\u2019s mother did not have options, and look what happened,\u201d Malcolm Jarry, co-founder of the Satanic Temple <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-satanic-temple-abortion-clinic-samuel-alito-b2282495.html\">said at the time</a>.</p> <p>As with its other causes, the Satanic Temple brands abortion as a core part of its religious beliefs. Women are asked to recite a ritual (\u201cBy my body, my blood, by my will, it is done\u201d) before taking abortion pills to ward off \u201cunjust persecution\u201d. The temple has also sued states that have banned abortion, <a href=\"https://www.ag.idaho.gov/newsroom/labrador-letter-defeat-for-satanic-temple/\">arguing</a> that abortion is a religious rite for their congregation and that denying them access to these ritual abortions would be a constitutional violation.</p> <p>All of this has had the desired effect of driving the satanists\u2019 adversaries bonkers.

      "bodyText": "Satan is a feminist now The devil works hard, but the Republican party works harder. Not a day seems to go by without anti-abortion zealots on the right advancing some cunning new plan to strip women of their bodily autonomy. As well as shutting down abortion clinics, Republican states are trying to essentially outlaw abortion pills: on Friday, Missouri, Kansas and Idaho renewed a legal push to drastically reduce access to mifepristone. Amid this hellscape, help may be at hand from a somewhat unlikely source: Satan. Or, to be more accurate \u2013 and since the devil is in the details \u2013 the Satanic Temple. Founded in 2012, the Satanic Temple (which is not to be confused with the very different Church of Satan) is not about devil worship. Rather, it is about raising hell to fight for freedom from the religious right\u2019s crusade to impose their beliefs on everyone else. \u201cRight now, we have a minority religious theocratic movement, so entrenched in politics and getting away with whatever they want,\u201d co-founder Lucien Greaves told the Guardian earlier this year. Recognized as a religion by the IRS, the Satanic Temple uses the religious right\u2019s tactics, and their victories, against them. When a Ten Commandments monument was erected at the Oklahoma state capitol in 2012, for example, the temple submitted an application to put a 7ft-tall statue depicting Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, alongside it. In its application, it argued that the decision to have a Ten Commandments monument paved the way for satanic representation. (They weren\u2019t the only ones protesting: the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster also requested a monument.) In the end, the Ten Commandments statue was removed by order of the state\u2019s supreme court and the Horned One did not get immortalized in Oklahoma. Over the years, the Satanic Temple has taken on issues like prayer in the classroom, after-class Bible study groups, and the distribution of Bibles in schools. Now, for obvious reasons, it\u2019s increasingly turning its not-so-evil eye to abortion rights. Last year, it opened an online abortion clinic in New Mexico called The Samuel Alito\u2019s Mom\u2019s Satanic Abortion Clinic, in reference to the conservative justice who wrote the majority opinion that overturned Roe v Wade. \u201cIn 1950, Samuel Alito\u2019s mother did not have options, and look what happened,\u201d Malcolm Jarry, co-founder of the Satanic Temple said at the time. As with its other causes, the Satanic Temple brands abortion as a core part of its religious beliefs. Women are asked to recite a ritual (\u201cBy my body, my blood, by my will, it is done\u201d) before taking abortion pills to ward off \u201cunjust persecution\u201d. The temple has also sued states that have banned abortion, arguing that abortion is a religious rite for their congregation and that denying them access to these ritual abortions would be a constitutional violation. All of this has had the desired effect of driving the satanists\u2019 adversaries bonkers. The Christian Research Institute, an evangelical group, described the group as \u201ctroll lords\u201d and said they were \u201cexploiting their cartoonishly dark and villainous branding to agitate the public and pester the Christian Right into a judicial showdown\u201d. That showdown may be forthcoming because the Satanic Temple has just opened its second telehealth abortion clinic, this time in Virginia. It\u2019s called the Right to Your Life Satanic Abortion Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re also actively working to increase access in other states, including taking legal action in restrictive states such as Indiana and Idaho to provide religious abortion services there as well,\u201d the temple said in a statement. Truly, they are doing the Lord\u2019s work. Russia wants to ban \u2018propaganda\u2019 promoting childfree lifestyles \u201cIt is important to protect people, primarily the younger generation, from having the ideology of childlessness imposed on them on the internet, in the media, in movies and in advertising,\u201d one politician said. I imagine that JD Vance, who has very strong views on \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d is nodding along furiously to all this, and taking notes for copycat legislation in the US. US startup charging couples to \u2018screen embryos for IQ\u2019 Video footage shot by the group Hope Not Hate and reviewed by the Guardian show the company Heliospect Genomic marketing its services at up to $50,000 for 100 embryos, with one manager boasting a possible gain of more six IQ points. A genetics expert told the Guardian that one of the many problems with this \u201cis that it normalises this idea of \u2018superior\u2019 and \u2018inferior\u2019 genetics \u2026 [and] reinforces the belief that inequality comes from biology rather than social causes\u201d.

They were in front when Son played a pass behind Wan-Bissaka, who watched Udogie turn and tee up Bissouma for an easy finish. They were rampant, soon surging forward again, Kulusevski\u2019s flick setting up Son for a shot that Todibo deflected in off Areola for an own goal. Todibo\u2019s misery continued, Son bamboozling him with a couple of stepovers before firing a low shot past Areola, and all that was left was for Kudus to lose his head after clashing with Van de Ven. West Ham ended in deserved disgrace.",

Mike Moon, the state\u2019s senator and author of its trans youth healthcare ban, has <a href=\"https://themissouritimes.com/former-transgender-patients-speak-out-at-safe-act-press-conference/\">referenced</a> God and the Bible to support his bill (and defend <a href=\"https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/13/missouri-senator-mike-moon-denies-support-of-child-adult-marriage/70111914007/\">child marriage</a>).

As she prepared to move away, one of the young members confided he was gay, telling her last-minute and worried she would disapprove. \u201cI said, \u2018So what? I love you,\u2019\u201d she recalls.</p> <p>The interaction taught her about how coming out feels risky to many kids, she said. \u201cAnd I knew that wouldn\u2019t be the last youth to come out [to me].\u201d</p> <p>Shumway is a member of the United Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination with 770,000 members, which promotes inclusivity.</p> <p>Over the years, she has helped lead numerous churches through the process of becoming \u201c<a href=\"https://openandaffirming.org/ona/why/\">open and affirming</a>\u201d congregations that support LGBTQ+ members. She acknowledges non-queer congregants\u2019 discomfort and tries to help them grasp what it might be like to struggle with dysphoria. She emphasizes the importance of treating people like Lemke with respect, even if they don\u2019t understand them. \u201cI affirm God\u2019s love for this person,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe God created Phoenix to be a wonderful person of God just as he is.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s my job to kick open the doors that have been closed and allow Phoenix and others the opportunity to walk through if they want to,\u201d Shumway added.</p> <p>Moving in with Shumway was transformative for Lemke, he said. He came out as trans after he started living with Shumway, and began transitioning soon after. \u201cHere, I could do what I want, be who I want and kiss who I want without being called a slur.\u201d</p>    <p>Last year, he posted a joyous photo holding his court paperwork confirming his legal name change: \u201cI just felt so much better and happier.\u201d</p> <p>Lemke said he\u2019s estranged from most of his relatives, who have resisted acknowledging his transition. \u201cBy insisting they had a daughter, they lost the opportunity to have a son,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could get them to understand that \u2013 as much as you think you know me, you don\u2019t live in my body. You didn\u2019t live the first 17 years of your life looking at it and knowing something is wrong but not being allowed to say it, because you know you wouldn\u2019t be safe.\u201d</p> <p>Lemke said he still feels unsafe using public bathrooms in Missouri. While he was grateful to turn 18 so he could access gender-affirming healthcare, he has also had distressing conversations with his doctor about how hard it has become to support trans patients in the state.</p> <p>Lemke scoffs at the idea that Republicans are \u201cprotecting children\u201d with bills restricting trans existence \u2013 laws that have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/health/trans-young-people-suicide-attempts/index.html\">linked</a> to sharp increases in suicide attempts among trans youth. \u201cThey want to die because they aren\u2019t allowed to be themselves,\u201d Lemke said of some of his peers. \u201cI genuinely feel I am alive because I was able to put my foot in the door.\u201d</p> <p>Shumway said watching Lemke blossom had inspired her to keep fighting for LGBTQ+ rights. \u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege seeing these shackles that were holding him down fall off, and seeing him become such a confident young man.\u201d</p> <p>Lemke isn\u2019t religious, but sometimes makes food for Shumway\u2019s congregation. When friends learn he lives with a pastor, \u201cthey say, \u2018Are you okay? Blink twice,\u2019\u201d he said, noting how many of them have come to associate religion with intolerance.</p> <p>Shumway added: \u201cThe corporate church has done such harm, and there needs to be healing.\u201d</p> <p>Shumway\u2019s statehouse race is an uphill battle in a district dominated by Republicans. Whether she\u2019s elected, she said she\u2019ll advocate for the passage of a nondiscrimination law in Missouri, where state <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2015/10/30/9645492/missouri-lgbtq-workplace-discrimination\">law</a> does not prohibit employers from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2015/10/30/9645492/missouri-lgbtq-workplace-discrimination\">firing people</a> for being LGBTQ+.</p> <p>Other Missouri <a href=\"https://www.missourifaithvoices.org/post/hundreds-of-missouri-faith-leaders-oppose-anti-trans-legislation\">faith leaders</a> have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/02/28/missouri-transgender-bills/\">organized</a> against anti-trans bills, some motivated by their own trans children.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/15/the-21st-century-is-queer-accept-it-the-harlem-gospel-travelers-on-prejudice-in-the-church-and-singing-for-joe-biden\">\u2018The 21st century is queer.

      "bodyText": "When Phoenix Lemke was in his final year of high school, he had nowhere to go. The family of the teenager from O\u2019Fallon, Missouri, had long disapproved of him being queer, and in December 2021, at age 17, he left home without a clear plan. He spent several days couchsurfing with friends until he found refuge with an unlikely figure: a local pastor. The Rev Susan Shumway, a minister at a nearby church, had known Lemke for years through his friends and offered him a room as soon as she learned of his predicament. \u201cShe has a history of letting people stay here when they are struggling,\u201d Lemke, now 20, said on a recent evening, seated with Shumway in their living room. \u201cShe was adamant in letting me know she supported me, and at some point I just started calling her mom.\u201d Shumway is something of an anomaly in this deep red state: a clergy member advocating for LGBTQ+ equality. Missouri in recent years has been at the center of a national push to limit the rights of trans and queer people. State officials have pushed to outlaw healthcare for trans youth, block trans kids from sports, restrict trans people\u2019s bathroom access and censor LGBTQ+ content. As in other parts of the country, those efforts have found the support of Christian nationalist groups, and Missouri officials have explicitly pointed at their faith while enacting trans restrictive policies. Mike Moon, the state\u2019s senator and author of its trans youth healthcare ban, has referenced God and the Bible to support his bill (and defend child marriage). The Missouri attorney general, Andrew Bailey, as well as the Missouri US senator Josh Hawley, who embraces the idea of America as a \u201cChristian nation\u201d, have promoted the anti-trans talking point that God \u201cdoesn\u2019t make mistakes\u201d, falsely suggesting children cannot be trans. Shumway has a very different view. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian who believes in trans rights. And I\u2019m going to be loud and make sure legislators hear from Christians who are not spewing hate,\u201d she said. Shumway\u2019s now campaigning to become a state representative, hoping to be a strong opposition voice in a legislature that has become one of the most hostile in the nation toward queer and trans people. \u201cThe Christian right has not had a challenge from the Christian left, and we need to join together and make some noise,\u201d she said. Shumway traces her LGBTQ+ rights advocacy to 1999, when she was in seminary, leading a youth group. As she prepared to move away, one of the young members confided he was gay, telling her last-minute and worried she would disapprove. \u201cI said, \u2018So what? I love you,\u2019\u201d she recalls. The interaction taught her about how coming out feels risky to many kids, she said. \u201cAnd I knew that wouldn\u2019t be the last youth to come out [to me].\u201d Shumway is a member of the United Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination with 770,000 members, which promotes inclusivity. Over the years, she has helped lead numerous churches through the process of becoming \u201copen and affirming\u201d congregations that support LGBTQ+ members. She acknowledges non-queer congregants\u2019 discomfort and tries to help them grasp what it might be like to struggle with dysphoria. She emphasizes the importance of treating people like Lemke with respect, even if they don\u2019t understand them. \u201cI affirm God\u2019s love for this person,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe God created Phoenix to be a wonderful person of God just as he is. \u201cI believe it\u2019s my job to kick open the doors that have been closed and allow Phoenix and others the opportunity to walk through if they want to,\u201d Shumway added. Moving in with Shumway was transformative for Lemke, he said. He came out as trans after he started living with Shumway, and began transitioning soon after. \u201cHere, I could do what I want, be who I want and kiss who I want without being called a slur.\u201d Last year, he posted a joyous photo holding his court paperwork confirming his legal name change: \u201cI just felt so much better and happier.\u201d Lemke said he\u2019s estranged from most of his relatives, who have resisted acknowledging his transition. \u201cBy insisting they had a daughter, they lost the opportunity to have a son,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could get them to understand that \u2013 as much as you think you know me, you don\u2019t live in my body. You didn\u2019t live the first 17 years of your life looking at it and knowing something is wrong but not being allowed to say it, because you know you wouldn\u2019t be safe.\u201d Lemke said he still feels unsafe using public bathrooms in Missouri. While he was grateful to turn 18 so he could access gender-affirming healthcare, he has also had distressing conversations with his doctor about how hard it has become to support trans patients in the state. Lemke scoffs at the idea that Republicans are \u201cprotecting children\u201d with bills restricting trans existence \u2013 laws that have been linked to sharp increases in suicide attempts among trans youth. \u201cThey want to die because they aren\u2019t allowed to be themselves,\u201d Lemke said of some of his peers. \u201cI genuinely feel I am alive because I was able to put my foot in the door.\u201d Shumway said watching Lemke blossom had inspired her to keep fighting for LGBTQ+ rights. \u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege seeing these shackles that were holding him down fall off, and seeing him become such a confident young man.\u201d Lemke isn\u2019t religious, but sometimes makes food for Shumway\u2019s congregation. When friends learn he lives with a pastor, \u201cthey say, \u2018Are you okay? Blink twice,\u2019\u201d he said, noting how many of them have come to associate religion with intolerance. Shumway added: \u201cThe corporate church has done such harm, and there needs to be healing.\u201d Shumway\u2019s statehouse race is an uphill battle in a district dominated by Republicans. Whether she\u2019s elected, she said she\u2019ll advocate for the passage of a nondiscrimination law in Missouri, where state law does not prohibit employers from firing people for being LGBTQ+. Other Missouri faith leaders have organized against anti-trans bills, some motivated by their own trans children. Daniel Bogard, a St Louis rabbi, has pleaded with lawmakers to preserve the rights of his 11-year-old trans son. He cited sacred Jewish texts that scholars interpret as referencing nonbinary identity. \u201cLegislators pretend like being queer is new, and it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have always been queer people. It\u2019s just another incredible way of being human. \u201cI used to believe, if I could show them that, they would leave my family alone. I don\u2019t believe that anymore,\u201d he continued, saying legislators now won\u2019t acknowledge his family. \u201cThey stopped looking us in the eye, because it just hurt them too much to see us as humans \u2026 It works for these Christian nationalist politicians to get people to be fearful of and disgusted by my child.\u201d While disillusioned by the political process, Bogard said he will continue to encourage faith leaders to \u201cstand up for the dignity and sacredness of trans kids. \u201cThese kids need to know there are people who love them and are fighting for them.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is impossibly easy to root for Kylie Minogue. The Australian pop princess is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/10/kylie-minogue-i-was-searching-for-my-favourite-manolos-then-i-remembered-theyre-in-the-va\">funny in interviews</a> \u2013 see her dry, casual dismissal of the idea that Kylie Jenner could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/29/kylie-jenner-kylie-minogue-trademark-battle\">trademark their shared first name</a>. She is also remarkably private \u2013 rarely, if ever, whipping up hokey, pseudo-emotional backstories for her records or trying to claim that she is some kind of pop auteur. In this sense, she is a rarity in the modern pop landscape, in which bleeding-heart confessionalism and grand posturing are de rigueur. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/30/the-rise-and-rise-of-mass-market-celebrity-wine\">wine brand is pretty good</a>, and while her 2010s and 2020s output rarely holds a candle to her unimpeachable 90s and 00s run, she has continually released enough great singles, and mounted enough fantastic tours, to keep fans interested (and stay in high rotation at drag bars).</p> <p>This surfeit of goodwill meant that when her career began to genuinely reignite on a mainstream level last year \u2013 after the single Padam Padam took on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/22/its-a-padam-ic-kylie-minogue-sex-positive-hit-brilliantly-upending-the-mainstream\">a life of its own</a> thanks to its kooky lyrics and insistent hook \u2013 many were swept up in the \u201cPadamic\u201d. That song\u2019s associated album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/sep/22/kylie-tension-review-padam-was-just-for-starters\">Tension</a></em>, also had the huge benefit of being Minogue\u2019s best full-length in many years: a euphoric EDM-pop record that also indulged her long-established love of glittery French touch and hazily remembered 80s nostalgia. Songs such as Hold on to Now, with its Robyn-esque slow build, and the robotic sex jam Tension are among Minogue\u2019s best tracks in ages \u2013 capturing, perfectly, the heightened mix of cheekiness and steeliness that wasn\u2019t even totally nailed on, say, Padam Padam, which, despite its success, also felt a little bit anonymous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Tension II replicates the animating ideas of Padam Padam over and over, until those ideas have been worn down to nothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, like any self-respecting dancefloor queen, Minogue wants to keep the sesh going. Her 17th album, <em>Tension II</em>, isn\u2019t a deluxe reissue of last year\u2019s set but an entirely new record featuring nine new tracks plus four previously released collaborations with the Blessed Madonna, Diplo and Orville Peck, Bebe Rexha and Tove Lo, and Sia. Unfortunately, like all too many fabulous parties, this is one that should have been called early. <em>Tension II</em> is sometimes sparky and sometimes gratifying, but for the most part it fails to recreate the highs of its predecessor, instead choosing to replicate the animating ideas of Padam Padam \u2013 anonymous, sledgehammer-subtle Eurotrash beats; nonsensical vocal hooks; self-aware attempts at camp \u2013 over and over, until those ideas have all been worn down to nothing.</p> <p>A lot of these songs feature great, quintessentially Kylie moments: the verses of Someone for Me are sultry and confident but get bulldozed by a plasticky Ibiza hits playlist drop. Good As Gone begins as a brilliant tribute to/update of I Will Survive, Minogue embodying a wounded disco diva, but little of that persona carries through to the chorus. It\u2019s frustrating to be teased, over and over again, with the sparkle and charisma that made Minogue a star, before she and her collaborators dutifully return to ideas better left on dance music radio. Ironically, the album displays a lack of self-belief \u2013 something you never want to hear associated with Kylie. A song such as Shoulda Left Ya, on the other hand, despite its resigned, post-breakup haze, has the kinetic thrill of many of Minogue\u2019s best tracks; a soaring electro-pop ballad, it\u2019s an outlier on this record, and it makes you wish that she would experiment more with this kind of pathos.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAVqr8hwjVY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aAVqr8hwjVY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAVqr8hwjVY\">Watch a video for Lights Camera Action by Kylie,the opening track on the album Tension II.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In a classic case of nominative determinism, the jewel of this set is titled Diamonds. It\u2019s casual but effortlessly glamorous, silly but steadfast in its commitment to the bit; when Minogue speak-sings the lines \u201cI see the diamonds in your eyes/ We\u2019re getting close to paradise\u201d, she issues them like commands, and you can instantly imagine tens of thousands screaming along, ready to submit. It\u2019s a shame that this highlight is sandwiched between Kiss Bang Bang and Hello, two boilerplate EDM-pop tracks that offer little of the same high.

      "bodyText": "It is impossibly easy to root for Kylie Minogue. The Australian pop princess is funny in interviews \u2013 see her dry, casual dismissal of the idea that Kylie Jenner could trademark their shared first name. She is also remarkably private \u2013 rarely, if ever, whipping up hokey, pseudo-emotional backstories for her records or trying to claim that she is some kind of pop auteur. In this sense, she is a rarity in the modern pop landscape, in which bleeding-heart confessionalism and grand posturing are de rigueur. Her wine brand is pretty good, and while her 2010s and 2020s output rarely holds a candle to her unimpeachable 90s and 00s run, she has continually released enough great singles, and mounted enough fantastic tours, to keep fans interested (and stay in high rotation at drag bars). This surfeit of goodwill meant that when her career began to genuinely reignite on a mainstream level last year \u2013 after the single Padam Padam took on a life of its own thanks to its kooky lyrics and insistent hook \u2013 many were swept up in the \u201cPadamic\u201d. That song\u2019s associated album, Tension, also had the huge benefit of being Minogue\u2019s best full-length in many years: a euphoric EDM-pop record that also indulged her long-established love of glittery French touch and hazily remembered 80s nostalgia. Songs such as Hold on to Now, with its Robyn-esque slow build, and the robotic sex jam Tension are among Minogue\u2019s best tracks in ages \u2013 capturing, perfectly, the heightened mix of cheekiness and steeliness that wasn\u2019t even totally nailed on, say, Padam Padam, which, despite its success, also felt a little bit anonymous. Now, like any self-respecting dancefloor queen, Minogue wants to keep the sesh going. Her 17th album, Tension II, isn\u2019t a deluxe reissue of last year\u2019s set but an entirely new record featuring nine new tracks plus four previously released collaborations with the Blessed Madonna, Diplo and Orville Peck, Bebe Rexha and Tove Lo, and Sia. Unfortunately, like all too many fabulous parties, this is one that should have been called early. Tension II is sometimes sparky and sometimes gratifying, but for the most part it fails to recreate the highs of its predecessor, instead choosing to replicate the animating ideas of Padam Padam \u2013 anonymous, sledgehammer-subtle Eurotrash beats; nonsensical vocal hooks; self-aware attempts at camp \u2013 over and over, until those ideas have all been worn down to nothing. A lot of these songs feature great, quintessentially Kylie moments: the verses of Someone for Me are sultry and confident but get bulldozed by a plasticky Ibiza hits playlist drop. Good As Gone begins as a brilliant tribute to/update of I Will Survive, Minogue embodying a wounded disco diva, but little of that persona carries through to the chorus. It\u2019s frustrating to be teased, over and over again, with the sparkle and charisma that made Minogue a star, before she and her collaborators dutifully return to ideas better left on dance music radio. Ironically, the album displays a lack of self-belief \u2013 something you never want to hear associated with Kylie. A song such as Shoulda Left Ya, on the other hand, despite its resigned, post-breakup haze, has the kinetic thrill of many of Minogue\u2019s best tracks; a soaring electro-pop ballad, it\u2019s an outlier on this record, and it makes you wish that she would experiment more with this kind of pathos. In a classic case of nominative determinism, the jewel of this set is titled Diamonds. It\u2019s casual but effortlessly glamorous, silly but steadfast in its commitment to the bit; when Minogue speak-sings the lines \u201cI see the diamonds in your eyes/ We\u2019re getting close to paradise\u201d, she issues them like commands, and you can instantly imagine tens of thousands screaming along, ready to submit. It\u2019s a shame that this highlight is sandwiched between Kiss Bang Bang and Hello, two boilerplate EDM-pop tracks that offer little of the same high. While the latter, at least, flirts with a Jersey Club beat just long enough to maintain interest, the former is pure pap, the kind of track that would only really be at home during a transition shot on the Netflix reality show Selling Sunset. It may have been easier to let Tension II slide were it not a sequel to an excellent predecessor; comparison was always inevitable, and I doubt many will choose to hit play on part two when they can just spin part one instead. That said, Minogue is an artist who has always been able to mount unexpected comebacks and has shown a preternatural ability to select surprising, avant-garde collaborators. (Which other A-list pop star has made a song with Deee-Lite\u2019s Towa Tei and Yellow Magic Orchestra\u2019s Haruomi Hosono on which they take the guise of a personified typeface?) Still, Tension II mostly fits the late-period Minogue criteria: a couple of songs here are absolutely fit for a greatest hits set list \u2013 or, at the very least, a high-energy 2am drag show.",

We do not condone the language in these posts and work hard to moderate content according to our values. \u201cWe are also deeply concerned by the divisive stance taken by education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, and the Labour government, which is \u2018othering\u2019 independent school children, fuelling abuse and creating a toxic environment. \u201cWe urge the government to end this harmful rhetoric and meet with parents affected by the proposed policy. Despite several requests, we have yet to secure a meeting with the education secretary.\u201dSome users in the group also documented the steps they were having to take to pay for the increased fees. One said they had \u201ccancelled RSPB and my national trust membership\u201d, another said that they had dropped work on a kitchen and a third that they had \u201ccancelled a new driveway\u201d. Ministers say the money raised from the VAT hike will be spent on 6,500 new teachers, better mental health support for children and breakfast clubs for all primary schools. Those opposed to the policy have warned that the plans are rushed, state schools will see an influx and that children with special educational needs and disabilities will be affected, as will children from military families and those from small religious faiths. The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which had quoted the campaign group in some of its social media posts, distanced itself from the abusive comments. \u201cThe ISC has no official involvement with ENT,\u201d it said. \u201cWe do not condone offensive or abusive remarks \u2013 these have no place in this discussion. We utterly condemn the distasteful language used in the comments highlighted by the Observer. \u201cIn addition to being objectionable, these posts draw attention away from the very real and legitimate concerns parents have about the future of their children\u2019s education. \u201cWe will continue to raise these concerns in our efforts to urge the government to delay the implementation of VAT on fees and to mitigate its impact on schools and families.\u201d",

They are recounting 1,000 years of death in the city: how many are buried in the labyrinth of tunnels that make up Les Catacombes, what killed them and how the diseases that may have led to their demise have developed over the centuries. In the first ever scientific study of the site, a team of archeologists, anthropologists, biologists and doctors is examining some of the skeletons of an estimated 5-6 million people whose bones were literally dumped down quarry shafts at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th. \u201cAstonishing as it may seem, there has never been any serious scientific study of the catacombs,\u201d said Philippe Charlier, who is leading the project. \u201cOur research is looking at 1,000 years of the history of public health in Paris and its suburbs, of the medicine and surgery people underwent and the illnesses they suffered. \u201cThere are other ossuaries in the world, but this is probably the biggest so it\u2019s unique.

      "body": "<p>Easy to forget that the American dream \u2013 the phrase dates from 1931 \u2013 was originally a quest for liberty and equality, not cars, washing machines and refrigerators. By the time Leonard Bernstein wrote his one-act opera <strong>Trouble in Tahiti</strong> (1952), mod cons had pushed lofty ideals out of the way. The sweet suburban life of Sam and Dinah, the married couple in the opera, \u201clooks\u201d like domestic bliss but feels awful, as Bernstein\u2019s own libretto puts it. Opening the Linbury theatre\u2019s new season, in a stylish and probing staging by Oliver Mears, conducted by Nicholas Chalmers, <em>Trouble in Tahiti</em> is <a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/trouble-in-tahiti-a-quiet-place-details\">paired with</a> its more cumbersome sequel, <strong>A Quiet Place</strong> (1983). Both are in orchestrations, reduced and adapted, by Garth Edwin Sunderland, sparklingly played by unnamed soloists from the Royal Opera orchestra.</p> <p>With a nod to Kurt Weill, and paving the way for his own <em>Candide</em> and <em>West Side Story</em>, soon to follow, <em>Trouble in Tahiti</em> had already established Bernstein\u2019s distinctive flair. He embraced jazz harmonies, shoo-be-doo scat singing for the commentating trio (oddly amplified here but well sung) and colloquial dialogue. Sam and Dinah have everything, including affluence, psychiatrist, milliner, superior attitudes and an obedient child, Junior, who sees all but says nothing. Only happiness is absent. In one version of the text (Bernstein wrestled with the work), Dinah asks: \u201cYou call this a life? Day after day of the same humiliation. Day after day with no consideration of what it means to be a woman.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Bernstein started writing Trouble in Tahiti, less than tactfully, on his honeymoon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As both parody and indictment of mid-20th-century marriage, <em>Trouble in Tahiti</em> is bittersweet. To an audience today, the fantasy of a \u201clittle white house\u201d (\u201cParks for the kids, neighbourly butchers, less than an hour by train!\u201d) holds a piteous and elusive nostalgia. For Bernstein it was the here and now. He based some of the story on aspects of his own parents\u2019 unhappy marriage and started writing the work, less than tactfully, on his honeymoon. Very little happens in this one day of Sam and Dinah\u2019s life. They pursue their selfish loneliness and secret longings: movie-going (the title is that of a fictitious film), work, shopping, drinking, muscle-building. Inconceivably, they fail in their only important job: to attend their son\u2019s school play.</p> <p>As Dinah, the Irish-Canadian mezzo-soprano Wallis Giunta (who played the same role in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMv13VilDEA\">Opera North\u2019s memorable production</a>) excelled, musically versatile, physically daring and energetic. Sam, clean-cut and coldly handsome in business uniform flannel suit, is at once ambitious and a pathetic cipher, this enigmatic mix suggested deftly by the British baritone <a href=\"https://www.henryneill.co.uk/\">Henry Neill</a>.</p>    <p><em>A Quiet Place</em>, written towards the end of Bernstein\u2019s life and set 30 years later, is an overlong theatrical dud. This is no reflection on those involved, who performed every aspect to the highest level. Their commitment makes it worth seeing, not least for historical interest. The wordy text is by Stephen Wadsworth, the music a thorny, dissonant departure. If only Bernstein were alive to have another shot at it. (His wholesale revision, incorporating <em>A Quiet Place</em> into <em>Trouble in Tahiti</em>, occasionally staged, still left problems.)</p> <p>The first act is an agonising and unconvincing funeral scene \u2013 Dinah has died, intimated as suicide, in a car crash. In Annemarie Woods\u2019s unfussy and elegant designs, a sleek, black Rolls-Royce of a coffin sits, centre stage, in the funeral home. You can almost smell the embalming fluid. The older Sam, excellently interpreted by Grant Doyle, stands apart, silent throughout, looking furious. Lugubrious scenes of post-death clearing, misunderstanding and reconciliation follow. It is almost, but not quite, moving. Neill returns, brilliantly, as the grown-up Junior, prone to undressing at untimely moments \u2013 namely his mother\u2019s funeral. He now has a sister, Dede (the adroit and touching Rowan Pierce). Elgan Ll\u0177r Thomas, admirable as the thinly characterised but pivotal Fran\u00e7ois, and Nick Pritchard as the smarmy funeral director, lead the skilful ensemble cast.</p> <p>English National Opera\u2019s new production of Benjamin Britten\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.eno.org/whats-on/the-turn-of-the-screw/\">The Turn of the Screw</a> </strong>(1954), directed and designed by Isabella Bywater, is musically outstanding and looks striking. The \u201cbut\u201d comes in the overladen backstory, invented to give further bafflement to Henry James\u2019s enigmatic novella on which the opera is based. Britten\u2019s taut work is robust, and survives the removal to a 50s-style psychiatric hospital in which the Governess, who may or may not see ghosts, is confined. Much of the ambiguity evaporates, with nurses gliding around writing reports and a doctor ushering his deluded patient back to bed.</p>    <p>The score, admirably played by 13 ENO musicians and conducted by <a href=\"https://www.duncan-ward.co.uk/about\">Duncan Ward</a> in a first-rate ENO debut, remains startling, disturbingly intact. Elaborate projections, designed by Jon Driscoll, take us into the upstairs-downstairs world of Bly Manor, now a queasy, swirling flashback. The Governess\u2019s charges, Flora (Viktoria Nekhaenko) and Miles (Jerry Louth), appear to be in thrall to the late Peter Quint (Robert Murray) and his unwilling consort, Miss Jessel (Eleanor Dennis). Who knows what the housekeeper Mrs Grose (Gweneth Ann Rand) really thinks. With fine performances all round, and a stellar reading of the Governess by <a href=\"https://www.stevenswalesartists.com/artist/ailish-tynan/\">Ailish Tynan</a>, who managed to charm despite ghastly wig, peach cardigan and fluffy, hospital-garb slippers, ENO is on fighting form.</p>    <p>The <strong><a href=\"https://sinfoniaoflondon.com/\">Sinfonia of London</a></strong> and star conductor John Wilson would have earned their colours in the first half of their Barbican concert alone: a glitter of extrovert wit from Kenneth Hesketh\u2019s <em>PatterSongs</em> (2008); and Dmitri Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Concerto No 2, not so often played in the concert hall, here performed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/04/sheku-kanneh-mason-cellist-interview-last-night-proms\">Sheku Kanneh-Mason</a>. Supported by the quick-witted players, the cellist traversed every mood from poetic to jaunty to lyrical to fiery. What then followed, Sergei Rachmaninov\u2019s Symphony No 1, was at once prodigious and flummoxing.

      "bodyText": "Easy to forget that the American dream \u2013 the phrase dates from 1931 \u2013 was originally a quest for liberty and equality, not cars, washing machines and refrigerators. By the time Leonard Bernstein wrote his one-act opera Trouble in Tahiti (1952), mod cons had pushed lofty ideals out of the way. The sweet suburban life of Sam and Dinah, the married couple in the opera, \u201clooks\u201d like domestic bliss but feels awful, as Bernstein\u2019s own libretto puts it. Opening the Linbury theatre\u2019s new season, in a stylish and probing staging by Oliver Mears, conducted by Nicholas Chalmers, Trouble in Tahiti is paired with its more cumbersome sequel, A Quiet Place (1983). Both are in orchestrations, reduced and adapted, by Garth Edwin Sunderland, sparklingly played by unnamed soloists from the Royal Opera orchestra. With a nod to Kurt Weill, and paving the way for his own Candide and West Side Story, soon to follow, Trouble in Tahiti had already established Bernstein\u2019s distinctive flair. He embraced jazz harmonies, shoo-be-doo scat singing for the commentating trio (oddly amplified here but well sung) and colloquial dialogue. Sam and Dinah have everything, including affluence, psychiatrist, milliner, superior attitudes and an obedient child, Junior, who sees all but says nothing. Only happiness is absent. In one version of the text (Bernstein wrestled with the work), Dinah asks: \u201cYou call this a life? Day after day of the same humiliation. Day after day with no consideration of what it means to be a woman.\u201d As both parody and indictment of mid-20th-century marriage, Trouble in Tahiti is bittersweet. To an audience today, the fantasy of a \u201clittle white house\u201d (\u201cParks for the kids, neighbourly butchers, less than an hour by train!\u201d) holds a piteous and elusive nostalgia. For Bernstein it was the here and now. He based some of the story on aspects of his own parents\u2019 unhappy marriage and started writing the work, less than tactfully, on his honeymoon. Very little happens in this one day of Sam and Dinah\u2019s life. They pursue their selfish loneliness and secret longings: movie-going (the title is that of a fictitious film), work, shopping, drinking, muscle-building. Inconceivably, they fail in their only important job: to attend their son\u2019s school play. As Dinah, the Irish-Canadian mezzo-soprano Wallis Giunta (who played the same role in Opera North\u2019s memorable production) excelled, musically versatile, physically daring and energetic. Sam, clean-cut and coldly handsome in business uniform flannel suit, is at once ambitious and a pathetic cipher, this enigmatic mix suggested deftly by the British baritone Henry Neill. A Quiet Place, written towards the end of Bernstein\u2019s life and set 30 years later, is an overlong theatrical dud. This is no reflection on those involved, who performed every aspect to the highest level. Their commitment makes it worth seeing, not least for historical interest. The wordy text is by Stephen Wadsworth, the music a thorny, dissonant departure. If only Bernstein were alive to have another shot at it. (His wholesale revision, incorporating A Quiet Place into Trouble in Tahiti, occasionally staged, still left problems.) The first act is an agonising and unconvincing funeral scene \u2013 Dinah has died, intimated as suicide, in a car crash. In Annemarie Woods\u2019s unfussy and elegant designs, a sleek, black Rolls-Royce of a coffin sits, centre stage, in the funeral home. You can almost smell the embalming fluid. The older Sam, excellently interpreted by Grant Doyle, stands apart, silent throughout, looking furious. Lugubrious scenes of post-death clearing, misunderstanding and reconciliation follow. It is almost, but not quite, moving. Neill returns, brilliantly, as the grown-up Junior, prone to undressing at untimely moments \u2013 namely his mother\u2019s funeral. He now has a sister, Dede (the adroit and touching Rowan Pierce). Elgan Ll\u0177r Thomas, admirable as the thinly characterised but pivotal Fran\u00e7ois, and Nick Pritchard as the smarmy funeral director, lead the skilful ensemble cast. English National Opera\u2019s new production of Benjamin Britten\u2019s The Turn of the Screw (1954), directed and designed by Isabella Bywater, is musically outstanding and looks striking. The \u201cbut\u201d comes in the overladen backstory, invented to give further bafflement to Henry James\u2019s enigmatic novella on which the opera is based. Britten\u2019s taut work is robust, and survives the removal to a 50s-style psychiatric hospital in which the Governess, who may or may not see ghosts, is confined. Much of the ambiguity evaporates, with nurses gliding around writing reports and a doctor ushering his deluded patient back to bed. The score, admirably played by 13 ENO musicians and conducted by Duncan Ward in a first-rate ENO debut, remains startling, disturbingly intact. Elaborate projections, designed by Jon Driscoll, take us into the upstairs-downstairs world of Bly Manor, now a queasy, swirling flashback. The Governess\u2019s charges, Flora (Viktoria Nekhaenko) and Miles (Jerry Louth), appear to be in thrall to the late Peter Quint (Robert Murray) and his unwilling consort, Miss Jessel (Eleanor Dennis). Who knows what the housekeeper Mrs Grose (Gweneth Ann Rand) really thinks. With fine performances all round, and a stellar reading of the Governess by Ailish Tynan, who managed to charm despite ghastly wig, peach cardigan and fluffy, hospital-garb slippers, ENO is on fighting form. The Sinfonia of London and star conductor John Wilson would have earned their colours in the first half of their Barbican concert alone: a glitter of extrovert wit from Kenneth Hesketh\u2019s PatterSongs (2008); and Dmitri Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Concerto No 2, not so often played in the concert hall, here performed by Sheku Kanneh-Mason. Supported by the quick-witted players, the cellist traversed every mood from poetic to jaunty to lyrical to fiery. What then followed, Sergei Rachmaninov\u2019s Symphony No 1, was at once prodigious and flummoxing. How could a work so familiar \u2013 I am supposed to have half an idea about Rachmaninov \u2013 sound so wild, unfamiliar, revolutionary. These vigorous musicians almost launched themselves into the air as they played. Wilson himself, mostly economical in gesture, occasionally snaked into a bent-knee shimmy. If you were under the impression that classical music is staid, try this lot.

This time, it\u2019s a real&nbsp;decline.\u201d</p> <p>Drive along the granite city\u2019s Union Street and there are dozens of shuttered shops, some empty for almost a decade following one of the longest routs in the history of the oil market, which brought oil prices to lows of less than $30 (\u00a323) a barrel in 2016, less than half its value&nbsp;today.</p> <p>The capital of the UK\u2019s oil and gas industry has weathered the volatility of the global oil markets since the North Sea heyday in the 1970s; its fortunes tied to the rise and fall of the price of Brent crude. But it is now less than two weeks away from a reckoning with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who many expect to set out tax changes in the budget that could hasten the end of the North Sea industry and threaten the 200,000 jobs it supports.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re killing us,\u201d says Darren, 50, an oil rig worker for the past 22&nbsp;years. He declines to give his full name for fear of losing his job with a major oil company. \u201cThis government is going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/north-sea-oil-transition-plan\">do to the North Sea what Margaret Thatcher did to the mines</a>. We all know it: this is the end for the UK oil industry. We just don\u2019t know when.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jul/04/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-in-full\">stormed to power</a> in July with bold plans to end Britain\u2019s fossil fuel legacy and emerge as a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d. Within days of forming a government, the party confirmed the UK would bring an end to new licences for oil and gas projects.</p> <p>The decision has cemented Britain\u2019s climate leadership in a crucial decade for tackling rising carbon emissions \u2013 but this is cold comfort for workers such as Darren, a father of two, who fear for the future of their industry.</p> <p>\u201cImagine losing your job, losing the roof over your kids\u2019 heads, and all to save carbon emissions that are a drop in the ocean compared to China\u2019s? The best I can hope for is to hang on and perhaps in four years this government will be voted out,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>\u2018A multibillion-pound paradox\u2019</h2> <p>Alongside plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist\">ban new oil and gas licences</a>, Labour came to power with an election pledge to toughen the windfall tax regime put in place after a surge in market prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It promised to raise the energy profits levy by increasing the headline tax rate companies pay on their oil and gas profits by three percentage points, to 78%.</p> <p>Labour plans to use the higher taxes taken from the North Sea to help fund its ambition to turn the UK into a green energy \u201csuperpower\u201d in line with its goal of making the UK\u2019s electricity system net zero by 2030.</p> <p>The party also promised to close the \u201cloophole\u201d left by the previous government that enabled oil and gas firms to reduce their taxes through investment allowances. These allowances, which are commonplace in tax legislation, allow companies to deduct the value of their investments from their profits \u2013 enabling companies to pay less tax and offering incentive for further investment.</p> <p>The combined impact of higher headline taxes and lower tax relief risks devastating the sector\u2019s predicted investment over the second half of this decade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/02/north-sea-firms-windfall-tax-jobs-tax-receipts-risk\">according to the industry\u2019s trade association</a>, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK). It has warned that the changes could wipe out \u00a312bn in tax receipts and jeopardise 35,000 industry jobs.</p> <p>Stifel, an investment bank, believes that while the move would increase Treasury revenues in the short term, the wider economic impact would mean a sharp decline in takings from 2029 and the loss of 100,000 jobs in total.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a multibillion-pound paradox here,\u201d the bank said in a research note this year. \u201cAny further increases to the windfall tax take, especially through the removal of investment allowances, would result in substantially lower investment and, therefore, lower tax income for the UK, fewer jobs, loss of skills for the green transition, higher emissions, and the export of jobs, skills and the UK\u2019s energy security to other energy-producing countries.\u201d</p>    <p>The Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce has warned that the spectre of Labour\u2019s budget is being felt far beyond the energy sector. Its most recent quarterly economic survey of more than 5,000 companies showed that concerns over taxation had rocketed up the risk register; more than 60% of companies in the north-east of Scotland have cited the government\u2019s tax policies as a barrier to growth, up from 48% just three months ago.</p> <p>\u201cThe Treasury understands the potential impact,\u201d says Russell Borthwick, the chamber\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut I do wonder if they\u2019ve painted themselves into a difficult corner with these policies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is, there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/15/oil-price-falls-china-middle-east-brent-crude-opec\">no windfall profits being made</a> in the North Sea today. There was a short period of time when Russia invaded Ukraine and there were oil prices above $100 a barrel. But Celtic Football Club made bigger profits than our largest North Sea oil producers last year. It looks like they\u2019re now being singled out for political reasons, rather than fiscal reasons,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The wider regional economy is still \u201cinextricably linked to the oil and gas economy\u201d, which means the knock-on effect \u201cwill be felt from professional services to the retail industry to cab drivers. It will be more marked here than anywhere&nbsp;else.\u201d</p> <p>Gabby Robertson, 24, has worked in high-street fashion stores for four years and has noticed the decline of Aberdeen\u2019s retail sector, which was once flush with oil and gas money.</p> <p>\u201cWe used to have people come in and spend \u00a3400 to \u00a3500, but we see that a lot less now. People are coming in to buy single items or they tell us they\u2019ll have to come back at payday and ask about paying on Klarna (the buy now, pay later platform). It\u2019s still better here than on Union Street. Shops there have closed and there\u2019s nothing to replace them. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for small businesses to survive,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Economic catastrophe is not inevitable. Most of the gloomier projections cited by the industry assume that all investment allowances will be scrapped, although this has not been explicitly proposed by the government. The industry is hoping that some allowances remain intact to help prolong investment in the declining industry and allow its workers the chance to transition to Britain\u2019s low-carbon future.</p> <h2>\u2018Where is the transition?\u2019</h2> <p>At a busy heliport near Aberdeen airport, dozens of rig workers wait to board the helicopters that will take them up to 100 miles off the Scottish coast to the giant oil and gas platforms that extract the UK\u2019s fossil fuels.</p> <p>Most will work 12- to 13-hour days offshore for three weeks, before returning to their homes in Scotland and the north of England for a three-week break. On this grey October day, bad weather has kept many helicopters on the ground, and talk of the government\u2019s upcoming budget has darkened the mood.</p> <p>One oil rig worker, aged 53, who asked not to be named, has travelled to Aberdeen from his home in Lincolnshire each month for the past 30 years to work in the North Sea. After only a five-day break, he has returned for a one-week stint as part of his plan \u201cto fit in more work while it\u2019s around\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf Rachel Reeves does increase taxes for the North Sea then that\u2019s another hit to the pockets of the oil companies that operate here. Harbour Energy, one of the biggest players, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-65178626\">let 350 people go </a>as part of a restructuring last year. I had hoped to keep working until I\u2019m 60 but if I can get another five years I should be OK,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the beginning of the end,\u201d says Bob, 52. \u201cPlatforms that could have kept producing for years longer will shut. The one I work on will close in two years. It\u2019s been 12 years that I\u2019ve been working on the rigs after the refinery I worked at was left to close. I\u2019ll be OK because I\u2019ve had a long career but I think about the guys with young families who could lose their jobs and it just doesn\u2019t seem right.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems crazy to me that the North Sea faces windfall taxes but the likes of Amazon can get away with paying very little. Shouldn\u2019t it be the same for all companies across the country? Isn\u2019t that&nbsp;fair?\u201d</p> <p>Paul, a rig worker from Dundee, is one of many who fear that Britain\u2019s plans to transition to a green economy will leave behind those who helped to build the fossil fuel economy of the past. \u201cWhat I would ask the government is this: what\u2019s the proposed solution to the problem that all this is going to create? They talk about a green transition but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/20/unions-lobbying-labour-just-transition-cleaner-energy-north-sea\">where\u2019s the transition for us</a>? All I hear is \u2018woke\u2019 jargon.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s plan to safeguard a \u201cjust transition\u201d for Britain\u2019s fossil fuel workers took a step forward last week with plans to launch a \u201cskills passport\u201d to help oil and gas workers to move into jobs in renewables such as offshore wind. From early next year, the passport, which will be overseen by industry bodies RenewableUK and OEUK, with the support of the UK and Scottish governments, aims to align standards, recognise transferable skills and qualifications such as oil and gas safety standards, and map out career pathways for suitable roles.</p> <p>About 90% of oil and gas workers have transferable skills for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/25/offshore-wind-to-power-20m-homes-within-five-years-starmer-to-pledge\">offshore renewable jobs</a>, according to OEUK \u2013 but not everyone is eager to make the switch. Barry, an oil worker in his late 30s, says he has \u201cabsolutely no interest\u201d in retraining to work in Britain\u2019s burgeoning offshore wind sector. For a start, the work is seasonal \u2013 with most maintenance taking place in the summer months. The pay is also not quite as good, he says.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s just not for me, I don\u2019t like heights,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIf I had plans to stay in the North Sea I\u2019d be worried. But I think I\u2019m going to go out to work in Qatar. I\u2019m not the one you need to worry about; I can leave the North Sea and work somewhere else. These big oil companies can leave the North Sea and work somewhere else. But the services firms \u2013 the supply chains serving the North Sea \u2013 which can\u2019t leave are the ones who are going to feel the pain.\u201d</p>    <h2>A green Aberdeen?</h2> <p>Like many oil workers, larger supply chain and oilfield service firms have already begun to eye the new oil and gas frontiers in the Middle East, Africa and South America as the UK\u2019s reserves dwindle.</p> <p>The loss of skills and resources that could be put to use helping to meet the UK\u2019s green energy ambitions is a major concern for industry observers. At the same time, smaller firms without an international reach risk going bust if the gap between the end of Britain\u2019s fossil fuel era and the full economic benefits of its green future becomes too wide.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an issue unite the trade unions, businesses, public sector and academics quite like this one,\u201d Borthwick says. \u201cWe\u2019re in danger of losing our industrial supply chains to overseas oil and gas projects before there\u2019s a chance for them to benefit from the opportunities of the green&nbsp;economy.\u201d</p> <p>The answer, according to Borthwick, is to allow more breathing room for the oil companies to keep investing in their existing projects while the industry winds down, while speeding up the green agenda to provide a future for the region\u2019s small businesses.</p> <p>The government\u2019s public energy company, GB Energy, which will be headquartered in Aberdeen, could use its \u201cconvening power\u201d to build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/02/aberdeen-p-and-j-live-art-gallery-revamp-bid-to-reinvent-city\">a home for green industries</a> in the city, he says. \u201cWe want that ecosystem. We want green companies to believe that Aberdeen is the place that they need to be.\u201d</p> <p>Reimagining Aberdeen as a green hub could prove to be the next chapter for a city uniquely poised at the centre of Britain\u2019s energy transition. It is a reinvention the city is ready for, says Borthwick.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Aberdeen used to be a very serious place; but we\u2019re changing. We\u2019ve started to break out of the greyness of our granite past. It\u2019s like we\u2019re waking up. We\u2019re relearning who we are,\u201d he says.</p>",

The capital of the UK\u2019s oil and gas industry has weathered the volatility of the global oil markets since the North Sea heyday in the 1970s; its fortunes tied to the rise and fall of the price of Brent crude. But it is now less than two weeks away from a reckoning with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who many expect to set out tax changes in the budget that could hasten the end of the North Sea industry and threaten the 200,000 jobs it supports. \u201cThey\u2019re killing us,\u201d says Darren, 50, an oil rig worker for the past 22 years. He declines to give his full name for fear of losing his job with a major oil company. \u201cThis government is going to do to the North Sea what Margaret Thatcher did to the mines. We all know it: this is the end for the UK oil industry. We just don\u2019t know when.\u201d The Labour party stormed to power in July with bold plans to end Britain\u2019s fossil fuel legacy and emerge as a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d. Within days of forming a government, the party confirmed the UK would bring an end to new licences for oil and gas projects. The decision has cemented Britain\u2019s climate leadership in a crucial decade for tackling rising carbon emissions \u2013 but this is cold comfort for workers such as Darren, a father of two, who fear for the future of their industry. \u201cImagine losing your job, losing the roof over your kids\u2019 heads, and all to save carbon emissions that are a drop in the ocean compared to China\u2019s? The best I can hope for is to hang on and perhaps in four years this government will be voted out,\u201d he says. \u2018A multibillion-pound paradox\u2019 Alongside plans to ban new oil and gas licences, Labour came to power with an election pledge to toughen the windfall tax regime put in place after a surge in market prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It promised to raise the energy profits levy by increasing the headline tax rate companies pay on their oil and gas profits by three percentage points, to 78%. Labour plans to use the higher taxes taken from the North Sea to help fund its ambition to turn the UK into a green energy \u201csuperpower\u201d in line with its goal of making the UK\u2019s electricity system net zero by 2030. The party also promised to close the \u201cloophole\u201d left by the previous government that enabled oil and gas firms to reduce their taxes through investment allowances. These allowances, which are commonplace in tax legislation, allow companies to deduct the value of their investments from their profits \u2013 enabling companies to pay less tax and offering incentive for further investment. The combined impact of higher headline taxes and lower tax relief risks devastating the sector\u2019s predicted investment over the second half of this decade, according to the industry\u2019s trade association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK). It has warned that the changes could wipe out \u00a312bn in tax receipts and jeopardise 35,000 industry jobs. Stifel, an investment bank, believes that while the move would increase Treasury revenues in the short term, the wider economic impact would mean a sharp decline in takings from 2029 and the loss of 100,000 jobs in total. \u201cThere is a multibillion-pound paradox here,\u201d the bank said in a research note this year. \u201cAny further increases to the windfall tax take, especially through the removal of investment allowances, would result in substantially lower investment and, therefore, lower tax income for the UK, fewer jobs, loss of skills for the green transition, higher emissions, and the export of jobs, skills and the UK\u2019s energy security to other energy-producing countries.\u201d The Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce has warned that the spectre of Labour\u2019s budget is being felt far beyond the energy sector. Its most recent quarterly economic survey of more than 5,000 companies showed that concerns over taxation had rocketed up the risk register; more than 60% of companies in the north-east of Scotland have cited the government\u2019s tax policies as a barrier to growth, up from 48% just three months ago. \u201cThe Treasury understands the potential impact,\u201d says Russell Borthwick, the chamber\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut I do wonder if they\u2019ve painted themselves into a difficult corner with these policies.\u201d \u201cThe fact is, there are no windfall profits being made in the North Sea today. There was a short period of time when Russia invaded Ukraine and there were oil prices above $100 a barrel. But Celtic Football Club made bigger profits than our largest North Sea oil producers last year. It looks like they\u2019re now being singled out for political reasons, rather than fiscal reasons,\u201d he says. The wider regional economy is still \u201cinextricably linked to the oil and gas economy\u201d, which means the knock-on effect \u201cwill be felt from professional services to the retail industry to cab drivers. It will be more marked here than anywhere else.\u201d Gabby Robertson, 24, has worked in high-street fashion stores for four years and has noticed the decline of Aberdeen\u2019s retail sector, which was once flush with oil and gas money. \u201cWe used to have people come in and spend \u00a3400 to \u00a3500, but we see that a lot less now. People are coming in to buy single items or they tell us they\u2019ll have to come back at payday and ask about paying on Klarna (the buy now, pay later platform). It\u2019s still better here than on Union Street. Shops there have closed and there\u2019s nothing to replace them. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for small businesses to survive,\u201d she says. Economic catastrophe is not inevitable. Most of the gloomier projections cited by the industry assume that all investment allowances will be scrapped, although this has not been explicitly proposed by the government. The industry is hoping that some allowances remain intact to help prolong investment in the declining industry and allow its workers the chance to transition to Britain\u2019s low-carbon future. \u2018Where is the transition?\u2019 At a busy heliport near Aberdeen airport, dozens of rig workers wait to board the helicopters that will take them up to 100 miles off the Scottish coast to the giant oil and gas platforms that extract the UK\u2019s fossil fuels. Most will work 12- to 13-hour days offshore for three weeks, before returning to their homes in Scotland and the north of England for a three-week break. On this grey October day, bad weather has kept many helicopters on the ground, and talk of the government\u2019s upcoming budget has darkened the mood. One oil rig worker, aged 53, who asked not to be named, has travelled to Aberdeen from his home in Lincolnshire each month for the past 30 years to work in the North Sea. After only a five-day break, he has returned for a one-week stint as part of his plan \u201cto fit in more work while it\u2019s around\u201d. \u201cIf Rachel Reeves does increase taxes for the North Sea then that\u2019s another hit to the pockets of the oil companies that operate here. Harbour Energy, one of the biggest players, let 350 people go as part of a restructuring last year. I had hoped to keep working until I\u2019m 60 but if I can get another five years I should be OK,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the beginning of the end,\u201d says Bob, 52. \u201cPlatforms that could have kept producing for years longer will shut. The one I work on will close in two years. It\u2019s been 12 years that I\u2019ve been working on the rigs after the refinery I worked at was left to close. I\u2019ll be OK because I\u2019ve had a long career but I think about the guys with young families who could lose their jobs and it just doesn\u2019t seem right. \u201cIt seems crazy to me that the North Sea faces windfall taxes but the likes of Amazon can get away with paying very little. Shouldn\u2019t it be the same for all companies across the country? Isn\u2019t that fair?\u201d Paul, a rig worker from Dundee, is one of many who fear that Britain\u2019s plans to transition to a green economy will leave behind those who helped to build the fossil fuel economy of the past. \u201cWhat I would ask the government is this: what\u2019s the proposed solution to the problem that all this is going to create? They talk about a green transition but where\u2019s the transition for us? All I hear is \u2018woke\u2019 jargon.\u201d The government\u2019s plan to safeguard a \u201cjust transition\u201d for Britain\u2019s fossil fuel workers took a step forward last week with plans to launch a \u201cskills passport\u201d to help oil and gas workers to move into jobs in renewables such as offshore wind. From early next year, the passport, which will be overseen by industry bodies RenewableUK and OEUK, with the support of the UK and Scottish governments, aims to align standards, recognise transferable skills and qualifications such as oil and gas safety standards, and map out career pathways for suitable roles. About 90% of oil and gas workers have transferable skills for offshore renewable jobs, according to OEUK \u2013 but not everyone is eager to make the switch. Barry, an oil worker in his late 30s, says he has \u201cabsolutely no interest\u201d in retraining to work in Britain\u2019s burgeoning offshore wind sector. For a start, the work is seasonal \u2013 with most maintenance taking place in the summer months. The pay is also not quite as good, he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just not for me, I don\u2019t like heights,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIf I had plans to stay in the North Sea I\u2019d be worried. But I think I\u2019m going to go out to work in Qatar. I\u2019m not the one you need to worry about; I can leave the North Sea and work somewhere else. These big oil companies can leave the North Sea and work somewhere else. But the services firms \u2013 the supply chains serving the North Sea \u2013 which can\u2019t leave are the ones who are going to feel the pain.\u201d A green Aberdeen? Like many oil workers, larger supply chain and oilfield service firms have already begun to eye the new oil and gas frontiers in the Middle East, Africa and South America as the UK\u2019s reserves dwindle. The loss of skills and resources that could be put to use helping to meet the UK\u2019s green energy ambitions is a major concern for industry observers. At the same time, smaller firms without an international reach risk going bust if the gap between the end of Britain\u2019s fossil fuel era and the full economic benefits of its green future becomes too wide. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an issue unite the trade unions, businesses, public sector and academics quite like this one,\u201d Borthwick says. \u201cWe\u2019re in danger of losing our industrial supply chains to overseas oil and gas projects before there\u2019s a chance for them to benefit from the opportunities of the green economy.\u201d The answer, according to Borthwick, is to allow more breathing room for the oil companies to keep investing in their existing projects while the industry winds down, while speeding up the green agenda to provide a future for the region\u2019s small businesses. The government\u2019s public energy company, GB Energy, which will be headquartered in Aberdeen, could use its \u201cconvening power\u201d to build a home for green industries in the city, he says. \u201cWe want that ecosystem. We want green companies to believe that Aberdeen is the place that they need to be.\u201d Reimagining Aberdeen as a green hub could prove to be the next chapter for a city uniquely poised at the centre of Britain\u2019s energy transition. It is a reinvention the city is ready for, says Borthwick. \u201cYou know, Aberdeen used to be a very serious place; but we\u2019re changing. We\u2019ve started to break out of the greyness of our granite past. It\u2019s like we\u2019re waking up. We\u2019re relearning who we are,\u201d he says.",

      "body": "<p>In many countries around the world, breakfast TV means cele\u00adbrity interviews, soap operas and last night\u2019s football highlights. On the German-language channel 3sat this Sunday morning, it means a one-hour philosophical discussion on trauma psychology, followed by a book review programme and a classical concert by the Munich Radio Orchestra.</p> <p>The collaboration between public broadcasters in Austria, Germany and Switzerland is a unique experi\u00adment in pan-European broadcasting that has defied doubters for almost four decades: highbrow television.</p> <p>Yet whether 3sat will get to cele\u00adbrate its 40th anniversary this De\u00adcember is in serious doubt. At a summit in Leipzig this week, the heads of Germany\u2019s 16 federal states will consider a proposal to close the world\u2019s most donnish TV station by merging it \u201cpartially or completely\u201d into Arte, the Franco-German culture channel that is embarking on a Europe-wide expansion.</p> <p>Admirers of 3sat\u2019s resolute intellectualism say the merger plans are a sign that authorities are bowing to populist attacks on public service broadcasting, by cutting culture programming that may appear painless but which is also unlikely to save much money. A petition to save the channel has been signed by 140,000 people including the film director Wim Wenders and actor Sandra H\u00fcller.</p> <p>But the debate over 3sat\u2019s future also raises questions over the reformability of Germany\u2019s public broadcasting system, which has one the biggest budgets in the world but is also one of the most complex and decentralised.</p> <p>3sat was launched in 1984 as an antidote to what the then head of Austria\u2019s public broadcaster bemoaned as the \u201c\u00adfeeble-mindedness\u201d of mainstream television. The bulk of its content is provided by the two main German public broadcasting channels, ARD and ZDF, with Austria\u2019s ORF contributing 25% and Switzerland\u2019s SRG supplying 10% of its programming.</p> <p>\u201cTo make a daily <em>feuilleton </em>[arts and ideas] programme for tele\u00advision was something no one else dared do,\u201d says the journalist and philosopher Gert Scobel, who presents several of the channel\u2019s flagship shows. \u201cEveryone told us we would last only three weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Among its mainstays are Scobel\u2019s science programme <em>Nano</em> and the culture news programme <em>Kultur</em><em>zeit</em>, which go out during mornings and evenings each weekday, as well as themed days on subjects as diverse as the dramatist Bertolt Brecht, Afghan history and genetics. It is the only channel to show all the three countries\u2019 main news programmes, and to live-broadcast the two-week-plus Theatertreffen festival in Berlin and readings from the three-day Bachmannpreis poetry competition in Klagenfurt.</p> <p>Scobel says: \u201cI tell the guests on my show that each programme only has one aim \u2013 to leave viewers smarter than they were before, and that they approach each subject from different directions with the aim of finding a solution.\u201d</p>    <p>3sat\u2019s market share is only about 1% in each of the three collaborating countries, though with 90m German-language households, its viewing figures are considerable. The channel costs German public broadcasters around \u20ac92m a year, roughly the same as the German children\u2019s TV channel Kika.</p> <p>But, as in other countries across Europe, Germany is facing an increasingly acrimonious debate over state-funded public service broadcasting. The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has vowed to shrink the public broadcasters down to a tenth of their current size, scrap the compulsory licence fee and finance the remaining offering with a tax on streaming giants such as Amazon and Netflix.</p> <p>Where the popu\u00adlist right is buoyant, centrist parties have fallen in line: in Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat state premiers have in the past few years tried to block plans for a licence fee rise.</p> <p>From 2025, people registered in Germany face a monthly licence fee of \u20ac18.94 (\u00a315.78), slightly higher than its equivalent in the UK (\u00a314.12). France scrapped its licence fee altogether in 2022. In multilingual Switzerland, the fee is higher still at SFr27.91 (\u00a324.73) and there is political pressure to cut back spending on public service television.</p> <p>High-minded 3sat could become the sacrificial lamb on the altar of the populist zeitgeist.

      "bodyText": "In many countries around the world, breakfast TV means celebrity interviews, soap operas and last night\u2019s football highlights. On the German-language channel 3sat this Sunday morning, it means a one-hour philosophical discussion on trauma psychology, followed by a book review programme and a classical concert by the Munich Radio Orchestra. The collaboration between public broadcasters in Austria, Germany and Switzerland is a unique experiment in pan-European broadcasting that has defied doubters for almost four decades: highbrow television. Yet whether 3sat will get to celebrate its 40th anniversary this December is in serious doubt. At a summit in Leipzig this week, the heads of Germany\u2019s 16 federal states will consider a proposal to close the world\u2019s most donnish TV station by merging it \u201cpartially or completely\u201d into Arte, the Franco-German culture channel that is embarking on a Europe-wide expansion. Admirers of 3sat\u2019s resolute intellectualism say the merger plans are a sign that authorities are bowing to populist attacks on public service broadcasting, by cutting culture programming that may appear painless but which is also unlikely to save much money. A petition to save the channel has been signed by 140,000 people including the film director Wim Wenders and actor Sandra H\u00fcller. But the debate over 3sat\u2019s future also raises questions over the reformability of Germany\u2019s public broadcasting system, which has one the biggest budgets in the world but is also one of the most complex and decentralised. 3sat was launched in 1984 as an antidote to what the then head of Austria\u2019s public broadcaster bemoaned as the \u201cfeeble-mindedness\u201d of mainstream television. The bulk of its content is provided by the two main German public broadcasting channels, ARD and ZDF, with Austria\u2019s ORF contributing 25% and Switzerland\u2019s SRG supplying 10% of its programming. \u201cTo make a daily feuilleton [arts and ideas] programme for television was something no one else dared do,\u201d says the journalist and philosopher Gert Scobel, who presents several of the channel\u2019s flagship shows. \u201cEveryone told us we would last only three weeks.\u201d Among its mainstays are Scobel\u2019s science programme Nano and the culture news programme Kulturzeit, which go out during mornings and evenings each weekday, as well as themed days on subjects as diverse as the dramatist Bertolt Brecht, Afghan history and genetics. It is the only channel to show all the three countries\u2019 main news programmes, and to live-broadcast the two-week-plus Theatertreffen festival in Berlin and readings from the three-day Bachmannpreis poetry competition in Klagenfurt. Scobel says: \u201cI tell the guests on my show that each programme only has one aim \u2013 to leave viewers smarter than they were before, and that they approach each subject from different directions with the aim of finding a solution.\u201d 3sat\u2019s market share is only about 1% in each of the three collaborating countries, though with 90m German-language households, its viewing figures are considerable. The channel costs German public broadcasters around \u20ac92m a year, roughly the same as the German children\u2019s TV channel Kika. But, as in other countries across Europe, Germany is facing an increasingly acrimonious debate over state-funded public service broadcasting. The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has vowed to shrink the public broadcasters down to a tenth of their current size, scrap the compulsory licence fee and finance the remaining offering with a tax on streaming giants such as Amazon and Netflix. Where the populist right is buoyant, centrist parties have fallen in line: in Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat state premiers have in the past few years tried to block plans for a licence fee rise. From 2025, people registered in Germany face a monthly licence fee of \u20ac18.94 (\u00a315.78), slightly higher than its equivalent in the UK (\u00a314.12). France scrapped its licence fee altogether in 2022. In multilingual Switzerland, the fee is higher still at SFr27.91 (\u00a324.73) and there is political pressure to cut back spending on public service television. High-minded 3sat could become the sacrificial lamb on the altar of the populist zeitgeist. Swiss broadcaster SRF said it would not comment on German proposals to close the jointly funded channel. Only Austria\u2019s ORF said it would seek an \u201cintense exchange\u201d with its partners on the station\u2019s future, insisting it was \u201cessential\u201d that its marquee TV productions reach an international audience. Not all criticism of 3sat is motivated by populist rabble-rousing. The channel\u2019s budget has been salami-sliced for years and its schedule increasingly includes reruns of period dramas, crime shows and wildlife documentaries. \u201cA lot of the original programmes produced by 3sat deserved to be protected, but are we sure we need them all in a separate channel?\u201d asks Stefan Niggemeier, a German journalist and media commentator. Its shortcomings are exposed by comparison with the Franco-German culture broadcaster Arte, which presents itself less and less as a linear TV channel and more and more as an arts-focused streaming platform, a \u201cNetflix for the educated classes\u201d, as the broadsheet Die Zeit has called it. Established via a treaty between France and Germany in 1990, six years after the birth of 3sat, Arte has gained considerable momentum in recent years after the French president Emmanuel Macron proposed developing it into a \u201cEuropean platform\u201d. Over the past six years, it has added offerings of programmes subtitled or dubbed into Polish, Italian, Spanish and English. \u201cBecause Arte had to straddle a language barrier, it was always under more pressure to develop its own identity and come up with original ideas,\u201d says Niggemeier. \u201cArte has managed to stay cool, while 3sat feels like a magazine for linear television.\u201d He doubts that politicians will close the German-speaking world\u2019s most erudite TV channel in the immediate future. \u201cBut in the long-term, I think it\u2019s right to ask how we can change it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On one summer night in Ontario, a Canadian Sikh activist received a panicked call from his wife: police had come to the family home and warned her that his life was at risk. Two weeks later and thousands of kilometers away, a gunman in the province of British Columbia filmed himself firing a volley of bullets into the home of a prominent Indo-Canadian singer as two vehicles burned in the driveway. Both instances \u2013 together with a string of arsons, extortion schemes, drive-by shootings and at least two murders \u2013 are now believed to be part of a wide-ranging and violent campaign of intimidation across Canada orchestrated by India\u2019s government. Last September, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, suggested there were \u201ccredible allegations potentially linking\u201d Indian officials with the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and Sikh activist, who was shot dead in British Columbia. Until recently, the scope and depth of those allegations were not clear. This week, however, Canadian police made the explosive accusation that Indian diplomats had worked with a criminal network led by a notorious imprisoned gangster to target Sikh dissidents in the country. India rejected the allegations as \u201cstrange\u201d and \u201cludicrous\u201d. But Canadian officials point to a string of cases over the past few years they suspect are part of a broader, India-sanctioned campaign to intimidate, coerce and kill. In September 2023, only two days after Trudeau\u2019s initial suggestion of a link to the Indian government, a fugitive Indian gangster called Sukhdool Singh Gill was killed in a hail of gunfire in a Winnipeg home. Gill, a member of the Bambiha gang, was wanted in India on charges of extortion, attempted murder and murder. But Indian officials also said he was also linked to the separatist Khalistan movement, which aspires to establish a Sikh homeland in Punjab. Inderjeet Brar, who lived nearby, says he and his wife heard nearly a dozen shots fired that morning and footage from a security camera facing his backyard captured three men fleeing Gill\u2019s house. A year later, police on Vancouver Island were called to the house of AP Dhillon, a prominent singer and producer who was born in Punjab and grew up Canada. The building had been peppered with gunfire, and two vehicles were charred ruins. Footage of the attack \u2013 apparently filmed by one of the assailants \u2013 was later posted online and shared widely in India. The British Columbia public safety minister called the attack \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d. Both attacks were claimed by members of a notorious gang run by India\u2019s most feared crime boss, Lawrence Bishnoi, whose network has been linked to some of the most high-profile crimes in the country \u2013 despite the fact that Bishnoi has been imprisoned since 2014. Canadian police say the government of Narendra Modi has been using organized crime syndicates such as the Bishnoi gang, as part of its strategy to pursue opponents and rivals. \u201cThere can be overlapping motivations to target certain people or groups,\u201d said Harjeet Singh Grewal, an assistant professor of Sikh studies at the University of Calgary. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now: overlapping interests for both the gangs \u2013 who might want to settle scores and gain an \u2018economic benefit\u2019 \u2013 and [the Indian government, which is] targeting activists.\u201d In the case of Dhillon, whose stardom spans multiple countries, a recent decision to feature Bollywood star Salman Khan in a music video apparently angered Bishnoi, who has pledged to kill the actor over a longstanding feud. Grewal says Dhillon also lent his support to Punjabi farmers during their months-long protest in 2021, with Indian media suggesting his song Farmer spread \u201cpro-Khalistan\u201d messages that angered the Modi government. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep tradition in Punjabi music and lyrics that speak to the powers that be about disenfranchisement,\u201d said Grewal. \u201cSome of these artists [in India] who spread these messages are now dead \u2013 and their deaths are connected to crime syndicates.\u201d A 2022 report from Canada\u2019s intelligence agency flagged a growing concern over organized crime, warning gangs with entrenched operations represented a \u201csignificant\u201d public safety and societal threat. \u201cTheir structure and membership are increasingly fluid, often creating opportunistic criminal relationships with national and international networks and associates,\u201d the report said. Trudeau made an explicit connection between Bishnoi and the Indian government during his testimony at a commission investigating foreign interference this week. But for those living close to the violence, links between the Indian government and organized crime doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. \u201cI think there\u2019s a way in which Modi helps the Bishnoi gang and the Bishnoi gang helps Modi,\u201d said Brar. \u201cIf Bishnoi is giving interviews and overseeing his gang from a jail cell, it means the government is likely involved in some way. Otherwise, how could he do this?\u201d Brar turned his video footage over to the police, but now worries his family could face recriminations when they visit India. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to go about our lives and yet we worry if we too will pay some cost for speaking up,\u201d he said. India has long accused the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but is more prevalent among the diaspora in Canada. New Delhi has argued that Canada has for decades failed to confront what it says are Sikh militants and failed to extradite gang members for prosecution at home. But experts say that India\u2019s rapid rise from developing nation to global superpower has also come with a growing sense it can act with relative impunity \u2013 both domestically and outside its borders. Earlier this year, the increasingly pugnacious Indian prime minister made an extraordinary public boast that he was able to extract retribution for dissent, saying: \u201cToday, even India\u2019s enemies know: this is Modi, this is the New India.

The Guardian has spoken with four people who have received such warnings, all of whom describe tightlipped police operating on \u201ccredible\u201d evidence of possible attempts on their lives. Inderjeet Singh Gosal, a close friend of Nijjar, received a panicked call form his wife while he was traveling: police were at their house, with a message that his life was in danger. Gosal, who took over efforts to hold a global, non-binding referendum as part of an effort to create the Sikh homeland of Khalistan after his \u201cbrother\u201d Nijjar was killed last year, says there is little doubt India is behind the threats. \u201cWhen I stepped into this role and over this activism, I knew there was a moment when they\u2019d come after me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop.

James says it has taken the squad no time to adapt to their new coaching team. \u201cShe\u2019s very focused, passionate and direct.

She is determined to rise above it and let those horrible experiences fuel her on the pitch. \u201cI just try to let my feet talk and hopefully let my success do that,\u201d James says. \u201cHaving the right support network around you helps you keep on track and try to block out the noise.

      "bodyText": "The one-on-one shooting drills have concluded, the coaches are collecting the footballs and maybe some of the watching parents are keen to get back inside in the warm, but none of these young players want to go anywhere just yet. A long, eager queue has formed. They all want their picture taken first with the England forward Lauren James. \u201cSometimes I forget how many people look up to me,\u201d says James, pleasantly surprised, after helping out with the grassroots session at Worcester Park in south-west London. Perhaps it is also easy for the rest of us to forget that the Chelsea No 10, who has played 24 times for the Lionesses, only recently turned 23. James is friendly yet rather shy, appearing slightly nervous as she sits down inside one of the ground\u2019s wooden dugouts for an exclusive interview. It is evident she enjoys putting on a performance in front of tens of thousands of people in a stadium more than holding a microphone. On Sunday, another performance will be expected as Chelsea meet Tottenham at Kingsmeadow. On this Tuesday afternoon, however, a jovial and happy James talks freely. Happy, first because she has got a new puppy, a male cockapoo called Waffle \u2013 \u201ca puppy is probably harder than a kid,\u201d jokes James, who has grown up with dogs. And because she has just helped Chelsea win at the Emirates Stadium for the first time in the Women\u2019s Super League, continuing their 100% winning start under their new manager, Sonia Bompastor. \u201cSometimes change can go one of two ways but it\u2019s been good so far; I\u2019m happy and Chelsea are happy,\u201d James says of the impact the Frenchwoman has made at the club since replacing the long-serving Emma Hayes. James says it has taken the squad no time to adapt to their new coaching team. \u201cShe\u2019s very focused, passionate and direct. Sonia is just bringing in her qualities and adding it to our own qualities. Hopefully with the combination of those, we can achieve good things. Hopefully we can try to win the Champions League.\u201d Taking that next step to lift an elusive first European title is a target that nobody at Chelsea has been coy about this season, and would be a dream come true for James, who has achieved no shortage of success at the club since her 2021 switch from Manchester United, winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award in 2023 and being named as Chelsea\u2019s Player of the Year last season after retaining the Women\u2019s Super League title. Behind the scenes, it has not been as easy as it looks, though. James has been on the receiving end of sickening racist abuse online on multiple occasions. She is determined to rise above it and let those horrible experiences fuel her on the pitch. \u201cI just try to let my feet talk and hopefully let my success do that,\u201d James says. \u201cHaving the right support network around you helps you keep on track and try to block out the noise. Family and friends, they just keep you on the ground and keep your head sane.\u201d James is speaking after a McDonald\u2019s Fun Football session, having this year become an ambassador for the programme that delivers free coaching to children aged five to 11. In 2024 the programme adjusted its centre locations to ensure that 80% of the lowest income urban areas in the UK have access to the sessions, and James wanted to get involved to be a \u201crole model to kids who have barriers\u201d. She says: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see kids smiling and having access. It\u2019s inclusive and, no matter what your background is, you can play football, and it\u2019s a step closer to people being able to reach their dreams.\u201d That desire to help youngsters from underprivileged backgrounds was also behind James\u2019s launch of her LJ10 scholarship scheme in September, which provides help to aspiring players from diverse backgrounds. \u201cFor kids that have potential or aren\u2019t getting seen or have barriers, perhaps not being able to fund kit or get to training, I\u2019ve been pleased to support them,\u201d she says. James knows football still has lots of work to do around diversity but says: \u201cIt\u2019s going in the right direction. There still can be improvements, but I do think it\u2019s on the right track.\u201d The more success she has, the more she hopes to inspire, especially with the Lionesses, pointing to substantial increases in girls playing football after England\u2019s triumph at the European Championship in 2022. James was yet to make her international debut when that tournament on home soil came around, injuries in the 2021-22 season meaning it came too soon for her.

But then I met Jack.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Jack had a reputation for being quite promiscuous, and I didn\u2019t want to be another notch on his bedpost</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of the first and most important things to mention about Jack, is that he is exceptionally hot. I first spotted him across the room, at a queer event, and was completely transfixed. He has&nbsp;gorgeous puppy eyes, floppy hair and a little earring. He\u2019s trans too, and&nbsp;has been taking testosterone for a&nbsp;few years.<br><br>We spent the next six months forming a sexually charged friendship, but I was wary. Jack had a&nbsp;reputation for being quite promiscuous, and I didn\u2019t want to be just another notch on his bedpost. I was also a little afraid of sex at that time. I hadn\u2019t dated for years and only previously had sex with cisgendered men. Eventually Jack confessed his feelings for me, and we ended up making out.<br><br>I needn\u2019t have worried, because the&nbsp;sex \u2013 when it came \u2013 was electric. In my experience, the average cisgendered guy only knows how to do&nbsp;about three things in bed. There\u2019s a&nbsp;lot of jack hammering, and about five minutes of foreplay if you\u2019re lucky. But&nbsp;having sex as two trans guys is so&nbsp;much more open and expansive. I&nbsp;feel as if I can tell Jack any of my fantasies and there would never be any&nbsp;judgment. There are so many imaginative configurations \u2026 the possibilities feel endless.</p> <h2><strong>Jack</strong><strong>, 32</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before I met Ben, I had been having a lot of casual sex \u2013 but often I wouldn\u2019t feel entirely present</p> </blockquote> <p>I remember locking eyes with Ben at a&nbsp;pub around a year ago and feeling a bit weak at the knees. He was wearing this flamboyant velvet shirt, with several buttons undone to show off&nbsp;his&nbsp;chest. I managed to secure a&nbsp;follow-up date by the end of the night. We watched The Lord of the Rings together, then talked for a bit about how&nbsp;hot Aragorn is. We both agreed there\u2019s something homoerotic about buff men wielding big, shiny swords.<br><br>There was undeniable chemistry between us, but for the first six months I was shy about telling Ben how I felt. In retrospect, I\u2019m grateful we didn\u2019t rush in. In the year before I&nbsp;met Ben, I had been having a lot of casual sex \u2013 but often when I was actually in the middle of a sex act, I&nbsp;wouldn\u2019t feel entirely present. I&nbsp;was&nbsp;out as a trans man but I often struggled to fully inhabit my body. Having top surgery made me feel more at home in myself, but Ben\u2019s friendship also helped, because he made me feel understood. During the time we spent watching movies on his sofa, I was building inner confidence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I do not have any desire to have surgery to alter my genitalia, but I want Ben to see my genitals as male</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, I reached a point where I felt that if I didn\u2019t declare my true feelings for Ben, I would go mad. I&nbsp;remember mumbling \u201cI want to be&nbsp;with you\u201d, but so quietly he had to ask me to repeat myself, which was excruciating \u2013 but he felt the same. The wonderful thing was that when we kissed I felt entirely present. Every sensation was heightened.<br><br>It\u2019s amazing to be in a relationship with another transgender person, because we both have a more fluid way of looking at one another\u2019s bodies. I do not have any desire to have surgery to alter my genitalia, but I want Ben to see my genitals as male. When you\u2019re transgender you have this ability to just reframe the way you see the body, and it\u2019s so liberating. When I look at Ben\u2019s body I notice its delicacy and grace, but I also see how masculine it is. I find that beautiful.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/08/would-you-and-your-sexual-partner-like-to-share-the-story-of-what-you-get-up-to-in-the-bedroom\">Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?</a></em></p>",

There\u2019s a lot of jack hammering, and about five minutes of foreplay if you\u2019re lucky. But having sex as two trans guys is so much more open and expansive. I feel as if I can tell Jack any of my fantasies and there would never be any judgment. There are so many imaginative configurations \u2026 the possibilities feel endless. Jack, 32 Before I met Ben, I had been having a lot of casual sex \u2013 but often I wouldn\u2019t feel entirely present I remember locking eyes with Ben at a pub around a year ago and feeling a bit weak at the knees. He was wearing this flamboyant velvet shirt, with several buttons undone to show off his chest. I managed to secure a follow-up date by the end of the night. We watched The Lord of the Rings together, then talked for a bit about how hot Aragorn is. We both agreed there\u2019s something homoerotic about buff men wielding big, shiny swords. There was undeniable chemistry between us, but for the first six months I was shy about telling Ben how I felt. In retrospect, I\u2019m grateful we didn\u2019t rush in. In the year before I met Ben, I had been having a lot of casual sex \u2013 but often when I was actually in the middle of a sex act, I wouldn\u2019t feel entirely present. I was out as a trans man but I often struggled to fully inhabit my body. Having top surgery made me feel more at home in myself, but Ben\u2019s friendship also helped, because he made me feel understood. During the time we spent watching movies on his sofa, I was building inner confidence. Eventually, I reached a point where I felt that if I didn\u2019t declare my true feelings for Ben, I would go mad. I remember mumbling \u201cI want to be with you\u201d, but so quietly he had to ask me to repeat myself, which was excruciating \u2013 but he felt the same. The wonderful thing was that when we kissed I felt entirely present. Every sensation was heightened. It\u2019s amazing to be in a relationship with another transgender person, because we both have a more fluid way of looking at one another\u2019s bodies. I do not have any desire to have surgery to alter my genitalia, but I want Ben to see my genitals as male. When you\u2019re transgender you have this ability to just reframe the way you see the body, and it\u2019s so liberating. When I look at Ben\u2019s body I notice its delicacy and grace, but I also see how masculine it is. I find that beautiful. Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?",

      "body": "<p>You can usually tell a person\u2019s age by the state of their hands. I stared at the pair across from me, folded on the scratched wood bar beside the lemon wedges and cocktail napkins. They were rough-hewn, liver-spotted, with wrinkles that cross-hatched a sparse thicket of hair. It was another night of yearning at a gay bar and I was contemplating going home with the man beside me because his hands kept a score (\u201cI\u2019m&nbsp;65!\u201d they screamed) that belied everything he\u2019d done to hide the decades behind him. His face looked middle-aged, no doubt thanks to a skin-care routine that cost more each month than my whole wardrobe; his body was toned from years spent in the gym; and his hair was buzzed on the side and longer on the top, which was fashionable in New York back then. Everyone in cosmopolitan western cities tries to look young. But I&nbsp;only slept with men who looked old.</p> <p>Back then I was 24, but the guys I wanted were at least in their mid-50s. Now I\u2019m 33, and my lovers are almost always senior citizens. My husband is 77. \u201cYou have daddy issues,\u201d a college friend I no longer see told me blithely a year or so after graduation, as though this cliche was newer and wiser when it emerged from his mouth. Now it\u2019s a wonder no one tries to diagnose me with \u201cgrandaddy issues\u201d.</p> <p>I\u2019m open about my sexuality, but I despise being pigeonholed. Still, I believe that those who share my preferences form a discrete sexual subset, encompassed by homosexuality, yet obscured by its mainstream. Men in my situation must come out twice: first, as homosexuals, and then as homos who only sleep with old homos. Our loins are left unstirred by young twinks with six-pack abs or adorable bear cubs whose hairy chests have yet to grey, just the same way that female models from Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues left us limp as adolescents. Generations of male heart-throbs have come and gone, and we\u2019ve appreciated their appeal only as a social consensus, not a carnal urge. Myriad people are indifferent towards popular sex symbols. Yet my apathy towards young beauty is so pronounced that I\u2019ve wondered if I react to older men as a sex of their own. Why have I always nursed a crush on bald character actor Richard Jenkins \u2013 b 1947 \u2013 but not, say, America\u2019s gilded waif Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet? Am I drawn to changing hormones, a pheromonic balance that alters as testosterone declines and a bit of oestrogen enters the soup? This bizarre idea is no less plausible than damaging presumptions that someone with my predilection is a gold-digger, a stunted character in a&nbsp;Freud case study, or a culprit of elder abuse. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The first man I fell for was a humanities teacher who was 37 when I was born</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was impossible to explore my sexuality in adolescence.

I&nbsp;laughed intensely at jokes, but still felt as though I was watching myself perform this act from the outside. At&nbsp;night I jerked off to porn videos of older men and hated myself afterwards. </p> <p>My early years of college were similarly repressed and desperate. I dreamed before puberty of living in a&nbsp;house with my peers. By the start of adulthood, a&nbsp;campus full of horny contemporaries had morphed into a cruel rite of passage. At 20 I told a dear friend that I was attracted to men, neglecting to mention that my wheelhouse was limited to old dudes. A partial truth seemed better than living a lie. </p> <p>But sex with my contemporaries changed nothing. I mostly pursued people if they, like me, were obsessed with art, music, literature and film. Sometimes this created the opportunity for passion to develop, but desire never sprouted a connection if the other person was within a light year of my age.</p> <p>My second coming-out \u2013 as a lover of older men \u2013 was piecemeal. Many of my peers found out when I moved to New York City at 22 to get a master of fine arts in fiction writing and promptly fell in love with a 61-year-old. I bummed a cigarette off him outside the local gay spot at closing time and then we went back to his apartment. He had a similar charm to my high-school teacher, a belly laugh and a lived-in wit. He didn\u2019t quite believe me when I told him that I loved him just a couple of weeks after we first slept together. I introduced him to friends. I spoke about him to a couple of relatives, who, although shocked, at least fostered an appearance of open-mindedness. </p> <p>Our relationship collapsed for a number of reasons soon after I turned 24. Many of my friends then confessed that they thought it impossible for a young adult to date a man of my ex\u2019s vintage. It was assumed he had been tired after six decades on the planet, and his exhaustion would always outpace his appetite for something new. He encouraged this narrative about himself, too, and I probably should have taken him at his word. He had entrenched obligations, both financial and emotional, traumas and history too tightly wound to ever be unspooled. He had dead parents he grieved, and friends who had become like family, and a recent retirement about which he felt ambivalent and that undermined his self-esteem, and a weekend property out in the country that was equally his pride and his weight to bear. I was too young to have much of a past or many present commitments that weren\u2019t disposable. What I&nbsp;had, for the first time in my life, was the sense that I&nbsp;had a romantic future.</p> <p>I finished grad school, moved to Crown Heights, and began to ride the slow, erratic train into Manhattan many nights of the week in order to hang out at a gay bar on East 58th Street called the Townhouse, still there today, which served oldsters who wanted to pick up young trade. A lot of sex workers operated out of this club, which maintained a loose dress code that only applied to men with grey hair and wrinkles. I was wary of the social conservatism of anyone who submitted to this in the 21st century, yet I liked how the clientele didn\u2019t try to look like boys. These older men suspected that I, too, was charging for it. They questioned my intentions because I sparked the flirtation, which is necessary with much older guys in gay bars; they won\u2019t approach the young because they don\u2019t want to risk rebuke or coming off as creepy. I had plenty of sex, but most of the men I met were heterosexually married with children and grandchildren, in town from Florida or New Jersey and looking for a bit of action on the side. </p> <p>One of the sixtysomethings I slept with had another lover, a 39-year-old artist who showed in Lower East Side galleries and wanted a friend who could cruise the aged with him. I was down, and went to his art shows, too. But one day he propositioned me, then&nbsp;asked me on a date. I rejected him: \u201cI thought you only liked daddies.\u201d</p> <p>He did, but he had given up on pursuing them. The trouble was that he could never introduce an older lover to his friends, he told me, or take him to a dinner party, or allow him into the corner of the art world that he occupied, or hold his hand at a restaurant, or take him home to mom and dad. His cowardice stuck with me and I worried that one day I would turn into him.</p> <p>Months passed and I figured out ways to put off what I obviously cared about the most, which was falling in&nbsp;love. I decided that I could not fall in love until I&nbsp;finished and published my first novel. I also decided that I could not fall in love until I could afford to live alone. Regardless of my plans, I fell in love when I was 25 with my now-husband, Jeff, then 69. We first spoke on the dating app Scruff, which is mainstream these days but used to cater specifically to hairy men and their admirers.</p> <p>We did not know how to relate in bed at first, so we smoked some crumbly old cannabis he had in his drawer and talked about experimental poetry. The next week Trump was inaugurated president and my fear about this imminent catastrophe had solidified into a vague if potent determination to \u201cbe a political person\u201d, whatever that meant. I knew that I could never go to the Townhouse again, for that entire swathe of the East Side had been tainted by vendors selling red hats and the dystopian police presence outside the Trump Tower. Undoubtedly I was being unfair, sweeping every closeted family man with a suit and a suburban address into a bin marked \u201cNot radical enough for my new life\u201d. But I no longer wanted to risk sleeping with the enemy.</p>    <p>Jeff was certainly not the enemy. He had been out for nearly half a century when we met, had been a&nbsp;tireless gay rights activist and co-chair of the Village Voice union in the 1980s, when he managed to extend the benefits of their shop to same-sex couples, a&nbsp;virtually unheard-of victory for queers in 1982. He enjoyed so many of the same movies that I do, including asinine comedies I revelled in during my adolescence, and had an innate understanding of obscure genres of music. He wasn\u2019t a snob. He had more financial resources than I did but still lived like a bohemian \u2013 a&nbsp;lifestyle I could afford. We tried to be friends at first and I insisted that we split every meal and night out for drinks straight down the middle: my attempt to counter society\u2019s assumption that I chased older men because I wanted their money was, I understand now, an admirable if ultimately self-defeating response to homophobia. Intergenerational gay relationships are always scrutinised for being transactional. Acquisitive stereotypes cut both ways: the younger partner worries about seeming conniving, while the older partner fears being fed a line, as if his significant other is the dating equivalent of a phishing email. My commitment to self-sufficiency was not what allowed Jeff and I to transcend these preconceptions. It was the strength of our attachment, the reality that we fell in love.</p> <p>Pretty soon we were spending every night together and having explosively good sex multiple times a day. I had experienced something similar with my ex, but was nonetheless in uncharted waters. Jeff still mourned his late husband, who was a decade his senior and had died less than a year and a half before we met. I had exercised little caution about inserting myself into his grief because we were too incompatible on a surface level to have more than an extended fling. He is six inches shorter than I am, and my previous crushes were taller than me \u2013 I believed that considerable height was necessary. Jeff has a high voice, cries when he feels overwhelmed, and embraces his femininity in dress and spirit, while the men I thought that I found most attractive embraced masculine stereotypes. This relationship was expanding me so quickly that I realised again that I was still in the process of coming out: I&nbsp;knew that intergenerationality was a must, but I had no idea just how much received thinking about gay attraction could be discarded. At the same time, the different parts of myself could flourish in this coupling: I could be boyish, dumb, silly, sad, ardent, obsessive and anxious. I didn\u2019t need to cloak any of these qualities in whatever I believed adulthood to be.</p> <p>\u201cWhat will you do if he gets sick?\u201d is a question people still ask me after we\u2019ve been together for nearly eight years. Implicit in their curiosity is a belief in the ableist, first-world fallacy that young people don\u2019t suffer&nbsp;illness or die \u2013 I want to reply, \u201cWhat will he do if <em>I</em> get sick?\u201d<em> </em></p> <p>Sometimes, people mistake us for father and son, which is not completely inaccurate \u2013 although the question of who is the parent and who is the child is more complicated than they might assume. Our relationship was able to blossom thanks to a mutual understanding that either of us may begin a romance or move in with another person and regard the other as a beloved family member deserving of affection, support, comfort and care. Love is not a contract, insurance policy or a coerced promise, and this freedom&nbsp;ironically absolves us from the urge to depart&nbsp;each other\u2019s lives. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I was skittish when we met. I really couldn\u2019t get how anyone could be attracted to my saggy butt and annoying old-guy forgetfulness </p> <footer> <cite>Jeff</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For now, and hopefully for an indefinite hereafter, Jeff and I cohabit and coexist. We both work from home, which means we spend all day in each other\u2019s space, bemoaning disappointing emails and discussing our next meal, concocting excuses to leave the apartment for a stroll in the middle of the afternoon. We demonstrate together for Palestinian, Black, queer and migrant lives. In the evenings, we go to gallery openings, concerts, clubs, movies, readings; we come home, have a drink, get stoned and laugh. We meld existing friend groups and make new ones, a cross-section of lovely people who span generations.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I was skittish when we met,\u201d Jeff says when I ask him to reflect on that time. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t get how anyone could be attracted to my saggy butt and annoying old-guy forgetfulness. The real surprise, though, is that when I look at you, sitting on the futon in your plaid pyjama pants, big eyes smiling at me, we\u2019re the same age, no difference at all.\u201d</p> <p>I am not trying to sell a lifestyle, and I suspect that late capitalism is still several years away from being able to market sex and love with a septuagenarian as a&nbsp;smokin\u2019 hot trend. But, I guarantee that there are many of you out there, of every gender identity and sexual orientation, who know now or will find out later that you are happiest romantically and erotically with someone much older. Don\u2019t despair. Though if you do, that\u2019s OK too \u2013 I sure did.</p> <p>Months after we met, Jeff and I woke up, sleep-deprived and sensitive, from a fight about how we could continue. We went on a walk. All of society seemed to be against us. The glares of passersby tracked us while&nbsp;we trudged up the avenue and stopped on every block to argue or to hug. If we broke up, we would be miserable. If we stayed together, we would accompany each other a little further into the uncertainty of existence. \u201cLet\u2019s be close today and see how tomorrow works for each of us,\u201d we resolved \u2013 as we had in the past, as we would in the future. And then we wandered the streets hand in hand, plotting a course that was as new as it was old.</p>",

I decided that I could not fall in love until I finished and published my first novel. I also decided that I could not fall in love until I could afford to live alone. Regardless of my plans, I fell in love when I was 25 with my now-husband, Jeff, then 69. We first spoke on the dating app Scruff, which is mainstream these days but used to cater specifically to hairy men and their admirers. We did not know how to relate in bed at first, so we smoked some crumbly old cannabis he had in his drawer and talked about experimental poetry. The next week Trump was inaugurated president and my fear about this imminent catastrophe had solidified into a vague if potent determination to \u201cbe a political person\u201d, whatever that meant. I knew that I could never go to the Townhouse again, for that entire swathe of the East Side had been tainted by vendors selling red hats and the dystopian police presence outside the Trump Tower. Undoubtedly I was being unfair, sweeping every closeted family man with a suit and a suburban address into a bin marked \u201cNot radical enough for my new life\u201d. But I no longer wanted to risk sleeping with the enemy. Jeff was certainly not the enemy. He had been out for nearly half a century when we met, had been a tireless gay rights activist and co-chair of the Village Voice union in the 1980s, when he managed to extend the benefits of their shop to same-sex couples, a virtually unheard-of victory for queers in 1982. He enjoyed so many of the same movies that I do, including asinine comedies I revelled in during my adolescence, and had an innate understanding of obscure genres of music. He wasn\u2019t a snob. He had more financial resources than I did but still lived like a bohemian \u2013 a lifestyle I could afford. We tried to be friends at first and I insisted that we split every meal and night out for drinks straight down the middle: my attempt to counter society\u2019s assumption that I chased older men because I wanted their money was, I understand now, an admirable if ultimately self-defeating response to homophobia. Intergenerational gay relationships are always scrutinised for being transactional. Acquisitive stereotypes cut both ways: the younger partner worries about seeming conniving, while the older partner fears being fed a line, as if his significant other is the dating equivalent of a phishing email. My commitment to self-sufficiency was not what allowed Jeff and I to transcend these preconceptions. It was the strength of our attachment, the reality that we fell in love. Pretty soon we were spending every night together and having explosively good sex multiple times a day. I had experienced something similar with my ex, but was nonetheless in uncharted waters. Jeff still mourned his late husband, who was a decade his senior and had died less than a year and a half before we met. I had exercised little caution about inserting myself into his grief because we were too incompatible on a surface level to have more than an extended fling. He is six inches shorter than I am, and my previous crushes were taller than me \u2013 I believed that considerable height was necessary. Jeff has a high voice, cries when he feels overwhelmed, and embraces his femininity in dress and spirit, while the men I thought that I found most attractive embraced masculine stereotypes. This relationship was expanding me so quickly that I realised again that I was still in the process of coming out: I knew that intergenerationality was a must, but I had no idea just how much received thinking about gay attraction could be discarded. At the same time, the different parts of myself could flourish in this coupling: I could be boyish, dumb, silly, sad, ardent, obsessive and anxious. I didn\u2019t need to cloak any of these qualities in whatever I believed adulthood to be. \u201cWhat will you do if he gets sick?\u201d is a question people still ask me after we\u2019ve been together for nearly eight years. Implicit in their curiosity is a belief in the ableist, first-world fallacy that young people don\u2019t suffer illness or die \u2013 I want to reply, \u201cWhat will he do if I get sick?\u201d Sometimes, people mistake us for father and son, which is not completely inaccurate \u2013 although the question of who is the parent and who is the child is more complicated than they might assume. Our relationship was able to blossom thanks to a mutual understanding that either of us may begin a romance or move in with another person and regard the other as a beloved family member deserving of affection, support, comfort and care. Love is not a contract, insurance policy or a coerced promise, and this freedom ironically absolves us from the urge to depart each other\u2019s lives. For now, and hopefully for an indefinite hereafter, Jeff and I cohabit and coexist. We both work from home, which means we spend all day in each other\u2019s space, bemoaning disappointing emails and discussing our next meal, concocting excuses to leave the apartment for a stroll in the middle of the afternoon. We demonstrate together for Palestinian, Black, queer and migrant lives. In the evenings, we go to gallery openings, concerts, clubs, movies, readings; we come home, have a drink, get stoned and laugh. We meld existing friend groups and make new ones, a cross-section of lovely people who span generations. \u201cI guess I was skittish when we met,\u201d Jeff says when I ask him to reflect on that time. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t get how anyone could be attracted to my saggy butt and annoying old-guy forgetfulness. The real surprise, though, is that when I look at you, sitting on the futon in your plaid pyjama pants, big eyes smiling at me, we\u2019re the same age, no difference at all.\u201d I am not trying to sell a lifestyle, and I suspect that late capitalism is still several years away from being able to market sex and love with a septuagenarian as a smokin\u2019 hot trend. But, I guarantee that there are many of you out there, of every gender identity and sexual orientation, who know now or will find out later that you are happiest romantically and erotically with someone much older. Don\u2019t despair. Though if you do, that\u2019s OK too \u2013 I sure did. Months after we met, Jeff and I woke up, sleep-deprived and sensitive, from a fight about how we could continue. We went on a walk. All of society seemed to be against us. The glares of passersby tracked us while we trudged up the avenue and stopped on every block to argue or to hug. If we broke up, we would be miserable. If we stayed together, we would accompany each other a little further into the uncertainty of existence. \u201cLet\u2019s be close today and see how tomorrow works for each of us,\u201d we resolved \u2013 as we had in the past, as we would in the future. And then we wandered the streets hand in hand, plotting a course that was as new as it was old.",

From the launch of the first, Sputnik, in 1957, as it became easier and cheaper to put satellites into space, the numbers have boomed. In 2022, there were about 6,000 and by 2030, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105166.pdf\">one estimate suggests</a> there will be nearly 60,000 satellites in orbit around our planet.</p> <p>Look up on a clear night now and <a href=\"https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/future-megaconstellations\">you may well see a bright train of dots</a> traversing the sky. These are part of SpaceX\u2019s \u201cmegaconstellation\u201d of satellites, Starlink, which offers increased access to broadband communication across the world.</p> <p>But regulations on how people behave in space are piecemeal and the main international law, the UN\u2019s 1967 Outer Space treaty, is more than 50 years old.</p> <p>There\u2019s now a huge amount of junk, or space debris, in orbit. Almost 37,000 objects more than 10cm in size are being tracked by space surveillance networks, according to the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers\">European Space Agency (Esa) figures for September</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThat stuff\u2019s dangerous, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d says John Janka, global government affairs and regulatory chief officer at the communications company <a href=\"https://www.viasat.com/\">Viasat</a>, who is based in Washington DC. \u201cBut there\u2019s also \u2013 according to Esa, more than 1m pieces of debris between 1cm and 10cm that are lethal and non-trackable. What does that mean? It means you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t avoid it, and today you can\u2019t shield your satellite against it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bigger satellite, the more cross-sectional area, the greater chance of being hit by debris</p> <footer> <cite>Viasat paper, 2022</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the concern over debris is about more than it damaging an individual satellite or craft. Space operators are acutely aware of a danger known as the Kessler effect or syndrome, named after the Nasa scientist Donald J Kessler, who in 1978 along with Burton G Cour-Palais, <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JA083iA06p02637\">published a theory</a> that as the number of satellites increased, so would the probability of collisions. As collisions increase, the more debris is produced, and the greater the risk of more collisions. At a critical mass, one collision could trigger an unstoppable cascade of collisions, such that an entire orbit could be rendered useless.</p> <p>A 2022 overview paper by Viasat paints <a href=\"https://www.viasat.com/content/dam/us-site/corporate/documents/Viasat%20White%20Paper-Managing%20Mega-Constellation%20Risks%20in%20LEO%20(Updated%20Nov%2022)%20(A4).pdf\">an almost apocalyptic picture</a>: \u201cIf a tipping point is reached, all of humanity would watch helplessly as space junk multiplies uncontrollably. Without timely intervention, we risk bringing the space age to an inglorious end, and trapping humanity on Earth under a layer of its own trash for centuries, or even millennia.\u201d</p> <p>It continues: \u201cNot only an abrupt end to space exploration, but also the loss of all the benefits of space technology \u2013 including navigation, weather forecasting, climate measurements, and even satellite broadband (the intended purpose of the megaconstellations being deployed).\u201d</p> <p>As well as numbers, Janka points out, size is an issue. \u201cWe\u2019re putting up tens of thousands of satellites, and we\u2019re putting up increasingly bigger satellites into low Earth orbit \u2013 bigger in terms of cross-sectional area and mass \u2013 we\u2019re finding that we\u2019re having perhaps some unanticipated impact on things like collision risk.\u201d</p> <p>He compares it to a bigger sail on a boat catching more wind. \u201cThe bigger satellite, the more cross-sectional area, the greater chance of being hit by debris.\u201d And bigger satellites create more debris when they are hit.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the solution? Tracking and manoeuvring satellites to avoid collisions is one way to manage risk. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX manages its Starlink satellites in this way, and de-orbits those deemed \u201c<a href=\"https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Commitment%20to%20Space%20Sustainability.pdf\">at an elevated risk of becoming non-manoeuvrable</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Many agree manoeuvrability is important. Shave describes it as \u201ccritical in orbit\u201d. However, it may not ultimately be a failsafe solution because of the sheer number of satellites due to fill the skies in the years to come.</p> <p>\u201cCollision avoidance is a complete misnomer,\u201d says Hugh Lewis, professor of astronautics at the University of Southampton, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t avoid a collision when you don\u2019t know whether a collision is actually going to happen or not.\u201d</p>    <p>But a manoeuvre to avoid a future collision does reduce the probability, he explains, so while the risk \u201cnever goes away\u201d, it gets smaller. \u201cNow multiply that [small risk] by 10,000 satellites,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Lewis, also a technical adviser to the <a href=\"https://www.essi.org/#what-ESSI-does\">Earth Space Sustainability Initiative</a> (Essi), talks about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/magazine/issue-41/improbable-probability/#:~:text=The%20second%20law%20of%20the,to%20form%20your%20birth%20date.\">the law of truly large numbers</a>\u201d. \u201cYou can have really rare events and if you give enough opportunity for that event to occur, then it generally does, which is why we tend to see these big catastrophes that happen even though they are really quite rare. The same thing is true with spacecraft [collisions].\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Satellites <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Types_of_orbits#LEO\">may be put into different orbits</a> depending on what their function is. For example, those put into low Earth orbit (LEO) are relatively close to Earth, 160-200km above the surface, and are good for Earth observation. Others <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OrbitsCatalog\">put into high Earth orbit</a>, 36,000km above Earth, may be useful for weather monitoring. Satellites also use different frequencies or <a href=\"https://news.viasat.com/blog/scn/radio-waves-and-how-satellites-use-them\">parts of the electromagnetic spectrum</a> to communicate and \u2013 just as with radio frequencies on Earth \u2013 operators need to apply for this limited resource through the UN\u2019s International Telecommunication Union.</p> <p>And as companies and nations vie for this finite resource \u2013 with early entrants able to hog orbits and bandwidths, this raises questions of how we divide up the sky equitably, sharing access to its benefits globally.</p> <p>Ian Christensen, a senior director at the <a href=\"https://swfound.org/about-us/who-we-are/\">Secure World Foundation</a>, a US-based nonprofit, says that \u201cin general constellation operators are doing well\u201d on manoeuvring their craft out of harm\u2019s way. For example, he says Starlink has a \u201chigher threshold for collision avoidance than is typical\u201d and its automated collision-avoidance system is \u201crisk averse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe concern comes from how different constellations will interact with one another \u2026 so as Chinese systems start to deploy, as Amazon Kuiper starts to deploy, as others come in, how do we ensure that they are coordinated, that operators are exchanging positional data, so that other operators know where they are?\u201d</p> <p>He says the concern is over how to build this coordination in the absence of a global system.</p> <p>Coming together globally is \u201cinevitable\u201d according to some, who argue that the space community should work together sooner rather than later, learning from the evolution of other technological gamechangers such as mobile phone networks and the internet.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we can skip to the end. Let\u2019s not go through the 10, 20, 30 years doing it incorrectly,\u201d says Michael Cheng, an advisory member of Essi and member of the <a href=\"https://www.outernetcouncil.org/about\">Outernet Council</a>.</p> <p>These nonprofits are lobbying the space industry to develop \u201cinteroperable\u201d systems. That is, that different operators agree on and use standardised hardware, software and network connectivity so that their satellites and space systems can \u201ctalk to one another\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Megaconstellation satellites could produce over 360 tonnes of aluminium oxide annually as they burn up in the atmosphere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe would like to see more efficient use of communications technologies and communications networks,\u201d says Cheng, who is also chief product officer at the communications company <a href=\"https://www.aalyria.com/\">Aalyria</a>, a Google spinout.</p> <p>To help build resilience into communications systems, the firm has developed a \u201cnetwork orchestration tool\u201d or software called <a href=\"https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63e03a88bb9f184ceb4ab190/65f4a624e382f6096dd2cb0c_Aalyria%20Spacetime%20101.pdf\">Spacetime</a> that monitors moving antennae and can find the best routes or connection options between moving satellites. It may also help operators exchange network capacity with one another once licences are in place, says Cheng.</p> <p>He compares the current communications network in space to the early days of mobile phone networks on Earth where leaving the jurisdiction of one operator meant \u201cexorbitant\u201d roaming charges for the customer, while now different mobile phone operators have protocols and standards in place making the system easier for everyone.</p> <p>Sharing and standardising systems across space would make things more efficient and therefore more sustainable \u2013 for instance, by reducing the amount of hardware that needs to be launched.</p>    <p>\u201cWe are betting on our ability to technologically outpace \u2013 or use technology to leverage our way out of whatever horrible things are happening,\u201d says Cheng, who argues that only by working together can we keep space sustainable. He cites one big success story for humanity \u2013 the banning of CFCs to help close the hole in the ozone layer. \u201cHumanity managed to collaborate and do a good thing there with making that hole smaller and smaller.\u201d</p> <p>Cheng also notes, however, that the ozone layer may be under threat once more \u2013 this time from spent satellites. A study published earlier this year in <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2024GL109280\">Geophysical Research Letters</a> suggested that in future the used satellites from megaconstellations could produce over 360 tonnes of aluminium oxide particles annually as they burn up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. These can linger for decades and lead to \u201csignificant ozone depletion\u201d.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Most agree the idea of interoperable systems makes sense, although Janka cautions that it doesn\u2019t stop the \u201coverconsumption problem\u201d. \u201cI think having a level of standardisation in the right areas to help enable space sustainability is critical,\u201d says Shave. He says the CEO of Astroscale, Nobu Okada, likens the situation in space now to having more cars on the roads in the early 20th century. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stop cars going on the road,\u201d he says. \u201cYou managed them better.\u201d</p> <p>His company <a href=\"https://astroscale.com/astroscale-awarded-contract-for-next-phase-of-a-uk-national-active-debris-removal-mission/\">won a \u00a31.95m contract</a> with the UK Space Agency last month for the next stage of its Cleaning Outer Space Mission through Innovative Capture (Cosmic) spacecraft project, which aims to pluck inactive British satellites from space using a robotic arm. If all goes to plan, it hopes to launch Cosmic in 2027-28.</p> <p>The mission\u2019s goal of \u201cactive debris removal\u201d may provide another avenue for keeping orbits sustainable. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative we do that,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cWe are having to deal with the legacy of derelict objects abandoned over decades.\u201d</p> <p>With the threats to sustainability in space, some might argue we should stop launching satellites altogether. But, argues Lewis, space services are now \u201cpart of our economy\u201d. He asks instead: \u201cHow do we grow our use in a sustainable way?\u201d</p> <p>Janka\u2019s firm wants to see the satellite industry modelling how different scenarios and solutions might work. He also calls for better regulation, adding that over the past year, the industry has recognised this with an umbrella group, the <a href=\"https://gsoasatellite.com/\">Global Satellite Operators Association</a>, agreeing on the importance of working with regulators. \u201cWe need to regulate, because we\u2019re dealing with what\u2019s potentially a \u2018<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/tragedy-of-the-commons\">tragedy of the commons</a>\u2019. And unfortunately, with human behaviour being what it is, we can\u2019t work on the assumption that everybody\u2019s going to do the right thing,\u201d he warns.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s interoperable systems, technological fixes, or better rules for how we use space, the issue of how we keep our activities in space sustainable is for everyone. \u201cWhat happens in space very much affects what happens on the ground,\u201d says Cheng.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about us. It\u2019s about tomorrow\u2026 it\u2019s about next century,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cand being able to leave a legacy that enables other generations to use space in the way we\u2019re enjoying.\u201d</p>",

He also calls for better regulation, adding that over the past year, the industry has recognised this with an umbrella group, the Global Satellite Operators Association, agreeing on the importance of working with regulators. \u201cWe need to regulate, because we\u2019re dealing with what\u2019s potentially a \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019. And unfortunately, with human behaviour being what it is, we can\u2019t work on the assumption that everybody\u2019s going to do the right thing,\u201d he warns. Whether it\u2019s interoperable systems, technological fixes, or better rules for how we use space, the issue of how we keep our activities in space sustainable is for everyone. \u201cWhat happens in space very much affects what happens on the ground,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about us. It\u2019s about tomorrow\u2026 it\u2019s about next century,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cand being able to leave a legacy that enables other generations to use space in the way we\u2019re enjoying.\u201d",

But appearances can be deceptive. Off stage, Don Jr is more influential than ever as a political operative. He has built a loyal following in the Maga universe via his Triggered podcast on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/20/what-is-rumble-the-video-sharing-platform-immune-to-cancel-culture\">Rumble</a> and gained powerful allies such as Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point USA.</p> <p>It was Don Jr <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-convention.html\">who advocated for</a> his close <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/11/donald-trump-vp-pick-rnc\">friend Vance</a>, a relatively inexperienced senator from Ohio, to become Trump\u2019s vice-presidential nominee. There is speculation in Washington that the pair struck a deal that, should Vance make his own White House bid, he will name Don Jr as his running mate. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/06/12/donald-trump-jr-maga-kingmaker-2024-election\">Vance has previously said</a>: \u201cWith the exception of his dad, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen anyone who has a stronger natural connection to our base.\u201d</p> <p>Some suspect that Don Jr would be the power behind the throne of a second Trump administration. Speaking on the sidelines of July\u2019s Republican national convention in Milwaukee, he said he wants \u201cveto power\u201d over hiring decisions in a presidential transition. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pick a single person for a position of power; all I want to do is block the guys that would be a disaster,\u201d Don Jr said during an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl08RdQwzPk\">Axios House event</a>. \u201cI want to block the liars, I want to block the guys that are pretending they\u2019re with you.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/02/republican-joe-walsh-iowa-trump\">Joe Walsh</a>, a former Republican congressman and Tea party activist turned Trump critic, said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard is that Junior is hugely active behind the scenes and hugely influential behind the scenes and that, if Trump is to win, Junior\u2019s going to be basically the power broker. He\u2019s going to be the big player in the administration<em>.\u201d</em></p>    <p>The ascendency of Don Jr and Eric coincides with the declining influence of Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, both of whom worked in the Trump White House. This is seen as evidence that, having conquered the Republican party, populist extremism has prevailed in Trump\u2019s own family.</p> <p>Walsh, part of a group known as Republicans for Harris campaigning for Democratic nominee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a>, added: \u201cDifferent family members are the faces this time around and who are they? They\u2019re the more Maga. Junior is clearly Maga. <a href=\"https://x.com/LaraLeaTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Lara Trump</a> is a Maga idiot and her husband Eric is the same way.</p> <p>\u201cJared Kushner and Ivanka were never that way. They\u2019re more polite, kind of high society folks so they were never really meshed with the whole Maga thing. It parallels with who would work for Trump in the second administration. It would all be much more Maga crazies.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his New York upbringing, Don Jr has styled himself as an outdoorsman who hunts and fishes and connects with middle America. He has also spent a decade honing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/21/donald-trump-jr-became-fathers-unlikely-political-heir-apparent\">brash political persona</a>, delivering fiery speeches, tweeting conspiracy theories and goading liberal critics \u2013 \u201cowning the libs\u201d \u2013 in ways that meet the moment for his father.</p> <p>Joshua Kendall, author of First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama, agrees. He said: \u201cTrump has gotten much more authoritarian so Don Jr is a much better fit for this go around than in 2016, when Trump was still every once in a while trying to make a nod that would be presidential.</p> <p>\u201cNow he really doesn\u2019t care and that fits very well with Don Jr\u2019s personality which is he\u2019s a real firebrand and, just like his father, he enjoys getting down and dirty with stump speeches and saying harsh things.\u201d</p> <p>Children have long been crucial players in presidential campaigns; Jimmy Carter\u2019s worked tirelessly to boost him in the New Hampshire primary election in 1976. As the oldest major party nominee in history, Trump, 78, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/18/trump-campaign-unity-rnc\">turned to his grandchildren to soften his image</a>.</p> <p>Kai Trump, the 17-year-old daughter of Don Jr and his ex-wife Vanessa, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-17-year-old-granddaughter-kai-trump-speaks-rnc/\">told delegates</a> at the Republican convention: \u201cThe media makes my grandpa seem like a different person.

      "bodyText": "In late afternoon sunshine, Eric Trump shook his fist and led chants of \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d The second son of Donald Trump told a fervent crowd: \u201cThey tried to smear us, they tried to bankrupt us, they came after us, they impeached him twice \u2026 then, guys, they tried to kill him.\u201d A who\u2019s who of the Maga movement had gathered for a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, less than three months after the Republican presidential nominee survived an assassination attempt there. Trump was joined on stage by running mate JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk. But if he was looking for moral support from his family, he would have to settle for Eric. His other children \u2013 and his wife \u2013 were notably absent. The no-shows at Trump\u2019s recent marquee event were indicative of a divided family keeping a lower profile than in past election cycles. When he took the political establishment by storm in 2016, the Trump family business was part of his brand. This time, at campaign stops where he gives disjointed and demagogic speeches, he cuts a more isolated figure. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, is sitting the election out while his younger daughter, Tiffany, is pregnant. His youngest son, Barron, 18, has begun his freshman year of college at New York University. Eric, executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, makes occasional appearances on the campaign trail alongside his wife, Lara, who is now co-chair of the Republican National Committee. \u201cI get to go to bed every single night and wake up every single morning listening about voter integrity,\u201d Eric, 40, joked in Butler, with Lara at his side. \u201cIt\u2019s really great. I\u2019m really, really excited for November 6 when Lara can turn over in the morning and not talk about voter integrity.\u201d Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, 46, has been less prominent on the campaign trail than in previous election cycles. But appearances can be deceptive. Off stage, Don Jr is more influential than ever as a political operative. He has built a loyal following in the Maga universe via his Triggered podcast on Rumble and gained powerful allies such as Charlie Kirk, founder and president of Turning Point USA. It was Don Jr who advocated for his close friend Vance, a relatively inexperienced senator from Ohio, to become Trump\u2019s vice-presidential nominee. There is speculation in Washington that the pair struck a deal that, should Vance make his own White House bid, he will name Don Jr as his running mate. Vance has previously said: \u201cWith the exception of his dad, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen anyone who has a stronger natural connection to our base.\u201d Some suspect that Don Jr would be the power behind the throne of a second Trump administration. Speaking on the sidelines of July\u2019s Republican national convention in Milwaukee, he said he wants \u201cveto power\u201d over hiring decisions in a presidential transition. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pick a single person for a position of power; all I want to do is block the guys that would be a disaster,\u201d Don Jr said during an Axios House event. \u201cI want to block the liars, I want to block the guys that are pretending they\u2019re with you.\u201d Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and Tea party activist turned Trump critic, said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard is that Junior is hugely active behind the scenes and hugely influential behind the scenes and that, if Trump is to win, Junior\u2019s going to be basically the power broker. He\u2019s going to be the big player in the administration.\u201d The ascendency of Don Jr and Eric coincides with the declining influence of Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, both of whom worked in the Trump White House. This is seen as evidence that, having conquered the Republican party, populist extremism has prevailed in Trump\u2019s own family. Walsh, part of a group known as Republicans for Harris campaigning for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, added: \u201cDifferent family members are the faces this time around and who are they? They\u2019re the more Maga. Junior is clearly Maga. Lara Trump is a Maga idiot and her husband Eric is the same way. \u201cJared Kushner and Ivanka were never that way. They\u2019re more polite, kind of high society folks so they were never really meshed with the whole Maga thing. It parallels with who would work for Trump in the second administration. It would all be much more Maga crazies.\u201d Despite his New York upbringing, Don Jr has styled himself as an outdoorsman who hunts and fishes and connects with middle America. He has also spent a decade honing a brash political persona, delivering fiery speeches, tweeting conspiracy theories and goading liberal critics \u2013 \u201cowning the libs\u201d \u2013 in ways that meet the moment for his father. Joshua Kendall, author of First Dads: Parenting and Politics from George Washington to Barack Obama, agrees. He said: \u201cTrump has gotten much more authoritarian so Don Jr is a much better fit for this go around than in 2016, when Trump was still every once in a while trying to make a nod that would be presidential. \u201cNow he really doesn\u2019t care and that fits very well with Don Jr\u2019s personality which is he\u2019s a real firebrand and, just like his father, he enjoys getting down and dirty with stump speeches and saying harsh things.\u201d Children have long been crucial players in presidential campaigns; Jimmy Carter\u2019s worked tirelessly to boost him in the New Hampshire primary election in 1976. As the oldest major party nominee in history, Trump, 78, has turned to his grandchildren to soften his image. Kai Trump, the 17-year-old daughter of Don Jr and his ex-wife Vanessa, told delegates at the Republican convention: \u201cThe media makes my grandpa seem like a different person. But I know him for who he is. He is very caring and loving. He truly wants the best for this country. And he will fight every single day to make America great again.\u201d Yet although Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, also attended the convention, she broke custom by not delivering a speech. The former first lady has maintained a low profile except to promote her own memoir, in which she expressed support for abortion rights \u2013 potentially giving her husband a political headache. It is a stark contrast with past elections, where spouses such as Laura Bush and Michelle Obama have been critical allies, and with Harris\u2019s husband, Doug Emhoff, who is unfailingly loyal and hugely active on the campaign trail. Kendall added: \u201cMelania is doing as little as necessary. In that book she came out as pro-abortion so she can\u2019t be counted on to go all Maga. The appeal of Don Jr and Eric is that Trump can count on them. They\u2019re the two family members that are most connected to him and most willing to do his dirty work. \u201cMelania has also drawn a line in the sand. She wouldn\u2019t speak at the convention, which these days is not common and isn\u2019t going out on the stump. Compare how much Emhoff is doing to how little she is doing.\u201d Some commentators believe that there is another, pragmatic reason for Trump\u2019s wife and daughter to hang back this time.

We heard about limos pulling up on set, the window going down, and new script pages for that day being passed out. Directors, those masters and mistresses of the universe, were surprisingly keen to relive these indignities. Their movies had become something that was done <em>to</em> them, not <em>by</em> them. They talked about the best survival strategy being to \u201cgo limp\u201d.</p> <p>And the chaos! There were multiple times in the writers\u2019 room where we said: \u201cYeah, I know it really happened, but we can\u2019t actually put it in. People won\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s too stupid.\u201d The idea of starting shooting a $300m movie with no third act settled upon seemed insane, but was almost standard practice. Actors shot with amorphous green props that would be VFXed in later, either because no one could agree what they should be, or because the provisional wing of the fandom had threatened insurgency/homicide over their design slightly deviating from the comics. It turned out that, backstage, the movies that had become the dominant cultural product of our time were more chaotic than even cold war proxy conflicts. And frequently, less uplifting.</p> <p>Plus, in a maybe-not-unconnected development, the cracks were opening up. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) \u2013 once the most consistently bankable franchise in the entire history of Hollywood film-making \u2013 was suddenly faltering, and even turning out a flop or two. DC\u2019s reboot was supposedly taking place even as studios were hearing about a potentially deadly new cultural pandemic \u2013 \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d.</p> <p>But wait, because I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Like&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of late-stage superhero franchise movies, I\u2019ve started in the wrong place. So let\u2019s spin this off into&nbsp;the origin story \u2026</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <p>Picture the scene. You are the director of a superhero franchise movie. When the studio hired you with mega fanfare, they gave you a budget that could have bought one hundred thousand water wells across Somalia. Which, you know, you didn\u2019t like to brag about. But it was a pretty neat way of reminding yourself how important your movie was going to be. Then again, you loved cinema above all things, so what you did with your life was always going to be important. You grew up idolising all those guys: Marty, Francis, Quentin. Mister Spielberg. Age 17, you accepted you shared their destiny. Aged 19, you decided your autobiography was going to be called My Auteurbiography. Aged 21, girls had sex with you to stop you explaining Mulholland Drive to them for another hour. The next morning, all you had to say was: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that structurally, it\u2019s a Moebius strip \u2026 \u201d and they\u2019d do it again.</p> <p>Aged 26, you were fresh out of graduate film school and keen to establish yourself as an uncompromising maverick, who was also available to shoot fragrance commercials. Aged 27, you read the phrase \u201cSundance-to-spandex pipeline\u201d about how promising young indie directors get sucked into the superhero sausage factory \u2013 and passed it off as your own in conversation on your first date with a model and award-winning brunch DJ who recently curated her own range of raw antidepressants.</p> <p>Aged 31 you made Breakfast Serial, a low-budget satirical slasher movie about a diner chef hunting down unfavourable TripAdvisor reviewers. A thin-year festival hit, it played at Sundance, where you self-effacingly mentioned to the audience that critics were already calling it \u201ca slow-burn funscape that\u2019s as deliberately undigestible as a human femur\u201d. Barry Diller sent peonies.</p>    <p>Also aged 31, you married the model and were formally designated a power couple. Sure, OK, Paper magazine?! For you, all that stuff was just noise that you weren\u2019t going to let get in the way of the work. Even so, you bought a $2,000 chore jacket. You started calling watches \u201ctimepieces\u201d.</p> <p>And then, aged 32, the comic-book studio wanted you. They wanted you in the way that you had always wanted to be wanted, maybe even by your wife. They wanted you to take your time thinking about it but, obviously, they wanted to announce your movie at Comic-Con next&nbsp;week. You told reporters what an honour it was to put a new spin on a character whose stories defined your childhood. (Did they? It didn\u2019t matter. No one could possibly have any way of checking.) The studio said they loved your uncompromising vision, so you knew you could persuade them to make it darker and grittier. You knew you wouldn\u2019t get caught up in the machine.</p> <p>Needle scratch. Cut to now. Now, aged 36, you are sitting in a trailer an hour before dawn on a location shoot in a quasi-democracy to which the studio has deployed you in order to take advantage of the tax credits. You are reading an article in the Hollywood Reporter about how Christopher Nolan has total creative control over Current, his new movie about Nikola Tesla. Before that, you read an article about Yorgos Lanthimos developing an intensely complex and disquieting story about a power struggle within an uncontacted tribe. And you? Your movie is about a man who can grow his really strong hair really fast, fashioning it into makeshift weapons and life aids. This is very isolating for him, and also some people killed his parents when he was a kid.</p> <p>Your movie was supposed to take nine months but you have now been on it for two-and-a-half years. It is in its second run of reshoots and has had more script revisions than Wikipedia. And possibly more writers. It\u2019s bad enough not having an ending but now they\u2019re rethinking the beginning. Thematically, it is both for and against the idea of war. You dimly recall it once had a climate message. The shoot has produced 10,000 tonnes of CO2 (so far).</p> <p>Ninety-seven days into shooting you developed a nervous tic, a compulsive humming that frequently ruins takes. Or maybe improves them, it\u2019s hard to tell. The crew used to like you; then they hated you; then they pitied you. Your wife now lives with Chris Pine. You want to quit, but if you do, the studio will quietly tell the entire industry that you are difficult. But today your jailers are going to let you choose the name of a space parliament that they will later cut from the movie. Won\u2019t that be fun?</p> <p>No, would seem to be the obvious answer. Later, when you nail on a smile for the premiere, you\u2019ll find what else they cut at the absolute last minute. As for the stuff they added \u2026 your movie was cuckooed. The set of a vulnerable person \u2013 you \u2013 was moved into and taken over by studio forces who wanted to use it to advance their own enterprises. They pumped it full of last-minute product placement, random artefacts and non-sequitur scenes whose sole purpose is to tee up and serve characters and plotlines in other, infinitely more important movies in the universe. You come to realise that the movie you sold your soul for is a kind of indentured straight man. You have made a $250m content butler. Marketing will push it to $400m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/08/fantastic-four-marvel-and-dc-superhero-movie-malaise\">Can Fantastic Four save Marvel \u2013 and DC \u2013 from superhero movie malaise?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Your studio producers kept telling you that the directors who thrive in the franchise movie era are \u201cthe ones who know what they don\u2019t know\u201d. You finally understand that this was a nice way of saying your role was always more ceremonial than operational. You were only ever a foam-suited sports mascot, or a regimental goat. For now, hiding in your trailer, you accept your real place in this comic universe. You are both the most important and the least important cultural unit you have ever been. You are a <em>superhero franchise movie director</em>.</p> <p>Or \u2026 are you? And that\u2019s when the real twist hits you. That\u2019s when you get what\u2019s truly going on. That\u2019s when you realise you M Night Shyamalanned yourself. You&nbsp;suddenly understand that what you\u2019re actually making is another horror \u2013 a story where someone, in a really grotesque fashion, is killing your beloved cinema. And that someone? It can\u2019t be, can it? But it can. Oh my God, man \u2013 that someone is you! You killed cinema! IT WAS YOU ALL ALONG!</p> <p>Roll credits.

Then again, you loved cinema above all things, so what you did with your life was always going to be important. You grew up idolising all those guys: Marty, Francis, Quentin. Mister Spielberg. Age 17, you accepted you shared their destiny. Aged 19, you decided your autobiography was going to be called My Auteurbiography. Aged 21, girls had sex with you to stop you explaining Mulholland Drive to them for another hour. The next morning, all you had to say was: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that structurally, it\u2019s a Moebius strip \u2026 \u201d and they\u2019d do it again. Aged 26, you were fresh out of graduate film school and keen to establish yourself as an uncompromising maverick, who was also available to shoot fragrance commercials. Aged 27, you read the phrase \u201cSundance-to-spandex pipeline\u201d about how promising young indie directors get sucked into the superhero sausage factory \u2013 and passed it off as your own in conversation on your first date with a model and award-winning brunch DJ who recently curated her own range of raw antidepressants. Aged 31 you made Breakfast Serial, a low-budget satirical slasher movie about a diner chef hunting down unfavourable TripAdvisor reviewers. A thin-year festival hit, it played at Sundance, where you self-effacingly mentioned to the audience that critics were already calling it \u201ca slow-burn funscape that\u2019s as deliberately undigestible as a human femur\u201d. Barry Diller sent peonies. Also aged 31, you married the model and were formally designated a power couple. Sure, OK, Paper magazine?! For you, all that stuff was just noise that you weren\u2019t going to let get in the way of the work. Even so, you bought a $2,000 chore jacket. You started calling watches \u201ctimepieces\u201d. And then, aged 32, the comic-book studio wanted you. They wanted you in the way that you had always wanted to be wanted, maybe even by your wife. They wanted you to take your time thinking about it but, obviously, they wanted to announce your movie at Comic-Con next week. You told reporters what an honour it was to put a new spin on a character whose stories defined your childhood. (Did they? It didn\u2019t matter. No one could possibly have any way of checking.) The studio said they loved your uncompromising vision, so you knew you could persuade them to make it darker and grittier. You knew you wouldn\u2019t get caught up in the machine. Needle scratch. Cut to now. Now, aged 36, you are sitting in a trailer an hour before dawn on a location shoot in a quasi-democracy to which the studio has deployed you in order to take advantage of the tax credits. You are reading an article in the Hollywood Reporter about how Christopher Nolan has total creative control over Current, his new movie about Nikola Tesla. Before that, you read an article about Yorgos Lanthimos developing an intensely complex and disquieting story about a power struggle within an uncontacted tribe. And you? Your movie is about a man who can grow his really strong hair really fast, fashioning it into makeshift weapons and life aids. This is very isolating for him, and also some people killed his parents when he was a kid. Your movie was supposed to take nine months but you have now been on it for two-and-a-half years. It is in its second run of reshoots and has had more script revisions than Wikipedia. And possibly more writers. It\u2019s bad enough not having an ending but now they\u2019re rethinking the beginning. Thematically, it is both for and against the idea of war. You dimly recall it once had a climate message. The shoot has produced 10,000 tonnes of CO2 (so far). Ninety-seven days into shooting you developed a nervous tic, a compulsive humming that frequently ruins takes. Or maybe improves them, it\u2019s hard to tell. The crew used to like you; then they hated you; then they pitied you. Your wife now lives with Chris Pine. You want to quit, but if you do, the studio will quietly tell the entire industry that you are difficult. But today your jailers are going to let you choose the name of a space parliament that they will later cut from the movie. Won\u2019t that be fun? No, would seem to be the obvious answer. Later, when you nail on a smile for the premiere, you\u2019ll find what else they cut at the absolute last minute. As for the stuff they added \u2026 your movie was cuckooed. The set of a vulnerable person \u2013 you \u2013 was moved into and taken over by studio forces who wanted to use it to advance their own enterprises. They pumped it full of last-minute product placement, random artefacts and non-sequitur scenes whose sole purpose is to tee up and serve characters and plotlines in other, infinitely more important movies in the universe. You come to realise that the movie you sold your soul for is a kind of indentured straight man. You have made a $250m content butler. Marketing will push it to $400m. Your studio producers kept telling you that the directors who thrive in the franchise movie era are \u201cthe ones who know what they don\u2019t know\u201d. You finally understand that this was a nice way of saying your role was always more ceremonial than operational. You were only ever a foam-suited sports mascot, or a regimental goat. For now, hiding in your trailer, you accept your real place in this comic universe. You are both the most important and the least important cultural unit you have ever been. You are a superhero franchise movie director. Or \u2026 are you? And that\u2019s when the real twist hits you. That\u2019s when you get what\u2019s truly going on. That\u2019s when you realise you M Night Shyamalanned yourself. You suddenly understand that what you\u2019re actually making is another horror \u2013 a story where someone, in a really grotesque fashion, is killing your beloved cinema. And that someone? It can\u2019t be, can it? But it can. Oh my God, man \u2013 that someone is you! You killed cinema! IT WAS YOU ALL ALONG! Roll credits. And no \u2013 you can\u2019t have your name taken off them. The Franchise begins 21 October, Sky Comedy and Now. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 October 2024 to correct a misspelling of Nikola Tesla\u2019s name.",

      "body": "<p>As the US presidential election looms, the billionaire Mark Cuban has emerged as an energetic campaign surrogate for Kamala Harris. Making the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/31/kamala-harris-mark-cuban-fundraising\">case</a> for business leaders to support the Democrat over Donald Trump, Cuban has drawn on his experience (in tech, investments, <a href=\"https://costplusdrugs.com/\">healthcare</a> and now sports, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/24/mark-cuban-backs-biden-why-was-he-so-keen-to-sell-the-mavs-to-trump-megadonors\">minority owner</a> of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team), celebrity (as a lead \u201cshark\u201d for 15 seasons of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/business/daniel-lubetzky-shark-tank-mark-cuban.html#:~:text=bravado%20and%20style.-,%E2%80%9CI%20wasn't%20going%20to%20try%20to%20fit%20in.,building%20his%20prescription%20drug%20company.\">ABC\u2019s Shark Tank</a>) and willingness to confront Trump-supporting billionaires, Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/mark-cuban-elon-musk-diversity-dei-program-business\">prominent among them</a>.</p> <p>The road has not been smooth. Last week, Cuban clashed with congressional progressives after <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/newsletter/10/09/2024/a-historic-storm?utm_source=nowshare&amp;utm_medium=principals&amp;utm_campaign=flagshipnumbered7\">criticizing</a> Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, over her tech-sector antitrust work. That issue and others, including Cuban\u2019s thoughts on Trump\u2019s championing of tariffs and the perennial question of whether Cuban harbors presidential ambitions of his own, are addressed below, in emailed answers to 10 questions posed by Guardian writers and editors.</p> <p><strong>Why did you start speaking up in support of Kamala Harris? Do you coordinate with the campaign, or set your own course?</strong></p> <p>I think she would be a far better president than her opponent. And I do my own scheduling. We are discussing them setting some things up for closer to the election [on Thursday, Cuban appeared with Harris at a rally in Wisconsin].</p> <p><strong>Can Harris appeal to white working-class voters? If so, how?</strong></p> <p>I think her appeal to everyone is the same. She is ethical, not an ideologue, open-minded, analytical, she wants to solve problems no matter where they come from. She has said she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet.</p> <p>She understands technology and the importance it has to national security, far, far better than her opponent. When Donald Trump talks about AI [artificial intelligence] he only talks in term of how much electricity it uses. Kamala understands the strategic, economic and defense opportunities it presents.</p> <p>I have worked with her team to bring pharmaceutical costs down significantly and that\u2019s just the beginning in her reducing healthcare costs.</p> <p><strong>Why are men such a problem for the Harris campaign? How would you appeal to them?</strong></p> <p>I think we are living in a world of memes. Donald Trump does a great job talking in soundbites rather than with substance. Soundbites are more meme-friendly. I also believe that the algorithms of social media reinforce those memes, which benefits Trump with men.</p> <p><strong>You have known and dealt with Trump for some time. Do you think he has deteriorated with age, as his critics charge? If so, how?</strong></p> <p>Yes. His speeches are longer, more rambling. The number of non-sequiturs continues to grow. He used to try to give direct answers to questions. I don\u2019t think he even tries or is able [to do that] any longer.</p> <p><strong>What would a second Trump presidency mean for </strong><strong>the US, and why should businesspeople choose Harris over Trump?</strong></p> <p>Stability is the key for larger businesses. They don\u2019t want to wake up to a tweet or a new tariff that impacts their business, because Donald got mad at someone.</p> <p>I think tariffs are also a big issue for businesses of all sizes: 10%, 20%, 60%, 200%, they are paid by the importer and passed on to customers.</p> <p>Trump uses tariffs as a threat to American companies, even when it helps their foreign competitors. A 200% tariff against John Deere makes their foreign competitors less expensive [Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/29/business/trump-tariffs-deere-attack-companies/index.html\">threatened</a> the tariff if the company were to move some production to Mexico], even after a 10% or 20% tariff against their products. That\u2019s insane.</p> <p>So many small entrepreneurs import products. But tariffs could literally put small retailers and manufacturers out of business.</p> <p>Small businesses don\u2019t have the pricing elasticity of larger companies. They can\u2019t pass on the incremental and administrative costs associated with tariffs.</p> <p>Trump doesn\u2019t understand how he will put small retailers and manufacturers out of business: 75% of manufacturers have fewer than 20 employees. Tariffs on the inputs to their manufactured products could put them out of business.</p> <p>Under Kamala, small-business benefits would benefit significantly. Ninety-seven per cent-plus of small companies are <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/subchapter_s_corporation\">Sub S</a> or <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc\">LLC</a>, which means they are taxed at their personal rates. For all of those entrepreneurs, if their incomes are $400,000 or under (which is 95% or more), their taxes won\u2019t go up and will probably go down.</p> <p>Kamala is also proposing increasing the ability to expense startup costs up to $50,000 (a 10-time increase), and she has childcare tax credits and tax credits for newborns that will allow parents to get the help they need to keep their businesses running.</p> <p><strong>A lot of other successful business people \u2013 Elon Musk, Peter Thiel \u2013 are backing Trump. What\u2019s his appeal? Why do you think they are wrong?</strong></p> <p>I can only guess. I think they believe they can manipulate him.</p> <p><strong>Has Harris told you how her business policies will differ from Biden\u2019s, and can she reconcile her big-business-friendly stance with her stand against price-gouging?</strong></p> <p>She has understandably not wanted to throw her current boss under the bus.

      "bodyText": "As the US presidential election looms, the billionaire Mark Cuban has emerged as an energetic campaign surrogate for Kamala Harris. Making the case for business leaders to support the Democrat over Donald Trump, Cuban has drawn on his experience (in tech, investments, healthcare and now sports, as minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team), celebrity (as a lead \u201cshark\u201d for 15 seasons of ABC\u2019s Shark Tank) and willingness to confront Trump-supporting billionaires, Elon Musk prominent among them. The road has not been smooth. Last week, Cuban clashed with congressional progressives after criticizing Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, over her tech-sector antitrust work. That issue and others, including Cuban\u2019s thoughts on Trump\u2019s championing of tariffs and the perennial question of whether Cuban harbors presidential ambitions of his own, are addressed below, in emailed answers to 10 questions posed by Guardian writers and editors. Why did you start speaking up in support of Kamala Harris? Do you coordinate with the campaign, or set your own course? I think she would be a far better president than her opponent. And I do my own scheduling. We are discussing them setting some things up for closer to the election [on Thursday, Cuban appeared with Harris at a rally in Wisconsin]. Can Harris appeal to white working-class voters? If so, how? I think her appeal to everyone is the same. She is ethical, not an ideologue, open-minded, analytical, she wants to solve problems no matter where they come from. She has said she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet. She understands technology and the importance it has to national security, far, far better than her opponent. When Donald Trump talks about AI [artificial intelligence] he only talks in term of how much electricity it uses. Kamala understands the strategic, economic and defense opportunities it presents. I have worked with her team to bring pharmaceutical costs down significantly and that\u2019s just the beginning in her reducing healthcare costs. Why are men such a problem for the Harris campaign? How would you appeal to them? I think we are living in a world of memes. Donald Trump does a great job talking in soundbites rather than with substance. Soundbites are more meme-friendly. I also believe that the algorithms of social media reinforce those memes, which benefits Trump with men. You have known and dealt with Trump for some time. Do you think he has deteriorated with age, as his critics charge? If so, how? Yes. His speeches are longer, more rambling. The number of non-sequiturs continues to grow. He used to try to give direct answers to questions. I don\u2019t think he even tries or is able [to do that] any longer. What would a second Trump presidency mean for the US, and why should businesspeople choose Harris over Trump? Stability is the key for larger businesses. They don\u2019t want to wake up to a tweet or a new tariff that impacts their business, because Donald got mad at someone. I think tariffs are also a big issue for businesses of all sizes: 10%, 20%, 60%, 200%, they are paid by the importer and passed on to customers. Trump uses tariffs as a threat to American companies, even when it helps their foreign competitors. A 200% tariff against John Deere makes their foreign competitors less expensive [Trump threatened the tariff if the company were to move some production to Mexico], even after a 10% or 20% tariff against their products. That\u2019s insane. So many small entrepreneurs import products. But tariffs could literally put small retailers and manufacturers out of business. Small businesses don\u2019t have the pricing elasticity of larger companies. They can\u2019t pass on the incremental and administrative costs associated with tariffs. Trump doesn\u2019t understand how he will put small retailers and manufacturers out of business: 75% of manufacturers have fewer than 20 employees. Tariffs on the inputs to their manufactured products could put them out of business. Under Kamala, small-business benefits would benefit significantly. Ninety-seven per cent-plus of small companies are Sub S or LLC, which means they are taxed at their personal rates. For all of those entrepreneurs, if their incomes are $400,000 or under (which is 95% or more), their taxes won\u2019t go up and will probably go down. Kamala is also proposing increasing the ability to expense startup costs up to $50,000 (a 10-time increase), and she has childcare tax credits and tax credits for newborns that will allow parents to get the help they need to keep their businesses running. A lot of other successful business people \u2013 Elon Musk, Peter Thiel \u2013 are backing Trump. What\u2019s his appeal? Why do you think they are wrong? I can only guess. I think they believe they can manipulate him. Has Harris told you how her business policies will differ from Biden\u2019s, and can she reconcile her big-business-friendly stance with her stand against price-gouging? She has understandably not wanted to throw her current boss under the bus. But the differences are stark. She came in at 28% for corporate and capital gains, far lower than what Biden wanted. She doesn\u2019t want a tax on unrealized capital gains. I think she has shown she will be far stricter on the border. Why do you think a President Harris \u2013 or presumably President Trump in a second term \u2013 should remove Lina Khan as chair of the FTC, over her stance on antitrust issues? Are you prepared for the \u201cbrawl\u201d with progressives that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has promised on the issue? I should rephrase what I said before [\u201cIf it were me, I wouldn\u2019t\u201d keep Khan, and: \u201cThe bigger picture is, she\u2019s hurting more than she\u2019s helping,\u201d to Semafor last Tuesday]. I gave my opinion, which was that while I think Lina has done a great job with PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers], scam companies and more, I prioritize AI, because of its importance to our economy, and believe our largest AI companies should not be broken up. That said, I have no intention of requesting or suggesting that she be fired. You have said you would have supported a business-minded Republican such as Mitt Romney or Jeff Flake had they stood for president. Can that sort of Republican ever be nominated again? What do you say to such Republicans \u2013 Romney, Larry Hogan and others \u2013 who won\u2019t back Trump but will not vote for Harris? I think they will vote for her.

There is a huge open space for living, dining and cooking, with two ovens, two fridges and a big round dining table. A former stable is now a cosy bar with a woodburner, piano and dartboard. The wellness area has a wood-fired sauna, cold plunge bath and outdoor shower. Up to five dogs are welcome \u2013 and can run free in the fenced garden and livestock-free field. Ludlow is a foodie hotspot, with a market packed with local food producers on six days a week.<br><em>Sleeps 15, from \u00a32,691 for three nights <a href=\"https://www.redfordfarmbarns.co.uk/\">redfordfarmbarns.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Barn Drift, Norfolk</strong></h2>    <p>What was once a cattle shed is now unrecognisable as a lovely eight-bedroom Norfolk flint house. It has a&nbsp;dining hall seating up to 45, a modern kitchen and a drawing room with woodburner, and some rooms have roll-top baths. Outside are three linked walled gardens with olive and fig trees&nbsp;and roses and a Big Green Egg for barbecuing.

It has eight bedrooms \u2013 six en suite and two sharing a bathroom \u2013 plus a kitchen, two living rooms, a dining room and a studio for yoga or arts activities. Set in three-quarters of an acre at the foot of Howgill Fells, it also offers a firepit, egg chairs and hammocks in the garden (and an ice bath for Wim Hof wannabes). Cautley Spout, England\u2019s highest waterfall, is a short walk away, and the market town of Sedbergh is a five-minute drive.<br><em>Sleeps 16, from </em><em>\u00a31,240</em><em> for two nights or </em><em>\u00a32,950</em><em> a week, <a href=\"https://stmarksstays.co.uk/\">stmarksstays.co.uk</a></em><br></p> <h2><strong>The Sail Loft, Aberdeenshire</strong></h2>    <p>This former sail- and rope-making loft, which dates back to the 1700s, in the seaside village of Portsoy, is a good choice for very large groups, as it can sleep 27. Now a four-star hostel, the accommodation also includes a Georgian house and two cottages, and was restored by a local community enterprise. Rooms sleep three, four and six, with ample space to hang out in the open-plan kitchen, dining area and lounge. There is secure storage for 25 bikes, a wood-fired hot tub and a walled garden with a barbecue. The Sail Loft overlooks Links Bay beach on the Moray Firth \u2013 perfect for coastal walks and cycles \u2013 and guests can join a boat-building workshop.

The opulent south wing includes five private apartments and a shared Victorian kitchen. Guests can also hire reception rooms such as the state dining room, which is hung with portraits by artists George Romney and Peter Lely. The castle is closed to the public from October to the end of April, so residents have the castle grounds and the wider woodland and parkland all to themselves. It is just a mile from the market town of Lauder, which has plenty of cafes, shops and pubs.<br><em>Sleeps 16, from </em><em>\u00a34,850</em><em> for three nights, <a href=\"https://www.crabtreeandcrabtree.com/properties/south-wing-thirlestane-castle/\">crabtreeandcrabtree.com</a></em><br></p> <h2><strong>Milden Hall, Suffolk</strong></h2>    <p>Milden Hall is a 200-hectare family farm near Lavenham, and the magnificent Tudor barn is ideal for groups who are happy to sleep Tudor-style \u2013 in a largely open-plan setting, in four-posters, doubles and singles dotted around the barn and on a mezzanine. For those who prefer more privacy, the adjoining cart lodge and potting shed have a few private rooms. Guests can stage a Tudor feast on long banqueting tables, complete with wooden platters and goblets and a roaring fire (or book a local chef to do&nbsp;the hard work) \u2013 and even dress up&nbsp;in period costumes (more than 50&nbsp;are&nbsp;available). The farm also has a&nbsp;modern bunkhouse, sleeping 22 in&nbsp;five bedrooms.<br><em>Sleeps 25, </em><em>two-night weekends from \u00a31,600, <a href=\"https://www.thehall-milden.co.uk/the-tudor-barn\">thehall-milden.co.uk</a></em><br><em> </em></p> <h2><strong>Gupton Farm Surf Lodge, Pembrokeshire</strong></h2>    <p>This former farmstead is now a National Trust holiday home for surfers, a short walk&nbsp;from Freshwater West, which has&nbsp;some of Wales\u2019s best waves. It is&nbsp;simple but comfortable, with a&nbsp;kitchen/diner and a table for 10&nbsp;people, a&nbsp;living room with a woodburner, three twin bedrooms, one double, and&nbsp;a shower room and a&nbsp;bathroom. There\u2019s a small garden with a barbecue surrounded by 325 hectares of farmland. The lodge is on the Gupton Farm campsite, so more people can stay nearby in tents and campervans. The Outer Reef surf school is based here too, if anyone needs a lesson. Other Pembrokeshire beaches, including Barafundle Bay and West Angle, are within easy reach for kayaking, coasteering, and coastal and beach walks.<br><em>Sleeps 10, from \u00a3454 for three nights or </em><em>\u00a3699</em><em> a week, <a href=\"https://www.groupaccommodation.com/properties/national-trust-gupton-farm-surf-lodge-pembrokeshire\">groupaccommodation.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Wye Valley Bunkhouse, Powys</strong></h2>    <p>This Grade II-listed Welsh Baptist chapel has seen a complete change of personality, into a contemporary fun house complete with a spiral slide from the first floor, and table tennis and pool tables. The large lounge has a woodburner and the kitchen/dining area has a long table with benches to seat a crowd; the huge chapel windows fill the space with light. Most guests sleep in smart bunkbeds, but there is also one double room and another with four singles. The bunkhouse is in&nbsp;the village of Glasbury, beside the River Wye and at the foot of the Black Mountains. Wye Valley Canoes is next door for trips down the river, and it is three miles to the bookshop mecca of Hay-on-Wye.<br><em>Sleeps 18, from \u00a3</em><em>1,920 for a three-night weekend, <a href=\"https://www.coolstays.com/property/wye-valley-bunkhouse/26045\">coolstays.com</a></em><br></p> <h2><strong>The Cider Press, Somerset</strong></h2>    <p>This converted barn is now a 10-bedroom luxury retreat. The kitchen and dining area has floor-to-ceiling windows, bifold doors and a long dining table overlooking the garden, and there is a games room with a vaulted ceiling and a snooker table, projector wall and open fire. Best of all, there\u2019s a heated indoor pool&nbsp;\u2013 and the tennis court in the grounds is a big draw too. The property is on 100 acres of private land&nbsp;near the village of Stawley. Guests receive a welcome hamper of&nbsp;local produce, including bread, milk, honey, eggs and fizz.<br><em>Sleeps 20, from \u00a3</em><em>5,750 for two nights, <a href=\"https://sandandstoneescapes.com/property/the-cider-press/\">sandandstoneescapes.com</a></em><br></p> <h2><strong>Dalehead Bunkhouse, Peak&nbsp;District</strong></h2>    <p>Groups can get off the beaten track at&nbsp;this cosy stone National Trust bunkhouse deep in the Edale valley, reached via a narrow lane. There are three dormitories with bunkbeds, two communal shower rooms, a kitchen and a living/dining area with a logburner, sofas and tables for up to 20, lots of exposed brick, rustic beams and low doorways. The small garden is&nbsp;bordered by a stream. Beyond is farmland, moorland and great walking: Mam Tor is within hiking distance and the jagged gritstone of&nbsp;Dark Peak can be reached on foot in&nbsp;an hour. Two dogs are welcome to stay too.<br><em>Sleeps 20, three-night weekend from \u00a31,268, <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays/peak-district-derbyshire/dalehead-bunkhouse\">nationaltrust.org.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Papple Steading, East Lothian</strong></h2>    <p>Papple Steading near Haddington, 17 miles east of Edinburgh, comprises a farmhouse and cottage (both sleeping eight) and two bothies (each sleeping two), and from next year a restored granary (sleeping six). Each of the four properties has a kitchen with an Aga, and the farmhouse has a drawing room and a dining room seating 22. There is a chill-out wing with library, TV room and garden room, and exclusive use of two hectares (six acres) of lawns, paddocks and woodland. Evenings can be spent around the firepit by the ruins of the Papple Convent. The wider grounds have a wildflower meadow and another seven hectares of woodland. And from Drem station, 10 miles away, it\u2019s a 25-minute train journey to Edinburgh.<br><em>Sleeps </em><em>20, from \u00a33,987 for three-night weekend or four nights midweek, <a href=\"https://www.crabtreeandcrabtree.com/properties/papple-steading/\">crabtreeandcrabtree.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Calverley Old Hall, West Yorkshire</strong></h2>    <p>This mansion, which dates from the 1320s, has been owned by the Landmark Trust since 1981, but guests were only able to stay in the north wing. Now, after a massive restoration project, the whole site is available to hire. That includes the Great Hall with its 15th-century hammerbeam roof, and a newly discovered Tudor painted chamber. There is wood panelling, inglenook fireplaces, a gallery and all the nooks and crannies to be expected from 700 years of history. The hall has three doubles and two twin bedrooms, and is in the village of Calverley, about seven miles from Leeds.<br><em>Sleeps 10, three nights from \u00a31,</em><em>567</em><em>, <a href=\"https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/calverley-old-hall-5219/#Overview\">landmarktrust.org.uk</a></em><br></p>",

There\u2019s a small garden with a barbecue surrounded by 325 hectares of farmland. The lodge is on the Gupton Farm campsite, so more people can stay nearby in tents and campervans. The Outer Reef surf school is based here too, if anyone needs a lesson. Other Pembrokeshire beaches, including Barafundle Bay and West Angle, are within easy reach for kayaking, coasteering, and coastal and beach walks. Sleeps 10, from \u00a3454 for three nights or \u00a3699 a week, groupaccommodation.com Wye Valley Bunkhouse, Powys This Grade II-listed Welsh Baptist chapel has seen a complete change of personality, into a contemporary fun house complete with a spiral slide from the first floor, and table tennis and pool tables. The large lounge has a woodburner and the kitchen/dining area has a long table with benches to seat a crowd; the huge chapel windows fill the space with light. Most guests sleep in smart bunkbeds, but there is also one double room and another with four singles. The bunkhouse is in the village of Glasbury, beside the River Wye and at the foot of the Black Mountains. Wye Valley Canoes is next door for trips down the river, and it is three miles to the bookshop mecca of Hay-on-Wye. Sleeps 18, from \u00a31,920 for a three-night weekend, coolstays.com The Cider Press, Somerset This converted barn is now a 10-bedroom luxury retreat. The kitchen and dining area has floor-to-ceiling windows, bifold doors and a long dining table overlooking the garden, and there is a games room with a vaulted ceiling and a snooker table, projector wall and open fire. Best of all, there\u2019s a heated indoor pool \u2013 and the tennis court in the grounds is a big draw too. The property is on 100 acres of private land near the village of Stawley. Guests receive a welcome hamper of local produce, including bread, milk, honey, eggs and fizz. Sleeps 20, from \u00a35,750 for two nights, sandandstoneescapes.com Dalehead Bunkhouse, Peak District Groups can get off the beaten track at this cosy stone National Trust bunkhouse deep in the Edale valley, reached via a narrow lane. There are three dormitories with bunkbeds, two communal shower rooms, a kitchen and a living/dining area with a logburner, sofas and tables for up to 20, lots of exposed brick, rustic beams and low doorways. The small garden is bordered by a stream. Beyond is farmland, moorland and great walking: Mam Tor is within hiking distance and the jagged gritstone of Dark Peak can be reached on foot in an hour. Two dogs are welcome to stay too. Sleeps 20, three-night weekend from \u00a31,268, nationaltrust.org.uk Papple Steading, East Lothian Papple Steading near Haddington, 17 miles east of Edinburgh, comprises a farmhouse and cottage (both sleeping eight) and two bothies (each sleeping two), and from next year a restored granary (sleeping six).

Now, after a massive restoration project, the whole site is available to hire. That includes the Great Hall with its 15th-century hammerbeam roof, and a newly discovered Tudor painted chamber. There is wood panelling, inglenook fireplaces, a gallery and all the nooks and crannies to be expected from 700 years of history. The hall has three doubles and two twin bedrooms, and is in the village of Calverley, about seven miles from Leeds. Sleeps 10, three nights from \u00a31,567, landmarktrust.org.uk",

      "bodyText": "More than a fifth of councillors have received death threats or threats of violence, a survey has found. The survey has been released by the Local Government Association (LGA) before its annual conference next week. It is calling for more to be done to improve councillors\u2019 safety. Of the 1,734 people who responded \u2013 about 10% of all councillors in England and Wales \u2013 about half (49%) said the abuse had got worse over the past 12 months, while 73% had experienced abuse or intimidation in their role in the past year. Councillors also said high levels of abuse, threats and misinformation online had put them off using social media or engaging with debate online. The survey also found that: One in 10 councillors had someone come to their home in a way that they considered intimidating or inappropriate, and 43% had requested to withhold their home address from the public because of safety concerns. Ten per cent had received a threat of damage to their property, and 5% had experienced damage to property. Eleven per cent said they had considered modifications to their home security but had been unable to make them for financial or personal reasons. Nineteen per cent of respondents had experienced abuse or intimidation relating to a protected characteristic. Sex was the most commonly cited characteristic for which respondents had suffered abuse or intimidation. Fifty-seven per cent of respondents reported that their authority\u2019s arrangements for protecting councillors were very or fairly effective. The LGA is calling on the government to improve councillors\u2019 safety, including by allowing them to withhold their addresses from publication and by establishing a permanent cross-Whitehall unit to monitor, assess and address the abuse and intimidation of locally elected politicians and candidates. Marianne Overton, the chair of the LGA\u2019s civility in public life steering group, said: \u201cThese results are troubling \u2013 not only do they highlight the concerns for the safety and wellbeing of councillors but show how violence and intimidation can be corrosive to our democracy, as they discourage people from taking up public office and from speaking fairly on vital issues. \u201cPeople must be able to represent their communities safely and without fear. We need cohesive communities that can debate differences in peace. Poor behaviour doesn\u2019t just impact the individual, it hurts everyone in communities, reducing the opportunity for open debate on important local issues. This has got to stop. \u201cWe need government to act decisively to ensure high levels of abuse do not become an accepted part of public life and that councillors are safe and confident as they carry out their vital elected role: working to represent their communities.\u201d",

This market wasn\u2019t just for Nabatieh, but for all the villages around,\u201d said Jaber, 30, gesturing at the ruined promenade, still smoking five days later.</p> <p>Children\u2019s clothes, computer parts and products from the now-levelled stores that used to line the market littered the ground, all covered in a layer of grey ash.</p> <p>Also hidden among the rubble was a fragment of the US-made munition that destroyed the marketplace. The tail fin of a joint direct attack munition (Jdam) \u2013 the guidance kit which turns dumb bombs ranging from 500-2,000lbs (230-910kg) into GPS-guided bombs \u2013 was found by the Guardian and verified by the crisis, conflict and arms division of Human Rights Watch. A week earlier, another US munition was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/11/us-made-munition-used-in-israeli-strike-on-central-beirut-shrapnel-shows\">found at the site of an Israeli airstrike that killed 22 people in central Beirut.</a></p>    <p>Similar scenes of destruction were repeated across Nabatieh, the second most populated city in south <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon\">Lebanon</a>, now eerily silent and devoid of life after a week of punishing airstrikes.</p> <p>Medical officials still left in the city said the wave of Israeli airstrikes had further degraded living conditions, in effect depopulating the city almost entirely. The UN said a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s territory was under evacuation orders by Israel. Amnesty International said the evacuation orders raise questions around whether the orders are intended to create mass displacement.</p> <p>Medical workers in Nabatieh said the strikes on Wednesday offered evidence of Israel\u2019s intention to provoke displacement. The strikes hit the city\u2019s municipal headquarters and killed members of the city\u2019s crisis cell \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/israeli-airstrike-kills-mayor-city-southern-lebanon\">including the mayor, Ahmad Kahil</a>, as they were distributing aid. The attacks also hit a building 100 metres (330ft) from the civil defence station, killing Naji Fahs, who had worked as a first responder for 22 years. In total, 16 people were killed and 52 wounded in the day\u2019s strikes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/lebanon_locator/giv-4559nwUzu7DwgLvL/\" data-alt=\"Map of Lebanon\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/lebanon_locator/giv-4559nwUzu7DwgLvL/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Israel said its strikes on Nabatieh were targeting Hezbollah installations. Fighting started after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel on 8 October last year \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas\u2019s attack the day before, but has escalated dramatically since 23 September, when Israel announced a renewed offensive against the group.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s military issued an evacuation order for the city on 3 October, as it has done with more than 70 villages across south Lebanon, but some people stayed, already having been displaced by fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. After this week\u2019s airstrikes, almost everyone left, leaving only medical workers and elderly people with reduced mobility.</p> <p>At Nabih Berri government university hospital, medical staff live on the premises with their families so that they can continue to serve the few city residents that remain. The hospital sits on a hill overlooking the city and its surroundings. Paramedics were stationed on the hilltop, where they sat smoking shisha and scanning the horizon.</p> <p>A distant thump and a wave of pressure announced a fresh airstrike on Thursday afternoon. A plume of smoke rose on a distant hill. \u201cYohmor,\u201d one of the men said, identifying by sight the village that was struck, about six miles away from the hospital. Immediately, an ambulance rushed off to check for survivors.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a huge amount of pressure on us. Of course, we try to remove our feelings when we are working,\u201d said Dr Hassan Wazni, the head of Nabih Berri. \u201cBut when you see someone who has lost his arm, shoulder-down, or your see a child who \u2026\u201d He trailed off.</p> <p>The hospital was suddenly overwhelmed with wounded people on Wednesday. \u201cThere were horrible sounds of airstrikes and then the ambulances started coming one after another, we couldn\u2019t believe this number of people could come in at once,\u201d Wazni said.</p> <p>The hospital has started to ration electricity, turning off power in nonessential units, after a power line leading to the hospital was cut by an airstrike. Electricity comes from a diesel-fed generator, but deliveries are few and far between. Drivers of fuel trucks take a great risk by travelling the road leading to Nabatieh, which is occasionally struck by Israeli aircraft. Basic supplies for the people remaining in the city are also threatened, as deliveries of food no longer come regularly.</p> <p>A delivery of 5,000 litres of diesel on Wednesday meant the hospital had enough to last another five days. Though the threat of running out of fuel, electricity and water worries the director, the hospital is well stocked with medicine and other supplies.</p> <p>Some time later, the ambulance returned from Yohmor, carrying a husband and wife injured by the airstrike. The man was taken to the emergency department, moaning in pain as doctors worked on him.</p> <p>The man\u2019s shoulder blade was broken and his lung punctured by shrapnel, a doctor said. The man lay on the operating table, covered in the same grey ash that covered the rest of Nabatieh, while surgeons inserted a tube into the shrapnel hole to suck out the blood which filled the cavity.</p>    <p>\u201cI was here in the 2006 [war] and this is 10 times worse, it\u2019s a brutal war. But we can\u2019t leave the hospital, what can I say?\u201d said Mukhtar Mroue, a general surgeon in the hospital, flexing his biceps in a show of bravado, blood staining his gloves.</p> <p>Mroue had received a call from a Danish number a few days earlier from a man speaking broken Arabic, telling him and his family to evacuate, similar to calls that Israel has made to residents living near areas that were soon to be bombed. Mroue decided to stay in Nabatieh regardless.</p> <p>At the town hall that had been bombed a day earlier, bags of lentils, cans of tomatoes and bread spilled out of a burned-out car that had been loaded up by municipal employees before Israel struck the building. <br><br>An administrator who was present at the time of the airstrike, Abbas Suloum, stood in front of the rubble holding lumps of flesh, covered in black dirt. It was unclear whose body they came from or even to which part of the body they belonged. Suloum said he had been finding little pieces of human flesh among the debris for the past day and that he was taking them to a nearby hospital for DNA testing.</p> <p>\u201cThis [building] belongs to the state and is meant to serve people, there are no rockets, weapons or ammunition here. We have bread, canned goods here. All of this is to displace people, but we are steadfast,\u201d Suloum said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/lebanese-healthcare-workers-fearful-as-growing-numbers-killed-in-strikes\">Lebanese healthcare workers fearful as growing numbers killed in strikes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier on Thursday, members of Nabatieh\u2019s civil defence gathered to accompany Fahs\u2019s coffin back to his village.

This market wasn\u2019t just for Nabatieh, but for all the villages around,\u201d said Jaber, 30, gesturing at the ruined promenade, still smoking five days later. Children\u2019s clothes, computer parts and products from the now-levelled stores that used to line the market littered the ground, all covered in a layer of grey ash. Also hidden among the rubble was a fragment of the US-made munition that destroyed the marketplace. The tail fin of a joint direct attack munition (Jdam) \u2013 the guidance kit which turns dumb bombs ranging from 500-2,000lbs (230-910kg) into GPS-guided bombs \u2013 was found by the Guardian and verified by the crisis, conflict and arms division of Human Rights Watch. A week earlier, another US munition was found at the site of an Israeli airstrike that killed 22 people in central Beirut. Similar scenes of destruction were repeated across Nabatieh, the second most populated city in south Lebanon, now eerily silent and devoid of life after a week of punishing airstrikes. Medical officials still left in the city said the wave of Israeli airstrikes had further degraded living conditions, in effect depopulating the city almost entirely. The UN said a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s territory was under evacuation orders by Israel. Amnesty International said the evacuation orders raise questions around whether the orders are intended to create mass displacement. Medical workers in Nabatieh said the strikes on Wednesday offered evidence of Israel\u2019s intention to provoke displacement. The strikes hit the city\u2019s municipal headquarters and killed members of the city\u2019s crisis cell \u2013 including the mayor, Ahmad Kahil, as they were distributing aid. The attacks also hit a building 100 metres (330ft) from the civil defence station, killing Naji Fahs, who had worked as a first responder for 22 years. In total, 16 people were killed and 52 wounded in the day\u2019s strikes. Israel said its strikes on Nabatieh were targeting Hezbollah installations. Fighting started after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel on 8 October last year \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Hamas\u2019s attack the day before, but has escalated dramatically since 23 September, when Israel announced a renewed offensive against the group. Israel\u2019s military issued an evacuation order for the city on 3 October, as it has done with more than 70 villages across south Lebanon, but some people stayed, already having been displaced by fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. After this week\u2019s airstrikes, almost everyone left, leaving only medical workers and elderly people with reduced mobility. At Nabih Berri government university hospital, medical staff live on the premises with their families so that they can continue to serve the few city residents that remain. The hospital sits on a hill overlooking the city and its surroundings. Paramedics were stationed on the hilltop, where they sat smoking shisha and scanning the horizon. A distant thump and a wave of pressure announced a fresh airstrike on Thursday afternoon. A plume of smoke rose on a distant hill. \u201cYohmor,\u201d one of the men said, identifying by sight the village that was struck, about six miles away from the hospital. Immediately, an ambulance rushed off to check for survivors. \u201cThere is a huge amount of pressure on us. Of course, we try to remove our feelings when we are working,\u201d said Dr Hassan Wazni, the head of Nabih Berri. \u201cBut when you see someone who has lost his arm, shoulder-down, or your see a child who \u2026\u201d He trailed off. The hospital was suddenly overwhelmed with wounded people on Wednesday. \u201cThere were horrible sounds of airstrikes and then the ambulances started coming one after another, we couldn\u2019t believe this number of people could come in at once,\u201d Wazni said. The hospital has started to ration electricity, turning off power in nonessential units, after a power line leading to the hospital was cut by an airstrike. Electricity comes from a diesel-fed generator, but deliveries are few and far between. Drivers of fuel trucks take a great risk by travelling the road leading to Nabatieh, which is occasionally struck by Israeli aircraft. Basic supplies for the people remaining in the city are also threatened, as deliveries of food no longer come regularly. A delivery of 5,000 litres of diesel on Wednesday meant the hospital had enough to last another five days. Though the threat of running out of fuel, electricity and water worries the director, the hospital is well stocked with medicine and other supplies. Some time later, the ambulance returned from Yohmor, carrying a husband and wife injured by the airstrike. The man was taken to the emergency department, moaning in pain as doctors worked on him. The man\u2019s shoulder blade was broken and his lung punctured by shrapnel, a doctor said. The man lay on the operating table, covered in the same grey ash that covered the rest of Nabatieh, while surgeons inserted a tube into the shrapnel hole to suck out the blood which filled the cavity. \u201cI was here in the 2006 [war] and this is 10 times worse, it\u2019s a brutal war. But we can\u2019t leave the hospital, what can I say?\u201d said Mukhtar Mroue, a general surgeon in the hospital, flexing his biceps in a show of bravado, blood staining his gloves. Mroue had received a call from a Danish number a few days earlier from a man speaking broken Arabic, telling him and his family to evacuate, similar to calls that Israel has made to residents living near areas that were soon to be bombed. Mroue decided to stay in Nabatieh regardless. At the town hall that had been bombed a day earlier, bags of lentils, cans of tomatoes and bread spilled out of a burned-out car that had been loaded up by municipal employees before Israel struck the building. An administrator who was present at the time of the airstrike, Abbas Suloum, stood in front of the rubble holding lumps of flesh, covered in black dirt. It was unclear whose body they came from or even to which part of the body they belonged. Suloum said he had been finding little pieces of human flesh among the debris for the past day and that he was taking them to a nearby hospital for DNA testing. \u201cThis [building] belongs to the state and is meant to serve people, there are no rockets, weapons or ammunition here. We have bread, canned goods here. All of this is to displace people, but we are steadfast,\u201d Suloum said. Earlier on Thursday, members of Nabatieh\u2019s civil defence gathered to accompany Fahs\u2019s coffin back to his village. Outside the civil defence station where he died, his blood had stained the earth, the dark red pooling in a puddle formed by a leaking firetruck. \u201cHe was never scared of anything, he would always beat us [to the site], we\u2019re younger than him, but he would always beat us there,\u201d Jaber said, tearing up. More than 115 healthcare workers and emergency responders have been killed by Israel since October last year \u2013 most of whom were killed over the last month. \u201cHe was carrying a message, and we want to finish that message. This is our biggest motivation, to keep going standing next to our people and finish our mission as civil defence,\u201d Jaber said.",

Another, retired teacher Richard Blewitt, 72, said he has had to move into rented accommodation because of the delays, adding: \u201cI am in despair as my debts mount.\u201d At the heart of the problems is the valuation of people\u2019s pension pots, and changes to the way these are calculated. When someone is getting divorced, they will typically need to get information on the value of their pension in order to allow the courts to consider whether or not it should be shared with their ex-partner and, if so, how much they should get. Current and former teachers who are getting divorced have to contact Teachers\u2019 Pensions \u2013 which administers the Teachers\u2019 Pension Scheme on behalf of the Department for Education \u2013 to request a cash equivalent transfer value (CETV). This shows how much they have built up in the scheme. Without a transfer value, it is difficult or impossible to reach a financial settlement in a divorce. The government\u2019s MoneyHelper website says that if you qualify for a CETV, it must be provided within three months of you asking, but some teachers said they have been waiting a year or more, and a few said they had been hanging on for more than 18 months. Delays seem to have started after changes to the \u201cdiscount rate\u201d used to work out contribution rates into public sector schemes, according to the former pensions minister Steve Webb, now a partner at the pension consultants LCP. Things were further complicated by a court judgment that found that government changes to public sector pensions in 2015 fell foul of age discrimination laws. \u201cThe resolution involves giving people a choice at retirement as to whether they want to be treated as having been in the old scheme or the new scheme between 2015 and 2022.

Waiting for her at Lake Tamansari were the five women pictured, local talent hired to take part as models. For the next four hours, Ariani dressed the women, positioned them and various elements in the warm water, and climbed up and down a ladder with her phone. She took about 100 photographs from different angles. \u201cIn the centre you can see a very common boat called a perahu mayang, and on the water, lotus flowers and enormous lily pads,\u201d Ariani says. \u201cI chose a rainbow of colours for the clothing to bring vibrancy to the image, and each woman is wearing a traditional bamboo hat.\u201d Back home later that day, Ariani applied some minor edits to sharpen the image a little. Reflecting on the picture now, she says she is proud of what they created that day. \u201cI wanted to show how colourful life can be, and I think I did that. I hope others looking at this image take a moment to appreciate the beauty of life.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What thoughts would go through the mind of a king exiled from his country for more than a century? What if that monarch took the form of a wooden statue boxed up for transportation from France to west Africa? Would he worry about recognising his native land? Perhaps his musings might turn to the abstract: \u201cWithin me resonates infinity.\u201d It would be a challenge for any film-maker to choose an inanimate object, however resonant, as her philosophical protagonist and narrator \u2013 but French-Senegalese director Mati Diop does just this to powerful effect in her new feature <em>Dahomey</em>.</p> <p>Part documentary, part visual and sonic poem, <em>Dahomey</em> follows a consignment of historical artefacts as they are returned by the French government to their source in the former African nation of Dahomey, now Benin. This year\u2019s winner of the Berlin film festival\u2019s top prize, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/24/mati-diops-documentary-dahomey-wins-top-prize-at-berlin-film-festival#:~:text=Mati%20Diop's%20documentary%20Dahomey%20wins,Berlin%20film%20festival%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\">the Golden Bear</a>, <em>Dahomey</em> is the latest triumph for Diop, 42, who for a decade and a half has been a much-admired presence in world cinema, first as an actor, then as a director. She made a memorable acting debut in 2008 in Claire Denis\u2019s hypnotic urban reverie <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/12/35-shots-of-rum-review\">35 Shots of Rum</a></em> and later became the first Black female director to have a feature in competition in Cannes. That was 2019\u2019s visionary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/atlantics-review-mati-diop-dakar-love-story-senegal\">Atlantics</a></em>, a story of young Senegalese men who attempt the perilous journey to Europe by boat \u2013 only to return as ghosts.</p>    <p><em>Dahomey</em> tells of another return. Here, the journey back to Africa is that of a set of royal treasures \u2013 controversially, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/art-benin-looted-african-nation-french-army-priceless-artefacts-treasure\">mere 26 items</a> among several thousand looted by troops after France\u2019s 1892 invasion of Dahomey. Sitting in the library of a central London hotel, in town to present her film at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">BFI London film festival</a>, Diop explains in French that while the restitution of these artefacts began in 2021, she had already been contemplating a fiction feature on the theme for some years.</p> <p>\u201cIt was going to be about an African mask telling its own story, from being captured to the day it comes home \u2013 and in between, the experience of exile in Europe. I was about to start writing \u2013 then I read that the royal treasures would be returned.\u201d</p> <p>Diop has talked about <em>Dahomey</em> as \u201c<em>un film d\u2019anticipation</em>\u201d \u2013 which in French could mean a science-fiction movie. Indeed, there is something extremely futuristic and techno-conscious about the film, not least in the way that that statue \u2013 a <em> </em>\u201cbo\u201d<em>,</em><em> </em>or power figure, of the Dahomeyan king Ghezo \u2013 delivers its voiceover in electronically processed tones.</p> <p>But Diop also means \u201canticipation\u201d literally, she says, because she never expected the items\u2019 repatriation to take place in the foreseeable future. \u201cI saw it happening in 2070 or 2080, I couldn\u2019t imagine it earlier \u2013 nothing in French or European politics suggested we were ready to recognise colonisation as a crime against humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Learning that the statues and other artefacts would return to Benin, Diop realised that she needed to get to work fast and film their transportation: \u201cI felt it was my duty.\u201d She was helped by the Senegalese writer and academic Felwine Sarr, co-author of a study on restitution commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Sarr helped oil the wheels with the Benin government, Diop says: \u201cThey understood that I needed to be with the works all the time in order to tell the story from the statues\u2019 point of view \u2013 and they understood that this wasn\u2019t the government\u2019s film. It had to be my film \u2013 and they respected that.\u201d</p> <p>A key section of <em>Dahomey</em> shows a debate that Diop organised among Beninese students, who discuss the significance of the artworks\u2019 return. Their comments cut to the heart of <em>Dahomey</em>\u2019s broader theme \u2013 notably when one young woman, a native speaker of the Fon language, says that when she learned about her own culture, it was in French.</p>    <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to hear those words coming from the continent itself,\u201d Diop says. \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to how much you can hear the word \u2018colonialism\u2019 from academic work \u2013 sooner or later, you have to hear it from the people who live with its consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Diop has known Africa since early childhood. She was born in Paris to a French mother and a Senegalese father \u2013 singer-guitarist Wasis Diop, for whom Mati shot an atmospheric music video in 2021. It was her mother who took her on regular visits to Senegal as a child.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to her, because otherwise I\u2019d be like many mixed-race people, disconnected from a part of myself. The way things work in France for the descendants of immigrants, everything is organised so that you renounce your double culture. At 25, I had to fight to find the African part of me.\u201d</p> <p>Diop grew up in Paris\u2019s eastern 12th arrondissement<em> </em>in<em> </em>an area she describes as \u201cnot working class, not bourgeois either \u2013 tr\u00e8s boring\u201d. She now lives in southern Paris\u2019s Chinatown district, studded with high-rises. She made a short there during the Covid pandemic, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2Bd77yfvNM\">In My Room</a></em>; showing Diop alone in her 24th-floor flat, musing on solitude and her late maternal grandmother, and modelling assorted Miu Miu frocks, the work \u2013 commissioned by the fashion label \u2013 remains one of the most effective films of the lockdown period.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As an actor, I realised it was a predatory world dominated by white men of a certain age and I found that terrifying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a teenager, she dreamed of being a singer. \u201cI really wanted to be a star \u2013 if you want to sing, you don\u2019t just want to do it in your bedroom.\u201d She went on to work in sound and video production for the stage, but made her breakthrough on screen, acting in <em>35 Shots of Rum</em>. She plays Jos\u00e9phine, the daughter of a Paris train driver and a figure rarely represented in cinema: a young Black female intellectual. Diop admits the role closely resembled her, but would have preferred it if Denis had offered her a role more like B\u00e9atrice Dalle\u2019s in the director\u2019s blood-steeped art horror <em>Trouble Every Day</em>. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of film I wanted to be in!\u201d she laughs. \u201cNow I\u2019m very proud of playing Jos\u00e9phine \u2013 but back then, I wanted to do the opposite, <em>quelque chose de</em> <em>plus trash!</em>\u201d</p> <p>You can imagine that Diop could have achieved out-and-out stardom if she had wanted. She cuts a striking figure, her discursive confidence matched with lean beauty and angular elegance: she emphasises her points with expansive hand movements, often keeping one arm clasped round her waist.

      "bodyText": "What thoughts would go through the mind of a king exiled from his country for more than a century? What if that monarch took the form of a wooden statue boxed up for transportation from France to west Africa? Would he worry about recognising his native land? Perhaps his musings might turn to the abstract: \u201cWithin me resonates infinity.\u201d It would be a challenge for any film-maker to choose an inanimate object, however resonant, as her philosophical protagonist and narrator \u2013 but French-Senegalese director Mati Diop does just this to powerful effect in her new feature Dahomey. Part documentary, part visual and sonic poem, Dahomey follows a consignment of historical artefacts as they are returned by the French government to their source in the former African nation of Dahomey, now Benin. This year\u2019s winner of the Berlin film festival\u2019s top prize, the Golden Bear, Dahomey is the latest triumph for Diop, 42, who for a decade and a half has been a much-admired presence in world cinema, first as an actor, then as a director. She made a memorable acting debut in 2008 in Claire Denis\u2019s hypnotic urban reverie 35 Shots of Rum and later became the first Black female director to have a feature in competition in Cannes. That was 2019\u2019s visionary Atlantics, a story of young Senegalese men who attempt the perilous journey to Europe by boat \u2013 only to return as ghosts. Dahomey tells of another return. Here, the journey back to Africa is that of a set of royal treasures \u2013 controversially, a mere 26 items among several thousand looted by troops after France\u2019s 1892 invasion of Dahomey. Sitting in the library of a central London hotel, in town to present her film at the BFI London film festival, Diop explains in French that while the restitution of these artefacts began in 2021, she had already been contemplating a fiction feature on the theme for some years. \u201cIt was going to be about an African mask telling its own story, from being captured to the day it comes home \u2013 and in between, the experience of exile in Europe. I was about to start writing \u2013 then I read that the royal treasures would be returned.\u201d Diop has talked about Dahomey as \u201cun film d\u2019anticipation\u201d \u2013 which in French could mean a science-fiction movie. Indeed, there is something extremely futuristic and techno-conscious about the film, not least in the way that that statue \u2013 a \u201cbo\u201d, or power figure, of the Dahomeyan king Ghezo \u2013 delivers its voiceover in electronically processed tones. But Diop also means \u201canticipation\u201d literally, she says, because she never expected the items\u2019 repatriation to take place in the foreseeable future. \u201cI saw it happening in 2070 or 2080, I couldn\u2019t imagine it earlier \u2013 nothing in French or European politics suggested we were ready to recognise colonisation as a crime against humanity.\u201d Learning that the statues and other artefacts would return to Benin, Diop realised that she needed to get to work fast and film their transportation: \u201cI felt it was my duty.\u201d She was helped by the Senegalese writer and academic Felwine Sarr, co-author of a study on restitution commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Sarr helped oil the wheels with the Benin government, Diop says: \u201cThey understood that I needed to be with the works all the time in order to tell the story from the statues\u2019 point of view \u2013 and they understood that this wasn\u2019t the government\u2019s film. It had to be my film \u2013 and they respected that.\u201d A key section of Dahomey shows a debate that Diop organised among Beninese students, who discuss the significance of the artworks\u2019 return. Their comments cut to the heart of Dahomey\u2019s broader theme \u2013 notably when one young woman, a native speaker of the Fon language, says that when she learned about her own culture, it was in French. \u201cIt\u2019s important to hear those words coming from the continent itself,\u201d Diop says. \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to how much you can hear the word \u2018colonialism\u2019 from academic work \u2013 sooner or later, you have to hear it from the people who live with its consequences.\u201d Diop has known Africa since early childhood. She was born in Paris to a French mother and a Senegalese father \u2013 singer-guitarist Wasis Diop, for whom Mati shot an atmospheric music video in 2021. It was her mother who took her on regular visits to Senegal as a child. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to her, because otherwise I\u2019d be like many mixed-race people, disconnected from a part of myself. The way things work in France for the descendants of immigrants, everything is organised so that you renounce your double culture. At 25, I had to fight to find the African part of me.\u201d Diop grew up in Paris\u2019s eastern 12th arrondissement in an area she describes as \u201cnot working class, not bourgeois either \u2013 tr\u00e8s boring\u201d. She now lives in southern Paris\u2019s Chinatown district, studded with high-rises. She made a short there during the Covid pandemic, In My Room; showing Diop alone in her 24th-floor flat, musing on solitude and her late maternal grandmother, and modelling assorted Miu Miu frocks, the work \u2013 commissioned by the fashion label \u2013 remains one of the most effective films of the lockdown period. As a teenager, she dreamed of being a singer. \u201cI really wanted to be a star \u2013 if you want to sing, you don\u2019t just want to do it in your bedroom.\u201d She went on to work in sound and video production for the stage, but made her breakthrough on screen, acting in 35 Shots of Rum. She plays Jos\u00e9phine, the daughter of a Paris train driver and a figure rarely represented in cinema: a young Black female intellectual. Diop admits the role closely resembled her, but would have preferred it if Denis had offered her a role more like B\u00e9atrice Dalle\u2019s in the director\u2019s blood-steeped art horror Trouble Every Day. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of film I wanted to be in!\u201d she laughs. \u201cNow I\u2019m very proud of playing Jos\u00e9phine \u2013 but back then, I wanted to do the opposite, quelque chose de plus trash!\u201d You can imagine that Diop could have achieved out-and-out stardom if she had wanted. She cuts a striking figure, her discursive confidence matched with lean beauty and angular elegance: she emphasises her points with expansive hand movements, often keeping one arm clasped round her waist. In fact, she only appeared in a handful of features \u2013 mostly on the further fringes of art cinema \u2013 before deciding that acting was not for her. \u201cI realised that it was a predatory world dominated by white men of a certain age and I found that terrifying. I couldn\u2019t articulate it at that age because I didn\u2019t have the intellectual or political tools. Deciding to be behind the camera rather than in front of it was a way of protecting myself \u2013 keeping control, not being simply an object of desire.\u201d Among several shorts that Diop directed was 2013\u2019s A Thousand Suns. Shot in Dakar, it was a celebration of her uncle, the director Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, who died in 1998 and who enjoys high status in African cinema for his hallucinatory visuals and absurdist sensibility. \u201cI realised it was important for me to start my cinema where he stopped. Perhaps if he had continued to make films, I wouldn\u2019t have become a director. I chose to take on his legacy.\u201d His work, she says, is \u201cabsolutely singular \u2013 impossible to imitate\u201d. But some have tried. Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s best-known film, the 1973 classic Touki Bouki, contains one of African cinema\u2019s most famous images: a young couple on a motorbike, handlebars embellished with a horned cattle skull. When that was pastiched by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z to promote their 2018 On the Run II tour, Diop declared herself sceptical, with a sharp comment on \u201cthe unbearable lightness of the mainstream\u201d. \u201cDid I say that?\u201d she says when I remind her. \u201cThe mainstream is completely part of my culture, I\u2019m more anti-elitist \u2013 I hate any hierarchy between high culture and popular culture, that\u2019s very French.\u201d But, she says: \u201cI was amazed how casually Beyonc\u00e9 appropriated [the image] \u2013 that\u2019s so American, so dominating. If she\u2019d had the decency to mention the name of the film, a million people could have discovered it.

As for French society now, and what current political tendencies might mean for future, more extensive returns of African treasures, Diop remains wary. \u201cThe choice that Europe seems to be making is a drift towards fascism.

Isn\u2019t doing a big entertainment podcast akin to sitting for a lightweight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jimmy-fallon\">Jimmy Fallon</a> interview but at marathon length and, depending on the host, featuring even more self-satisfied cackling?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/trump-rightwing-media-tv-podcasts-sites\">\u2018Every day is a new conspiracy\u2019: behind Trump\u2019s ironclad grip on rightwing media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if it is, though, it\u2019s also considered a major avenue of access to certain broad audiences that might include undecided or undermotivated voters. Harris has initially gone both broader and more selective. Her biggest move was sitting for a 40-minute interview on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-podcast-comments\">Call Her Daddy</a>, a relationships and advice podcast that\u2019s a staple of the top five on Spotify\u2019s charts. In other words, it\u2019s the kind of broad-based show that sees itself as a relatively big-tent affair with a politically diverse audience. Host Alexandra Cooper began her episode practically apologizing for talking to a politician \u2013 the sitting vice-president of the United States! \u2013 because she generally tries to avoid politics.</p> <p>The first chunk of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/12/the-week-in-audio-kill-list-call-her-daddy-boj-kate-have-a-lot-on-their-plate-johnny-walker-review\">interview</a> did, indeed, largely avoid talking politics per se, given the show\u2019s focus on mental and physical wellbeing, allowing Harris to get both personal and (in terms of her candidacy) pretty vague. But Harris did have the opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/oct/06/kamala-harris-donald-trump-melania-joe-biden-latest-us-politics?page=with:block-6703009b8f0809b6ab31bd6f#block-6703009b8f0809b6ab31bd6f\">talk</a> about the major issue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/14/election-harris-trump-issues-policies\">abortion rights</a> in the wake of Roe v Wade\u2019s 2022 overturn, something Cooper obviously feels strongly about. And though the Call Her Daddy audience is too big to be completely homogenous, having Harris talk about this stuff with Cooper did feel like a tacit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/white-women-voters-harris-trump\">pitch to younger white women</a>: here\u2019s why this issue and this candidate should matter to you.</p>    <p>In that demographic sense, Call Her Daddy felt like an outlier in this recent season of podcast interviews. Harris\u2019s other major podcast appearance so far was a longer (if often more personally focused) interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/kamala-harris-black-barbershop-media\">All The Smoke</a>, hosted by former basketball players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. So maybe the correct analogy isn\u2019t the diminished influence of late-night talk shows or general-interest radio after all, but the unstoppable, evergreen blather of sports talk radio. Even Call Her Daddy, which has nothing in particular to do with sports, was owned by Barstool Sports for several years before it went to Spotify.</p> <p>Trump also went on a Barstool-affiliated show, Bussin\u2019 With The Boys, hosted by former NFL players. His podcast playbook seems to be more focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/05/young-men-voters-us-election-trump-harris\">energizing the younger end of his base</a>, the strange intersection of sports fans and comedy bros, where attaining some mixture of being perceived as kinda athletic or vaguely funny trumps, so to speak, all other concerns. Like Call Her Daddy, these shows also affect a kind of independent-thinking, quasi-apolitical posture \u2013 while also flattering their audience with the practiced pandering of a classic politician. In other words, it\u2019s Trump country for people who don\u2019t think of themselves as Trump country. So Trump gets to yuk it up with cult-of-personality comedians like Andrew Schulz or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/trump-rightwing-media-tv-podcasts-sites\">Theo Von,</a> giving off the impression that, if you don\u2019t pay too much attention, he\u2019s a fun anti-woke bro who talks common sense. Even the occasional pushback he receives doesn\u2019t actually question his basic worldview. When he misidentified the Olympic boxer Imane Khelif twice (as transgender, which she\u2019s not; and as a man, which she\u2019s not) on Bussin\u2019 With The Boys, the hosts argued that her opponent should have stayed in the ring, rather than actually correct him about her gender status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/call-her-daddy-kamala-harris-alex-cooper\">From frat-bro media to Kamala Harris: how the sex podcast Call Her Daddy reached the stratosphere</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, no one is listening to a Barstool Sports podcast looking for heavy interrogation of a presidential candidate, and none of this seems likely to move the needle for truly undecided voters. (At best, it might raise a candidate\u2019s profile among dudes who are undecided about whether they\u2019ll remember to vote at all.) Maybe there was a point during the pre-Trump era where appearing approachable, sincere, funny or game on TV would change some minds in that classic Kennedy-over-Nixon way; the majority of voters seem too entrenched for that kind of perceptible shift today.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t make these shows aggressively marketing themselves as harmless, down to earth and essentially bipartisan are actually either of those things, though. Much as cultural critics are losing favor compared to friendlier, more \u201cfun\u201d influencers who serve as an ideally eager-to-please audience surrogate rather those cranky experts, actual journalists are losing ground to personalities like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/joe-rogan\">Joe Rogan</a> \u2013 people in media positions who aren\u2019t any more qualified to interview presidential candidates than a TV personality is to run the country. To wit: Harris is said to be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/kamala-harris-could-join-podcaster-joe-rogan-an-interview-sources-2024-10-15/\">considering an appearance on Rogan\u2019s show</a> because of its pull with a young and male audience. In the short term, in an close race, it might even make sense. But in pursuit of friendly, casual access to a lot of voters, candidates might well wind up in a podcast quagmire of their own making, where anyone can be turned into a harmless morning-zoo personality. By imitating the low-stakes bluster of sports talk, this chosen corner of the podcast world is upholding a questionable old-media tradition: turning a serious political moment back into a horse race.</p>",

Her biggest move was sitting for a 40-minute interview on Call Her Daddy, a relationships and advice podcast that\u2019s a staple of the top five on Spotify\u2019s charts. In other words, it\u2019s the kind of broad-based show that sees itself as a relatively big-tent affair with a politically diverse audience. Host Alexandra Cooper began her episode practically apologizing for talking to a politician \u2013 the sitting vice-president of the United States! \u2013 because she generally tries to avoid politics. The first chunk of the interview did, indeed, largely avoid talking politics per se, given the show\u2019s focus on mental and physical wellbeing, allowing Harris to get both personal and (in terms of her candidacy) pretty vague. But Harris did have the opportunity to talk about the major issue of abortion rights in the wake of Roe v Wade\u2019s 2022 overturn, something Cooper obviously feels strongly about. And though the Call Her Daddy audience is too big to be completely homogenous, having Harris talk about this stuff with Cooper did feel like a tacit pitch to younger white women: here\u2019s why this issue and this candidate should matter to you. In that demographic sense, Call Her Daddy felt like an outlier in this recent season of podcast interviews. Harris\u2019s other major podcast appearance so far was a longer (if often more personally focused) interview with All The Smoke, hosted by former basketball players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. So maybe the correct analogy isn\u2019t the diminished influence of late-night talk shows or general-interest radio after all, but the unstoppable, evergreen blather of sports talk radio. Even Call Her Daddy, which has nothing in particular to do with sports, was owned by Barstool Sports for several years before it went to Spotify. Trump also went on a Barstool-affiliated show, Bussin\u2019 With The Boys, hosted by former NFL players. His podcast playbook seems to be more focused on energizing the younger end of his base, the strange intersection of sports fans and comedy bros, where attaining some mixture of being perceived as kinda athletic or vaguely funny trumps, so to speak, all other concerns. Like Call Her Daddy, these shows also affect a kind of independent-thinking, quasi-apolitical posture \u2013 while also flattering their audience with the practiced pandering of a classic politician. In other words, it\u2019s Trump country for people who don\u2019t think of themselves as Trump country. So Trump gets to yuk it up with cult-of-personality comedians like Andrew Schulz or Theo Von, giving off the impression that, if you don\u2019t pay too much attention, he\u2019s a fun anti-woke bro who talks common sense. Even the occasional pushback he receives doesn\u2019t actually question his basic worldview. When he misidentified the Olympic boxer Imane Khelif twice (as transgender, which she\u2019s not; and as a man, which she\u2019s not) on Bussin\u2019 With The Boys, the hosts argued that her opponent should have stayed in the ring, rather than actually correct him about her gender status. Of course, no one is listening to a Barstool Sports podcast looking for heavy interrogation of a presidential candidate, and none of this seems likely to move the needle for truly undecided voters. (At best, it might raise a candidate\u2019s profile among dudes who are undecided about whether they\u2019ll remember to vote at all.) Maybe there was a point during the pre-Trump era where appearing approachable, sincere, funny or game on TV would change some minds in that classic Kennedy-over-Nixon way; the majority of voters seem too entrenched for that kind of perceptible shift today. That doesn\u2019t make these shows aggressively marketing themselves as harmless, down to earth and essentially bipartisan are actually either of those things, though. Much as cultural critics are losing favor compared to friendlier, more \u201cfun\u201d influencers who serve as an ideally eager-to-please audience surrogate rather those cranky experts, actual journalists are losing ground to personalities like Joe Rogan \u2013 people in media positions who aren\u2019t any more qualified to interview presidential candidates than a TV personality is to run the country. To wit: Harris is said to be considering an appearance on Rogan\u2019s show because of its pull with a young and male audience. In the short term, in an close race, it might even make sense. But in pursuit of friendly, casual access to a lot of voters, candidates might well wind up in a podcast quagmire of their own making, where anyone can be turned into a harmless morning-zoo personality. By imitating the low-stakes bluster of sports talk, this chosen corner of the podcast world is upholding a questionable old-media tradition: turning a serious political moment back into a horse race.",

A BHS sign still hangs on its upper floor, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/28/frank-field-accuses-sir-philip-green-of-asset-stripping-bhs\">department store chain\u2019s demise eight years ago</a>. </p> <p>It is almost the end of the line for Crompton Place, with its demolition scheduled for next year. </p> <p>Bolton council, which <a href=\"https://www.bolton.gov.uk/news/article/300/council-buys-crompton-place\">bought Crompton Place for almost \u00a315m</a> from the Santander pension fund in 2018, plans to knock it down, saying the town has \u201ca surplus of retail space\u201d. In its place the council says it wants to build a more attractive area that it hopes will attract new tenants to empty sites around the main square and nearby streets, as part of a \u00a31bn town centre redevelopment.</p> <p>Crompton\u2019s demise is echoed in towns and cities across the UK. Tired shopping centres have become one of the biggest obstacles to reviving high streets. Often hemmed in by buildings and hugely expensive to overhaul, they have turned from assets to liabilities \u2013 victims of a vicious cycle of store closures. Councils are increasingly becoming the owners of last resort, buying shopping centres from investment funds.</p> <h2>Urban decay</h2> <p>About 60 of the UK\u2019s 500 bigger shopping centres are likely to be razed completely, and a further 200 could be partially demolished, according to a report by the property consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH).</p> <p>Outside that top 500, dozens more are at risk as the big chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer, House of Fraser and Wilko have dramatically downsized, while a number of former <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/retail-anchor\">anchor stores </a>such as Debenhams and Topshop no longer have a physical high street presence.</p> <p>The reasons for their demise are well-trodden: the rise of internet shopping; working from home; an epidemic of retail chain collapses; and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres.</p> <p>All that has left the UK with far too much retail space. Shopping centres have average vacancy rates of 19%, according to LSH.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/shopping_centres_online_retail_sales/giv-4559fnCqXx96qDLf/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/shopping_centres_online_retail_sales/giv-4559fnCqXx96qDLf/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Among the shopping centres facing demolition are City Square in Lincoln, Eccles in Salford, Kirkgate in Bradford, Oak Mall in Greenock, west Scotland, and the Strand in Bootle, near Liverpool.</p> <p>They follow a string of demolitions in recent years including Elephant and Castle shopping centre in south London; Castlegate in Stockton-on-Tees; the Agora Centre in Wolverton, Milton Keynes; and a big chunk of Nottingham\u2019s Broadmarsh.</p> <p>In Bolton, Crompton is to be replaced with a mix of homes, leisure facilities, food and offices with new public space opposite the town hall.</p>    <p>Stephen Warren, the owner of watch menders Time-Piece, is one of the last remaining traders after almost 20 years in the shopping centre.</p> <p>\u201cBolton is finished,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the big shops have gone and that\u2019s not helpful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have taken the heart out of Bolton,\u201d agrees Ian Lomax, 75, who is in town with his wife. He is unsure whether knocking Compton Place down will spur a revival.</p> <p>\u201cThe big shops have all gone to places like Bury,\u201d Lomax says, adding that there are few places for a couple to have an evening out. \u201cWe did have a mix of shops, cafes and restaurants but [many] have closed down.

      "bodyText": "In Bolton\u2019s town centre, the gap-toothed brutalist facade of Crompton Place shopping centre faces off against the majestic Victorian town hall. While the civic building\u2019s sandstone edifice, complete with classical columns and stone lions, evokes the mill town\u2019s heyday, time has not been kind to Crompton Place. Opened with great fanfare as an Arndale Centre in 1971, and once famed for its fountain and colony of colourful budgies, it was renamed in 1989 after the Bolton-born industrialist Samuel Crompton. But of its 46 units, only a handful of stores remain trading, including Primark and a few independents, while broken windows pockmark the rest. Inside, shoppers are few and far between in the brightly lit but low-ceilinged walkways. A BHS sign still hangs on its upper floor, despite the department store chain\u2019s demise eight years ago. It is almost the end of the line for Crompton Place, with its demolition scheduled for next year. Bolton council, which bought Crompton Place for almost \u00a315m from the Santander pension fund in 2018, plans to knock it down, saying the town has \u201ca surplus of retail space\u201d. In its place the council says it wants to build a more attractive area that it hopes will attract new tenants to empty sites around the main square and nearby streets, as part of a \u00a31bn town centre redevelopment. Crompton\u2019s demise is echoed in towns and cities across the UK. Tired shopping centres have become one of the biggest obstacles to reviving high streets. Often hemmed in by buildings and hugely expensive to overhaul, they have turned from assets to liabilities \u2013 victims of a vicious cycle of store closures. Councils are increasingly becoming the owners of last resort, buying shopping centres from investment funds. Urban decay About 60 of the UK\u2019s 500 bigger shopping centres are likely to be razed completely, and a further 200 could be partially demolished, according to a report by the property consultancy Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH). Outside that top 500, dozens more are at risk as the big chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer, House of Fraser and Wilko have dramatically downsized, while a number of former anchor stores such as Debenhams and Topshop no longer have a physical high street presence. The reasons for their demise are well-trodden: the rise of internet shopping; working from home; an epidemic of retail chain collapses; and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres. All that has left the UK with far too much retail space. Shopping centres have average vacancy rates of 19%, according to LSH. Among the shopping centres facing demolition are City Square in Lincoln, Eccles in Salford, Kirkgate in Bradford, Oak Mall in Greenock, west Scotland, and the Strand in Bootle, near Liverpool. They follow a string of demolitions in recent years including Elephant and Castle shopping centre in south London; Castlegate in Stockton-on-Tees; the Agora Centre in Wolverton, Milton Keynes; and a big chunk of Nottingham\u2019s Broadmarsh. In Bolton, Crompton is to be replaced with a mix of homes, leisure facilities, food and offices with new public space opposite the town hall. Stephen Warren, the owner of watch menders Time-Piece, is one of the last remaining traders after almost 20 years in the shopping centre. \u201cBolton is finished,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the big shops have gone and that\u2019s not helpful.\u201d \u201cThey have taken the heart out of Bolton,\u201d agrees Ian Lomax, 75, who is in town with his wife. He is unsure whether knocking Compton Place down will spur a revival. \u201cThe big shops have all gone to places like Bury,\u201d Lomax says, adding that there are few places for a couple to have an evening out. \u201cWe did have a mix of shops, cafes and restaurants but [many] have closed down. It\u2019s hen parties and stag nights and you have to watch who\u2019s about. You can feel threatened.\u201d The 1970s golden years When Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, the first modern incarnation of a city shopping centre, was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1964, it epitomised the consumer boom on the UK\u2019s high streets. Vast retail emporiums followed: Meadowhall in Sheffield opened in 1990; Lakeside in Essex in 1990; Bluewater in Kent in 1999, spawning much smaller imitations in towns across the UK. While a relatively small number of premium centres such as Westfield\u2019s glitzy shopping centres in west and east London and the Trafford Centre in Manchester are thriving, smaller centres are struggling as retailers opt for far fewer but larger sites. Big sites still change hands for substantial sums \u2013 Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund bought the half of Meadowhall that it did not own for \u00a3360m this year from British Land. But Sean Prigmore, the head of retail at LSH, says many shopping centres are \u201ccoming to the end of their useful economic lifecycle. A lot of centres of a certain age, built in the development boom in the early 1970s or 1980s, have had their heyday.\u201d LSH\u2019s shopping centres report says \u201conly a very small handful of centres are seen as requiring no significant interventions in the medium term\u201d. There is no one answer to the knotty problem. In Stockton, its Castlegate centre will be replaced by parks, while homes and university buildings will spring up in place of Elephant and Castle\u2019s former shopping centre. More homes are planned on the sites of several centres from Bristol to Milton Keynes. Jonathan Wallace, the executive chair of the development consultancy Lichfields, says: \u201cEvery centre is different and faces different challenges. Some can be repurposed for a new use or a new mix of uses. Others need to be demolished and the land redeveloped.\u201d Mini-golf anyone? For some, the answer will be partial redevelopment. A slice of Landsec\u2019s shopping centre in Lewisham, south London, is to be replaced by a new town square, homes and more shops.

He admits there can be \u201chuge risk\u201d involved but says centres need to evolve to embrace new trends, from health to competitive socialising such as mini-golf or darts. \u201cSometimes you have to trim the tree to make it grow,\u201d Findlay says. However, refitting 1970s and 1980s centres is complex and expensive given that many contain asbestos, have units that are the wrong size for modern tastes and have lots of ageing infrastructure needing replacement \u2013 from leaking roofs to broken lifts and escalators. Some projects involving housing have ground to a halt, as developers say the economic logic has been hit by a surge in construction costs and a depressed housing and retail market. Steve Norris, the head of planning, regeneration and infrastructure at LSH, says: \u201cMore homes can underpin the viability of a centre and generate footfall and spend but it is not easy.\u201d A scheme to build more than 1,000 homes, as well as retail and leisure space, on the moribund Anglia Square shopping centre in Norwich was unexpectedly cancelled in February just as demolition teams were set to move in. The developer Weston Homes, which had been working with the site\u2019s owner, the asset management firm Columbia Threadneedle, blamed rising costs, waning demand for retail and the former government\u2019s policies for backing out of its plans. Norwich council is now aiming to buy the site to push through affordable homes and a more \u201ceclectic mix\u201d of retail and leisure in place of Anglia Square which has been vacant for many years. Councils have been behind many of the reinvention plans for older centres, but are also now holding back as budgets are squeezed and a crucial source of funding, cheap Treasury loans, dry up. The disastrous experiences of councils such as Woking, which went bust after a massive investment spree including in a shopping centre, have also dampened enthusiasm, as have the complexities of needing to marshal disparate interests, from landlords and tenants to lenders. While some schemes \u2013 including Middlesbrough where the council bought two of its four local shopping centres and is shifting them from retail towards leisure and health \u2013 are deemed successful, Will Lund at the property advisory firm Knight Frank says many councils are scared of a backlash against spending on retail assets. Prigmore at LSH says: \u201cWe are not going to see many councils do acquisitions unless there is a very strong regeneration purpose such as community or civic space.\u201d Speculative investors However, the massive decline in the value of shopping centres in recent years and stabilising rents are bringing in other speculative investors. The parent group of Ikea recently bought Brighton\u2019s Churchill Square with the aim of revamping it anchored by one of its own furniture stores, as it has already done in Hammersmith, west London. Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group, meanwhile, has now snapped up at least six shopping centres from the Overgate in Dundee to Princesshay in Exeter, using its plethora of brands such as Sports Direct and the luxury streetwear chain Flannels to revive the space. Lund says retailers have begun to acknowledge that \u201cphysical stores are more important\u201d than they might have thought during the pandemic. Some investment funds have begun to specialise in reviving tired centres, where they see the possibility of attractive returns. They include Running Hare, which now owns Runcorn Shopping City in Runcorn and the Belfry in Redhill, as well as investment group M Core\u2019s Evolve Estates and LCP, which together have spent more than \u00a3200m on UK shopping centres in the past year. They join Landsec and NewRiver, which owns a number of mid-ranking centres including a handful set for major redevelopment or demolition. They are banking on attracting retailers who have not been able to get space in the prime shopping centres and hope the shift to working from home and increased enthusiasm for shopping in person to deliver more visitors. Private, often locally based entrepreneurs have also snapped up smaller centres, thinking they can sell on for a higher price as the retail market improves. Prigmore is sceptical. \u201cYields are seemingly attractive but the reality is there is a lot of work to do to improve those centres,\u201d he says.",

      "body": "<p>It takes a few anxious minutes for me to ring on Nick Harkaway\u2019s north London doorbell, on the grounds that neither the taxi driver nor I is convinced it\u2019s a private residence; its blankly businesslike doorway and proximity to a pub and an undertaker would lead a passerby to think of a discreet accountancy firm or therapist\u2019s office. Or, perhaps, a safe house. But I double check the address and, seconds later, there is the proprietor, ushering me in. </p> <p>Two hours later, I\u2019ve discovered that there\u2019s more to the history of the Hungarian tobacco industry than meets the eye, that Harkaway tracks the shipping traffic in the Danube corridor via an app and that, despite not being a horsey person, he has a surprisingly detailed knowledge of how the late Queen\u2019s horses were trained. And I\u2019ve also got a little nearer to understanding how he came to take on one of the most daunting literary challenges imaginable: continuing the legacy of his father, John le Carr\u00e9.</p> <p>The result is Karla\u2019s Choice, a novel revolving around the celebrated mole hunter George Smiley and his enemy, the Soviet spymaster of the title. Set in 1963, it occupies the gap in the fictional chronology between The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and the trilogy of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley\u2019s People, all published in the 1970s. As well as Smiley and Karla themselves, a host of figures from le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novels and their TV and film adaptations are there: Peter Guillam, Bill Haydon, Toby Esterhase, Connie Sachs and Control, the Circus chief whom Harkaway thinks of as \u201ca monster \u2013 a spider in the web\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a formidable undertaking, so how did it come about? When le Carr\u00e9 died at the end of 2020 at the age of 89, Harkaway explains, he left a letter of wishes to accompany his will, and asked that his family make efforts to secure and broaden his readership now and&nbsp;in the future. Those efforts may include adaptations, already a success \u2013 in 2010 Harkaway\u2019s elder brothers Simon and Stephen founded The Ink Factory, the production company responsible for the TV adaptation of The Night Manager, and The Pigeon Tunnel, the documentary based on le Carr\u00e9\u2019s memoir. But another way would be to provide more books, \u201cand so that conversation began, and I sat there very quietly and said, \u2018Well, you know, there are lots of very talented people we should get to do this. We could get very interesting voices from around the world to write into&nbsp;different locations, because the cold war wasn\u2019t just in western Europe. From a creative and literary viewpoint, those are absolutely fascinating projects.\u2019 And then there was a pause, and my brother Simon said something like, \u2018Well, I mean, there\u2019s one person who very obviously should write it, and that\u2019s you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was an idea that Harkaway had previously ruled out. \u201cI had said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this\u2019 \u2013 not in a kind of horrified or aggressive way, but just like, no: I\u2019ve spent however long, 16 years or something, putting clear water between myself and my dad in terms of creative work, and I\u2019ve been very successful at doing that. You know, people occasionally find out and go, \u2018God, I had no idea. That\u2019s extraordinary. How does that work?\u2019\u201d Indeed Harkaway\u2019s novels, from 2008\u2019s The Gone-Away World through to Gnomon in 2017 and his most recent, Titanium Noir, are fuelled by fantasy and futurism. Despite their interest in espionage, surveillance and the digital world, they tend towards the absurd, moving easily, as Harkaway points out, from loop quantum gravity to jam and scones. That kind of thing, he says with bravura understatement, can\u2019t happen in a George Smiley novel.</p>    <p>But something about being asked by his family rather than suggesting it himself took the hubris out of the idea, and despite \u201cthe eye-watering fear\u201d, Harkaway took himself off for a couple of weeks and \u201cnoodled around\u201d to find out if he could do it. \u201cAnd very quickly, I realised that I could. That you don\u2019t have to turn the distortion dial on my normal writing voice very far before you get to something that feels quite comfortable in my father\u2019s universe. And when I think about that, it\u2019s obvious. I was born in 1972, when he was writing Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He was reading pages of it to my mother in bed in the mornings while I was learning to speak. It\u2019s not just that I\u2019m familiar with the work; it\u2019s that the work is pivotal in how I learned to speak&nbsp;English.\u201d</p> <p>In the introduction to Karla\u2019s Choice, Harkaway recalls a childhood falling asleep listening to cassette tapes of his father\u2019s Smiley novels read by actor Michael&nbsp;Jayston, who played Peter Guillam in the 1979 TV series in which Smiley was immortalised by Alec Guinness. It\u2019s a striking, touching image, and I ask him more about it. \u201cPicture an upstairs room with really&nbsp;70s yellow bedroom walls with that slightly plucked&nbsp;texture, single-glazed, wood-framed windows facing due south, at one of the most southwesterly points in the UK, which gets hit by wind off the Atlantic Ocean at maximum heft. And the sound it makes when it gets stormy, whistling and howling around the house.\u201d</p> <p>He listened to the tapes so much, even after he\u2019d left the family home in Cornwall, that they became touchstones, comfort blankets. Were they also, I suggest to him, a way of taking his father with him wherever he went? \u201cBy that stage, not even that. When I was littler, definitely, there was a lot of hero worship going on, and there was a tussle in me because Dad read Smiley\u2019s People, and I loved listening to Dad but I loved Tinker Tailor, and I loved Michael Jayston. And also listening to Dad on tape when he was down the corridor felt weird.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to take the iconic sorrow and breathe happiness into Smiley\u2019s marriage \u2013 so that when it\u2019s sorrowful, it really hurts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harkaway is the youngest of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s sons: his elder brothers, Simon, Stephen, and Timothy who edited his father\u2019s letters and died in 2022, were the children of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s first marriage to Ann Sharp. The couple divorced in 1971, and the following year he married Jane Eustace, an editor who took on much behind-the-scenes work in his writing career, and who died a few weeks after him. So Harkaway grew up both as the youngest son and, in a sense, as an only child, and his bond with his father was close: \u201ca really easy relationship, not complex or difficult and he was proud of me and delighted with what I was doing\u201d.</p> <p>Did he read his son\u2019s books? Harkaway bursts into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cWell. Now. Did he?\u201d He considers. \u201cHe would always say to me, \u2018I dipped into it, I haven\u2019t really read it properly.\u2019 And I knew that the things I write about were not really his thing. I was talking to my older brother a few years ago and said, \u2018I\u2019m not sure he ever properly read one of my books in its entirety\u2019, and he said, \u2018Well, I never had a conversation with him about any of your books where he didn\u2019t know exactly what the plotline was, and most of the minutiae of the book.\u201d</p> <p>I remark on the oddness of the inversion: people generally claim to have read books they haven\u2019t, rather than the other way around. Harkaway puts it down to his father\u2019s \u201cextraordinary delicacy\u201d in not wanting to squash or \u201cbigfoot\u201d him, and his delight when his son\u2019s work was well received. And yet there were moments: Harkaway recalls a Cambridge don telling le Carr\u00e9 how much he loved his work, and also his son\u2019s. \u201cAnd he was very thrown. It was like, the ankle-biters have come for me. I said, are you joking? That\u2019s one person, and your audience is millions of people around the world. My mother thought it was hilarious. She brought it up for weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There are obvious technical challenges in adding narratives to the Smiley universe, and Harkaway was determined to avoid writing \u201cinfill stories\u201d, and to create something substantial. One change he made was to picture George in a period of marital contentment, unlike later, when his wife Ann\u2019s affair with Bill Haydon \u2013 among others \u2013 causes his notable distress. \u201cI wanted to take that iconic sorrow,\u201d says Harkaway, \u201cand just breathe a degree of happiness into it \u2013 so that when it\u2019s sorrowful, it really hurts.\u201d</p> <p>Karla of course was key: a character whom Smiley first encounters in an interrogation room in 1955 but who, at that point, is only one of a number of agents he\u2019s encouraging to defect. By the time we meet him properly in Tinker Tailor, Harkaway notes, Karla has become \u201cthe figure that Smiley is concerned about, and reciprocally, Smiley is the only person in the Circus that Karla thinks is dangerous. How does that happen? You\u2019ve got a 10-year gap into which some momentous sequence has to occur to bring you to that point.\u201d Why does he think his father left that gap? \u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t building a franchise. He was just writing books as they occurred to him.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the imaginative demands of stepping into his father\u2019s shoes, how did Harkaway cope with the emotions that the task must have brought up? After all, he was writing in the midst of loss and grief for both his parents. \u201cDo you know, the weird thing about that is that it was, I think, really helpful. Because when you lose someone you love, you think the world should stop. You think the earth should crack and the heavens should rattle. And by and large, it doesn\u2019t. Things just&nbsp;carry on. But when my father died, for an enormous&nbsp;number of people, the heavens did rattle. People cared, and they wrote and said that they cared. They said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know your dad, but his work meant so much to me.\u2019 I had to go on the radio and talk about&nbsp;him, I think we did it in my parents\u2019 living room. It was&nbsp;my therapy.\u201d</p> <p>Harkaway is aware, naturally, of his father\u2019s complexities \u2013 not least, his lifelong recovery from a childhood in which his mother left the family when he was five, and he and his brother Tony were brought up by his father, Ronnie Cornwell, a charming conman prone to occasional violence. (\u201cKilling him was an early preoccupation of mine,\u201d wrote le Carr\u00e9, \u201cand it has endured off and on even after his death. Probably it is no more than my exasperation that I could absolutely never pin him down.\u201d)</p> <p>In 2023, Adam Sisman published a follow-up to his monumental 2015 biography. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/15/the-secret-life-of-john-le-carre-by-adam-sisman-review\">The Secret Life of John le Carr\u00e9</a> detailed the writer\u2019s serial adultery, Sisman arguing that the author\u2019s death had freed him to tell the whole story. How can that have felt for his family? \u201cBroadly speaking,\u201d Harkaway replies carefully, \u201cwe have, as a family, said what we need to say about that. I don\u2019t see the world any differently. I think it\u2019s just what it is.\u201d</p> <p>His father died during lockdown, and there were strict limits on how many people could be present. With his mother unable to go because she was undergoing chemotherapy, the brothers discussed how to decide which of them should visit their father in hospital. \u201cAnd&nbsp;I looked at my life and my life with dad, and I thought, \u2018I do not have unfinished business. He loves me. I love him. We both know it. I don\u2019t have anything pressing that I need to say except I love you, and he knows that.\u2019 And so Tim went in. And then I think the following day, he deteriorated, and he died, and I didn\u2019t get the chance to go in. Do I wish I could have held his hand? Yes. Do I regret the decision? Not for one second, and that feeling hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p> <p>His family and early readers have greeted Karla\u2019s Choice enthusiastically, and with that \u201cthe level of fear declines, because at a certain threshold, no one can say this was a catastrophe, this is a disgrace. They can only say this is not for me, and everyone\u2019s at liberty to say this is not for me.\u201d If the wider readership agrees, Harkaway will continue to write in his father\u2019s world, and his own too; spies in one direction, wizards and superheroes in the other. \u201cThe nice thing about writing into the Smiley universe,\u201d he tells me as we part, \u201cis that there\u2019s a ceiling on how crazy I can be.\u201d And so perhaps I am leaving a safe house.</p> <p>\u2022 Karla\u2019s Choice: A John le Carr\u00e9 Novel by Nick Harkaway, published by Viking.

      "bodyText": "It takes a few anxious minutes for me to ring on Nick Harkaway\u2019s north London doorbell, on the grounds that neither the taxi driver nor I is convinced it\u2019s a private residence; its blankly businesslike doorway and proximity to a pub and an undertaker would lead a passerby to think of a discreet accountancy firm or therapist\u2019s office. Or, perhaps, a safe house. But I double check the address and, seconds later, there is the proprietor, ushering me in. Two hours later, I\u2019ve discovered that there\u2019s more to the history of the Hungarian tobacco industry than meets the eye, that Harkaway tracks the shipping traffic in the Danube corridor via an app and that, despite not being a horsey person, he has a surprisingly detailed knowledge of how the late Queen\u2019s horses were trained. And I\u2019ve also got a little nearer to understanding how he came to take on one of the most daunting literary challenges imaginable: continuing the legacy of his father, John le Carr\u00e9. The result is Karla\u2019s Choice, a novel revolving around the celebrated mole hunter George Smiley and his enemy, the Soviet spymaster of the title. Set in 1963, it occupies the gap in the fictional chronology between The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and the trilogy of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley\u2019s People, all published in the 1970s. As well as Smiley and Karla themselves, a host of figures from le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novels and their TV and film adaptations are there: Peter Guillam, Bill Haydon, Toby Esterhase, Connie Sachs and Control, the Circus chief whom Harkaway thinks of as \u201ca monster \u2013 a spider in the web\u201d. It\u2019s a formidable undertaking, so how did it come about? When le Carr\u00e9 died at the end of 2020 at the age of 89, Harkaway explains, he left a letter of wishes to accompany his will, and asked that his family make efforts to secure and broaden his readership now and in the future. Those efforts may include adaptations, already a success \u2013 in 2010 Harkaway\u2019s elder brothers Simon and Stephen founded The Ink Factory, the production company responsible for the TV adaptation of The Night Manager, and The Pigeon Tunnel, the documentary based on le Carr\u00e9\u2019s memoir. But another way would be to provide more books, \u201cand so that conversation began, and I sat there very quietly and said, \u2018Well, you know, there are lots of very talented people we should get to do this. We could get very interesting voices from around the world to write into different locations, because the cold war wasn\u2019t just in western Europe. From a creative and literary viewpoint, those are absolutely fascinating projects.\u2019 And then there was a pause, and my brother Simon said something like, \u2018Well, I mean, there\u2019s one person who very obviously should write it, and that\u2019s you.\u2019\u201d It was an idea that Harkaway had previously ruled out. \u201cI had said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this\u2019 \u2013 not in a kind of horrified or aggressive way, but just like, no: I\u2019ve spent however long, 16 years or something, putting clear water between myself and my dad in terms of creative work, and I\u2019ve been very successful at doing that. You know, people occasionally find out and go, \u2018God, I had no idea. That\u2019s extraordinary. How does that work?\u2019\u201d Indeed Harkaway\u2019s novels, from 2008\u2019s The Gone-Away World through to Gnomon in 2017 and his most recent, Titanium Noir, are fuelled by fantasy and futurism. Despite their interest in espionage, surveillance and the digital world, they tend towards the absurd, moving easily, as Harkaway points out, from loop quantum gravity to jam and scones. That kind of thing, he says with bravura understatement, can\u2019t happen in a George Smiley novel. But something about being asked by his family rather than suggesting it himself took the hubris out of the idea, and despite \u201cthe eye-watering fear\u201d, Harkaway took himself off for a couple of weeks and \u201cnoodled around\u201d to find out if he could do it. \u201cAnd very quickly, I realised that I could. That you don\u2019t have to turn the distortion dial on my normal writing voice very far before you get to something that feels quite comfortable in my father\u2019s universe. And when I think about that, it\u2019s obvious. I was born in 1972, when he was writing Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He was reading pages of it to my mother in bed in the mornings while I was learning to speak. It\u2019s not just that I\u2019m familiar with the work; it\u2019s that the work is pivotal in how I learned to speak English.\u201d In the introduction to Karla\u2019s Choice, Harkaway recalls a childhood falling asleep listening to cassette tapes of his father\u2019s Smiley novels read by actor Michael Jayston, who played Peter Guillam in the 1979 TV series in which Smiley was immortalised by Alec Guinness. It\u2019s a striking, touching image, and I ask him more about it. \u201cPicture an upstairs room with really 70s yellow bedroom walls with that slightly plucked texture, single-glazed, wood-framed windows facing due south, at one of the most southwesterly points in the UK, which gets hit by wind off the Atlantic Ocean at maximum heft. And the sound it makes when it gets stormy, whistling and howling around the house.\u201d He listened to the tapes so much, even after he\u2019d left the family home in Cornwall, that they became touchstones, comfort blankets. Were they also, I suggest to him, a way of taking his father with him wherever he went? \u201cBy that stage, not even that. When I was littler, definitely, there was a lot of hero worship going on, and there was a tussle in me because Dad read Smiley\u2019s People, and I loved listening to Dad but I loved Tinker Tailor, and I loved Michael Jayston. And also listening to Dad on tape when he was down the corridor felt weird.\u201d Harkaway is the youngest of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s sons: his elder brothers, Simon, Stephen, and Timothy who edited his father\u2019s letters and died in 2022, were the children of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s first marriage to Ann Sharp. The couple divorced in 1971, and the following year he married Jane Eustace, an editor who took on much behind-the-scenes work in his writing career, and who died a few weeks after him. So Harkaway grew up both as the youngest son and, in a sense, as an only child, and his bond with his father was close: \u201ca really easy relationship, not complex or difficult and he was proud of me and delighted with what I was doing\u201d. Did he read his son\u2019s books? Harkaway bursts into laughter. \u201cWell. Now.

Harkaway puts it down to his father\u2019s \u201cextraordinary delicacy\u201d in not wanting to squash or \u201cbigfoot\u201d him, and his delight when his son\u2019s work was well received. And yet there were moments: Harkaway recalls a Cambridge don telling le Carr\u00e9 how much he loved his work, and also his son\u2019s. \u201cAnd he was very thrown. It was like, the ankle-biters have come for me. I said, are you joking? That\u2019s one person, and your audience is millions of people around the world. My mother thought it was hilarious. She brought it up for weeks.\u201d There are obvious technical challenges in adding narratives to the Smiley universe, and Harkaway was determined to avoid writing \u201cinfill stories\u201d, and to create something substantial.

The duplicates involved transactions from recent days and resulted in some people having their bank accounts overdrawn. After stating it was working to reverse these transactions \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d, a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson told Guardian Australia shortly before 6pm on Saturday evening that \u201cthe process to reverse these transactions has been completed\u201d. Any fees charged will be refunded, the bank said. Earlier, the bank issued an \u201cimportant message\u201d on Saturday morning to customers, saying \u201cwe are aware some customers are seeing duplicate transactions from payments\u201d. It told customers it was \u201csorry for the inconvenience. Thanks for being patient with us\u201d. However, for some the lack of funds was a matter of urgency. Some took to X, formerly Twitter, and described being unable to pay for essentials including medication, fuel, food and nappies. One person on social media said they risked missing a flight because their account was overdrawn, leaving them without enough funds to get transportation to the airport. For some, their weekend plans have had to change \u2013 as one person put it, \u201cthis has fucked up my Saturday. Thanks Commbank.\u201d When Sophie Edwards, a 19-year-old university student, saw her bank account was $230 overdrawn Saturday morning, she assumed she had been hacked. When she looked at her bank account, she saw she had been charged twice for every transaction she had made the previous week. Edwards said it had been an \u201cextremely stressful morning. I\u2019m already under a lot of pressure with money - this is an added stress I can\u2019t afford\u201d. Saturday is the only day she has to buy her groceries for the week, including food for her cats. But she said she was not able to afford the shop or the public transport costs to get there. She was unable to get through to Commonwealth Bank on phone or web assist and was worried about paying her $390 weekly rent.

      "body": "<p>Well, that kicked off a bit didn\u2019t it? By now it seems fairly clear we all need a break from people having feelings about The Germans, and specifically about the morality or otherwise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/16/thomas-tuchel-confirmed-as-new-england-manager-from-2025\">a German being employed as manager</a> of the England men\u2019s football team.</p> <p>Except, perhaps not quite yet. How about it? Once more, this time with feeling? At the very least, as the tide retreats on all that free-floating anxiety, it is probably worth taking a look at the reaction itself, which is, as ever, the part that seems to stick.</p> <p>One thing needs to be made clear at this point. It would be wholly incorrect to accuse Jeff Powell of the Daily Mail of either intentionally or unintentionally reframing the rhetoric and phrasing of Adolf Hitler in the form of a football article. Or indeed, of being in some way Nazi-adjacent in the rhetoric of what was a logical, well-reasoned article this week on the issues surrounding overseas managerial appointments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/17/sean-dyche-asks-if-fa-is-committed-to-english-coaches-after-tuchel-arrival\">Sean Dyche asks if FA is committed to English coaches after Tuchel arrival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clearly, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-13962851/England-team-English-kit-man-JEFF-POWELL-Thomas-Tuchel.html?ico=authors_pagination_desktop\">Powell\u2019s widely shared article</a> condemning the appointment of Thomas Tuchel shows no actual Hitlerian influences. To suggest anything else is ridiculous. Powell is a respected big beast of the sports journalism world. He broke and indeed assisted in one of the biggest England manager stories ever \u2013 Don Revie walking out on his country with a pay cheque from the Daily Mail for the exclusive \u2013 so he knows what he\u2019s talking about on the subject of mercenaries and betrayal. A key lesson of the week, however, is just how vital it is to stay in control of our message; to be so, so careful about how we express ourselves around issues where emotions run high and misinterpretation is not just possible but likely.</p> <p>As a prime example of this, it was striking how many parts of Powell\u2019s own article on Tuchel could, taken out of context, sound a bit like sentences drawn from the collected writings and speeches of Hitler, including the autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf. Below are just a few examples of this misleading process, skimmed out from first paragraph to last.</p> <p><strong>Powell</strong>: The birthright of the country which gave football to the world was being sold. <strong>Hitler</strong>: It was a filthy crime against the people, a stab in the back of the nation.</p> <p><strong>Powell</strong>: How can a foreigner urge Englishmen to do or die on football\u2019s battlefield? <strong>Hitler</strong>: I can fight only for something that I love, and respect only what I know.</p> <p><strong>Powell</strong>: That Three-Lion heart is still beating. <strong>Hitler</strong>:&nbsp;Those who have still a German heart and a love for their&nbsp;people.</p> <p><strong>Powell</strong>: Ominously, his English is not so good. <strong>Hitler</strong>:&nbsp;They speak German as awkwardly as they probably speak English awkwardly.</p> <p>Now, this is obviously just coincidence. But there is a much wider point here, one that applies to all of us, specifically just how easy it is for rhetoric to take on its own misleading life when it comes to these highly emotive topics. We all do it at times. Zoom out a bit and the entire vernacular of England manager-dom, the narrative of failure, betrayal and entitlement, can sound a bit Mein Kampf-ish. Not because it is fascist to want England to win, but because this story is an archetype, and because the basic language of sport and nationalism always will overlap to some degree.</p>    <p>So both areas have notions of \u201cbirthright\u201d and a sacred trust. Much like those of Weimar Germany, the frustrations of England football tend to rest on a basic notion of betrayal, the people sold short by a blazered and chinless elite. Money-grubbing external forces are in the mix, in the shape of Sven, Capello, the Premier League. What is required is unity, clarity of purpose (the impure, the anthem-confused, will rightly fail). And of course it is better to suffer as one entity than to seek decadent success with Tuchel.</p> <p>And yes, you could nitpick over some of the inaccuracies in Powell\u2019s article. Swedes aren\u2019t really cross-country skiers who spend half their lives in darkness. Powell wasn\u2019t proved correct in his conviction Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson would be a disaster (although the English guy who came next was). Tuchel wasn\u2019t sacked by Bayern Munich. Powell seems to think Henry V actually delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech (this happened in a play). He also insists that every single nation in the world must have an English kitman, perhaps unintentionally. He appears to be suggesting Tuchel\u2019s English isn\u2019t good, which would be both weird and incorrect.</p> <p>But the most frustrating part, the real casualty of the way words can sometimes get away from us, is the fact Powell is right in his main point. International football teams should be coached by their own domestic coaches. It\u2019s more interesting that way. This is supposed to be a test of systems, one sporting culture ranged against another, a way of learning and improving. Otherwise what\u2019s the point?</p> <p>The problem arrives when this idea gets too exciting, when we lose sight of the fact Tuchel for England is just one person having a job. Or indeed, if we forget why England have an overseas manager, which is that English football decided a while back it\u2019s just not commercially necessary to produce coaches.</p> <p>With this in mind, why not direct all that anger and discontent at the structures of English football, not its outcomes? This has been going on for decades. English football has no school, no style, no recognisable indigenous coaching culture. Usually we ignore this and talk about VAR or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/22/playful-update-to-national-debate-england-kit-has-begun-a-culture-war\">the colour of a cross</a>. Now we have a German and it\u2019s a problem.</p> <p>The final irony here is that Tuchel does represent English football, or at least what it has chosen to become, a stage for hired talent and outsourced intelligence. Play a longer game. Break the cycle, grow it rather than buy it. And maybe, just maybe we may end up with the most desirable outcome, denied us for so long by corrupt elites, of one nation, one team, one leader. Hmm. Hang on.</p>",

At the very least, as the tide retreats on all that free-floating anxiety, it is probably worth taking a look at the reaction itself, which is, as ever, the part that seems to stick. One thing needs to be made clear at this point. It would be wholly incorrect to accuse Jeff Powell of the Daily Mail of either intentionally or unintentionally reframing the rhetoric and phrasing of Adolf Hitler in the form of a football article. Or indeed, of being in some way Nazi-adjacent in the rhetoric of what was a logical, well-reasoned article this week on the issues surrounding overseas managerial appointments. Clearly, Powell\u2019s widely shared article condemning the appointment of Thomas Tuchel shows no actual Hitlerian influences. To suggest anything else is ridiculous. Powell is a respected big beast of the sports journalism world. He broke and indeed assisted in one of the biggest England manager stories ever \u2013 Don Revie walking out on his country with a pay cheque from the Daily Mail for the exclusive \u2013 so he knows what he\u2019s talking about on the subject of mercenaries and betrayal. A key lesson of the week, however, is just how vital it is to stay in control of our message; to be so, so careful about how we express ourselves around issues where emotions run high and misinterpretation is not just possible but likely. As a prime example of this, it was striking how many parts of Powell\u2019s own article on Tuchel could, taken out of context, sound a bit like sentences drawn from the collected writings and speeches of Hitler, including the autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf. Below are just a few examples of this misleading process, skimmed out from first paragraph to last. Powell: The birthright of the country which gave football to the world was being sold. Hitler: It was a filthy crime against the people, a stab in the back of the nation. Powell: How can a foreigner urge Englishmen to do or die on football\u2019s battlefield? Hitler: I can fight only for something that I love, and respect only what I know. Powell: That Three-Lion heart is still beating. Hitler: Those who have still a German heart and a love for their people. Powell: Ominously, his English is not so good. Hitler: They speak German as awkwardly as they probably speak English awkwardly. Now, this is obviously just coincidence. But there is a much wider point here, one that applies to all of us, specifically just how easy it is for rhetoric to take on its own misleading life when it comes to these highly emotive topics. We all do it at times. Zoom out a bit and the entire vernacular of England manager-dom, the narrative of failure, betrayal and entitlement, can sound a bit Mein Kampf-ish. Not because it is fascist to want England to win, but because this story is an archetype, and because the basic language of sport and nationalism always will overlap to some degree. So both areas have notions of \u201cbirthright\u201d and a sacred trust. Much like those of Weimar Germany, the frustrations of England football tend to rest on a basic notion of betrayal, the people sold short by a blazered and chinless elite. Money-grubbing external forces are in the mix, in the shape of Sven, Capello, the Premier League. What is required is unity, clarity of purpose (the impure, the anthem-confused, will rightly fail). And of course it is better to suffer as one entity than to seek decadent success with Tuchel. And yes, you could nitpick over some of the inaccuracies in Powell\u2019s article. Swedes aren\u2019t really cross-country skiers who spend half their lives in darkness. Powell wasn\u2019t proved correct in his conviction Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson would be a disaster (although the English guy who came next was). Tuchel wasn\u2019t sacked by Bayern Munich. Powell seems to think Henry V actually delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech (this happened in a play). He also insists that every single nation in the world must have an English kitman, perhaps unintentionally. He appears to be suggesting Tuchel\u2019s English isn\u2019t good, which would be both weird and incorrect. But the most frustrating part, the real casualty of the way words can sometimes get away from us, is the fact Powell is right in his main point. International football teams should be coached by their own domestic coaches. It\u2019s more interesting that way. This is supposed to be a test of systems, one sporting culture ranged against another, a way of learning and improving. Otherwise what\u2019s the point? The problem arrives when this idea gets too exciting, when we lose sight of the fact Tuchel for England is just one person having a job. Or indeed, if we forget why England have an overseas manager, which is that English football decided a while back it\u2019s just not commercially necessary to produce coaches. With this in mind, why not direct all that anger and discontent at the structures of English football, not its outcomes? This has been going on for decades. English football has no school, no style, no recognisable indigenous coaching culture. Usually we ignore this and talk about VAR or the colour of a cross. Now we have a German and it\u2019s a problem. The final irony here is that Tuchel does represent English football, or at least what it has chosen to become, a stage for hired talent and outsourced intelligence. Play a longer game. Break the cycle, grow it rather than buy it. And maybe, just maybe we may end up with the most desirable outcome, denied us for so long by corrupt elites, of one nation, one team, one leader. Hmm.

It\u2019s about improving the individual in order to improve the collective, to win games.\u201d</p> <p>Many of <em>Le Racing</em>\u2019s first-team regulars are seasoned professionals, despite their young age. The 20-year-old club captain, Habib Diarra, a Senegal international who grew up in Alsace, was handed the armband this summer, at the dawn of his third campaign with the club. The Swedish summer signing Sebastian Nanasi, who has three goals and two assists already, made his professional debut at 15 and won four trophies with Malm\u00f6 before leaving for France. He continued his good form in the last international break, scoring a double against Estonia. \u201cWe played his goals to the rest of the team today,\u201d Rosenior beams, \u201cand we did the same with Emanuel Emegha\u2019s goal for the Dutch under-\u200a21 team. We want to share each others\u2019 successes.\u201d</p>    <p>Strasbourg\u2019s standout result of the season so far was a 1-0 win over Marseille at the end of September, a match which saw Rosenior inflict a first Ligue 1 defeat on Roberto De Zerbi. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as me beating De Zerbi,\u201d Rosenior says. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to talk about tactical battles in the press. There are elements of that, but the most important thing is the work the players do on the training ground.\u201d</p> <p>Rosenior does, though, praise the Italian tactician as \u201cone of the best in the world\u201d, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s influenced me in the way that I see the game, especially from his time at Brighton. I saw what he did with the players I\u2019d played with, like Solly March and Lewis Dunk.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I watch Arsenal and the way they press \u2013 Roberto was doing that before with Brighton before Mikel Arteta was going man-for-man across the pitch. Certain coaches work at a level where they can influence other coaches, so to come up against him is something I won\u2019t forget, and hopefully it will happen often in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The winning goal against Marseille came from the winger Diego Moreira, who exemplifies the positional flexibility of Rosenior\u2019s squad. The Portugal youth international was deployed as a striker in his first start of the season, before being shifted to left-back, and scored his first professional goal from that position. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in pigeonholing players into positions,\u201d says Rosenior. \u201cIsma\u00ebl Doukour\u00e9, for example, has played at left-back, right-back, centre-back and in central midfield. I\u2019m being given the confidence to try that, because the people above me believe in working this way.\u201d</p> <p>One effect of the Alsatians\u2019 turnover in personnel \u2013 which has included several Chelsea loanees \u2013 has been a rejuvenation of the squad. One lineup in particular, against Montpellier back in August, was the first in French top-flight history in which all outfield players were under 23. \u201cWe\u2019re the youngest team in Europe, so you have to accept that you have players who are going to be learning on the job,\u201d Rosenior says. \u201cMy job is to accelerate that learning, and you can only do that with experience.\u201d</p> <p>He points to two matches in particular \u2013 their 4-3 defeat by Lyon and a 3-3 draw against Lille, both away from home, both of which saw Strasbourg take the lead before giving up points. \u201cBut if those two matches hadn\u2019t happened, we would have had less of a chance of seeing out the Marseille win,\u201d he goes on to say.</p>    <p>Rosenior is effectively now a member of the cohort of young tacticians who have taken Ligue 1 by storm, including his compatriot Will Still, as well as Luka Elsner at Reims. \u201cI\u2019m learning from these coaches as well,\u201d he says, adding that Still, an Anglo-Belgian, who he recently faced, \u201chas a very defined way of playing, which you could say is the polar opposite of what I do with the ball, but it\u2019s still very effective\u201d.</p> <p>For Rosenior, his own youth is not necessarily the key to connecting with rising players \u2013 citing as counter examples Alex Ferguson and a certain local. \u201cArs\u00e8ne Wenger was a master at developing young players, even at an older age,\u201d he says. \u201cI want my players to enjoy coming in. I want them to be open. I want them to be vulnerable, and I allow myself to be vulnerable as well with them. From that, I think you can create really close connections with your group and you build trust, which is everything.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Strasbourg travel to the champions, Paris Saint-Germain, who are unbeaten in Ligue 1. Not everyone in the stands is entirely won over, though. In particular, BlueCo\u2019s arrival in June 2023 prompted protests from the club\u2019s ultras, who have remained silent in the first 15 minutes of matches to express their disapproval of the sale. For the UB90<em> </em>group, the takeover risks undermining the club\u2019s identity and independence, in favour of the whims of the new American owners who could prioritise Chelsea.</p> <p>The quiet demonstration has increasingly divided opinion among the Stade de la Meinau faithful, with many \u2013 including the manager himself \u2013 pointing out that the players themselves are affected by the lack of atmosphere. \u201cThe context is really important. This club has been under foreign ownership before and, to put it mildly, it didn\u2019t go well,\u201d concedes Rosenior, referring to the turbulent six-year period at the turn of the century during which IMG were in charge.

To compete at this level, you need big investment, and I think this club is fortunate to have investors who don\u2019t just think about being a flash in the pan and throw money at things, but want to build something here. I think the long-term plan is for the club to be consistently aiming for European football\u201d.</p> <p>Can PSG realistically be toppled? \u201cIn France, you need a lot of money and a lot of time to challenge them,\u201d Rosenior admits.

A party of 33 people who completely filled all 10 en suite rooms would get the best value. Our lower number means no one has to share with someone they aren\u2019t related to or good friends with, but still keeps things affordable.</p> <p>Danywenallt hostel, near the village of Talybont-on-Usk, is a good-looking place, a stone-built converted farmhouse, its whitewashed frontage contrasting with the dark slate roof, green hillsides and sheep-dotted fields. Some bedrooms are in former outbuildings across a cloister-like central garden, with covered walkways handy for moving about when the weather turns wetly Welsh. And everything is kept cosy in mid-February by central heating as well as the wood burner.</p>    <p>This is not our first go at youth hostel exclusive hires. In February 2020, just weeks before lockdown meant that for months we all got together only on a weekly Zoom quiz, we stayed at the smaller Pwll Deri hostel, with amazing sea views of the dramatic Pembrokeshire coast. It sleeps 24 from \u00a3750 for two nights, so the break costs from \u00a331 a head. The weather wasn\u2019t kind that year: the arrival of Storm Ciara meant walking the coastal path to Strumble Head was swiftly abandoned due to high winds, and even a safer inland hike brought rain and stinging hailstones. But it just made holing up with mates and lots of food and drink more fun.</p> <p>These are hostels, though. Where fancy places might have curated artworks on the walls, we have fire regulations and exhortations to leave the kitchen tidy. Instead of roll-top baths and posh smellies, we have basic but functional shower rooms. The beds \u2013 a few doubles, lots of bunks \u2013 are made up but we take our own towels.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Instead of roll-top baths and posh smellies, we have basic but functional shower rooms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s in the self-catering kitchen at Danywenallt that the differences between this and a normal holiday let come to the fore, though they cause more amusement than annoyance. There\u2019s nothing to make coffee in. \u201cHow can they not have cafetieres? Do they expect us to drink instant?\u201d</p> <p>OK, it\u2019s very much a first-world problem, and is solved by a call to a couple in the party who live in Wales and have not set off yet, but it could have caused headaches \u2013 real and figurative. The enamel teapot seems not to have seen use since the hostel closed for the season in September and needs months of dust washing off it. There\u2019s also no cheese grater, but hey, we can strew shavings of parmesan over our food if we must.</p>    <p>Teaspoons, though. We all know about the black hole that teaspoons, odd socks and pens disappear into, but a grand total of two teaspoons for 19 (or up to 33) people is so paltry as to be hilarious. Everyone soon learns it\u2019s deeply antisocial to walk away from the kitchen with a spoon still in your drink.</p> <p>While no one wants this to feel like a school trip, some planning is necessary with nearly 20 people. We luckily have on hand an ace organiser \u2013 she\u2019s called Jan \u2013 who cheerfully and without a hint of bossiness has sorted out room allocation before most people arrive. Thanks also to her, everyone knew what food to bring \u2013 mains, desserts, breakfast and packed lunch supplies, afternoon cake \u2013 and what we might do each day.</p>    <p>Each evening big pans of homemade chilli or curry are heated up and heaps of salad washed, chopped and piled into bowls. Later, homemade cheesecakes and trifles come out and are wolfed down greedily. And because no one wants to appear anything but open-handed, there is loads of everything, wine included, to go around.</p> <p>Those who haven\u2019t cooked that particular evening willingly launch into clearing away, and with two sinks and lots of tea towels, it\u2019s done surprisingly quickly (and some say the best craic of the holiday is in the kitchen over the washing up).</p> <p>By day, the delights of the national park are just outside. In heavy rain the first afternoon, fewer than half of us, waterproof trousers swishing, head off on a walk around Talybont reservoir, while others stay in the dry. In sunshine next day, choices are between a demanding nine-miler with steep climbs and great views and a gentler walk taking in the remains of the Brinore Tramroad (built in 1814 to move limestone down the valley) and the picturesque Monmouthshire and Brecon canal.</p> <p>In the chill February air, thrushes, chaffinches, robins, great tits and blackbirds are celebrating the slightly longer days with loud, spectacular song. We also hear nuthatches and coal tits \u2013 thanks, Merlin app \u2013 and a birder among us photographs a pair of buzzards over Twyn Du.</p>    <p>On the last day we drive half an hour along the A40 to hike Pen-y-F\u00e2l, or Sugar Loaf, said to be the \u201cpurple-headed mountain\u201d from All Things Bright and Beautiful, with the Usk the \u201criver running by\u201d. Though I doubt moralistic Victorian hymn writer Cecil Frances Alexander had as much fun as we do over lunch in the excellent <a href=\"https://www.thecrownatpantygelli.com/\">Crown at Pantygelli</a> afterwards.</p> <p>Evenings at the hostel mean raucous board games and live music from the handful of musicians among us, on ukulele, banjo, guitar and \u201ccajon\u201d box drum. They\u2019ve never all played together before, and call themselves the Shambles, but give an enjoyable programme ranging from Dylan and John Denver to Little Big Town.</p> <p>And there has to be a quiz. Because some of us love them and those who hate them just have to suck it up. Final question: which hostel shall we do all this again in next winter?</p> <p><em>Accommodation was provided by <a href=\"https://www.yha.org.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw9Km3BhDjARIsAGUb4nwLS_iKx02LTs6pqPyVMRjvHqTfQ9gcFVxdu3JMAezVGFtUinI5U2IaAu-zEALw_wcB\">YHA</a>, which charges from \u00a3250 a night for exclusive hire.</em> <em>It is offering 20% off exclusive hire stays at <a href=\"https://www.yha.org.uk/special-offers/hot-deals#deal\">selected hostels</a> this winter from 1 December to 2 March (excluding new year) using promo code HOTDEAL-242</em></p>",

A party of 33 people who completely filled all 10 en suite rooms would get the best value. Our lower number means no one has to share with someone they aren\u2019t related to or good friends with, but still keeps things affordable. Danywenallt hostel, near the village of Talybont-on-Usk, is a good-looking place, a stone-built converted farmhouse, its whitewashed frontage contrasting with the dark slate roof, green hillsides and sheep-dotted fields. Some bedrooms are in former outbuildings across a cloister-like central garden, with covered walkways handy for moving about when the weather turns wetly Welsh. And everything is kept cosy in mid-February by central heating as well as the wood burner. This is not our first go at youth hostel exclusive hires. In February 2020, just weeks before lockdown meant that for months we all got together only on a weekly Zoom quiz, we stayed at the smaller Pwll Deri hostel, with amazing sea views of the dramatic Pembrokeshire coast. It sleeps 24 from \u00a3750 for two nights, so the break costs from \u00a331 a head. The weather wasn\u2019t kind that year: the arrival of Storm Ciara meant walking the coastal path to Strumble Head was swiftly abandoned due to high winds, and even a safer inland hike brought rain and stinging hailstones. But it just made holing up with mates and lots of food and drink more fun. These are hostels, though. Where fancy places might have curated artworks on the walls, we have fire regulations and exhortations to leave the kitchen tidy. Instead of roll-top baths and posh smellies, we have basic but functional shower rooms. The beds \u2013 a few doubles, lots of bunks \u2013 are made up but we take our own towels. It\u2019s in the self-catering kitchen at Danywenallt that the differences between this and a normal holiday let come to the fore, though they cause more amusement than annoyance. There\u2019s nothing to make coffee in. \u201cHow can they not have cafetieres? Do they expect us to drink instant?\u201d OK, it\u2019s very much a first-world problem, and is solved by a call to a couple in the party who live in Wales and have not set off yet, but it could have caused headaches \u2013 real and figurative. The enamel teapot seems not to have seen use since the hostel closed for the season in September and needs months of dust washing off it. There\u2019s also no cheese grater, but hey, we can strew shavings of parmesan over our food if we must. Teaspoons, though. We all know about the black hole that teaspoons, odd socks and pens disappear into, but a grand total of two teaspoons for 19 (or up to 33) people is so paltry as to be hilarious. Everyone soon learns it\u2019s deeply antisocial to walk away from the kitchen with a spoon still in your drink. While no one wants this to feel like a school trip, some planning is necessary with nearly 20 people. We luckily have on hand an ace organiser \u2013 she\u2019s called Jan \u2013 who cheerfully and without a hint of bossiness has sorted out room allocation before most people arrive. Thanks also to her, everyone knew what food to bring \u2013 mains, desserts, breakfast and packed lunch supplies, afternoon cake \u2013 and what we might do each day. Each evening big pans of homemade chilli or curry are heated up and heaps of salad washed, chopped and piled into bowls. Later, homemade cheesecakes and trifles come out and are wolfed down greedily. And because no one wants to appear anything but open-handed, there is loads of everything, wine included, to go around. Those who haven\u2019t cooked that particular evening willingly launch into clearing away, and with two sinks and lots of tea towels, it\u2019s done surprisingly quickly (and some say the best craic of the holiday is in the kitchen over the washing up). By day, the delights of the national park are just outside. In heavy rain the first afternoon, fewer than half of us, waterproof trousers swishing, head off on a walk around Talybont reservoir, while others stay in the dry. In sunshine next day, choices are between a demanding nine-miler with steep climbs and great views and a gentler walk taking in the remains of the Brinore Tramroad (built in 1814 to move limestone down the valley) and the picturesque Monmouthshire and Brecon canal. In the chill February air, thrushes, chaffinches, robins, great tits and blackbirds are celebrating the slightly longer days with loud, spectacular song. We also hear nuthatches and coal tits \u2013 thanks, Merlin app \u2013 and a birder among us photographs a pair of buzzards over Twyn Du. On the last day we drive half an hour along the A40 to hike Pen-y-F\u00e2l, or Sugar Loaf, said to be the \u201cpurple-headed mountain\u201d from All Things Bright and Beautiful, with the Usk the \u201criver running by\u201d. Though I doubt moralistic Victorian hymn writer Cecil Frances Alexander had as much fun as we do over lunch in the excellent Crown at Pantygelli afterwards. Evenings at the hostel mean raucous board games and live music from the handful of musicians among us, on ukulele, banjo, guitar and \u201ccajon\u201d box drum. They\u2019ve never all played together before, and call themselves the Shambles, but give an enjoyable programme ranging from Dylan and John Denver to Little Big Town. And there has to be a quiz. Because some of us love them and those who hate them just have to suck it up. Final question: which hostel shall we do all this again in next winter? Accommodation was provided by YHA, which charges from \u00a3250 a night for exclusive hire. It is offering 20% off exclusive hire stays at selected hostels this winter from 1 December to 2 March (excluding new year) using promo code HOTDEAL-242",

Mumin said: \u201cWe demand an independent investigation into the circumstances of this illegal act, holding those responsible accountable for violating the rights of journalists and the principles of justice.\u201d The head of Risaala Media Corporation, Mohamed Abduwahab, said he condemned \u201cthe abduction and unlawful actions\u201d against Nur, who is known as \u201cJakarta\u201d. SJS said Risaala and Nur\u2019s family had reported armed men arriving at his house at 3am on Friday to detain him and confiscate his phone and laptop. It said that this followed the arrest of other Risaala employees, who have reported critically on the security forces under President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. The arrest threatened the press and the public\u2019s access to independent reporting, it said. The Guardian reported that the journalist AliNur Salaad had been arrested in July after similar reporting on the security forces and there have been several claims of attacks on press freedom since. In August, SJS criticised attacks on journalists covering protests in Mogadishu over the cost of living. It also reported the disappearance of the journalist Ali Mohammed Ahmed (known as Ali Shujac) after he was taken away by plainclothes police officers while conducting public interviews. In July, the journalist Said Abdullahi Kulmiye was arrested for reporting on incidents of police and armed men demanding bribes at checkpoints, while the journalists Sharma\u2019arke Abdi Mahdi and Abdinur Hayi Hashi said they were shot at by four police officers in the town of Dhobley in May. The World Press Freedom Index ranks Somalia 145th out of 180 countries for journalists\u2019 ability to report freely and independently. Aside from attacks on journalists, press freedom groups have argued against a proposed information law, which the government says is designed to reduce leaks and improve the confidentiality of sources. Campaigners say it would reduce the ability of journalists to investigate and report on matters of public interest. \u201cThis could easily be misused to shield government activities from scrutiny, eroding the fundamental right to information and enabling potential abuses of power,\u201d said a letter from regional and international press freedom campaigners, including the International Federation of Journalists.",

Then there was an invisible presence, tugging her duvet off her. She\u2019s been hearing voices, too \u2013 a Spanish woman, and an ethereal voice in a hospital room offering words of comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s like a veil has been lifted,\u201d she says.</p> <p>You sound crackers, I say.

Then she opens the door of the glass room we\u2019re in, and shouts down the spiral stairs to the photo studio below for her partner to bring his phone up. She wants me to hear something.</p> <p>One of Cooper\u2019s many talents is surprise. The writer-performer shot to fame with This Country, the mockumentary about rural poverty in the Cotswolds. She showed her range as the lead in BBC/HBO show <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=85604b0bcae66a71&amp;amp;rlz=1CAXSDZ_enGB1092GB1092&amp;amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL8KA6XT49eWOvWXHcjG4BEFW9voA:1727946600114&amp;amp;q=rain+dogs&amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J_86uWOeqwdnV0yaSF-x2jon2iao6KWCaVjfn7ahz_sfz4kQc-hbvsXJ2gNx0RnV2nl305mvoek0YK94ylYY2a4b3Q-OEwW5lKppi2wujywZWmdIJVp8wrsv_g-eh5sWEDXx8JNpgmjsiKj2mZMvftPlZJZz&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9nqna7vGIAxWq1gIHHQv7MaYQ0pQJegQIEhAB&amp;amp;biw=1397&amp;amp;bih=664&amp;amp;dpr=1.38#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;vld=cid:a2cd03b6,vid:bemwEA9lnSI,st:0\">Rain Dogs</a>, and wrote the twisting female-friendship thriller <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m001c3f9/am-i-being-unreasonable\">Am I Being Unreasonable?</a> Her new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hexy-bitch-9781804192580/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">Hexy Bitch</a>, is a twist again. Her riotous account of her occult experiences includes joining a coven that turned out to be a swingers\u2019 club, regressing to a past life, and attempting to have sex with a ghost. The book is funny and often outrageous, yet serious of intent. Having been through extreme experiences in the past few years, she\u2019s grappling with what death means.</p>    <p>The \u201csomething\u201d she wants me to hear is a recording of one of the voices she heard. Cooper was severely ill&nbsp;with viral meningitis after the birth of her daughter Pip in 2018. She was alone in a private hospital room,&nbsp;she explains before pressing play. I hear her voice, speaking tentatively into the phone. \u201cIf there\u2019s anybody in here&nbsp;\u2026 can you speak into the microphone?\u201d The only response is the background hiss of hospital silence. Then, from somewhere else in the room \u2013 the tiny sound of a girl\u2019s voice, eerily there and not there. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d it cajoles. Although I\u2019m a cynic, the hairs on my arm stand up. Cooper has the phrase tattooed on her wrist. Whenever she doubts herself, she looks down.</p> <p>The supernatural has fascinated her since childhood. After her aunt Alison died in a car accident at the age of 30, her mother routinely dragged Cooper to see psychics in the back of pubs. The mediums would sing Roy Orbison songs between performances, and hold a raffle afterwards. Cooper was unmoved by these grasping, hammy shows, but understands why her mother went. \u201cIt was her desperation to prove everything wasn\u2019t completely meaningless, that her sister was somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Her hope is that technology will advance to the point&nbsp;that scientists can prove there are ghosts. There\u2019s a yearning in the push-pull of her belief. In 2019, she&nbsp;lost&nbsp;her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/10/this-country-star-michael-sleggs-dies-aged-33\">childhood friend Michael Sleggs</a> (who played a version of himself in This Country) to heart failure. Sleggs had endured numerous health problems, including a teenage cancer diagnosis. \u201cHe\u2019d been in&nbsp;constant pain his entire life. Even walking caused him pain,\u201d she says. When he was placed in palliative&nbsp;care, \u201cit was horrible, because he was terrified of dying\u201d. Then she received a phone call that changed&nbsp;everything.</p> <p>Sleggs had had a visitation from an angelic presence, she recounts, which sat at the end of his bed and told him: \u201cIn seven days you will have a new body at midnight.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if that meant death or a full recovery \u2013 but he told her he wasn\u2019t afraid any more. He died seven days after that, \u201cand his time of death was 11.59\u201d. She can\u2019t know whether angels are real, or if this was a powerful example of bodily self-determination. Either way, she thinks it\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>\u201cBut then I think, why hasn\u2019t he come back, out of everybody?\u201d Doubt clouds her face. There was the presence that tugged firmly on her duvet, on the morning of Sleggs\u2019 favourite local festival. She doesn\u2019t know what to make of that. \u201cIf that is you, Slugs, can you please be more specific?\u201d she asks, using his nickname. \u201cWrite your name in lipstick on my mirror. I need to know.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought, I\u2019m gonna die to Dancing Queen. This can\u2019t be the end</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other famous people have stories, too, says Cooper. Tilda Swinton met someone who practises voodoo, and has warned her not to take it lightly. \u201cShe said, \u2018This stuff exists, and it\u2019s dangerous, and you can fuck people\u2019s lives up with it.\u2019\u201d Dermot O\u2019Leary\u2019s wife astrally projects \u201call the time\u201d. The best story she has heard is that of Martin Kemp. While filming in an old Tudor house, the Spandau Ballet bassist saw a woman dressed in 16th-century maid\u2019s clothes, whom he assumed was an extra. \u201cHe asked her: \u2018Do you know what time lunch is?\u2019 And she disappeared!\u201d Cooper cackles. \u201cImagine this ghost being like \u2026 oh no, not Martin Kemp.\u201d</p> <p>While ghosts don\u2019t scare her, she is wary of human reactions to her encounters. \u201cIt\u2019s isolating, because people think you\u2019re mad,\u201d she says. It\u2019s taboo to say that you\u2019ve had an encounter with the world beyond our own, she notes. \u201cBut it exists.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The line between worlds must have felt even thinner of late. It\u2019s been just two months since her son Benji was born, seven weeks prematurely. In the middle of filming a second series of Am I Being Unreasonable? in Bristol, Cooper started getting severe contractions, and had to lie down on set. She was taken to hospital, where her waters broke. She was scared \u2013 especially when she was given a form to sign indicating that if she died, the family wouldn\u2019t sue the hospital.</p> <p>Cooper was sent for an emergency C-section, during which she haemorrhaged badly. She doesn\u2019t remember much, apart from the surgeons in scrubs, playing Abba. \u201cI thought, I\u2019m gonna die to Dancing Queen. This can\u2019t be the end.\u201d She didn\u2019t see any lights or angelic figures.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t able to meet the baby for two days. He was being cared for in the neonatal unit, in a Perspex box hooked up with wires and a monitor. She describes the \u201chell\u201d of nurses struggling to administer an IV drip, \u201ctrying to find a vein on a baby that small. I was terrified he was going to die.\u201d Walking around the hospital in the grip of fear, she was recognised by other patients, and had to pose for selfies. </p> <p>She credits her ex-husband\u2019s wife for looking after the children, and her partner Anthony Huggins with looking after her. He\u2019s here today, a calming, blue-eyed presence who now works as her assistant. There\u2019s support for mothers after an experience like that, she says, \u201cbut a lot of fathers get PTSD from it. They just feel helpless.\u201d</p> <p>Happily the family are healthy, and numerous. They live in South Cerney, Gloucestershire with five children under one roof (two each from previous relationships, plus Benji). They navigate a whole spectrum of childhood issues, she laughs, from a three-year-old boy to a 14-year-old girl. Benji has brought the family even closer. \u201cI thought there\u2019d be jealousy, but they do the whole blended thing well.\u201d</p>    <p>Cooper and Huggins met on Hinge. She had recently divorced the landscape gardener Will Weston, whom she wed in 2019. Their three-year marriage, which produced two children, had become strained, and its implosion seems to have imbued both with energy \u2013 Weston has since remarried, while Cooper has had Benji with Huggins. They began dating while she was filming<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/04/rain-dogs-review-no-wonder-daisy-may-cooper-is-being-touted-as-the-next-m-in-bond\"> Rain Dogs</a>. He had no idea who she was, she reveals with mock outrage. He also told her he worked in advertising, before she discovered his job was putting up billboard posters. During the shoot today, he\u2019d told me the same thing, I say. Cooper storms to the door again and flings it open. She shouts down to the studio floor. \u201cWhy are you still telling people you work in advertising?\u201d She returns to her chair. \u201cThat\u2019s catfishing. How dare he.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was a teenager, there was no point in doing any sort of job if I couldn\u2019t steal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She had assumed her children would follow in her footsteps, but not so. She thinks her daughter Pip might become a surgeon, comparing her to Saffy from Absolutely Fabulous, the prim daughter of a narcissistic mother. \u201cWe\u2019ll be playing Sylvanian families and my heart sinks, because she introduces all these rules. If we were at school, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d hang out with that nerd.\u201d The teasing runs both ways, Cooper reassures. \u201cShe speaks down to me in a loving way. \u2018Mum, you\u2019ve got to blend your foundation.\u2019 It\u2019s humiliating.\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Cooper grew up in Cirencester, just miles from where she lives today, in very different circumstances. Her parents struggled financially. At their poorest, Cooper couldn\u2019t afford tampons. She moved between unrewarding jobs \u2013 one of which was selling towels at House of Fraser. \u201cI used to steal jeans, perfume. No&nbsp;wonder they\u2019re going into administration.\u201d (She\u2019s&nbsp;behind the curve \u2013 it\u2019s been bought by Sports Direct.) Cooper remembers smashing Lindt chocolate Father Christmases on the stockroom floor, to write&nbsp;them off so she could eat them. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, there was no point in doing any sort of job if I couldn\u2019t steal.\u201d</p> <p>In her early 20s, a tarot reader told Cooper she would become a famous actor, so she auditioned for and was accepted into Rada. She hated the training. \u201cA lot of these places are run by people who are massively pretentious and bitter that they didn\u2019t make it.\u201d Students were encouraged to instrumentalise their personal trauma in ways that became competitive, she adds, and it struck her as nonsense. \u201cI\u2019m terrible with authority,\u201d she acknowledges.</p> <p>It was there she met Selin Hizli, with whom she later created Am I Being Unreasonable?. Cooper initially dismissed Hizli as a \u201cwannabe Lily Allen\u201d. The pair had a physical altercation in a lift, before bonding over their mutually unhappy experience of the course. \u201cYou hate the people you end up getting on best with, because they remind you of yourself. Maybe that\u2019s just me.\u201d</p>    <p>Hizli went on to play a queen bee character in an early version of This Country. When the series was commissioned, Cooper ghosted her, afraid to tell her the character had been cut. They patched things up, before losing contact again during the pandemic. They\u2019re fine now, but \u201cI\u2019m not a very good friend\u201d, confesses Cooper. She describes herself as intensely conflict-averse. \u201cI\u2019d be a terrible doctor, as I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell anyone they had cancer. I\u2019d just say everything\u2019s great.\u201d She\u2019s been burnt by people using her to further their own careers; moreover, she can\u2019t keep up with the level of interaction expected of friendships. Today she says: \u201cI&nbsp;have one friend, and no&nbsp;phone.\u201d</p> <p>Her relationship with brother Charlie is, at least, a fairytale. The siblings shared a mattress in London, and an office cleaning job in Cirencester, while improvising sketches based on their childhood. The resulting series was watched by millions and won multiple Baftas, transforming their fortunes. They still squabble, but Daisy, three years older, has always been protective. They anchor each other. </p> <p>How is Charlie? Living nearby, looking after his own 18-month and three-year-old, and not sleeping. \u201cHe looked like a husk before, but now \u2026 he looks like a ghost.\u201d He\u2019s too soft, she diagnoses, unwilling to sleep train or discipline his children. The three-year-old in particular is \u201cgaslighting him all the time. He\u2019s getting mugged off by a&nbsp;toddler.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/oct/16/daisy-may-cooper-on-creating-this-country\">This Country</a> was the best outright comedy of the decade, and in conversation, Cooper is as hilarious as you\u2019d hope. Even her Instagram is an anarchic joy. Her wilfully obtuse romance with an online scammer, who called himself the Sea Captain, made headlines. There was a series of posts aimed at Penguin Books, arguing her right to insert penises into her autobiography <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dont-laugh-itll-only-encourage-her-9781405949224/\">Don\u2019t Laugh, It\u2019ll Only Encourage Her</a>. When she claimed the publisher hadn\u2019t paid her final&nbsp;advance cheque, Cooper commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tiger-king\">Tiger King</a> star to record a negotiation video on her behalf, insisting she would \u201cnow only communicate through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/05/carole-baskin-tiger-king-faces-of-2020\">Carole Baskin</a>\u201d.</p>    <p>She seems to have no filter.<strong> </strong>Does she have any celebrity crushes? \u201cDid you ever watch <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Jinx/dp/B0B6RLRRTC\">The Jinx</a>?\u201d she replies. I can only think of the HBO true crime documentary about the real estate heir serial killer. I&nbsp;needn\u2019t have worried \u2013 that\u2019s exactly who she\u2019s talking about. \u201cI had a massive crush on Bob Durst. He\u2019s really funny,\u201d she whispers, appalled by herself. \u201cYou\u2019re watching him thinking: \u2018I\u2019d really like this guy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine Cooper at the centre of the showbiz whirl. But wrong. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t drink now, I don\u2019t go to parties. I stay at home all the time.\u201d She used to get wildly drunk to combat her introversion, and the pressure to be funny made social situations exhausting. Drink emboldened her, but the hangovers would arrive accompanied by the horrors. \u201cI\u2019d be having flashes of shit I did the night before, thinking \u2026 oh my God. Why did I suck that cab driver off?\u201d</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>This Country aired its final episode in March 2020. Cooper returned with Am I Being Unreasonable? in the autumn of 2022, a hiatus that sounds fraught. \u201cMy marriage was breaking down; I was drinking to get through,\u201d she recounts. The drinking spiralled, to the point, \u201cI was getting up in the morning and drinking vodka.\u201dCooper has spoken candidly about her mental health crisis during the pandemic, and the challenges of motherhood. The pressure got so much, she was hiding bottles in the toilet cistern, feeling depressed and suicidal. \u201cAnd I said I need to go somewhere and sort myself out.\u201d She checked herself into a rehab facility for a month, for alcohol addiction issues.</p> <p>Rehab was \u201clike being in the Big Brother house\u201d, she says \u2013 except with a mixed cast of billionaire\u2019s children, overseas royalty and primary school teachers. She found the experience transformative; not to mention a rich character study. \u201cPeople with addictions are the most creative, interesting, emotionally intelligent people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>    <p>Cooper writes manipulative characters with rare empathy, from the stalker in Am I Being Unreasonable?, to This Country\u2019s Kerry Mucklowe abusing an elder care scheme to get double dinners. In rehab, she confronted her own tricksiness. One of <strong> </strong>them had been to buy a bottle of booze and a gift bag to put it in, pretending she had received a present from work. She discovered many of the alcoholics had done the same thing. \u201cI\u2019d thought I was so clever! Pathetic. So funny.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s writing a film about an addiction recovery centre. Two of the patients she grew closest to at the facility she attended have since died of alcoholism, which is why the story is important to her.</p> <p>Another legacy of rehab is her lack of phone ownership. She had to surrender hers upon checking in, which sounds awful. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she smiles. I guess she now shares a phone with Huggins, to keep up with Instagram, surely a cumbersome arrangement. \u201cI think after the book comes out, I\u2019m going to delete my account,\u201d she says. The general toxicity of social media makes it not worth being on, and like any woman in the public eye, she receives nasty messages. \u201cLots of it is about the way I look, which I really hate,\u201d she adds. \u201cSome guy saying: \u2018Your bottom teeth make me want to barf.\u2019 It\u2019s just bullying.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, Cooper received compliments for her dramatic weight loss, yet the reality is complex. \u201cPeople are like, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve lost so much weight\u2019, but I had always been slim before. That\u2019s what people don\u2019t know.\u201d She had been larger during This Country, and part of her glow up was simply coming off the antidepressant quetiapine. She describes its side-effects as slowing her metabolism to a crawl and giving her the munchies, which caused her weight to balloon. She appreciates the irony. \u201cAren\u2019t these supposed to be antidepressants? Now I&nbsp;hate the way I look.\u201d</p> <p>She calls herself lazy, but is actually what\u2019s known in writing as a \u201cpantser\u201d. \u201cI have to find it in the last minute,\u201d she confirms. A high-pressure process, for a slate as packed as hers. In addition to the rehab film, she\u2019s currently finishing the second series of Am I being Unreasonable? while a third has already been commissioned. There\u2019s a TV project subject to secrecy, but which will be one of the most discussed of the year. She\u2019s also adapting Hilary Mantel\u2019s funny ghost novel Beyond Black, with the Skins and His Dark Materials writer Jack Thorne. Before she died, Mantel said she wanted Cooper to play the part of the travelling medium. It\u2019s a perfect fit \u2013 mixing domestic mundanity and gothic horror, to expose the psychic underbelly of the suburbs. This Country, through a glass darkly.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine she has any time left over, but Cooper also develops new writers, especially those without class advantages or industry connections. There are amazingly creative people who aren\u2019t being reached, she says. She describes a catch-22, in which production companies don\u2019t accept unsolicited scripts, but where it\u2019s hard to get an agent without interest from production companies. Broadcasters, too, could do more to bridge the gap. \u201cThey make it feel very guarded.\u201d</p> <p>Altruism has its downsides, though. One man recently sent her a seven-novels-length account of his time working at Co-op, in which nothing happened \u201capart from getting into work at two minutes past nine, and reducing some grapes\u201d. Sounds a bit Knausg\u00e5rd. In an effort to be more organised, Cooper is starting her own production company.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Me and Charlie came from such a poor upbringing, we were always going cap in hand to people </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her advice to new writers is simple. \u201cMe and Charlie came from such a poor upbringing. We were always going cap in hand to people,\u201d she says. She urges creatives to protect their voice, even when it risks a project not going forward. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to swing your dick around,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t feel inferior to anybody.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper no longer has to worry about money, yet she&nbsp;credits her current wellbeing less to material comfort than confrontations with the immaterial. Her recent visitations, the bizarre sightings and ethereal voices, have had a profound impact. \u201cI used to get terrible anxiety, and I sort of \u2026 don\u2019t now. I feel more at peace.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds as if she is talking about faith. She doesn\u2019t describe herself as religious \u2013 too many terrible deeds have been committed under that name. But she\u2019s aware there\u2019s a broad, existential dimension to her paranormal preoccupation. Everything changes, she muses, once the question changes from an if to a what. Specifically: \u201cWhat is all this? What\u2019s the meaning of being? What\u2019s our purpose? We\u2019re so naive to think there\u2019s not a bigger picture.\u201d She sounds lost in wonder, and for the first time in the conversation, there is a lapse into silence. We\u2019ve butted into the big question, perhaps the only one that matters. I may as well ask. Ultimately, what is the meaning of life?</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cFuck knows.\u201d We both burst out laughing.</p> <p>\u2022 Daisy May Cooper\u2019s Hexy Bitch: Tales from My Life, the Afterlife, and Beyond is published on 24 October by Radar (\u00a322).

      "bodyText": "Daisy May Cooper is being haunted. Her first ghost sighting was two years ago \u2013 a disembodied pair of child\u2019s legs, running around the bedroom of her new-build house. Then there was an invisible presence, tugging her duvet off her. She\u2019s been hearing voices, too \u2013 a Spanish woman, and an ethereal voice in a hospital room offering words of comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s like a veil has been lifted,\u201d she says. You sound crackers, I say. Not something I\u2019d usually voice in an interview \u2013 but there\u2019s an infectious, gossipy ease to being in Cooper\u2019s company. \u201cI do! Completely,\u201d she sighs. Then she opens the door of the glass room we\u2019re in, and shouts down the spiral stairs to the photo studio below for her partner to bring his phone up. She wants me to hear something. One of Cooper\u2019s many talents is surprise. The writer-performer shot to fame with This Country, the mockumentary about rural poverty in the Cotswolds. She showed her range as the lead in BBC/HBO show Rain Dogs, and wrote the twisting female-friendship thriller Am I Being Unreasonable? Her new book, Hexy Bitch, is a twist again. Her riotous account of her occult experiences includes joining a coven that turned out to be a swingers\u2019 club, regressing to a past life, and attempting to have sex with a ghost. The book is funny and often outrageous, yet serious of intent. Having been through extreme experiences in the past few years, she\u2019s grappling with what death means. The \u201csomething\u201d she wants me to hear is a recording of one of the voices she heard. Cooper was severely ill with viral meningitis after the birth of her daughter Pip in 2018. She was alone in a private hospital room, she explains before pressing play. I hear her voice, speaking tentatively into the phone. \u201cIf there\u2019s anybody in here \u2026 can you speak into the microphone?\u201d The only response is the background hiss of hospital silence. Then, from somewhere else in the room \u2013 the tiny sound of a girl\u2019s voice, eerily there and not there. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d it cajoles. Although I\u2019m a cynic, the hairs on my arm stand up. Cooper has the phrase tattooed on her wrist. Whenever she doubts herself, she looks down. The supernatural has fascinated her since childhood. After her aunt Alison died in a car accident at the age of 30, her mother routinely dragged Cooper to see psychics in the back of pubs. The mediums would sing Roy Orbison songs between performances, and hold a raffle afterwards. Cooper was unmoved by these grasping, hammy shows, but understands why her mother went. \u201cIt was her desperation to prove everything wasn\u2019t completely meaningless, that her sister was somewhere.\u201d Her hope is that technology will advance to the point that scientists can prove there are ghosts. There\u2019s a yearning in the push-pull of her belief. In 2019, she lost her childhood friend Michael Sleggs (who played a version of himself in This Country) to heart failure. Sleggs had endured numerous health problems, including a teenage cancer diagnosis. \u201cHe\u2019d been in constant pain his entire life. Even walking caused him pain,\u201d she says. When he was placed in palliative care, \u201cit was horrible, because he was terrified of dying\u201d. Then she received a phone call that changed everything. Sleggs had had a visitation from an angelic presence, she recounts, which sat at the end of his bed and told him: \u201cIn seven days you will have a new body at midnight.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if that meant death or a full recovery \u2013 but he told her he wasn\u2019t afraid any more. He died seven days after that, \u201cand his time of death was 11.59\u201d. She can\u2019t know whether angels are real, or if this was a powerful example of bodily self-determination. Either way, she thinks it\u2019s amazing. \u201cBut then I think, why hasn\u2019t he come back, out of everybody?\u201d Doubt clouds her face. There was the presence that tugged firmly on her duvet, on the morning of Sleggs\u2019 favourite local festival. She doesn\u2019t know what to make of that. \u201cIf that is you, Slugs, can you please be more specific?\u201d she asks, using his nickname. \u201cWrite your name in lipstick on my mirror. I need to know.\u201d Other famous people have stories, too, says Cooper. Tilda Swinton met someone who practises voodoo, and has warned her not to take it lightly. \u201cShe said, \u2018This stuff exists, and it\u2019s dangerous, and you can fuck people\u2019s lives up with it.\u2019\u201d Dermot O\u2019Leary\u2019s wife astrally projects \u201call the time\u201d. The best story she has heard is that of Martin Kemp. While filming in an old Tudor house, the Spandau Ballet bassist saw a woman dressed in 16th-century maid\u2019s clothes, whom he assumed was an extra. \u201cHe asked her: \u2018Do you know what time lunch is?\u2019 And she disappeared!\u201d Cooper cackles. \u201cImagine this ghost being like \u2026 oh no, not Martin Kemp.\u201d While ghosts don\u2019t scare her, she is wary of human reactions to her encounters. \u201cIt\u2019s isolating, because people think you\u2019re mad,\u201d she says. It\u2019s taboo to say that you\u2019ve had an encounter with the world beyond our own, she notes. \u201cBut it exists.\u201d * * * The line between worlds must have felt even thinner of late. It\u2019s been just two months since her son Benji was born, seven weeks prematurely. In the middle of filming a second series of Am I Being Unreasonable? in Bristol, Cooper started getting severe contractions, and had to lie down on set. She was taken to hospital, where her waters broke. She was scared \u2013 especially when she was given a form to sign indicating that if she died, the family wouldn\u2019t sue the hospital. Cooper was sent for an emergency C-section, during which she haemorrhaged badly. She doesn\u2019t remember much, apart from the surgeons in scrubs, playing Abba. \u201cI thought, I\u2019m gonna die to Dancing Queen. This can\u2019t be the end.\u201d She didn\u2019t see any lights or angelic figures. She wasn\u2019t able to meet the baby for two days. He was being cared for in the neonatal unit, in a Perspex box hooked up with wires and a monitor. She describes the \u201chell\u201d of nurses struggling to administer an IV drip, \u201ctrying to find a vein on a baby that small. I was terrified he was going to die.\u201d Walking around the hospital in the grip of fear, she was recognised by other patients, and had to pose for selfies. She credits her ex-husband\u2019s wife for looking after the children, and her partner Anthony Huggins with looking after her. He\u2019s here today, a calming, blue-eyed presence who now works as her assistant. There\u2019s support for mothers after an experience like that, she says, \u201cbut a lot of fathers get PTSD from it. They just feel helpless.\u201d Happily the family are healthy, and numerous. They live in South Cerney, Gloucestershire with five children under one roof (two each from previous relationships, plus Benji). They navigate a whole spectrum of childhood issues, she laughs, from a three-year-old boy to a 14-year-old girl. Benji has brought the family even closer. \u201cI thought there\u2019d be jealousy, but they do the whole blended thing well.\u201d Cooper and Huggins met on Hinge. She had recently divorced the landscape gardener Will Weston, whom she wed in 2019. Their three-year marriage, which produced two children, had become strained, and its implosion seems to have imbued both with energy \u2013 Weston has since remarried, while Cooper has had Benji with Huggins. They began dating while she was filming Rain Dogs. He had no idea who she was, she reveals with mock outrage. He also told her he worked in advertising, before she discovered his job was putting up billboard posters. During the shoot today, he\u2019d told me the same thing, I say. Cooper storms to the door again and flings it open. She shouts down to the studio floor. \u201cWhy are you still telling people you work in advertising?\u201d She returns to her chair. \u201cThat\u2019s catfishing. How dare he.\u201d She had assumed her children would follow in her footsteps, but not so. She thinks her daughter Pip might become a surgeon, comparing her to Saffy from Absolutely Fabulous, the prim daughter of a narcissistic mother. \u201cWe\u2019ll be playing Sylvanian families and my heart sinks, because she introduces all these rules. If we were at school, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d hang out with that nerd.\u201d The teasing runs both ways, Cooper reassures. \u201cShe speaks down to me in a loving way. \u2018Mum, you\u2019ve got to blend your foundation.\u2019 It\u2019s humiliating.\u201d * * * Cooper grew up in Cirencester, just miles from where she lives today, in very different circumstances. Her parents struggled financially. At their poorest, Cooper couldn\u2019t afford tampons. She moved between unrewarding jobs \u2013 one of which was selling towels at House of Fraser. \u201cI used to steal jeans, perfume. No wonder they\u2019re going into administration.\u201d (She\u2019s behind the curve \u2013 it\u2019s been bought by Sports Direct.) Cooper remembers smashing Lindt chocolate Father Christmases on the stockroom floor, to write them off so she could eat them. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, there was no point in doing any sort of job if I couldn\u2019t steal.\u201d In her early 20s, a tarot reader told Cooper she would become a famous actor, so she auditioned for and was accepted into Rada. She hated the training. \u201cA lot of these places are run by people who are massively pretentious and bitter that they didn\u2019t make it.\u201d Students were encouraged to instrumentalise their personal trauma in ways that became competitive, she adds, and it struck her as nonsense. \u201cI\u2019m terrible with authority,\u201d she acknowledges. It was there she met Selin Hizli, with whom she later created Am I Being Unreasonable?. Cooper initially dismissed Hizli as a \u201cwannabe Lily Allen\u201d. The pair had a physical altercation in a lift, before bonding over their mutually unhappy experience of the course. \u201cYou hate the people you end up getting on best with, because they remind you of yourself. Maybe that\u2019s just me.\u201d Hizli went on to play a queen bee character in an early version of This Country. When the series was commissioned, Cooper ghosted her, afraid to tell her the character had been cut. They patched things up, before losing contact again during the pandemic. They\u2019re fine now, but \u201cI\u2019m not a very good friend\u201d, confesses Cooper. She describes herself as intensely conflict-averse. \u201cI\u2019d be a terrible doctor, as I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell anyone they had cancer. I\u2019d just say everything\u2019s great.\u201d She\u2019s been burnt by people using her to further their own careers; moreover, she can\u2019t keep up with the level of interaction expected of friendships. Today she says: \u201cI have one friend, and no phone.\u201d Her relationship with brother Charlie is, at least, a fairytale. The siblings shared a mattress in London, and an office cleaning job in Cirencester, while improvising sketches based on their childhood. The resulting series was watched by millions and won multiple Baftas, transforming their fortunes. They still squabble, but Daisy, three years older, has always been protective. They anchor each other. How is Charlie? Living nearby, looking after his own 18-month and three-year-old, and not sleeping. \u201cHe looked like a husk before, but now \u2026 he looks like a ghost.\u201d He\u2019s too soft, she diagnoses, unwilling to sleep train or discipline his children. The three-year-old in particular is \u201cgaslighting him all the time. He\u2019s getting mugged off by a toddler.\u201d This Country was the best outright comedy of the decade, and in conversation, Cooper is as hilarious as you\u2019d hope. Even her Instagram is an anarchic joy. Her wilfully obtuse romance with an online scammer, who called himself the Sea Captain, made headlines. There was a series of posts aimed at Penguin Books, arguing her right to insert penises into her autobiography Don\u2019t Laugh, It\u2019ll Only Encourage Her. When she claimed the publisher hadn\u2019t paid her final advance cheque, Cooper commissioned a Tiger King star to record a negotiation video on her behalf, insisting she would \u201cnow only communicate through Carole Baskin\u201d. She seems to have no filter. Does she have any celebrity crushes? \u201cDid you ever watch The Jinx?\u201d she replies. I can only think of the HBO true crime documentary about the real estate heir serial killer. I needn\u2019t have worried \u2013 that\u2019s exactly who she\u2019s talking about. \u201cI had a massive crush on Bob Durst. He\u2019s really funny,\u201d she whispers, appalled by herself. \u201cYou\u2019re watching him thinking: \u2018I\u2019d really like this guy.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine Cooper at the centre of the showbiz whirl. But wrong. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t drink now, I don\u2019t go to parties. I stay at home all the time.\u201d She used to get wildly drunk to combat her introversion, and the pressure to be funny made social situations exhausting. Drink emboldened her, but the hangovers would arrive accompanied by the horrors. \u201cI\u2019d be having flashes of shit I did the night before, thinking \u2026 oh my God. Why did I suck that cab driver off?\u201d * * * This Country aired its final episode in March 2020. Cooper returned with Am I Being Unreasonable? in the autumn of 2022, a hiatus that sounds fraught. \u201cMy marriage was breaking down; I was drinking to get through,\u201d she recounts. The drinking spiralled, to the point, \u201cI was getting up in the morning and drinking vodka.\u201dCooper has spoken candidly about her mental health crisis during the pandemic, and the challenges of motherhood. The pressure got so much, she was hiding bottles in the toilet cistern, feeling depressed and suicidal. \u201cAnd I said I need to go somewhere and sort myself out.\u201d She checked herself into a rehab facility for a month, for alcohol addiction issues. Rehab was \u201clike being in the Big Brother house\u201d, she says \u2013 except with a mixed cast of billionaire\u2019s children, overseas royalty and primary school teachers. She found the experience transformative; not to mention a rich character study. \u201cPeople with addictions are the most creative, interesting, emotionally intelligent people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Cooper writes manipulative characters with rare empathy, from the stalker in Am I Being Unreasonable?, to This Country\u2019s Kerry Mucklowe abusing an elder care scheme to get double dinners. In rehab, she confronted her own tricksiness. One of them had been to buy a bottle of booze and a gift bag to put it in, pretending she had received a present from work. She discovered many of the alcoholics had done the same thing. \u201cI\u2019d thought I was so clever! Pathetic. So funny.\u201d She\u2019s writing a film about an addiction recovery centre. Two of the patients she grew closest to at the facility she attended have since died of alcoholism, which is why the story is important to her. Another legacy of rehab is her lack of phone ownership. She had to surrender hers upon checking in, which sounds awful. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d she smiles. I guess she now shares a phone with Huggins, to keep up with Instagram, surely a cumbersome arrangement. \u201cI think after the book comes out, I\u2019m going to delete my account,\u201d she says. The general toxicity of social media makes it not worth being on, and like any woman in the public eye, she receives nasty messages. \u201cLots of it is about the way I look, which I really hate,\u201d she adds. \u201cSome guy saying: \u2018Your bottom teeth make me want to barf.\u2019 It\u2019s just bullying.\u201d Last year, Cooper received compliments for her dramatic weight loss, yet the reality is complex. \u201cPeople are like, \u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve lost so much weight\u2019, but I had always been slim before. That\u2019s what people don\u2019t know.\u201d She had been larger during This Country, and part of her glow up was simply coming off the antidepressant quetiapine. She describes its side-effects as slowing her metabolism to a crawl and giving her the munchies, which caused her weight to balloon. She appreciates the irony. \u201cAren\u2019t these supposed to be antidepressants? Now I hate the way I look.\u201d She calls herself lazy, but is actually what\u2019s known in writing as a \u201cpantser\u201d. \u201cI have to find it in the last minute,\u201d she confirms. A high-pressure process, for a slate as packed as hers. In addition to the rehab film, she\u2019s currently finishing the second series of Am I being Unreasonable? while a third has already been commissioned. There\u2019s a TV project subject to secrecy, but which will be one of the most discussed of the year. She\u2019s also adapting Hilary Mantel\u2019s funny ghost novel Beyond Black, with the Skins and His Dark Materials writer Jack Thorne. Before she died, Mantel said she wanted Cooper to play the part of the travelling medium. It\u2019s a perfect fit \u2013 mixing domestic mundanity and gothic horror, to expose the psychic underbelly of the suburbs. This Country, through a glass darkly. It\u2019s hard to imagine she has any time left over, but Cooper also develops new writers, especially those without class advantages or industry connections. There are amazingly creative people who aren\u2019t being reached, she says. She describes a catch-22, in which production companies don\u2019t accept unsolicited scripts, but where it\u2019s hard to get an agent without interest from production companies. Broadcasters, too, could do more to bridge the gap. \u201cThey make it feel very guarded.\u201d Altruism has its downsides, though. One man recently sent her a seven-novels-length account of his time working at Co-op, in which nothing happened \u201capart from getting into work at two minutes past nine, and reducing some grapes\u201d. Sounds a bit Knausg\u00e5rd. In an effort to be more organised, Cooper is starting her own production company. Her advice to new writers is simple. \u201cMe and Charlie came from such a poor upbringing. We were always going cap in hand to people,\u201d she says. She urges creatives to protect their voice, even when it risks a project not going forward. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to swing your dick around,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t feel inferior to anybody.\u201d Cooper no longer has to worry about money, yet she credits her current wellbeing less to material comfort than confrontations with the immaterial. Her recent visitations, the bizarre sightings and ethereal voices, have had a profound impact. \u201cI used to get terrible anxiety, and I sort of \u2026 don\u2019t now. I feel more at peace.\u201d It sounds as if she is talking about faith. She doesn\u2019t describe herself as religious \u2013 too many terrible deeds have been committed under that name. But she\u2019s aware there\u2019s a broad, existential dimension to her paranormal preoccupation. Everything changes, she muses, once the question changes from an if to a what. Specifically: \u201cWhat is all this? What\u2019s the meaning of being? What\u2019s our purpose? We\u2019re so naive to think there\u2019s not a bigger picture.\u201d She sounds lost in wonder, and for the first time in the conversation, there is a lapse into silence. We\u2019ve butted into the big question, perhaps the only one that matters. I may as well ask. Ultimately, what is the meaning of life? She doesn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cFuck knows.\u201d We both burst out laughing. \u2022 Daisy May Cooper\u2019s Hexy Bitch: Tales from My Life, the Afterlife, and Beyond is published on 24 October by Radar (\u00a322).

This would mean 26 quadrillion drops of water in the sea \u2013 or 26 followed by 24 zeros (in the US this would be called 26 septillion). It\u2019s just a rough estimate!

      "body": "<p>Icylyn Goddard, 86, has lived in her maisonette in Wembley, north London, for more than 40 years. She finished paying off the mortgage on it 20 years ago, but still does not own her own home and was recently told she would need to spend more than \u00a3200,000 to ensure she can spend the rest of her life there.</p> <p>Goddard is a leaseholder and has 11 years left on her lease. In July, lawyers for the freeholder of her building told her that she needed to pay \u00a3212,000 plus valuers\u2019 fees to extend it for 125 years. She was told that if an agreement was not completed within three months, the terms offered to her would be revised.</p> <p>She says that a recent valuation of her home found that with a long lease it would be worth \u00a3350,000. Paying about two-thirds of that to extend the existing lease will be very difficult for her. But if she does not do so, ultimately it will expire and her home will become the property of the freeholder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is causing me anxiety, sleepless nights, loss of appetite and grief overload</p> <footer> <cite>Icylyn Goddard</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI believe I\u2019m not the only elderly person facing this kind of financial challenge despite having paid off my mortgage years ago,\u201d Goddard says. \u201cThe situation I\u2019m in is distressing and unjust. The choice I am faced with is either to be forced out of my own home or to be subjected to unreasonable financial demands because of the terms of the leasehold agreement.\u201d</p> <p>She feels that the situation is a \u201clegal scam\u201d. She says: \u201cIt is causing me anxiety, sleepless nights, loss of appetite and grief overload.\u201d</p> <p>Goddard is right that there are others who have been through similar. Levi Thomas and his wife bought their home in north-west London in 1974. He assumed that once he had finished paying off the mortgage, the home belonged to him and his family. But instead, since 2008 he has been paying \u00a31,040 a month to live in the same house \u2013 a big strain on the 86-year-old\u2019s budget \u2013 and he has nothing to leave his children.</p> <p>When they bought, the couple had recently come to the UK from Jamaica and were not familiar with the way the leasehold system worked. They did not realise that there was a lease on their home that they needed to extend before it expired. There were 34 years left at that point and as the clock ticked down they were oblivious until he received a letter warning him that his lease was due to expire soon. </p> <p>Thomas was appalled to discover that the mortgage he had paid off counted for nothing. A letter was sent to the freeholder from a family member in 2008 pleading with them to allow Thomas to extend the lease. But instead it expired, the property reverted to the freeholder and Thomas was given an assured tenancy on it. Although eye-watering to many, the freeholder says the rent is below the market price for a property of that size in that area.</p> <p>New residential leaseholds were abolished in Scotland in 1974 and the number now remaining is negligible. However, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/leasehold-disputes\">plight</a> of people who buy leasehold homes, whether from private developers or former council properties, and face crippling service charges has been widely reported. But less is heard about those whose leases have expired or are due to expire soon.</p> <p>In response to concerns about the many problems leasehold arrangements can cause, the previous government passed the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024, which increases rights for leaseholders.</p> <p>Calls are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/09/ministers-accused-of-dawdling-over-leasehold-changes-in-england-and-wales\">mounting</a> to pass the secondary legislation needed to enforce the act, which would ban developers from selling new houses as leaseholds, make it cheaper to extend a lease and increase the standard lease length to 990 years.</p> <p>The new government is also planning further reform with the introduction of the leasehold and commonhold reform bill.</p> <p>Currently, if the lease on a property has only a few years left on it, it is likely to be very expensive to renew or extend it. Once the lease drops below 80 years, there is an additional expense factored in, called marriage value, which is based on the increase in value of the property if the lease extension is granted. The money is paid to the freeholder.</p>    <p>Giles Peaker of Anthony Gold solicitors, who specialises in leasehold agreements, says: \u201cBoth of these cases are a clear illustration of why leasehold can be a dreadful form of tenure, and why there needs to be a clear route out of it to instead a share of freehold or to commonhold for existing leaseholders.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyers for the freeholders who own the freehold to Goddard\u2019s property did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Tony Beaumont, the managing director at Hamways, which manages Thomas\u2019s property, said: \u201cMr Thomas has been an assured tenant for over 16 years and we are always available to assist with any repairs or rental concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas\u2019s daughter, Janice Lamont, says: \u201cNow he is 86 it is very difficult for him to afford this amount every month.

      "body": "<p>\u2018It was a terrible sensation when I heard the sentence: life.\u201d It was 11 March 2016 and Daniela Poggiali had just been confirmed as Italy\u2019s \u201cangel of death\u201d. Less than 18 months after she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/italy-nurse-dead-patients-hospital-photographs#:~:text=Police%2C%20who%20arrested%20Poggiali%20on,bloodstream%20after%20a%20few%20days.\">first been arrested</a>, in October 2014, the nurse was now the country\u2019s most infamous killer, convicted of killing one elderly patient<strong> </strong>and suspected of dozens of other murders.</p> <p>\u201cI struggled to rationalise it,\u201d she says, \u201cI just thought they were grabbing a crab.\u201d (This is a curious Italian phrase that roughly translates as doing something irrational or idiotic.)</p> <p>Today Poggiali looks exactly like she did when she first became national news. Her short blond hair frames a handsome face. She is wearing pale lipstick and short-shorts. She has a deep tan, a nose stud, various earrings and defiant tattoos (\u201cUntil the end\u201d and \u201cNothing other than us\u201d).</p> <p>We\u2019re meeting in the offices of Lorenzo Valgimigli, the lawyer she employed after that disastrous initial trial. Valgimigli\u2019s offices are in Faenza, an ancient, brick-built town of about 60,000 inhabitants just south-east of Bologna. Poggiali has always lived here, or in the surrounding towns and villages.</p>    <p>She and Valgimigli endured nine years of trials and appeals in relation to two deaths. She was acquitted of murder in both cases on appeal, most recently in January 2023,<strong> </strong>but their version of what she has been through is alarming, and poses profound questions about cases involving suspected serial killers in&nbsp;healthcare.</p> <p>Those are being posed with ever more urgency given the questions now surrounding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/09/lucy-letby-evidence-experts-question\">safety of Lucy Letby\u2019s convictions</a>. Letby is the nurse who was last year found guilty of the murder of seven newborns, and the attempted murder of seven others, in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester hospital, in the north-west of England. Criminal barristers, medics and statisticians have all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/27/lucy-letby-inquiry-should-be-postponed-changed-experts\">expressed misgivings over the safety of her&nbsp;convictions</a>.</p> <p>Poggiali\u2019s nine-year journey through the court system has been frequently referred to in discussions about Letby\u2019s case. She was born on 23 October 1972, the youngest of three sisters. \u201cOurs was a humble family,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother was a housewife and my father worked on the motorways.\u201d She moved a few miles away to the city of Imola, studied accounting, and then changed tack and qualified as a nurse in 1995. \u201cI was just curious to begin with,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I slowly realised that I really liked it. I liked learning so many things, helping others, always being busy at work and being in contact with people.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, Poggiali joined the staff of the palliative care department at Umberto I hospital in Lugo, near Ravenna. A childless and energetic 40-year-old, she took every shift offered. \u201cSometimes life was a bit too frenetic,\u201d she says. \u201cWork was busy and you would miss rest days. But otherwise I would just be an aunt or be with my mother. I liked to travel, listen to music, read&nbsp;books.\u201d</p> <p>Poggiali is an ebullient character and rubbed her colleagues up the wrong way. \u201cI\u2019ve never had filters in my personality,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI should bite my tongue, but I don\u2019t. So I said things I shouldn\u2019t have about my boss.\u201d She made enemies among her peers, too. They believed she gave patients sleeping pills to have a quiet night shift, or laxatives to make sure her colleagues had a tough one. It was gossip that she has always denied. \u201cIn a workplace there\u2019s always chitchat and jealousies,\u201d she shakes her head, \u201cbut I never thought it could come&nbsp;to this.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Daniela Poggiali dyed her hair pink, wore cartoon-character T-shirts or pumped her fist. It was easy for the prosecutors and press to portray her as a gleeful she-devil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her conduct was under scrutiny, however. Things went missing. Towards the end of 2013, there were 27 incidents of petty theft in the hospital. Her colleagues thought Poggiali was responsible and she was reported to the police.<strong> </strong>In 2014, she was given an <em>obbligo di firma</em>: an obligation to sign in daily at the local police station while awaiting trial for the thefts. She was found guilty in October 2016 of the attempted theft of the wallet of a man visiting his sick wife, and was sentenced to three months in custody and a \u20ac100 fine. In November 2016 she was also sentenced to four and a half years in custody for the theft of pharmaceuticals and food. Both sentences were upheld on appeal and in the supreme&nbsp;court.</p> <p>Equally serious was her apparent celebration of death. Those who have worked in a hospice say that there is sometimes relief when a patient finally dies, relief that can come from a place of empathy or selfishness. In one moment of what she calls \u201cstupidity\u201d, Poggiali immortalised hers by giving a thumbs up next to an elderly patient who had just died. A colleague took a photo on her phone of Poggiali\u2019s grinning face next to the open mouth of the deceased.</p>    <p>In spring 2014, her colleagues noted <em>morti inattes</em><em>e</em> (unexpected deaths) when Poggiali was on shift. Between 30 March and 6 April 2014, there were six. It was recorded on 2 April 2014 that potassium chloride had been incorrectly placed in the drawer of the nurses\u2019 trolley (rather than in the dispensary) and that two phials of the medication \u2013 usually diluted and injected to treat or prevent low blood potassium \u2013 were unaccounted for. When another patient, 78-year-old Rosa Calderoni, died on 8 April 2014 (having been left alone with Poggiali), the hospital alerted the&nbsp;police,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the following day&nbsp;she was suspended.</p> <p>Off work and still signing in at the police station every day because of the theft investigation, Poggiali tried to continue as normal. She had made plans to go to the Stuttgart beer festival in October. \u201cI had even received permission from the authorities to travel abroad,\u201d she says. \u201cI had been round to say goodbye to my mum, and then, from a clear sky, the police turned up and invited me to the station. They said they had something to talk about.\u201d The authorities had reversed their decision: she was no longer allowed to leave the country, and was being charged with murder over Calderoni\u2019s death.</p> <p>The following week, Italy\u2019s \u201cangel of death\u201d was the lead story on the national news. Magistrates spoke of 38 <em>morti sospette</em> (suspicious deaths). The photograph of Poggiali\u2019s pose over a corpse was blown up behind every newsreader.</p> <p>Poggiali was imprisoned pending a trial, but her brief appearances in court had already made up many people\u2019s minds: she seemed oddly carefree and smiling. \u201cShe never had a subservient attitude,\u201d Valgimigli tells me. \u201cShe always had a straight back in court. It seemed like defiance.\u201d In later years, she dyed her hair pink, wore cartoon-character T-shirts or pumped her fist. It was easy for the prosecutors and press to portray her as a gleeful she-devil.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The Poggiali case is intriguing given the debate about the safety of Lucy Letby\u2019s convictions.<strong> </strong>Adam King, a practising barrister, <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2024/07/the-questions-haunting-the-lucy-letby-trial/\">has written in UnHerd</a> that Letby\u2019s case is an example of the \u201ccontagion of confirmation bias\u201d, claiming the \u201ctheory\u201d of her guilt \u201cwas based almost entirely on her having been on shift at the relevant times\u201d. British justice has also been cross-examined in reporting by the New Yorker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/03/i-am-evil-i-did-this-lucy-letbys-so-called-confessions-were-written-on-advice-of-counsellors\">the Guardian</a> and the Financial Times. <a href=\"https://www.private-eye.co.uk/special-reports/lucy-letby\">Private Eye\u2019s MD column</a> (authored by the physician Dr Phil Hammond) described at length the flaws in the prosecution\u2019s case: postmortems found natural causes in the deaths of five of the seven babies. Many were extremely premature and profoundly fragile. Experts in the care of newborns told him there were more likely causes of death than the ones proposed by the prosecution, and that the main method of murder alleged \u2013 injecting air into the babies \u2013 was implausible.</p> <p>The jury only heard about half the deaths during the period Letby was said to have been killing, making the data appear cherrypicked. The hospital unit was downgraded, meaning it no longer cared for the most premature and low-weight babies, around the same time that Letby was removed from duty. Comparing her shifts with those of later months was like comparing apples and pears.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s special correspondent, Felicity Lawrence, has reported on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/27/lucy-letby-inquiry-should-be-postponed-changed-experts\">letter submitted to the health secretary</a> signed by 24 leading statisticians, paediatric doctors, forensic scientists and neonatologists. Speaking of \u201csystemic issues\u201d in justice regarding \u201cmedical serial killers\u201d, it said: \u201cWe believe that legal systems are particularly vulnerable to errors when dealing with intricate scientific evidence, especially in cases involving statistical anomalies in healthcare settings.\u201d</p>    <p>Those who doubt Letby\u2019s convictions have pointed to various well-known miscarriages of justice. On first sight, the probabilities offered by prosecution experts in those cases seemed utterly convincing: in November 1999, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/17/childrensservices.uknews\">solicitor Sally Clark was sentenced to life for the murder</a> of her two infant sons following analysis that suggested the chances of two children in the same family suffering sudden infant death syndrome (or \u201ccot death\u201d) was \u201cone in 73m\u201d.</p> <p>In 2003, Lucia de Berk, a Dutch paediatric nurse, was convicted of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/25/andrewosborn\">four murders and three attempted murders</a> of children in her care (and, a year later, of seven murders and three attempted murders). One criminologist gave evidence to suggest that the probability of so many deaths occurring while De Berk was on duty was \u201cone in 342m\u201d. (Given these notorious examples of misleading probabilities, the prosecution in the Letby case avoided using \u201cone in a million\u201d-style claims.)</p> <p>Clark\u2019s and De Berk\u2019s convictions were subsequently overturned, with professional statisticians pouring scorn on the analyses. In January 2002, the president of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) wrote to the UK attorney general asserting that the \u201cone in 73m figure cannot be regarded as statistically valid\u201d, calling it \u201cfallacious\u201d and \u201ca serious error of logic\u201d. Clark was released a year later, but suffered from mental illness and alcoholism, and died in 2007. De Berk was exonerated in 2010.</p> <p>The statistician who fought to clear De Berk\u2019s name \u2013 Richard Gill, emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands \u2013 was also instrumental in overturning Daniela Poggiali\u2019s conviction. Gill took to social media during the Lucy Letby trial to dispute the use of statistics in that case, and was warned by police that he was in danger of contempt of court. He says now that in each of these cases he sees \u201cthe same errors: bad data, incompetent statistical analysis\u201d.</p> <p>Along with Julia Mortera, a forensic statistician and now honorary professor at the University of Bristol, Gill was a co-author of an RSS paper published in September 2022, before Letby\u2019s trial, entitled Healthcare Serial Killer Or Coincidence? Mortera was also an integral part of Poggiali\u2019s defence team, and she and Gill co-authored, with another professor, Francesco Dotto, an academic paper about that case.</p> <p>They assert that the murder convictions of medical staff are frequently based on the same errors. Confusion usually sets in with the foggy logic of the \u201cTexas sharpshooter fallacy\u201d, named after the apocryphal story of a gun-toting Texan who randomly fires off rounds into a barn door, finds a cluster and circles them as evidence that she\u2019s a crack shot. In Gill and Mortera\u2019s analysis, tunnel vision can quickly take over and all pieces of other evidence (the stray shots or outliers) are ignored. Stories and pictures emerge from our narrative&nbsp;impulses.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Prejudices often play a major role in giving significance to a cluster: \u2018It\u2019s about picking on a suitable scapegoat. They have to be some kind of outsider\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt first, it\u2019s just a load of dots,\u201d the consultant on the ward where Lucy Letby worked told the author of the New Yorker essay, referring to the cluster connecting Letby\u2019s presence when babies collapsed, \u201cbut you stare at them, and all of a sudden the picture appears. And then, once you can see that picture, you see it every time you look, and you think, \u2018How the hell did I miss that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When those clusters coincide with the presence of employees who are considered tricky or problematic, they appear more convincing, Gill says. He adds that prejudices often play a major role in giving significance to a cluster: \u201cIt\u2019s about picking on a suitable scapegoat,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey have to be some kind of outsider.\u201d This wasn\u2019t true of Letby, who was said to be well liked, but Lucia de Berk was a former sex worker; and Sally Clark had been in the Priory clinic for postnatal depression. Other accused nurses have been neurodiverse, gay or foreign. \u201cDaniela Poggiali was a nurse with a strong and colourful personality and a sharp tongue,\u201d write Gill, Mortera and Dotto. Paradoxically, Gill notes that those accused are often the most conscientious, doing more shifts (which influences deaths-to-presence figures) or being vocally critical of failings in the hospital or their superiors. </p> <p>Once a pattern of \u201csuspicious\u201d events has been identified, top hospital management or senior clinicians can appoint themselves investigators and interrogators, says Gill, \u201cor to put it more crudely, carry out a witch-hunt\u201d. In Poggiali\u2019s case, a senior colleague became a de facto detective, recovering intravenous bags and testing for potassium. According to her lawyer, Valgimigli, gossip dominated the prosecution\u2019s hypothesis: Poggiali had been heard to complain to colleagues that Rosa Calderoni was a difficult patient; another patient she was later accused of murdering was the former boss of her partner (a workman from the nearby town of Conselice), with whom she was thought to have had issues.</p>    <p>Private notes or diaries provided \u201cgotcha moments\u201d in the cases against De Berk and Letby: De Berk writing about secret \u201ccompulsions\u201d and Letby about being \u201cevil\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/sep/03/i-am-evil-i-did-this-lucy-letbys-so-called-confessions-were-written-on-advice-of-counsellors\">(\u201cI am evil I did this\u201d)</a>. Letby clearly felt bereft and guilty about repeated neonatal deaths on her watch. But feeling guilty, which innocent people often do, isn\u2019t the same as being criminally responsible. It has recently been revealed that Letby\u2019s notorious notes were actually the result of a cathartic exercise recommended by therapists.</p> <p>The clincher against Poggiali was even worse: that photograph. It was used by the prosecution as the \u201chomepage\u201d of the courtroom screen, on show to the jury and press every day. \u201cThat photo was proof of my guilt,\u201d she tells me with exasperation. \u201cHaving done something stupid doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a serial killer.\u201d (Although now cleared of all murder charges, she has been struck off as a nurse owing to that unprofessional&nbsp;image.)</p> <p>The other pillars of the prosecution in the cases of Poggiali and De Berk were the probabilities: what was the likelihood of it being just chance that they were always on duty when patients died? This is where statisticians are most sceptical of these murder convictions, since the interpretation of those duty rosters relies on which deaths they include. There are so many deaths at the extremity of life that it\u2019s easy to cherrypick ones to show that X was \u201calways\u201d there.</p> <p>This is the notorious \u201cprosecutor\u2019s fallacy\u201d: in the words of the RSS paper, it leads people to confuse \u201cthe probability of the evidence given a hypothesis with the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence\u201d. No one, the RSS paper urges, should think that the probability of an animal having four legs if it is a horse is the same as the probability that an animal is a horse if it has four legs. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s fallacy,\u201d the RSS report maintains, \u201cis a seductive and widespread mode of reasoning, affecting the general public, the media, lawyers, jurors and judges alike.\u201d</p> <p>That fallacy underpins alleged cases of medical misconduct because someone testifies the probability of X number of deaths occurring randomly is, say, one in a million. On hearing that, people \u201ctranspose the conditional probabilities\u201d and assume that there is a one in a million chance that the deaths are occurring randomly. It\u2019s a bit like reasoning that since the chances of winning the lottery are one in 50m, anyone who does win is clearly a cheat: it\u2019s so unlikely it must be fixed. It\u2019s a short step from there to confuse the profound improbability of an event with the overwhelming probability of a suspect being guilty.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>\u2018Prison is terrible,\u201d recalls Poggiali. \u201cEverything is uphill. Your family outside is doing badly because of you.\u201d Her face suddenly gives way as she speaks. \u201cEven now it moves me. You feel bad for your family.\u201d</p> <p>She was allowed eight 10-minute phone calls, and six physical visits a month. Most of her time was spent reading the novels of Christian Jacq, the French Egyptologist. She was on cleaning and cooking duties, and sometimes looked after the prison governor\u2019s dog, Lillo. \u201cI had the advantage of being in a small prison, a family setting. The staff were almost maternal figures. They seemed fond of me.\u201d</p> <p>She was the prison\u2019s most infamous inmate, and during Sunday mass male prisoners from the adjacent facility would try to talk to her. She received \u201c50 or so\u201d letters a year, hoping for friendships or courtships. But former colleagues continued to shun her.<strong> </strong>\u201cBefore there were people who would smile, have a chat, a coffee. And then one said to me, \u2018I\u2019ve got to stay out of it because I\u2019ve got two children I have to defend.\u2019 What does that&nbsp;mean?\u201d</p> <p>For her lawyer, the use of gossip and hearsay showed how far her trial had strayed from a serious process. \u201cTrials should reconstruct the evidence, giving a judgment that gets close to a science. If you graft on to that emotionality, irrationality, gut instincts and drives, you end up contaminating this reasoning.\u201d</p>    <p>Valgimigli had been recommended to Poggiali after she was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison at the end of her first trial. He\u2019s the archetypal provincial lawyer: an intellectual working out of an ancient palazzo with frescoed, vaulted ceilings. The sliding ladder behind his desk only reaches halfway up the shelves. He sourced experts who dismantled the postmortem potassium evidence. Potassium measurements from the vitreous humour of the eyeballs (where cell breakdown occurs more slowly) have long been one of a number of ways to estimate time of death (because the concentration of potassium increases more steadily there after death than in other organs). But the prosecution had used potassium levels to imply foul play. \u201cA stroke of genius,\u201d Valgimigli says sarcastically. \u201cThere is agreement [within the scientific community] that this model cannot be used to diagnose a fatal potassium infusion.\u201d</p> <p>Gill and Mortera\u2019s submissions had been dismissed as irrelevant by a haughty judge in the first trial, but on appeal Valgimigli leaned heavily on their statistical expertise to distance causation from correlation. Mortera subsequently wrote of the prosecution\u2019s statistics offered in Poggiali\u2019s case as being \u201ctotally misleading\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious mistake,\u201d she tells me, \u201cto assume that a significant association indicates a&nbsp;causation.\u201d</p> <p>A chart linking Poggiali\u2019s shifts to deaths appeared, at first, a convincing graphic, a persuasive technique that has been used in many other trials of medical staff. But, as John O\u2019Quigley of University College London pointed out in his recent<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00258024241242549\"> paper on \u201cstatistical blunders\u201d</a>, all the shift chart shows is that \u201cwhen the suspected nurse was on duty she was \u2026 on duty\u201d.</p> <p>There were many variables not accounted for in the statistical analysis presented by the prosecution in Poggiali\u2019s case: all the other shifts she worked without deaths; the fact that deaths normally occur in early morning shifts, when Poggiali was<strong> </strong>invariably present; that admissions policies \u2013 accepting more acute cases, or fewer \u2013 affect a ward\u2019s mortality rates.</p> <p>In July 2017, Bologna\u2019s court of appeal overturned Poggiali\u2019s first-degree murder sentence and attributed Calderoni\u2019s death to natural causes. After just over 1,000 days in custody, Poggiali emerged exultant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In premature baby and palliative care wards, death is a frequent occurrence, and determining the cause is notoriously imprecise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Prosecutors appealed against the decision to the supreme court. They were clearly convinced of her guilt, but perhaps vanity played its part. Investigating magistrates in Italy become media stars, offering running commentaries on their investigations to TV cameras. It\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t want to lose not only a famous case, but also the national notoriety. (Those involved in the Letby investigation have also embraced the limelight, with police releasing an in-house documentary of their investigation and giving lengthy interviews to broadcasters.)</p> <p>In 2018 the supreme court annulled the appeals court verdict and ordered a retrial. The following year Poggiali was again acquitted. In 2020, as she was nursing her dying mother, she was rearrested and charged with the murder of 95-year-old Massimo Montanari (her partner\u2019s former employer, who had died on 12 March 2014, a month before Calderoni). On 15 December 2020 she was sentenced to life in prison. Again she was acquitted on appeal. She was also accused of having asked her sister over the phone to steal pharmaceuticals for their mother (that case was dismissed).</p> <p>It was once hoped that statistics could blow away the mists of doubt in medical murder trials. But professional statisticians urge caution, not only about using them to determine innocence or guilt, but even to show that a murder has taken place. \u201cWe are talking about workplaces where many people do die,\u201d says Gill. In premature baby and palliative care wards, death is a frequent occurrence, and determining the cause is notoriously imprecise.</p> <p>Among their many recommendations in the RSS paper, Gill and Mortera offer an established and poetic corrective to \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s fallacy\u201d: Bayes\u2019 theorem. Thomas Bayes was an 18th-century Presbyterian minister who found a means to \u201cinvert\u201d (rather than \u201ctranspose\u201d) the conditional. Bayes\u2019 theorem looks at the problem from the other end. If an animal has four legs, one can only calculate the probability of it being a horse if one has more information (how many non-horse animals also have four legs). One needs to take into account the \u201cprior probabilities\u201d, which in medical settings means thousands of patients seeing hundreds of medics with almost endless variables. Very quickly this far more nuanced probabilistic reasoning makes those outlandish \u201cone in a million\u201d claims seem&nbsp;redundant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/09/lucy-letby-evidence-experts-question\">Lucy Letby: killer or coincidence?

He orders chilled red wine for lunch and says he could never live outside the slim, brick buildings of his home town of Faenza. He seems to understand his compatriots\u2019 misguided fears: some of his fellow <em>Faentini</em>, he says, \u201chave never emerged from this nightmare, that there was an angel of death walking the corridors injecting death instead of saving life\u201d. But he\u2019s adamant that the real danger is something less fantastical: a false accusation. \u201cIn Romagna, we think we\u2019re something a bit apart,\u201d he says, meaning the locals consider themselves more civilised. \u201cBut are we truly safe? What does your life become if you come under malign suspicion, if you\u2019re in the crosshairs?\u201d Just because Poggiali appeared \u201cbrazen\u201d, her case became a \u201cvery provincial witch\u2011hunt\u201d.</p> <p>Her life has been, if not ruined, certainly profoundly interrupted. Her name is toxic to employers. \u201cYou\u2019re labelled that way,\u201d she laments, \u201ceven if you\u2019ve won&nbsp;all&nbsp;these trials. You go out and people look at you&nbsp;from afar \u2013 they start talking to the person next to them.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s always busy, but is technically unemployed. She hasn\u2019t moved though. She\u2019s still here, strutting the diagonals of Faenza\u2019s colonnaded squares. She drives a dusty Fiat Panda with a pink furry frog on the back seat. As we sit in it, she says she\u2019s not sure what to do next. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about going abroad, but I\u2019m limited linguistically. And it\u2019s hard to start over if you don\u2019t have economic means.\u201d She has at least reconciled with her former partner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m very sorry for Lucy Letby on a human level. She\u2019s been painted as a serial killer on the basis of what? That she was always present when babies died?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She misses her old work, but is worried about its feasibility as a profession now, implying that the risks are too great. \u201cOne can\u2019t be a nurse today,\u201d she says. Talking about Letby, Poggiali says: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for her on a human level. That\u2019s a case that is even more sad than mine because it involved newborns. I think she could be innocent because she\u2019s been painted as a serial killer on the basis of what? That she was always present when babies died?</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t accept death any more,\u201d Poggiali continues. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to make them [the bereaved] believe it. They say: \u2018But I was here yesterday and she [the relative] was fine.\u2019\u201d She is indignant at her treatment by the press, the judiciary and her fellow citizens. \u201cJournalists are bastards. Sorry.\u201d She feels like a scapegoat for a failing healthcare system that was underfunded and understaffed.</p> <p>In many ways, Poggiali has always made a rod for her own back. Her talk of the need to accept death could easily be misinterpreted as confirmation that there really was a killer doing the rounds. Of all the stories, that\u2019s the version people naturally want to believe, because a guilty individual provides a reason, a clear explanation for a relative\u2019s death. Alternative explanations \u2013 system failures, chance, natural causes \u2013 are so much more boring than the old story that it\u2019s all the fault of a beguiling witch. </p> <p>\u2022 Tobias Jones lives in Parma, Italy.

      "bodyText": "\u2018It was a terrible sensation when I heard the sentence: life.\u201d It was 11 March 2016 and Daniela Poggiali had just been confirmed as Italy\u2019s \u201cangel of death\u201d. Less than 18 months after she had first been arrested, in October 2014, the nurse was now the country\u2019s most infamous killer, convicted of killing one elderly patient and suspected of dozens of other murders. \u201cI struggled to rationalise it,\u201d she says, \u201cI just thought they were grabbing a crab.\u201d (This is a curious Italian phrase that roughly translates as doing something irrational or idiotic.) Today Poggiali looks exactly like she did when she first became national news. Her short blond hair frames a handsome face. She is wearing pale lipstick and short-shorts. She has a deep tan, a nose stud, various earrings and defiant tattoos (\u201cUntil the end\u201d and \u201cNothing other than us\u201d). We\u2019re meeting in the offices of Lorenzo Valgimigli, the lawyer she employed after that disastrous initial trial. Valgimigli\u2019s offices are in Faenza, an ancient, brick-built town of about 60,000 inhabitants just south-east of Bologna. Poggiali has always lived here, or in the surrounding towns and villages. She and Valgimigli endured nine years of trials and appeals in relation to two deaths. She was acquitted of murder in both cases on appeal, most recently in January 2023, but their version of what she has been through is alarming, and poses profound questions about cases involving suspected serial killers in healthcare. Those are being posed with ever more urgency given the questions now surrounding the safety of Lucy Letby\u2019s convictions. Letby is the nurse who was last year found guilty of the murder of seven newborns, and the attempted murder of seven others, in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester hospital, in the north-west of England. Criminal barristers, medics and statisticians have all expressed misgivings over the safety of her convictions. Poggiali\u2019s nine-year journey through the court system has been frequently referred to in discussions about Letby\u2019s case. She was born on 23 October 1972, the youngest of three sisters. \u201cOurs was a humble family,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother was a housewife and my father worked on the motorways.\u201d She moved a few miles away to the city of Imola, studied accounting, and then changed tack and qualified as a nurse in 1995. \u201cI was just curious to begin with,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I slowly realised that I really liked it. I liked learning so many things, helping others, always being busy at work and being in contact with people.\u201d In 2012, Poggiali joined the staff of the palliative care department at Umberto I hospital in Lugo, near Ravenna. A childless and energetic 40-year-old, she took every shift offered. \u201cSometimes life was a bit too frenetic,\u201d she says. \u201cWork was busy and you would miss rest days. But otherwise I would just be an aunt or be with my mother. I liked to travel, listen to music, read books.\u201d Poggiali is an ebullient character and rubbed her colleagues up the wrong way. \u201cI\u2019ve never had filters in my personality,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI should bite my tongue, but I don\u2019t. So I said things I shouldn\u2019t have about my boss.\u201d She made enemies among her peers, too. They believed she gave patients sleeping pills to have a quiet night shift, or laxatives to make sure her colleagues had a tough one. It was gossip that she has always denied. \u201cIn a workplace there\u2019s always chitchat and jealousies,\u201d she shakes her head, \u201cbut I never thought it could come to this.\u201d Her conduct was under scrutiny, however. Things went missing. Towards the end of 2013, there were 27 incidents of petty theft in the hospital. Her colleagues thought Poggiali was responsible and she was reported to the police. In 2014, she was given an obbligo di firma: an obligation to sign in daily at the local police station while awaiting trial for the thefts. She was found guilty in October 2016 of the attempted theft of the wallet of a man visiting his sick wife, and was sentenced to three months in custody and a \u20ac100 fine. In November 2016 she was also sentenced to four and a half years in custody for the theft of pharmaceuticals and food. Both sentences were upheld on appeal and in the supreme court. Equally serious was her apparent celebration of death. Those who have worked in a hospice say that there is sometimes relief when a patient finally dies, relief that can come from a place of empathy or selfishness. In one moment of what she calls \u201cstupidity\u201d, Poggiali immortalised hers by giving a thumbs up next to an elderly patient who had just died. A colleague took a photo on her phone of Poggiali\u2019s grinning face next to the open mouth of the deceased. In spring 2014, her colleagues noted morti inattese (unexpected deaths) when Poggiali was on shift. Between 30 March and 6 April 2014, there were six. It was recorded on 2 April 2014 that potassium chloride had been incorrectly placed in the drawer of the nurses\u2019 trolley (rather than in the dispensary) and that two phials of the medication \u2013 usually diluted and injected to treat or prevent low blood potassium \u2013 were unaccounted for. When another patient, 78-year-old Rosa Calderoni, died on 8 April 2014 (having been left alone with Poggiali), the hospital alerted the police, and the following day she was suspended. Off work and still signing in at the police station every day because of the theft investigation, Poggiali tried to continue as normal. She had made plans to go to the Stuttgart beer festival in October. \u201cI had even received permission from the authorities to travel abroad,\u201d she says. \u201cI had been round to say goodbye to my mum, and then, from a clear sky, the police turned up and invited me to the station. They said they had something to talk about.\u201d The authorities had reversed their decision: she was no longer allowed to leave the country, and was being charged with murder over Calderoni\u2019s death. The following week, Italy\u2019s \u201cangel of death\u201d was the lead story on the national news. Magistrates spoke of 38 morti sospette (suspicious deaths). The photograph of Poggiali\u2019s pose over a corpse was blown up behind every newsreader. Poggiali was imprisoned pending a trial, but her brief appearances in court had already made up many people\u2019s minds: she seemed oddly carefree and smiling. \u201cShe never had a subservient attitude,\u201d Valgimigli tells me. \u201cShe always had a straight back in court. It seemed like defiance.\u201d In later years, she dyed her hair pink, wore cartoon-character T-shirts or pumped her fist. It was easy for the prosecutors and press to portray her as a gleeful she-devil. * * * The Poggiali case is intriguing given the debate about the safety of Lucy Letby\u2019s convictions. Adam King, a practising barrister, has written in UnHerd that Letby\u2019s case is an example of the \u201ccontagion of confirmation bias\u201d, claiming the \u201ctheory\u201d of her guilt \u201cwas based almost entirely on her having been on shift at the relevant times\u201d. British justice has also been cross-examined in reporting by the New Yorker, the Guardian and the Financial Times. Private Eye\u2019s MD column (authored by the physician Dr Phil Hammond) described at length the flaws in the prosecution\u2019s case: postmortems found natural causes in the deaths of five of the seven babies. Many were extremely premature and profoundly fragile. Experts in the care of newborns told him there were more likely causes of death than the ones proposed by the prosecution, and that the main method of murder alleged \u2013 injecting air into the babies \u2013 was implausible. The jury only heard about half the deaths during the period Letby was said to have been killing, making the data appear cherrypicked. The hospital unit was downgraded, meaning it no longer cared for the most premature and low-weight babies, around the same time that Letby was removed from duty. Comparing her shifts with those of later months was like comparing apples and pears. The Guardian\u2019s special correspondent, Felicity Lawrence, has reported on the letter submitted to the health secretary signed by 24 leading statisticians, paediatric doctors, forensic scientists and neonatologists. Speaking of \u201csystemic issues\u201d in justice regarding \u201cmedical serial killers\u201d, it said: \u201cWe believe that legal systems are particularly vulnerable to errors when dealing with intricate scientific evidence, especially in cases involving statistical anomalies in healthcare settings.\u201d Those who doubt Letby\u2019s convictions have pointed to various well-known miscarriages of justice. On first sight, the probabilities offered by prosecution experts in those cases seemed utterly convincing: in November 1999, solicitor Sally Clark was sentenced to life for the murder of her two infant sons following analysis that suggested the chances of two children in the same family suffering sudden infant death syndrome (or \u201ccot death\u201d) was \u201cone in 73m\u201d. In 2003, Lucia de Berk, a Dutch paediatric nurse, was convicted of four murders and three attempted murders of children in her care (and, a year later, of seven murders and three attempted murders). One criminologist gave evidence to suggest that the probability of so many deaths occurring while De Berk was on duty was \u201cone in 342m\u201d. (Given these notorious examples of misleading probabilities, the prosecution in the Letby case avoided using \u201cone in a million\u201d-style claims.) Clark\u2019s and De Berk\u2019s convictions were subsequently overturned, with professional statisticians pouring scorn on the analyses. In January 2002, the president of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) wrote to the UK attorney general asserting that the \u201cone in 73m figure cannot be regarded as statistically valid\u201d, calling it \u201cfallacious\u201d and \u201ca serious error of logic\u201d. Clark was released a year later, but suffered from mental illness and alcoholism, and died in 2007. De Berk was exonerated in 2010. The statistician who fought to clear De Berk\u2019s name \u2013 Richard Gill, emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands \u2013 was also instrumental in overturning Daniela Poggiali\u2019s conviction. Gill took to social media during the Lucy Letby trial to dispute the use of statistics in that case, and was warned by police that he was in danger of contempt of court. He says now that in each of these cases he sees \u201cthe same errors: bad data, incompetent statistical analysis\u201d. Along with Julia Mortera, a forensic statistician and now honorary professor at the University of Bristol, Gill was a co-author of an RSS paper published in September 2022, before Letby\u2019s trial, entitled Healthcare Serial Killer Or Coincidence? Mortera was also an integral part of Poggiali\u2019s defence team, and she and Gill co-authored, with another professor, Francesco Dotto, an academic paper about that case. They assert that the murder convictions of medical staff are frequently based on the same errors. Confusion usually sets in with the foggy logic of the \u201cTexas sharpshooter fallacy\u201d, named after the apocryphal story of a gun-toting Texan who randomly fires off rounds into a barn door, finds a cluster and circles them as evidence that she\u2019s a crack shot. In Gill and Mortera\u2019s analysis, tunnel vision can quickly take over and all pieces of other evidence (the stray shots or outliers) are ignored. Stories and pictures emerge from our narrative impulses. \u201cAt first, it\u2019s just a load of dots,\u201d the consultant on the ward where Lucy Letby worked told the author of the New Yorker essay, referring to the cluster connecting Letby\u2019s presence when babies collapsed, \u201cbut you stare at them, and all of a sudden the picture appears. And then, once you can see that picture, you see it every time you look, and you think, \u2018How the hell did I miss that?\u2019\u201d When those clusters coincide with the presence of employees who are considered tricky or problematic, they appear more convincing, Gill says. He adds that prejudices often play a major role in giving significance to a cluster: \u201cIt\u2019s about picking on a suitable scapegoat,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey have to be some kind of outsider.\u201d This wasn\u2019t true of Letby, who was said to be well liked, but Lucia de Berk was a former sex worker; and Sally Clark had been in the Priory clinic for postnatal depression. Other accused nurses have been neurodiverse, gay or foreign. \u201cDaniela Poggiali was a nurse with a strong and colourful personality and a sharp tongue,\u201d write Gill, Mortera and Dotto. Paradoxically, Gill notes that those accused are often the most conscientious, doing more shifts (which influences deaths-to-presence figures) or being vocally critical of failings in the hospital or their superiors. Once a pattern of \u201csuspicious\u201d events has been identified, top hospital management or senior clinicians can appoint themselves investigators and interrogators, says Gill, \u201cor to put it more crudely, carry out a witch-hunt\u201d. In Poggiali\u2019s case, a senior colleague became a de facto detective, recovering intravenous bags and testing for potassium. According to her lawyer, Valgimigli, gossip dominated the prosecution\u2019s hypothesis: Poggiali had been heard to complain to colleagues that Rosa Calderoni was a difficult patient; another patient she was later accused of murdering was the former boss of her partner (a workman from the nearby town of Conselice), with whom she was thought to have had issues. Private notes or diaries provided \u201cgotcha moments\u201d in the cases against De Berk and Letby: De Berk writing about secret \u201ccompulsions\u201d and Letby about being \u201cevil\u201d (\u201cI am evil I did this\u201d). Letby clearly felt bereft and guilty about repeated neonatal deaths on her watch. But feeling guilty, which innocent people often do, isn\u2019t the same as being criminally responsible. It has recently been revealed that Letby\u2019s notorious notes were actually the result of a cathartic exercise recommended by therapists. The clincher against Poggiali was even worse: that photograph. It was used by the prosecution as the \u201chomepage\u201d of the courtroom screen, on show to the jury and press every day. \u201cThat photo was proof of my guilt,\u201d she tells me with exasperation. \u201cHaving done something stupid doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a serial killer.\u201d (Although now cleared of all murder charges, she has been struck off as a nurse owing to that unprofessional image.) The other pillars of the prosecution in the cases of Poggiali and De Berk were the probabilities: what was the likelihood of it being just chance that they were always on duty when patients died? This is where statisticians are most sceptical of these murder convictions, since the interpretation of those duty rosters relies on which deaths they include. There are so many deaths at the extremity of life that it\u2019s easy to cherrypick ones to show that X was \u201calways\u201d there. This is the notorious \u201cprosecutor\u2019s fallacy\u201d: in the words of the RSS paper, it leads people to confuse \u201cthe probability of the evidence given a hypothesis with the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence\u201d. No one, the RSS paper urges, should think that the probability of an animal having four legs if it is a horse is the same as the probability that an animal is a horse if it has four legs. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s fallacy,\u201d the RSS report maintains, \u201cis a seductive and widespread mode of reasoning, affecting the general public, the media, lawyers, jurors and judges alike.\u201d That fallacy underpins alleged cases of medical misconduct because someone testifies the probability of X number of deaths occurring randomly is, say, one in a million. On hearing that, people \u201ctranspose the conditional probabilities\u201d and assume that there is a one in a million chance that the deaths are occurring randomly. It\u2019s a bit like reasoning that since the chances of winning the lottery are one in 50m, anyone who does win is clearly a cheat: it\u2019s so unlikely it must be fixed. It\u2019s a short step from there to confuse the profound improbability of an event with the overwhelming probability of a suspect being guilty. * * * \u2018Prison is terrible,\u201d recalls Poggiali. \u201cEverything is uphill. Your family outside is doing badly because of you.\u201d Her face suddenly gives way as she speaks. \u201cEven now it moves me. You feel bad for your family.\u201d She was allowed eight 10-minute phone calls, and six physical visits a month. Most of her time was spent reading the novels of Christian Jacq, the French Egyptologist. She was on cleaning and cooking duties, and sometimes looked after the prison governor\u2019s dog, Lillo. \u201cI had the advantage of being in a small prison, a family setting. The staff were almost maternal figures. They seemed fond of me.\u201d She was the prison\u2019s most infamous inmate, and during Sunday mass male prisoners from the adjacent facility would try to talk to her. She received \u201c50 or so\u201d letters a year, hoping for friendships or courtships. But former colleagues continued to shun her. \u201cBefore there were people who would smile, have a chat, a coffee. And then one said to me, \u2018I\u2019ve got to stay out of it because I\u2019ve got two children I have to defend.\u2019 What does that mean?\u201d For her lawyer, the use of gossip and hearsay showed how far her trial had strayed from a serious process. \u201cTrials should reconstruct the evidence, giving a judgment that gets close to a science. If you graft on to that emotionality, irrationality, gut instincts and drives, you end up contaminating this reasoning.\u201d Valgimigli had been recommended to Poggiali after she was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison at the end of her first trial. He\u2019s the archetypal provincial lawyer: an intellectual working out of an ancient palazzo with frescoed, vaulted ceilings. The sliding ladder behind his desk only reaches halfway up the shelves. He sourced experts who dismantled the postmortem potassium evidence. Potassium measurements from the vitreous humour of the eyeballs (where cell breakdown occurs more slowly) have long been one of a number of ways to estimate time of death (because the concentration of potassium increases more steadily there after death than in other organs). But the prosecution had used potassium levels to imply foul play. \u201cA stroke of genius,\u201d Valgimigli says sarcastically. \u201cThere is agreement [within the scientific community] that this model cannot be used to diagnose a fatal potassium infusion.\u201d Gill and Mortera\u2019s submissions had been dismissed as irrelevant by a haughty judge in the first trial, but on appeal Valgimigli leaned heavily on their statistical expertise to distance causation from correlation. Mortera subsequently wrote of the prosecution\u2019s statistics offered in Poggiali\u2019s case as being \u201ctotally misleading\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious mistake,\u201d she tells me, \u201cto assume that a significant association indicates a causation.\u201d A chart linking Poggiali\u2019s shifts to deaths appeared, at first, a convincing graphic, a persuasive technique that has been used in many other trials of medical staff. But, as John O\u2019Quigley of University College London pointed out in his recent paper on \u201cstatistical blunders\u201d, all the shift chart shows is that \u201cwhen the suspected nurse was on duty she was \u2026 on duty\u201d. There were many variables not accounted for in the statistical analysis presented by the prosecution in Poggiali\u2019s case: all the other shifts she worked without deaths; the fact that deaths normally occur in early morning shifts, when Poggiali was invariably present; that admissions policies \u2013 accepting more acute cases, or fewer \u2013 affect a ward\u2019s mortality rates. In July 2017, Bologna\u2019s court of appeal overturned Poggiali\u2019s first-degree murder sentence and attributed Calderoni\u2019s death to natural causes. After just over 1,000 days in custody, Poggiali emerged exultant. Prosecutors appealed against the decision to the supreme court. They were clearly convinced of her guilt, but perhaps vanity played its part. Investigating magistrates in Italy become media stars, offering running commentaries on their investigations to TV cameras. It\u2019s possible they didn\u2019t want to lose not only a famous case, but also the national notoriety. (Those involved in the Letby investigation have also embraced the limelight, with police releasing an in-house documentary of their investigation and giving lengthy interviews to broadcasters.) In 2018 the supreme court annulled the appeals court verdict and ordered a retrial. The following year Poggiali was again acquitted. In 2020, as she was nursing her dying mother, she was rearrested and charged with the murder of 95-year-old Massimo Montanari (her partner\u2019s former employer, who had died on 12 March 2014, a month before Calderoni). On 15 December 2020 she was sentenced to life in prison. Again she was acquitted on appeal. She was also accused of having asked her sister over the phone to steal pharmaceuticals for their mother (that case was dismissed). It was once hoped that statistics could blow away the mists of doubt in medical murder trials. But professional statisticians urge caution, not only about using them to determine innocence or guilt, but even to show that a murder has taken place. \u201cWe are talking about workplaces where many people do die,\u201d says Gill. In premature baby and palliative care wards, death is a frequent occurrence, and determining the cause is notoriously imprecise. Among their many recommendations in the RSS paper, Gill and Mortera offer an established and poetic corrective to \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s fallacy\u201d: Bayes\u2019 theorem. Thomas Bayes was an 18th-century Presbyterian minister who found a means to \u201cinvert\u201d (rather than \u201ctranspose\u201d) the conditional. Bayes\u2019 theorem looks at the problem from the other end. If an animal has four legs, one can only calculate the probability of it being a horse if one has more information (how many non-horse animals also have four legs). One needs to take into account the \u201cprior probabilities\u201d, which in medical settings means thousands of patients seeing hundreds of medics with almost endless variables. Very quickly this far more nuanced probabilistic reasoning makes those outlandish \u201cone in a million\u201d claims seem redundant. Poggiali\u2019s lawyer, Valgimigli, is still scandalised that she faced such an inquisition based on erroneous science. But he\u2019s equally shocked that no one has been courageous enough to take Poggiali\u2019s side in public: \u201cI think it\u2019s very serious that, in a legal process without precedent, there isn\u2019t a mayor, an authority or an intellectual who has said, \u2018What\u2019s happening to her could happen to any of you.\u2019\u201d Valgimigli is affable company. He orders chilled red wine for lunch and says he could never live outside the slim, brick buildings of his home town of Faenza. He seems to understand his compatriots\u2019 misguided fears: some of his fellow Faentini, he says, \u201chave never emerged from this nightmare, that there was an angel of death walking the corridors injecting death instead of saving life\u201d. But he\u2019s adamant that the real danger is something less fantastical: a false accusation. \u201cIn Romagna, we think we\u2019re something a bit apart,\u201d he says, meaning the locals consider themselves more civilised. \u201cBut are we truly safe? What does your life become if you come under malign suspicion, if you\u2019re in the crosshairs?\u201d Just because Poggiali appeared \u201cbrazen\u201d, her case became a \u201cvery provincial witch\u2011hunt\u201d. Her life has been, if not ruined, certainly profoundly interrupted. Her name is toxic to employers. \u201cYou\u2019re labelled that way,\u201d she laments, \u201ceven if you\u2019ve won all these trials. You go out and people look at you from afar \u2013 they start talking to the person next to them.\u201d She\u2019s always busy, but is technically unemployed. She hasn\u2019t moved though. She\u2019s still here, strutting the diagonals of Faenza\u2019s colonnaded squares. She drives a dusty Fiat Panda with a pink furry frog on the back seat. As we sit in it, she says she\u2019s not sure what to do next. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about going abroad, but I\u2019m limited linguistically. And it\u2019s hard to start over if you don\u2019t have economic means.\u201d She has at least reconciled with her former partner. She misses her old work, but is worried about its feasibility as a profession now, implying that the risks are too great. \u201cOne can\u2019t be a nurse today,\u201d she says. Talking about Letby, Poggiali says: \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for her on a human level. That\u2019s a case that is even more sad than mine because it involved newborns. I think she could be innocent because she\u2019s been painted as a serial killer on the basis of what? That she was always present when babies died? \u201cPeople don\u2019t accept death any more,\u201d Poggiali continues. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to make them [the bereaved] believe it. They say: \u2018But I was here yesterday and she [the relative] was fine.\u2019\u201d She is indignant at her treatment by the press, the judiciary and her fellow citizens. \u201cJournalists are bastards. Sorry.\u201d She feels like a scapegoat for a failing healthcare system that was underfunded and understaffed. In many ways, Poggiali has always made a rod for her own back. Her talk of the need to accept death could easily be misinterpreted as confirmation that there really was a killer doing the rounds. Of all the stories, that\u2019s the version people naturally want to believe, because a guilty individual provides a reason, a clear explanation for a relative\u2019s death. Alternative explanations \u2013 system failures, chance, natural causes \u2013 are so much more boring than the old story that it\u2019s all the fault of a beguiling witch. \u2022 Tobias Jones lives in Parma, Italy.

Struggling to make friends and fill her lonely evenings, she joined a church choir \u2013 something that quickly became her only source of joy.</p> <p>Her new GP had diagnosed her with depression and she started to see a female therapist. But when she failed to see noticeable improvement, she decided to take up the offer of help from her charismatic choirmaster, who told her he was a qualified counsellor.</p> <p>\u201cI had no understanding of boundaries in the therapeutic process, procedures, vulnerability, all those things. He seemed a decent person, highly respected in the church,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/19/psychotherapists-in-england-must-be-regulated-experts-say-after-abuse-claims-rise\">Psychotherapists in England must be regulated, experts say, after abuse claims rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After three months of counselling sessions that she now alleges were a grooming period, they started having sex, and she claims he used the information she had shared about her vulnerabilities to make her progressively more reliant on him. \u201cEverything was about power and control and secrecy. It became very abusive. It went on for a while, over which period my health deteriorated rapidly because of his gaslighting,\u201d she said.<br><br>\u201cI just got more and more depressed and non-functioning. I had no control, it was like I was not really understanding the situation I was in. When I started to question anything he became very aggressive and controlling, telling me I couldn\u2019t go to choir, excluding me from things, which is something he knew I was sensitive about after my abusive marriage.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah was referred to a psychiatrist after the abuse began, who signed her off work for three months. \u201c[He] was really concerned that I wasn\u2019t responding to the medications he was prescribing. [He asked me:] \u2018What is going on in your life?\u2019 And it opened the floodgates. He made me aware it was professional abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah\u2019s story is an extreme example of bad and abusive therapy, but it illustrates how the current regulatory system makes it easier for rogue therapists to continue practising, and more difficult for victims to seek recourse in the event of misconduct.</p> <p>Sarah claims she was not the first vulnerable woman to be abused by her counsellor. As the truth \u201cstarted to dawn on me from this murk of depression\u201d, she began to suspect he was in relationships with other members of the choir.</p> <p>She also learned that he had previously been employed as a priest in another town . One day, she visited the church where he had had been employed. \u201cJust by serendipity I bumped into the current vicar and as soon as I mentioned the name he dropped his bicycle, went white and told me to go straight to the police. He told me that what his predecessor had done there had involved four female parishioners and had been tantamount to rape.\u201d</p> <p>For Sarah there seemed to be no recourse \u2013 the church investigation went nowhere, and because the counsellor was not accredited there was no professional association to turn to for support. She thinks that had therapy been statutorily regulated she might have been more aware of how to verify her therapist\u2019s credentials, and it would have made it easier to file a complaint.</p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"a43ad84b-8b8a-4d0c-9858-8d5ee198fb24\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p>\u201cYou feel so foolish in retrospect, but I didn\u2019t understand the process and how you should select a therapist.

      "bodyText": "Sarah* moved across the country to a new town in her late 30s after fleeing a decade-long abusive marriage. Struggling to make friends and fill her lonely evenings, she joined a church choir \u2013 something that quickly became her only source of joy. Her new GP had diagnosed her with depression and she started to see a female therapist. But when she failed to see noticeable improvement, she decided to take up the offer of help from her charismatic choirmaster, who told her he was a qualified counsellor. \u201cI had no understanding of boundaries in the therapeutic process, procedures, vulnerability, all those things. He seemed a decent person, highly respected in the church,\u201d she said. After three months of counselling sessions that she now alleges were a grooming period, they started having sex, and she claims he used the information she had shared about her vulnerabilities to make her progressively more reliant on him. \u201cEverything was about power and control and secrecy. It became very abusive. It went on for a while, over which period my health deteriorated rapidly because of his gaslighting,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got more and more depressed and non-functioning. I had no control, it was like I was not really understanding the situation I was in. When I started to question anything he became very aggressive and controlling, telling me I couldn\u2019t go to choir, excluding me from things, which is something he knew I was sensitive about after my abusive marriage.\u201d Sarah was referred to a psychiatrist after the abuse began, who signed her off work for three months. \u201c[He] was really concerned that I wasn\u2019t responding to the medications he was prescribing. [He asked me:] \u2018What is going on in your life?\u2019 And it opened the floodgates. He made me aware it was professional abuse.\u201d Sarah\u2019s story is an extreme example of bad and abusive therapy, but it illustrates how the current regulatory system makes it easier for rogue therapists to continue practising, and more difficult for victims to seek recourse in the event of misconduct. Sarah claims she was not the first vulnerable woman to be abused by her counsellor. As the truth \u201cstarted to dawn on me from this murk of depression\u201d, she began to suspect he was in relationships with other members of the choir. She also learned that he had previously been employed as a priest in another town . One day, she visited the church where he had had been employed. \u201cJust by serendipity I bumped into the current vicar and as soon as I mentioned the name he dropped his bicycle, went white and told me to go straight to the police. He told me that what his predecessor had done there had involved four female parishioners and had been tantamount to rape.\u201d For Sarah there seemed to be no recourse \u2013 the church investigation went nowhere, and because the counsellor was not accredited there was no professional association to turn to for support. She thinks that had therapy been statutorily regulated she might have been more aware of how to verify her therapist\u2019s credentials, and it would have made it easier to file a complaint. \u201cYou feel so foolish in retrospect, but I didn\u2019t understand the process and how you should select a therapist. Because I was at such a low ebb, I was completely vulnerable. I\u2019d never been in that kind of situation before.\u201d * Name has been changed",

Did you go on somewhere? We went to a nice pub down the road for a drink. And \u2026 did you kiss? I wouldn\u2019t usually kiss on a first date anyway \u2013 but it didn\u2019t feel like a \u201ckiss\u201d moment. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? I\u2019ve never had a sit-down meal on a first date, so that made me feel a bit awkward \u2013 but the food was lovely. Marks out of 10? 8. Although there wasn\u2019t a romantic connection, Rosa seems a great person. Would you meet again? I\u2019d be up for it, but maybe as friends. Rosa on Richard What were you hoping for? A fun, different evening and maybe to meet \u201cthe one\u201d. Otherwise, a great story. First impressions? Surprisingly slick, considering he\u2019d just cycled across half of London to get there. What did you talk about? Politics. Cycling. Growing our own vegetables. Our hatred of landlords. Most awkward moment? The waiter thought our names were Jack and Sophie and introduced us to each other. Good table manners? Impeccable. He was also a strong believer in the fact that we have a second \u201cpudding stomach\u201d. Best thing about Richard? A breath of fresh air and very unpretentious. Would you introduce Richard to your friends? In a heartbeat \u2013 he would get on with all of them. Describe Richard in three words. Chatty, open-minded, at ease with himself. What do you think he made of you? Smiley, dedicated and maybe that I need to get better at gardening. Did you go on somewhere? To the pub next door for a swift half, before I realised I had to make it home to pack for a wedding I was going to the next day. And \u2026 did you kiss? A side hug and a definitely (maybe) see you soon. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? The meal was at 8pm so I wish we\u2019d met a little earlier. Marks out of 10? A solid 9. Would you meet again? We have exchanged numbers, but maybe just as friends. I felt like there wasn\u2019t a romantic vibe. Richard and Rosa ate at Rossella, London NW5. Fancy a blind date?

On the first&nbsp;night, in Oxford, we&nbsp;play in a big church, where I make a&nbsp;conscious decision to censor the profanity of certain lyrics, then forget all about it and leave the F-word ringing against the old stone columns.</p> <p>On the second night we\u2019re in the theatre of a specialist music school. Everywhere we go backstage we hear instruments being played brilliantly on the other side of the walls: piano, drums, trumpet.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit worrying,\u201d says the bass player. \u201cThese people all know how music is supposed to sound.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have a banjo programme here,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich is&nbsp;lucky.\u201d</p> <p>In the second set, the fifth song begins with a new arrangement: a&nbsp;sonorous drone provided by the keyboard player which is meant to set the atmosphere.

Ahead of our arrival I have managed to glean only one fact about the place: it\u2019s a cave.

      "bodyText": "The band I\u2019m in is in the middle of its autumn tour: Hertford, Stroud, Nottingham, Scunthorpe. On the first night, in Oxford, we play in a big church, where I make a conscious decision to censor the profanity of certain lyrics, then forget all about it and leave the F-word ringing against the old stone columns. On the second night we\u2019re in the theatre of a specialist music school. Everywhere we go backstage we hear instruments being played brilliantly on the other side of the walls: piano, drums, trumpet. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit worrying,\u201d says the bass player. \u201cThese people all know how music is supposed to sound.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have a banjo programme here,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich is lucky.\u201d In the second set, the fifth song begins with a new arrangement: a sonorous drone provided by the keyboard player which is meant to set the atmosphere. Unfortunately I am obliged to tune my banjo while it\u2019s going on. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I tell the audience. \u201cThis is part of it.\u201d For the third gig of the tour we head to Cornwall to play at Carnglaze Caverns. Ahead of our arrival I have managed to glean only one fact about the place: it\u2019s a cave. I imagine this means that the venue is some kind of cellar, or a building taking advantage of a natural dent in the landscape, perhaps with a craggy back wall. But what it actually means is: it\u2019s a cave. Or more specifically, an old slate quarry hollowed into vast underground vaults by centuries of digging, 150 metres back into the hillside, with the stage at the far end. There\u2019s a golf buggy available to drive our stuff into the cave, and a big box of hard hats sitting in front of the cafe outside. \u201cDo I have to wear one of these?\u201d I say. \u201cNot while we\u2019re playing, apparently,\u201d says the drummer.

He was in the enviable position of being able to choose any creative project.</p> <p>He chose to call Jean-Marc Jancovici, one of France\u2019s foremost climate science communicators. \u201cI was frightened,\u201d said Blain, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cI realised that the climate change was a reality. When I\u2019m frightened I have to move \u2013 I can\u2019t stay still, I have to jump in the action. And the action was to call Jean-Marc and tell him let\u2019s make a book together.\u201d</p> <p>It was an opportunity for which Jancovici, already author of eight books on climate breakdown and energy transition, whose online lectures on the topics had been viewed millions of times, had been waiting.</p>    <p>\u201cI felt very excited because it was a way that I knew would work for sure to get to an audience that doesn\u2019t read books and who is not in my ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a way to reach people that remained out of reach before, because you can add a zero to the number of copies for a graphic novel compared to a classical essay.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/18/world-without-end-review-by-jean-marc-jancovici-and-christophe-blain-a-graphic-view-of-the-climate-crisis\">World Without End review by Jean-Marc Jancovici and Christophe Blain \u2013 a graphic view of the climate crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Together, Blain and Jancovici devised a revealing deconstruction of the human-made processes that have pushed the planet to the brink of climate collapse, full of incredible observations, such as the fact that the effects of fossil fuel energy mean it is as if each human had, on average, 200 enslaved people working for them, or that, without machines, 1.5 trillion people would have to work to produce the same amount of energy.</p> <p>There are also painful truths, including the little acknowledged fact that 35% of the world\u2019s electricity is still produced from coal \u2013 the dirtiest of all fossil fuels.</p> <p>But the book\u2019s most powerful element lies in its use of a series of evocative images to decode concepts of energy production and consumption, and its burden on our planet.</p> <p>Most notably, the fossil fuel economy, and all the advantages it has given human civilisation, is depicted as Iron Man (or rather Armour Man in the UK version, for reasons of copyright), an exoskeleton donned by humanity to expand its powers to near omnipotence.</p> <p>The image of a superhero came naturally, Jancovici said. \u201cAs our superpowers come from all the machinery that we have in the world, mixing up the human shape and the idea of machines, well I could either choose Terminator or Iron Man, and I chose Iron Man. It\u2019s a little bit more friendly.\u201d</p>    <p>But Iron Man has a problematic counterpart, the spectre \u2013 quite literally in World Without End \u2013 of greenhouse gas pollution. \u201cOne of the metaphors we could have used in the book is the history of Faust,\u201d Jancovici said. \u201cFirst you enjoy, then you pay. It\u2019s exactly what fossil fuels are bringing us.\u201d</p> <p>What sets World Without End apart from other examinations of climate breakdown is this look at the deep connection between energy abundance and the scientific and social progress it has enabled \u2013 comforts that cannot easily be abandoned \u2013 and the breakdown of our planet\u2019s climate.</p> <p>\u201cThe new part in the book, in my view, is that one,\u201d said Jancovici. \u201cIt\u2019s to put in just one piece something that gathers both knowledge on the physical flows of our productive system and our way of living, and a major externality, which is climate change.\u201d</p> <p>And that is also where its most terrifying aspect arises. World Without End describes a situation where the cataclysmic effects of climate change are beginning to grip human civilisation just as people can no longer use, and indeed are begin to run out of, the energy sources needed to cope with them.</p> <p>The very name of the book can be seen as a pr\u00e9cis of this paradox, Jancovici said. \u201cIt was Christophe\u2019s idea, and I thought that it expressed very well the romantic idea of a never-ending story of growth and abundance, which is exactly what fossil fuels brought us for a while. Of course the understatement in the title appears to anyone: the world is not without end.\u201d</p> <p>That is where solutions come in \u2013 as well as the book\u2019s most-contested claim. Jancovici and Blain downplay the potential of renewable energies such as wind, solar and hydropower. Nuclear power, they say, is the only way to decarbonise power grids fast while maintaining the benefits of industrial society.</p> <p>It is a position that led to criticism, even in France, which <a href=\"https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/france\">already gets most of its electricity from nuclear</a>. Renewable energy advocates accused the book of a \u201cpro-nuclear bias\u201d, pointing out Jancovici\u2019s connections to the energy industry through his think tank the Shift Project.</p> <p>Some campaigners even <a href=\"https://www.comicsbeat.com/bestselling-french-graphic-novel-world-without-end-victim-of-hoax-by-anti-nuclear-campaigners/\">took their actions into bookshops</a>, masquerading as representatives of the French publisher, Dargaud, to persuade staff to insert an anti-nuclear \u201cerratum\u201d to copies.</p> <p>Jancovici said that if the book were to be rewritten there would be less material on nuclear power, but not because he regrets it \u2013 he thought their position had been vindicated by the energy crisis provoked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cPart of the debate is over in France,\u201d he said. \u201cAnti-nuclear positions are not at all as mainstream in the media as they were five years ago. We owe that to Putin, because it has been a general movement all across Europe.</p> <p>\u201cOn renewable energies what we wanted to say is not that they are totally useless, or without interest. It\u2019s that they by nature do not have the properties of dense and dispatchable fossil fuels, and that, of course, we can do something with them. But we won\u2019t do with them what we believe we can do, which is sustain an industrial civilisation on renewable energies alone.\u201d</p> <p>Blain and Jancovici attributed the book\u2019s phenomenal sales to its shareability, its offering an easy and discreet way for people who cared about the climate issue to use it to explain the problems to others. \u201cWhen the book was released, what I expected was the book would become viral. And it became viral,\u201d Blain said.</p> <p>Jancovici added: \u201cWhat happened is that the book was designed to be given, and this strategy became effective.\u201d</p> <p>The authors\u2019 hope is that World Without End will precipitate a change in consciousness around energy consumption. \u201cThe book is made to understand the problem, to understand the orders of magnitude,\u201d Blain said.</p> <p>\u201cTo understand what it costs, really, what it means, what is behind the scenes. When you understand that, it\u2019s impossible to think the same way as before \u2026 You can see the things around you differently. You imagine your future life differently, for you, or your children, for your parents, for anybody. You know that the world will be different.\u201d</p> <p>Or, as Jancovici put it: \u201cIt\u2019s the kilowatt hours, stupid.\u201d</p> <p><em>World Without End is published in the UK on Thursday</em><em> by Particular Books.</em></p>",

He chose to call Jean-Marc Jancovici, one of France\u2019s foremost climate science communicators. \u201cI was frightened,\u201d said Blain, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cI realised that the climate change was a reality. When I\u2019m frightened I have to move \u2013 I can\u2019t stay still, I have to jump in the action. And the action was to call Jean-Marc and tell him let\u2019s make a book together.\u201d It was an opportunity for which Jancovici, already author of eight books on climate breakdown and energy transition, whose online lectures on the topics had been viewed millions of times, had been waiting. \u201cI felt very excited because it was a way that I knew would work for sure to get to an audience that doesn\u2019t read books and who is not in my ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a way to reach people that remained out of reach before, because you can add a zero to the number of copies for a graphic novel compared to a classical essay.\u201d Together, Blain and Jancovici devised a revealing deconstruction of the human-made processes that have pushed the planet to the brink of climate collapse, full of incredible observations, such as the fact that the effects of fossil fuel energy mean it is as if each human had, on average, 200 enslaved people working for them, or that, without machines, 1.5 trillion people would have to work to produce the same amount of energy. There are also painful truths, including the little acknowledged fact that 35% of the world\u2019s electricity is still produced from coal \u2013 the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. But the book\u2019s most powerful element lies in its use of a series of evocative images to decode concepts of energy production and consumption, and its burden on our planet. Most notably, the fossil fuel economy, and all the advantages it has given human civilisation, is depicted as Iron Man (or rather Armour Man in the UK version, for reasons of copyright), an exoskeleton donned by humanity to expand its powers to near omnipotence. The image of a superhero came naturally, Jancovici said. \u201cAs our superpowers come from all the machinery that we have in the world, mixing up the human shape and the idea of machines, well I could either choose Terminator or Iron Man, and I chose Iron Man. It\u2019s a little bit more friendly.\u201d But Iron Man has a problematic counterpart, the spectre \u2013 quite literally in World Without End \u2013 of greenhouse gas pollution. \u201cOne of the metaphors we could have used in the book is the history of Faust,\u201d Jancovici said. \u201cFirst you enjoy, then you pay. It\u2019s exactly what fossil fuels are bringing us.\u201d What sets World Without End apart from other examinations of climate breakdown is this look at the deep connection between energy abundance and the scientific and social progress it has enabled \u2013 comforts that cannot easily be abandoned \u2013 and the breakdown of our planet\u2019s climate. \u201cThe new part in the book, in my view, is that one,\u201d said Jancovici. \u201cIt\u2019s to put in just one piece something that gathers both knowledge on the physical flows of our productive system and our way of living, and a major externality, which is climate change.\u201d And that is also where its most terrifying aspect arises. World Without End describes a situation where the cataclysmic effects of climate change are beginning to grip human civilisation just as people can no longer use, and indeed are begin to run out of, the energy sources needed to cope with them. The very name of the book can be seen as a pr\u00e9cis of this paradox, Jancovici said. \u201cIt was Christophe\u2019s idea, and I thought that it expressed very well the romantic idea of a never-ending story of growth and abundance, which is exactly what fossil fuels brought us for a while. Of course the understatement in the title appears to anyone: the world is not without end.\u201d That is where solutions come in \u2013 as well as the book\u2019s most-contested claim. Jancovici and Blain downplay the potential of renewable energies such as wind, solar and hydropower. Nuclear power, they say, is the only way to decarbonise power grids fast while maintaining the benefits of industrial society. It is a position that led to criticism, even in France, which already gets most of its electricity from nuclear. Renewable energy advocates accused the book of a \u201cpro-nuclear bias\u201d, pointing out Jancovici\u2019s connections to the energy industry through his think tank the Shift Project. Some campaigners even took their actions into bookshops, masquerading as representatives of the French publisher, Dargaud, to persuade staff to insert an anti-nuclear \u201cerratum\u201d to copies. Jancovici said that if the book were to be rewritten there would be less material on nuclear power, but not because he regrets it \u2013 he thought their position had been vindicated by the energy crisis provoked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cPart of the debate is over in France,\u201d he said. \u201cAnti-nuclear positions are not at all as mainstream in the media as they were five years ago. We owe that to Putin, because it has been a general movement all across Europe. \u201cOn renewable energies what we wanted to say is not that they are totally useless, or without interest. It\u2019s that they by nature do not have the properties of dense and dispatchable fossil fuels, and that, of course, we can do something with them. But we won\u2019t do with them what we believe we can do, which is sustain an industrial civilisation on renewable energies alone.\u201d Blain and Jancovici attributed the book\u2019s phenomenal sales to its shareability, its offering an easy and discreet way for people who cared about the climate issue to use it to explain the problems to others. \u201cWhen the book was released, what I expected was the book would become viral. And it became viral,\u201d Blain said. Jancovici added: \u201cWhat happened is that the book was designed to be given, and this strategy became effective.\u201d The authors\u2019 hope is that World Without End will precipitate a change in consciousness around energy consumption. \u201cThe book is made to understand the problem, to understand the orders of magnitude,\u201d Blain said. \u201cTo understand what it costs, really, what it means, what is behind the scenes. When you understand that, it\u2019s impossible to think the same way as before \u2026 You can see the things around you differently. You imagine your future life differently, for you, or your children, for your parents, for anybody. You know that the world will be different.\u201d Or, as Jancovici put it: \u201cIt\u2019s the kilowatt hours, stupid.\u201d World Without End is published in the UK on Thursday by Particular Books.",

He intends to serve out another term and with it promises to push forward with key policies such as the extension of Canberra\u2019s light rail system.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s share of the vote has declined each election since 2016.

In 2016, it faced a <a href=\"https://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections_and_voting/past_act_legislative_assembly_elections/2016-election/2016-election-results/results-overview\">-2.2% swing with 89,632 votes</a>.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Canberrans head to the polls on Saturday to decide who will lead the nation\u2019s capital. Labor has been the ruling party for the past 23 years \u2013 an impressive feat given the ACT has only had self-governance since 1989. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, has been in the top job since 2014 after the now finance minister, Katy Gallagher, left the post for Capital Hill. But this election, the Canberra Liberals are hoping their leader, Elizabeth Lee, will be the one to turn the tide in the bush capital. The party hopes to reverse its recent electoral misfortunes, including the loss of the territory\u2019s sole federal Liberal representative, Zed Seselja, at the last election to David Pocock. The ACT government\u2019s composition is an interesting space to watch. It is the only Labor-Greens coalition in the country, with Shane Rattenbury, the ACT Greens leader, appointed as attorney general and climate minister and two other Greens ministers as part of Labor\u2019s cabinet. Let\u2019s catch you up to speed on the rest. Who might run the ACT government next? Starting with the obvious: the polls could decide Barr remains chief minister for another four years. The 51-year-old was first elected to the ACT assembly in 2006. He intends to serve out another term and with it promises to push forward with key policies such as the extension of Canberra\u2019s light rail system. Labor\u2019s share of the vote has declined each election since 2016. In 2020, the party got more than 100,000 votes from Canberrans, or 37.8% of the vote, but recorded a -0.6% swing. The party\u2019s main opposition, the Canberra Liberals, has fared worse. In 2016, it faced a -2.2% swing with 89,632 votes. Four years later, the party\u2019s vote increased marginally to 91,047 votes but represented 33.8% of the territory, resulting in a -2.9% swing. Still, with the help of independents and after 23 years of Labor, Lee hopes it will be enough to turn Canberra blue. \u201cIf the Canberra Liberals are in a position to be able to form minority government, then the result will be that the Canberra community has clearly voted for a change,\u201d Lee told Guardian Australia. \u201cI would ask that the independents take that very seriously.\u201d The Greens are also in the running, but their path to leadership is more challenging. At the 2020 election the Liberals won nine seats in the 25-member parliament, with Labor (10) and the Greens (six seats, a record result) combining to form a coalition government \u2013 their third in a row in a parliament that nearly always produces minority governments. For Rattenbury to overtake Barr, the minor party would have to pick up a number of seats and rely on either Labor or the Liberals to help form government. How do ACT elections work? These elections work a little differently to other jurisdictions. The territory uses a unicameral system, meaning there is one house. Sitting within it are 25 members, representing the five electorates: Brindabella, Ginninderra, Kurrajong, Murrumbidgee and Yerrabi. There are no local councils in the ACT, so the Legislative Assembly deals with a range of services, from garbage disposal to running public hospitals. Elections are run on the Hare-Clark system: voters number their preferred candidates from one onwards, with candidates needing to hit a quota of first-preference votes. Once a candidate reaches that quota, their surplus votes are distributed according to a voter\u2019s preferences until another candidate meets the quota. If seats still remain after this distribution, the candidate with the lowest number of votes in each round is excluded and the preferences are transferred to remaining candidates until all five positions are filled. What are each party\u2019s policies? The major divergence between the ACT\u2019s major parties is clear this election \u2013 the future development of Canberra\u2019s light rail system. Barr has committed to full completion of stage 2B of the city\u2019s light rail system, extending the existing line past the central CBD to Parliament House \u2013 initial works on the route are already under construction \u2013 and into its growing south-western hub. The construction of a track further into southern suburbs \u2013 Canberra is broadly split into north and south by Lake Burley Griffin \u2013 won\u2019t be begin until at least 2028 and will require federal government funding commitments. The Canberra Liberals agree to stage 2A - extending the line south from the city to Commonwealth Park on the lake\u2019s northern shore. However, the opposition believes the stage further to Parliament House and Woden in the territory\u2019s south-west is a waste of money and are pledging to dump the plan. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Another issue for Canberrans is the ageing sports stadium, a 15-minute drive north of the city in the suburb of Bruce. While Labor has proposed to build a new stadium near the original site, the Liberals are in favour of building a new one closer to the city centre on the lake. Beyond infrastructure, Lee has said she won\u2019t wind back some of the policies that have earned the ACT its reputation as Australia\u2019s most progressive jurisdiction. Some of those policies include voluntary assisted dying, and the territory running on 100% renewable energy. On the other hand, the Greens are pitching \u201ca higher level of ambition\u201d on progressive policies. For example, the party\u2019s territory branch proposes a ban on gambling ads, accelerating the rollout of the light rail and for the government to build and buy 10,000 new public homes over the next 10 years. Apart from the major parties, who else is running in Canberra? Labor, Liberals and the Greens aren\u2019t the only parties in town. At this ACT election, a number of new and some familiar faces are having a crack. Thomas Emerson, David Pocock\u2019s former adviser and the son of former federal Labor minister Craig Emerson, has started a new group of independents, aptly called Independents for Canberra. The group pledges to make Canberra a fairer society, looking at affordable and sustainable housing, and integrity in politics. There\u2019s also the First Nation party, led by Ngambri-Kamberri custodian, Paul Girrawah House. It offers policies to help ACT reach its closing the gap targets. Familiar minor parties in other elections, including the Animal Justice party, Family First and Labour DLP, are also running candidates in electorates.

A lot. They finished the game shooting 10-for-36. From 3-point range: 0-for-9. Stewart still had a double-double with 11 and 11, including six offensive rebounds.</p> <p>Also, various academics have concluded that \u201chome advantage\u201d is partially due to the officials not being able to fight the temptation to give the home team a few close decisions. And \u2026 yeah. </p> <p>Now the glass-half-full \u2026</p> <p><strong>Courtney Williams, </strong>who played college basketball at South Florida and has only been an All-Star once while playing for five teams in nine years (four in the last four) is having a series for the ages. She had 15 points and seven assists, and it seemed like every last one came at an important time.</p> <p><strong>Alanna Smith </strong>played through a back injury and managed 30 minutes on the court. She hit both 3-pointers she attempted and grabbed seven rebounds.</p> <p>While Stewart and Ionescu had an off night, <strong>Napheesa Collier </strong>was quietly effective. She only scored 14 points on 4-of-10 shooting (4-for-6 from the free throw line), but she played all 40 minutes and added nine rebounds, four assists and four steals. </p> <p><strong>Kayla McBride </strong>scored 19 points, some of them from mind-boggling angles.</p> <p>And it was every bit the highly competitive contest we expected. </p> <p>Which means, going back to glass-half-empty, that Game 5 will probably be a blowout. You have to like New York\u2019s chances at home. A quick check of the odds shows that the people in charge of such things agree. </p> <p>But it\u2019s going to be must-see TV in any case. The WNBA has had a breakthrough season, thanks in part to <strong>Caitlin Clark </strong>and <strong>Angel Reese</strong>, and it\u2019s going to end with a winner-take-all game in New York. </p> <p>See you then.

      "bodyText": "First, the glass-half-empty way of looking at it \u2026 Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu struggled. A lot. They finished the game shooting 10-for-36. From 3-point range: 0-for-9. Stewart still had a double-double with 11 and 11, including six offensive rebounds. Also, various academics have concluded that \u201chome advantage\u201d is partially due to the officials not being able to fight the temptation to give the home team a few close decisions. And \u2026 yeah. Now the glass-half-full \u2026 Courtney Williams, who played college basketball at South Florida and has only been an All-Star once while playing for five teams in nine years (four in the last four) is having a series for the ages. She had 15 points and seven assists, and it seemed like every last one came at an important time. Alanna Smith played through a back injury and managed 30 minutes on the court. She hit both 3-pointers she attempted and grabbed seven rebounds. While Stewart and Ionescu had an off night, Napheesa Collier was quietly effective. She only scored 14 points on 4-of-10 shooting (4-for-6 from the free throw line), but she played all 40 minutes and added nine rebounds, four assists and four steals. Kayla McBride scored 19 points, some of them from mind-boggling angles. And it was every bit the highly competitive contest we expected. Which means, going back to glass-half-empty, that Game 5 will probably be a blowout. You have to like New York\u2019s chances at home. A quick check of the odds shows that the people in charge of such things agree. But it\u2019s going to be must-see TV in any case. The WNBA has had a breakthrough season, thanks in part to Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, and it\u2019s going to end with a winner-take-all game in New York. See you then. Thanks for tuning in, and I\u2019ll be back in about 44 hours. Ionescu is tightly guarded and has to send it to the rafters. It\u2019s off the mark. Join us for Game 5 on Sunday. Liberty 80-82 Lynx, 2.0 seconds left, 4th quarter: The foul is on Ionescu, who was judged to have backed up into Carleton as the Canadian grabbed the ball and shot. I don\u2019t buy that call, either. Carleton hits both. Timeout New York. They\u2019ll have to fling it in and shoot right away. Minnesota can hold for the last shot. Williams pulls up and misses. Carleton gets the rebound \u2026 and she\u2019s fouled! Liberty 80-80 Lynx, 18.3 seconds left, 4th quarter: Stewart misses the rim with the shot clock running down. That\u2019s a shot-clock violation. Why didn\u2019t the Liberty call timeout? Ball to Minnesota. Timeout Minnesota. Jones misses, but Stewart gets the rebound. 25 seconds. McBride misses a tough drive. Collier saves the ball, but it goes to New York. Reminder of what\u2019s at stake: The New York Liberty have never won the WNBA championship. That might not be the case in a couple of minutes. How close has this game been? First quarter: NY 23-23 MIN Second: NY 22-23 MIN Third: NY 18-18 Fourth: NY 17-16 Liberty 80-80 Lynx, 1:10 left, 4th quarter: You know that player in your pickup basketball games who is so infuriating because they hit all these ridiculous shots that seem like they\u2019re all luck but probably aren\u2019t? That\u2019s Kayla McBride. She just did it again. Ionescu scores a tough one inside. Williams misses. Stewart feeds Jones \u2013 she scores, and she\u2019s fouled! Her free throw would tie it! And it does. Timeout Minnesota. Shifting to quick-action posting for the finish here \u2026 Liberty 75-77 Lynx, 2:39 left, 4th quarter: New York loses the challenge. The ball last hit Collier, but the referees determined that Stewart committed a foul, so Minnesota gets the ball BUT Stewart isn\u2019t charged with her fifth foul because that\u2019s outside the parameters of a replay. Got that? I don\u2019t. Stewart misses. Stewart swats away a shot by Smith. Stewart misses again. Smith is left wide open inside. Minnesota leads. Jones finally misses a 3-pointer. Minnesota rotates the ball nicely. Carleton hits a 3. The lead is five. Fiebich answers for New York! Liberty 72-72 Lynx, 4:48 left, 4th quarter: McBride somehow gets a bank shot from an obtuse angle to fall. Tied again. Great defense from Minnesota, but I\u2019m not sure how Stewart missed that shot right before the buzzer. The commentators think Stewart just got away with what would\u2019ve been her fifth and final foul. I don\u2019t buy it, and I\u2019d venture to say I\u2019ve refereed more games than they have. (Granted, they\u2019re soccer games.) New York uses a challenge to determine possession, which basically means it\u2019s a timeout. Quick peek at the stats \u2026 New York: Stewart has finally hit a few shots and has eight rebounds, along with three steals, but she and Ionescu are 0-for-7 from 3-point range. Fiebich has picked up the slack with 16 points, and then Jones is simply having a monster game at both ends of the court \u2013 18 points with just one missed shot, seven rebounds (all defensive), two blocks. Minnesota: Williams (15 points), McBride (14) and Collier (14) are still the scoring leaders, but Smith now has 10. Liberty 72-70 Lynx, 5:47 left, 4th quarter: Zandalasini! The Italian player drives and scores inside to put Minnesota up by four. Fiebich draws a foul from Zandalasini in an all-Euro matchup. The German player hits two free throws. She has 14. Williams misses, but Stewart mistimes her jump for the rebound, and Collier snags it. McBride shoots as the shot clock winds down but can\u2019t get it to go. Ionescu drives. It\u2019s tied. Again. Jones swats away a shot from Zandalasini, and Fiebich is somehow left alone at the other end for an uncontested layup. Timeout Minnesota. What a game. Liberty 66-68 Lynx, 8:07 left, 4th quarter: Jones finally misses a shot. Zandalasini scores on a nifty turnaround. Stewart misses. then ties up Juhasz for a jump ball. Jones scores \u2026 NO! Collier draws the offensive foul. They don\u2019t challenge, which is surprising. New York has gotten by far the worst of the officiating tonight. Ionescu rushes a 3-point shot as if in desperation. But the Liberty get a defensive stop, and Stewart scores on a reverse layup and draws a foul. She hits the free throw. Collier hits a free throw, then misses the second. But the rebound comes out at an awkward angle, and the ball is tied up for a jump ball. Liberty control. Vanderslute tries a very strange pass, and the Liberty can\u2019t keep control of the ball. Bridget Carleton is fouled in transition and hits both free throws. Lead change. Ionescu comes in for the last possession of the quarter, but no one is showing for the ball. Turnover. Long impossible shot for the Lynx as the buzzer sounds. We\u2019re 10 minutes of playing time away from the Liberty\u2019s first championship or a Game 5. Liberty 63-61 Lynx, 0:45 left, 3rd quarter: Ionescu takes a break. Stewart is on the bench with four fouls. The Liberty are playing without their two big guns. Fiebich tries a shot from Caitlin Clark range. Nope. Williams misses. Can\u2019t hit them all. Sabally drives, and I\u2019m not sure why the refs didn\u2019t send her to the free throw line. More misses and turnovers. Sabally drives, and this time, there\u2019s a foul. But it\u2019s an offensive foul. I don\u2019t like that call, either. Williams misses. Can\u2019t hit them all. Sabally gets the rebound. Vandersloot drives for her first points of the night to restore New York\u2019s lead. Liberty 61-61 Lynx, 2:33 left, 3rd quarter: A sloppy return to action for each team. Williams is back in the game. Stewart hits an impressive bucket in transition \u2013 once again, the scorers can\u2019t seem to agree on whether it\u2019s a 2-pointer or 3. They settle on 2. And oh dear \u2013 Collier just drew Stewart\u2019s fourth foul. She hits one of two free throws. Wild, ill-advised shot from Ionescu. Williams drives at the other end, unbalances the defense, and dishes to a wide-open Smith, who practically has time to autograph the ball before sinking a 3-pointer to tie the game once again. Timeout, New York. Liberty 59-55 Lynx, 5:02 left, 3rd quarter: Natisha Hiedeman left the court in the first quarter as the ball jammed her thumb. That thumb has since been heavily taped, and she\u2019s in to give Williams a break, as Williams tries to catch her breath on the bench. And she drives, earns two free throws and scores both. But Jones hits her third 3-pointer \u2013 she\u2019s 5-for-5! \u2013 and after a defensive stop, the Liberty drive back and get a bucket and the and-one for Fiebich to put the Liberty back in front. McBride misses a layup. Back down the court, back to Jones. She can\u2019t go 6-for-6, can she? With four of those shots being threes? Yes she can, and Minnesota takes a timeout. That\u2019s a 9-0 run in just over a minute. Liberty 50-53 Lynx, 6:46 left, 3rd quarter: Alanna Smith has been battling a back injury and has struggled to score inside, but she does just fine outside the arc, easily knocking down a 3. Jones answers for New York. What a game she\u2019s having. Bridget Carleton hits a layup, and that\u2019s the last made shot for nearly a minute. Stewart ends the drought with a tip-in. New York clamps down on defense, and time starts to run out on a Minnesota possession, but there\u2019s Courtney Williams again with an acrobatic layup. The Liberty\u2019s dominant duo of Stewart and Ionescu combined to hit 5 of 20 shots in the first half. They missed all five 3-pointers and attempted no free throws. Ionescu has three turnovers; Stewart has three fouls. But Betnijah Laney-Hamilton has a pair of 3s among her 10 points, Jonquel Jones has 9 points on 3-for-3 shooting, and Leonie Fiebich has also chipped in 9. Minnesota have three players who are doing it all. McBride has 14 points. Williams has 13 and three assists. Collier has 12 and three assists along with three steals. The rest of the team has combined for seven points. New York has a massive rebounding edge, 21-13. Minnesota has only one offensive board. This has to be one of the worst halves of playoff basketball Breanna Stewart has ever played. She picks up her third foul as McBride scores, then converts the free throw. Fiebich scores on a strong drive. Ionescu, to her astonishment, is called for a foul on Zandalasini. But the Lynx player misses both free throws. Ionescu can\u2019t get a shot away before the buzzer sounds. Somewhere along the line, officials decided that Zandalasini\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:58 left was actually a 2-pointer. That resolves a discrepancy between the score ESPN was showing on its screen vs. what the stadium scoreboard and ESPN\u2019s site said. Weird. Liberty 41-40 Lynx, 1:08 left, 2nd quarter: Stewart doubles her scoring output for the night with a layup. Williams misses a couple for Minnesota but delivers a slick pass to Zandalasini for the corner 3 to tie it. (UPDATE: This has been downgraded to a 2-pointer.) Sabally hits a pair of free throws. NY up by 2. Williams hits a shot from just inside the arc and will have a chance to make it a 3-point play anyway \u2013 Stewart fouled her. Williams hits the free throw. Liberty 39-38 Lynx, 3:35 left, 2nd quarter: Ionescu unleashes her third bad pass of the game, Williams hits the pullup jumper in transition (she\u2019s now 5-for-7 for 10 points), and New York will take a timeout. Liberty 39-36 Lynx, 3:48 left, 2nd quarter: Stewart will take a break. New York struggles to get a shot away, but Fiebich flings an awkward shot under pressure and knocks it down. Collier hits a jumper to trim the New York lead. Liberty 37-34 Lynx, 5:52 left, 2nd quarter: Williams is simply feeling it. She pulls up for a shot that no rational person other than herself and possible Steph Curry would attempt. Drains it. But Fiebich hits a corner 3, and Stewart steals a pass and drives the length of the court for her first points of the game. Carleton hits a 3 for the Lynx. Ionescu immediately finds a seam in the Lynx defense and drives for an easy layup. Once again, it\u2019s Williams answering for the Lynx. Stewart gets another steal, and Ionescu swiftly scores. Timeout Minnesota. Liberty 28-27 Lynx, 8:11 left, 2nd quarter: Stewart passes to Jones in the paint, and she draws a foul. The Liberty maintain possession and work the ball to Stewart, who can\u2019t find the handle. Lynx turnover, and Ionescu feeds Jones in transition. Courtney Williams immediately ties the game again. Laney-Hamilton gets into the corner and knocks down her second 3-pointer of the game. She has 10 already. Collier draws a shooting foul from Stewart and hits both free throws. Laney-Hamilton bangs into McBride, and the Lynx player is down injured. Officials review the play to consider whether it\u2019s a flagrant foul. The announcers say yes. I don\u2019t think so \u2013 I think she stumbled as she made contact with another player. The officials agree with me. I am a soccer referee, after all. Still, it\u2019s three free throws for McBride. She misses the first but knocks down the next two. She has 11 points. Fiebich levels the score. The Lynx have a chance to get the last shot of the quarter, but McBride knocks down Fiebich off the ball, and the refs spot it. So the Liberty get a shot and get it to Stewart. And she misses her seventh shot. If you told New York before the game that their top scorer would be 0-for-7 and the score would still be tied, they\u2019d probably be happy with that. Then they\u2019d ask you for tomorrow\u2019s lottery numbers, because you\u2019re clearly psychic. Liberty 21-21 Lynx, 0:44 left, 1st quarter: The struggling Alanna Smith has departed, replaced by Dorka Juhasz, who has played scant minutes in the postseason. Good defense from Minnesota forces a bad shot from the struggling Stewart, and McBride scores on an emphatic drive, also drawing a foul. The free throw puts Minnesota in front. Stewart misses once again, but Nyara Sabally is there for the putback. Collier hits a 3. Minnesota in front. Laney-Hamilton hits a jumper. Tied. Liberty 17-15 Lynx, 2:03 left, 1st quarter: Superb ball movement from the Liberty, leading to a basket off a strong post move from Jones. A miss at the other end, but Ionescu makes a bad pass. That\u2019s a couple for her. More turnovers each way, but McBride hits a 3 to draw the Lynx level. Laney-Hamilton scores under intense pressure inside to put New York back in front. Liberty 13-12 Lynx, 4:15 left, 1st quarter: Collier\u2019s 3-pointer falls gently through the net to reinstate the Minnesota lead. After a miss at each end (including another one by Smith), Kayla Thornton hits a 3 to swing the lead the other way. Collier turns it over, and we\u2019ll take a timeout. Liberty 10-9 Lynx, 5:08 left, 1st quarter: Smith again misses inside under heavy pressure. Jones is fouled at the other end and hits two free throws to put New York in front. Liberty 8-9 Lynx, 5:28 left, 1st quarter: Smith gets the close-range shot this time to extend Minnesota\u2019s lead. Ionescu answers with a gorgeous drive. Bad miss for Minnesota, but then Stewart has her third miss of the game. The 30-point scorer in Game 3 doesn\u2019t look comfortable here. Collier steals an Ionescu pass, the Lynx race out on the break, and McBride hits a 3 from the corner. Jonquel Jones immediately answers. Liberty 3-4 Lynx, 7:45 left, 1st quarter: A few misses at the outset, but Courtney Williams hits a smooth pullup jumper and then feeds Collier for a layup to get the home team out fast, just as they did in Game 3. But Smith misses badly inside, and Laney-Hamilton hits a 3 to get New York on the board. Tipoff \u2026 we\u2019re underway \u2026 Game time is \u2026 whenever. Apologies to non-US readers who are perplexed when the schedules say a game started at 8 p.m. when it clearly does not. We\u2019re getting player intros now. Before Caitlin Clark, there was Sabrina Ionescu \u2013 a college player with sublime skills who elevated the sport. She and Breanna Stewart are as formidable a duo as has ever existed in the WNBA. This year, Stewart has averaged 20.5 points and 8.5 rebounds, while Ionescu\u2019s season stat line is 18.2 points and 6.2 assists. Jonquel Jones, the 2021 league MVP with Connecticut, has been a steady third scoring option in her second season with the team. In Game 3, while Ionescu struggled through much of the contest, Stewart powered her way to 30 points and 11 rebounds. Ionescu made the clutch shots late. New York had two players on the US roster this summer (Stewart and Ionescu) and two players for Germany \u2013 Nyara Sabally and Leonie Fiebich. The Liberty posted the best record in the regular season at 32-8. The Lynx were second at 30-10. The coach will be familiar to those who saw the Olympics \u2013 she\u2019s Cheryl Reeve, who coached Team USA to gold this summer by the narrowest of margins. Reeve was in charge for all four of the Lynx\u2019s championships \u2013 every odd year from 2011 to 2017 \u2013 thanks to the consistent excellence of Seimone Augustus (newly inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame), Lindsey Whalen (already in the Hall), Maya Moore (sure to be in the Hall soon) and Sylvia Fowles (also Hall-bound, surely). The key player now is Napheesa Collier, the only Lynx player on the US roster this summer. She averaged 20.4 points and 9.7 rebounds per game in the regular season. Kayla McBride, the team\u2019s eldest player at 32, averaged 15.0 points, while Courtney Williams was the top distributor with 5.5 assists along with 11.1 points per game. Two Minnesota players were on non-US teams in the Olympics \u2013 Australia\u2019s Alanna Smith and Canada\u2019s Bridget Carleton. Smith is playing through a back injury. Hello, everyone in Guardian-land. Nice to see you all again. Tonight, we might witness the coronation at last of the New York Liberty, a star-studded and star-crossed team through their 28-year history, in which they\u2019ve reached the Finals five times and come up empty. Game 3 was an absolute scorcher. The Minnesota home crowd was rocking \u2026 until it wasn\u2019t, as New York roared back and took a stunning win. Wherever you are, thanks for joining us. This one should be a thriller. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a look back at the Liberty\u2019s stunning Game 3 win on Wednesday night.",

Here\u2019s more from the Post on what we can expect to see when the evidence is released:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a five-page order Thursday, U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan said Trump had failed to address the legal system\u2019s presumption in favor of public access to criminal court proceedings, and rejected the former president\u2019s assertion that it could appear the court was trying to impact the election by making public potentially unflattering material about Trump in an appendix to Smith\u2019s brief.</p> <p>\u201cIf the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute \u2014 or appear to be \u2014 election interference,\u201d Chutkan wrote. \u201cThe court will therefore continue to keep political considerations out of its decision-making, rather than incorporating them as Defendant requests.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s attorneys earlier Thursday had asked Chutkan to postpone the release of the material, much of which was expected to be redacted, until nine days after the Nov. 5 election. That would fall after the former president is set to file his own blockbuster brief of up to 180 pages with its own appendix of sources arguing why he should not still face trial after the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling establishing that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for their official acts.</p> <p>While Trump argued that release of the materials would poison the jury pool, Chutkan said that both sides\u2019 filings ultimately would be available to potential jurors, any taint could be rooted out in jury selection, and Trump was free to make his own legal arguments in court and to the public.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-67125a888f08156d1577588f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-18T12:55:27.940Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>While Donald Trump is believed to have made gains among Black and Hispanic voters, a new poll shows the Kamala Harris continues to lead among the former group, the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anna-betts\">Anna Betts</a> reports:</em></p> <p>A new poll has revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</a> continues to lead Donald Trump among Black likely voters in battleground states.</p> <p>The poll, conducted by <a href=\"https://gs.howard.edu/sites/gs.howard.edu/files/2024-10/HIPO_Battleground_African_American_Survey_Wave_2_LV_Toplines_2024_10_10_10152024.pdf\">Howard University\u2019s Initiative on Public Opinion</a> from 2 October to 8 October, surveyed 981 Black likely voters in the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p> <p>The results show that 84% of respondents said they planned to vote for the vice-president, while only 8% said they would support Trump for president in November, and another 8% remained undecided.</p> <p>The survey also identified the most important issues for the respondents, with \u201cdemocracy/voting rights/elections\u2019\u201d ranked as a top priority, followed by the economy and abortion rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/harris-trump-black-swing-state-voters\">Harris maintains lead over Trump among Black swing state voters \u2013 poll</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-671255ba8f08156d1577583e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-18T12:38:48.557Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>We\u2019ll hear more from Donald Trump at 7pm today, when he holds a rally in Detroit. </strong></p> <p>That\u2019s the largest city in swing state Michigan, and a Democratic stronghold.

      "bodyText": "With just 18 days until election day, both presidential candidates had a busy day campaigning across Michigan. The day ended with Trump taking the stage at a Detroit rally and Harris speaking from Oakland County, Michigan. Earlier, a federal judge allowed the release of hundreds of documents used in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case against Donald Trump, but the majority of them are redacted. What we can see mostly concerns the legal strategy Trump and his allies concocted to block Joe Biden from taking the White House, which may be presented to jurors whenever the case goes to trial. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Trump has canceled interviews because he is \u201cexhausted\u201d \u2013 something his campaign denies \u2013 and is also considering holding a town hall with one-time rival Nikki Haley in a bid to woo female voters. Here\u2019s what else has happened today: Trump said that some of the jokes he told at last night\u2019s Al Smith dinner were written by employees of conservative network Fox \u2013 a breach of ethics, if confirmed. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president of Germany, warned in unusually direct terms of the threat Trump could pose if returned to the White House, during a visit by Joe Biden to the country. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign has enlisted singer-songwriter Marc Anthony for a campaign ad aimed at Latino voters in which he condemns Trump\u2019s comments about Puerto Rico. A House oversight committee report accused Trump of exploiting tax payer money by charging Secret Service agents and other federal officials higher-than-normal rates at his DC hotel. Trump hit back on reports that he\u2019s too tired to attend events. An unnamed White House employee told an investigator for the January 6 committee that Trump watched the attack on the Capitol unfold from a White House dining room while drinking a Diet Coke. The detail was included in hundreds of pages of mostly redacted documents in the federal case against Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Signing off. Johana Bhuiyan, Diana Ramirez-Simon, Chris Stein, Anna Betts and Daniel Lavelle Harris wrapped up her speech reminding her Detroit audience of about 3,500 to vote. In Michigan, early voting for most jurisdictions begins 26 October. For Detroit, it begins on 19 October. \u201cOur vote is our voice and your voice is your power.\u201d Trump is concluding his rally with a reminder of his campaign promises. \u201cIn conclusion, with your vote this November we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. We will teach our children to love our country honor our history\u2026we will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen\u2026we will do that very easily. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American and show the whole world the American dream is back. I will stop the global theft of American jobs. I will turn America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine immediately\u2026stop the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War 3. We are very close to World War 3\u2026because we have incompetent people. I will crush violent crime and give our police the\u2026support that they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military\u2026you know I rebuilt our military. We will build a missile defense shield all made in the USA. And we will put the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars and maybe with the help of Elon we\u2019ll get it done quickly. We\u2019ll rebuild our cities including our capital in Washington DC. We will get\u2026and remember this one, we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools.\u201d \u201cBut for that to happen we must defeat Kamala Harris\u2026we want a landslide and it looks like that could be happening,\u201d he ended. He closed out his rally by clapping and dancing to YMCA by the Village People. Harris went in on outlining her other policies and criticizing Trump for having only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to which the audience echoes \u201cConcepts!\u201d. She emphasizes her fight for freedom, especially in relation to abortion rights, describing the downfall of Roe v Wade and vowing that when a bill restoring national abortion rights comes across her desk she will \u201cproudly sign it in to law\u201d. Harris rehashed Trump\u2019s job losses in Michigan, calling him \u201cone of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history\u201d. She reminded her supporters of Trump\u2019s broken promises over losing auto plants during his presidency, resulting in \u201cthousands of Michigan auto workers losing their jobs\u201d. She says Trump is making the same empty promises that he made before. \u201cBut we\u2019re not falling for the okey doke. And we won\u2019t be fooled!\u201d she said as the crowd hollers \u201cNooo!\u201d Harris vows to her Detroit audience to invest in American manufacturing and industry such as steel, iron and the auto industry. \u201cAnd contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive\u201d Harris said, addressing Trump\u2019s claim that her administration would \u201cmandate\u201d electric vehicles. Trump called for the death penalty for any migrant who kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. Trump said that his administration will also restore the US borders. \u201cI think it\u2019s the worst thing that has happened to us. 21 million people. When I win on November 5, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. I have no choice.\u201d Many of Trump\u2019s claims about the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies have been previously debunked. For instance, Trump claims the Biden administration opened the borders but in fact the administration increased the number of expedited removals and added more sections to the U.S. Southern border walls. A study that looked at 150 years of census data has also shown that despite Trump\u2019s claims, the vast majority of immigrants do not commit crimes and are significantly less likely to commit crimes than those born in the US. Trump has addressed a few topics in a span of a few minutes. Trump addressed what he calls an electric vehicle \u201cmandate\u201d that the Biden administration has set. However, the administration has set no such requirement. They have set a goal of having 50% of car sales be electric vehicles by 2030. \u201cOn day 1 of the Trump administration I will terminate Kamala\u2019s insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the green new scam once and for all. We will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack and drill, baby, drill. I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months of taking office. That\u2019s going to bring everything down. I will massively cut taxes for workers and we will also have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors.\u201d Back at the Harris rally, she says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna just go off script for a moment.\u201d She begins to talk about the difficulties of taking care of an aging relative and the financial toll it can take. \u201cMy plan is to fix Medicare to cover the home health costs for seniors because it\u2019s about dignity.\u201d \u201cThis is the worst mic I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d Trump quipped. After playing two campaign videos, Trump calls Kamala Harris the \u201ctax queen\u201d and claims her tax proposals will kill \u201calmost a million full-time jobs\u201d. \u201cIt will be economic armageddon for Detroit,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s microphone is working again. He\u2019s talking about his \u201cbuild it in America plan\u201d. \u201cWhen CEOs call me to complain about my tariffs, my answer will be very simple, build it in America. And to be specific, build it in Detroit, and we\u2019ll give you good electricity. His plan is to impose tariffs on companies to discourage them from building manufacturing plants outside of America. \u201cThe centerpiece of his plan will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. So we brought the rate down from close to 40% to 21%\u2026now we\u2019re going to get it down to 15% but only if they build it in America,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those who don\u2019t make their product in America they will be forced to pay tariffs.\u201d Harris is back. She begins again, starting with addressing the devastation in Gaza and Lebanon. \u201cI know this year has been very difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating. And now Sinwar\u2019s death must be a turning point. Everyone must seize this opportunity to end the war in Gaza. Bring the hostages home. And end the suffering once and for all.\u201d Kamala Harris began by thanking the members of the Arab- American communities at the rally. Harris, however, suddenly stopped her remarks to call for a medic. Harris made a few comments about it being warm in the room. While Trump waits for the technical difficulties to be fixed, Kamala Harris is taking the stage at her dueling rally in Oakland County, Michigan. Donald Trump is indeed on stage at the rally but there are technical difficulties with the microphone it turns out. He began speaking but the sound cut out and he\u2019s now standing around as the crowd cheers for him. Trump takes the stage in Michigan with his usual self-confidence, acknowledging the cheers of the crowd who are waving \u201cMake Detroit Great Again\u201d signs. \u201cWe win Michigan, we win the whole ballgame,\u201d he said, as he\u2019s promised every other city he\u2019s visited lately. However on his previous visit to the city, he bashed it as a \u201cmess\u201d and a \u201cdeveloping nation\u201d. \u201cOur whole country will end up being like Detroit if she\u2019s your president. You\u2019re going to have a mess on your hands,\u201d Trump said, referring to Kamala Harris. Trump surrogates who have spoken before Donald Trump takes the stage have all hit on talking points we\u2019ve heard repeatedly throughout his campaign. In addition to getting back jobs for American workers, including auto workers, and rising costs of living, nearly everyone who has taken the stage has decried what they describe as mass illegal immigration. They also made promises to Detroit residents specifically. \u201cDetroit once was the city that powered the entire world, every car worth driving in the entire world was manufactured here,\u201d said former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. \u201cNot in Mexico, not in China, not in Japan. Donald Trump has a plan to make Detroit and to make Michigan the economic center of the world.\u201d However, just last week, Trump criticized the city during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club. \u201cThe whole country will be like \u2014 you want to know the truth? It\u2019ll be like Detroit,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee said. \u201cOur whole country will end up being like Detroit if she\u2019s your president.\u201d At the time, Detroit\u2019s Democratic mayor Mike Duggan responded and cited the city\u2019s recent drop in crime. \u201cLots of cities should be like Detroit. And we did it all without Trump\u2019s help,\u201d Duggan said. Donald Trump is slated to speak at a rally in Detroit in a few minutes. Follow along here. While Donald Trump spent the last few minutes of his round table in Michigan talking about returning jobs to American auto workers, Kamala Harris is reminding auto workers what he\u2019s previously said about their work. According to Politico, at a campaign event at the United Auto Workers Local 652 in Lansing, Harris played the room full of auto workers remarks Trump made earlier this week at the Economic Club of Chicago. In addition to saying a child could do their jobs, Trump said car manufacturers \u201cdon\u2019t build cars\u201d and just \u201ctake them out of a box, and they assemble them\u201d. Both candidates are fighting to win over auto workers as well as working class voters in Michigan. The round table has concluded. He ended the event by talking about tariffs in response to a United Auto Workers member. He said he plans to use tariffs to discourage people from building plants in other countries and taking jobs from American workers. Donald Trump will be speaking at a rally in Detroit at 7pm. Stay tuned for more updates. Donald Trump is hearing from audience members in Michigan. Among them have been a Teamster representative as well as a holistic wellness practitioner and the president of the Police Officers Association of Michigan. Jim Tignanelli, the group\u2019s president, described what he says is the loss of honor for police. He said three officers were shot in Michigan over the last 90 days. In response, Trump said he wants to call for the death penalty for anyone killing a police officer. Trump also called for qualified immunity for police. \u201cOne thing we\u2019re going to be doing is \u2026 immunity for some of these police,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf police officers are doing their job \u2026 if they make a mistake, and that happens \u2026 we have to help people out now. We\u2019re going to do the immunity thing. We have to stop being politically correct. You\u2019re always going to have some bad apples but very few of them,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump started the conversation by again criticizing Kamala Harris\u2019 decision not to attend the Alfred E Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, which raises funds for Catholic charities. You can follow along here. Upon landing in Michigan, Donald Trump touted the support he\u2019s received from the Arab-American community after many have expressed disappointment in how the Biden administration has responded to Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza. Just last month, Trump was endorsed by Amer Ghalib, the Democratic mayor of Michigan suburb, Hamtramck. Forty percent of Hamtramck\u2019s residents are of Middle Eastern or North African descent. But minutes later, Trump said that he planned to speak with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and tell him that \u201che\u2019s doing a good job\u201d. \u201c[Biden] is trying to hold him back,\u201d Trump said to reporters. \u201cThey probably should be doing the opposite. I\u2019m glad that Bibi decided to do what he had to do.\u201d A new investigation by 404 Media found that an Elon Musk-funded PAC called Future Coalition is targeting Muslim and Jewish populations in Michigan and Pennsylvania with extremely contradictory ads. The ads are being delivered to Snapchat users and targeting them by zip code. Those who live in an area with a large Muslim population in Michigan are being served ads that paint Kamala Harris as pro-Israel while those who live in parts of Pennsylvania that have a high percentage of Jewish residents are seeing ads that says Harris stands with Palestine. You can read the investigation here. Meanwhile in Michigan, Donald Trump answered questions from the press and denied reports that he\u2019s exhausted and canceling events. \u201cWhat event did I cancel,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t canceled. She doesn\u2019t go to any events. She\u2019s a loser. She didn\u2019t even show up for the Catholics last night at the hotel. It was insulting. All they are is soundbites.\u201d Trump said he has gone 48 days without a rest. \u201cTell me when you\u2019ve seen me take even a little bit of a rest.\u201d According to a new House oversight committee report that accuses Donald Trump of fleecing tax payers and exploiting the presidency, former president Trump charged secret service agents who were staying at his hotel while protecting him far more than the hotel charged private patrons. The report says Trump \u201cturned the U.S. Secret Service into an ATM for his personal enrichment\u201d by charging the agency, in at least one case, more than 5 times the rate approved by the government. \u201cAmazingly, that same night, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., rented out more than 200 rooms to private parties at just $125 or $170 each.\u201d The report goes onto say that at least five people who received pardons from Trump as well as four federal judges who Trump nominated and were later given lifetime appointments also stayed at the hotel. \u201cOur report also details startling instances in which state and federal officials, as well as individuals actively seeking federal jobs and presidential pardons, used the D.C. hotel as a channel to put money into the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s pocket,\u201d Representative Jamie Raskin said in a statement. Hey all, Johana Bhuiyan taking over from my colleague, Chris. I\u2019ll be tuning into Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Michigan which starts at 5pm ET but in the meantime I\u2019m going through a new report from the House committee on oversight and accountability. Citing hotel guest logs, the report claims Trump used his DC hotel to take \u201cethically questionable payments\u201d from the US Secret Service, federal and state officials, federal job seekers as well as people seeking a federal pardon during his presidency. \u201cThese payments demonstrate how Donald Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s Domestic Emoluments Clause as he used the Secret Service as his personal ATM and repeatedly took payments that raise the specter of pay-to-play corruption from individuals who sought and, in many cases obtained, favors from the Commander-in-Chief,\u201d the press release read. Kamala Harris will campaign alongside Barack Obama and Michelle Obama in two separate events next week aimed at encouraging voting in swing states, the vice-president\u2019s campaign said. On Thursday, Harris and Barack Obama will campaign in Atlanta, with the goal of encouraging supporters to take advantage of the early voting period. The vice-president will then head to Michigan on Saturday, the first day of early voting in that state, for an event with Michelle Obama. Donald Trump has meanwhile arrived in Michigan, ahead of his 5pm campaign event in Detroit. His campaign is sharing photos and video of him taking questions from reporters upon his arrival, saying it\u2019s not the sort of thing Kamala Harris would do: Reporters traveling with the vice-president to Grand Rapids said she spoke to them before going onstage. A key message of Kamala Harris to voters in Michigan today was encouraging them to cast ballots when early voting begins next Saturday. \u201cElection Day is in 18 short days, okay? And here in Michigan, early voting starts on Saturday, October 26, which is one week from tomorrow,\u201d the vice-president said as she concluded her speech. \u201cNow is the time to make your plan to vote. Make a plan.\u201d Unions have long played an outsized role in Michigan, particularly when it comes to its automotive industry. Kamala Harris has focused much of her speech on how she would be more friendly to organized labor than Donald Trump. \u201cMake no mistake, Donald Trump is no friend of labor,\u201d the vice-president said. She continued: He encouraged automakers to move their plants out of Michigan so he could pay they could pay their workers less. Understand what that was about, so they could pay their workers less. And when the [United Auto Workers (UAW)] went on strike to demand the higher wages they deserved, Donald Trump went to a non-union shop and attacked the UAW, and he said, he said, striking and collective bargaining don\u2019t make \u2018a damn bit of sense\u2019. \u201cStrong unions mean higher wages, better healthcare and greater dignity for union members and for everyone, whether or not you are part of a union: get that straight,\u201d she said. Kamala Harris seized on reports that Donald Trump had backed out of interviews because he was \u201cexhausted\u201d, saying that they were proof he is not up to the job of being president. \u201cHe has no plan for how he would address the needs of the American people, and he is, as we have seen, only focused on himself, and now he is ducking debates and canceling interviews,\u201d Harris told the crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \u201cAnd check this out. His own campaign team recently said it is because of exhaustion. Well, if you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world.\u201d Kamala Harris is on stage now, with familiar walk-out song Freedom by Beyonc\u00e9 playing. The vice-president was introduced by carpenters union official Brian Hein, who decried Donald Trump as someone \u201cwho has never done a hard day\u2019s work in his life\u201d. Kamala Harris is soon to begin speaking in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as she looks for an edge among voters in a swing state that Donald Trump is looking to reclaim. The western Michigan city lies in historically Republican territory where Democrats have only recently begun showing strength. From a stage set up in a park, the vice-president was introduced by Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer, who said: Donald Trump has shown us that he is incapable of handling a crisis. He is a petty man who tells dangerous lies and is always looking for someone else to blame. We don\u2019t need that. We need leaders who are going to put politics aside and work together to solve problems. As our next commander-in-chief, Kamala Harris will ask, what do you need? How can I help you? Are you okay? That\u2019s what a leader does. An unnamed White House employee told an investigator for the January 6 committee that Donald Trump watched the attack on the Capitol unfold from a White House dining room while drinking a Diet Coke. The detail was included in hundreds of pages of mostly redacted documents in the federal case against Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election, which a federal judge allowed to be released today. \u201cThey\u2019re rioting down at the Capitol\u201d, the employee recalls telling Trump in an interview with an unnamed investigator. \u201cOh, really?\u201d Trump replied. The employee recalls going with Trump to the dining room where he often spent time, and where a television was set up: And then we walked back to the back. I\u2019m taking off his outer coat that he\u2019s wearing right now, and I get the TV, like, ready for him, and I hand him over the remote, and he starts watching it. And I stepped out to get him a Diet Coke, come back in and that\u2019s pretty much it for me as he\u2019s watching and, like, seeing it for himself. A federal judge blocked an effort by authorities in Florida to keep off the air a television advertisement in support of the state\u2019s abortion access ballot initiative, the Guardian\u2019s Carter Sherman reports: Florida\u2019s health department can\u2019t block a TV advertisement in support of a ballot measure that would protect abortion rights, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, after the department sent letters to local TV stations commanding them to stop airing the ad or risk criminal consequences. \u201cThe government cannot excuse its indirect censorship of political speech simply by declaring the disfavored speech is \u2018false\u2019,\u201d US district judge Mark E Walker wrote in his ruling. \u201cTo keep it simple for the State of Florida: it\u2019s the First Amendment, stupid.\u201d Florida is one of 10 states set to vote on abortion-related ballot measures in November. If enacted, Florida\u2019s measure would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution and roll back the state\u2019s six-week ban on the procedure, which took effect in May. Earlier this month, Florida\u2019s health department sent cease-and-desist letters to TV stations running an ad by Floridians Protecting Freedom, the campaign behind the measure. In the ad, a woman named Caroline speaks about being diagnosed with cancer while pregnant. \u201cThe doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life and my daughter would lose her mom,\u201d Caroline says in the ad. \u201cFlorida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine.\u201d Vice-president Kamala Harris will be hosting a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, where she will be joined by singer Usher, her campaign said. This comes as the Democratic National Committee announced today that it is launching a Taylor Swift-themed \u201cI Will Vote\u201d campaign to increase engagement among young voters in battleground states. The campaign will kick off in Miami, the DNC said, with billboards around the city, a mobile billboard on a boat near Taylor Swift\u2019s concert venue in Miami where the singer is playing this weekend, and exclusive Snapchat filters. Rosemary Boeglin, DNC Communications Director, said in a statement that Democrats \u201care reaching out to young voters where they are, from concert venues to social media platforms, to make sure they have the resources they need to cast their ballot.\u201d Former president Donald Trump will be visiting Asheville, North Carolina on Monday to see the devastation of Hurricane Helene first-hand and deliver remarks, his campaign announced on Friday. Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida three weeks ago, before moving across parts of the south-east, quickly becoming the deadliest hurricane to hit the US mainland since Katrina in 2005. Parts of western North Carolina, including Asheville, were among the hardest-hit areas. On Thursday, the first day of early in-person voting for the 2024 election in the battleground state of North Carolina, more than 350,000 voters North Carolinians cast their ballots, setting a new state record, officials announced. Election officials in the state said on Friday that a record 353,166 voters turned out statewide on Thursday, surpassing the previous record for the first day of early voting of 348,559 voters set in 2020. \u201cYesterday\u2019s turnout is a clear sign that voters are energized about this election, that they trust the elections process, and that a hurricane will not stop North Carolinians from exercising their right to vote,\u201d said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections. This comes as earlier this week, Georgia voters shattered Georgia\u2019s early voting record, casting 328,000 ballots on the first day of early voting, which is more than double the previous record of 136,000, set in 2020. You can read more about that here. Fox News has reportedly denied that any of its employees or freelancers assisted in writing the jokes that former president Donald Trump told at last night\u2019s Al Smith dinner. This comes as the former president appeared on Fox News this morning and said that some of his jokes were written by \u201ca couple people from Fox\u201d. A federal judge allowed release of hundreds of documents used in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case against Donald Trump, but the majority of them are redacted. What we can see mostly concerns the legal strategy Trump and his allies concocted to block Joe Biden from taking the White House, which may be presented to jurors whenever the case goes to trial. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Trump has canceled interviews because he is \u201cexhausted\u201d \u2013 something his campaign denies \u2013 and is also considering holding a town hall with one-time rival Nikki Haley in a bid to woo female voters. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Trump said that some of the jokes he told at last night\u2019s Al Smith dinner were written by employees of conservative network Fox \u2013 a breach of ethics, if confirmed. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president of Germany, warned in unusually direct terms of the threat Trump could pose if returned to the White House, during a visit by Joe Biden to the country. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign has enlisted singer-songwriter Marc Anthony for a campaign ad aimed at Latino voters in which he condemns Trump\u2019s comments about Puerto Rico. Interestingly included among the documents are copies of the envelopes used to mail electoral vote tallies from states Donald Trump targeted to overturn the election result. CBS News took a screenshot: The portions of the documents that are not redacted include statements by Republican swing state lawmakers and officials in late 2020, around the time that Donald Trump and his allies were pressing them to cooperate with his attempts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. As has been documented by the January 6 committee and other investigations, Trump and his allies attempted to convince Republicans in states like Arizona and Georgia to cast doubt on the validity of their state\u2019s votes for Biden \u2013 largely without success. Also visible in the documents are portions of Mike Pence\u2019s memoir, where he described how his former boss leaned on him to go along with his plans to throw Biden\u2019s election victory into doubt: The documents released thus far consist of hundreds of blank pages, interspersed occasionally with what appear to be snippets of emails, text messages and interviews, parts of which are, themselves, redacted. From what can be gleaned, much of it appears to relate to Trump and his allies\u2019 strategy to create a legal basis to prevent Joe Biden from taking office \u2013 which is at the heart of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s case against the former president. A federal court has unsealed hundreds of pages of evidence in the case against Donald Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The release comes as special prosecutor Jack Smith\u2019s team moves to get its case back on track after the supreme court\u2019s ruling earlier this year that presidents have immunity from charges related to official acts. Much of the documents released have been redacted, but we will let you know if any news emerges. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the latest in the legal wrangling over the case: Donald Trump was on Fox News earlier this morning, and was asked about his jokes at last night\u2019s Al Smith dinner. He replied that some of them were written by \u201ca couple people from Fox\u201d \u2013 which, if true, would be quite the breach of media ethics, even for the right-leaning network. CNN captured a clip: Here is our coverage of Trump\u2019s zingers and insults from last night\u2019s get-together: Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign has enlisted singer songwriter Marc Anthony to appear in a new ad in which he slams Donald Trump for comments he made about Puerto Rico during his presidency: It\u2019s part of Harris\u2019s push to win the diverse group of Latino voters who could make the difference between winning and losing key swing states. In a speech during Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Germany, president Frank-Walter Steinmeier was unusually frank about the threat posed by Donald Trump if he returns to the White House. \u201cIn this friendship, there have been and always will be times of proximity and greater distance, times of agreement and times of discord. Even recently, just a handful years ago, the distance had grown so wide that we almost lost each other,\u201d Steinmeier said. He noted that the outcome of the election could impact an array of American and European foreign policy priorities, including the defense of Ukraine: The choice on November the 5th is only Americans\u2019 choice to make but we as Europeans have a choice too. We have the choice to do our part, to be unwavering in our support for Ukraine. To invest in our common security. To invest in our shared future. And as you have done sir, to stand by the transatlantic alliance no matter what. From the bottom of my heart, in this time when democracy is under strain all around the western world, you Mr President have been the beacon of democracy ... Decency is maybe what we are most at risk of losing. Which is not to say Donald Trump has not been doing any interviews at all. He spoke with Fox News personality and ex-professional wrestler Tyrus for an episode of his Outkick podcast released today, in which he repeated his comments warning of \u201can enemy from within\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip, shared by the Kamala Harris campaign: Democrats have said the former president\u2019s usage of the terminology to describe his political enemies is a dangerous escalation of rhetoric, and a sign that he is out for \u201cunchecked power\u201d: Case in point: Donald Trump has turned down an invitation from CNN for a televised town hall just days before the 5 November election. Kamala Harris has said yes to the invitation, CNN reports, and her town hall is set for 23 October. Here\u2019s more: Donald Trump has uncharacteristically been backing out of media interviews lately, and Politico has learned the reason why: the former president is \u201cexhausted\u201d. Here\u2019s what they found: It happened just this week to planned Trump sit-downs with NBC in Philadelphia and CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s on the heels of him backing out of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d episode earlier this month. Why does this keep happening? Another outlet was recently given an explanation by Trump\u2019s team for why their own interview wasn\u2019t coming to fruition: exhaustion. The Trump campaign had spent weeks in conversations with The Shade Room, a site that draws a largely young and Black audience \u2014 a demographic where Trump has been making inroads. It hosted an interview with Kamala Harris just last week. But no interview has materialized. As Shade Room staff began feeling that feet were being dragged inside Trump\u2019s campaign, they pressed earlier this week to set a date for a sit-down. In response, a Trump adviser told Shade Room producers that Trump was \u201cexhausted and refusing [some] interviews but that could change\u201d at any time, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman has denied the report: Trump national press secretary Karoline Leavitt, while making clear she wasn\u2019t part of the back-and-forth for the Shade Room interview, said last night that the idea that Trump was exhausted \u201cis unequivocally false.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is running laps around Kamala Harris on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAnd has done media interviews every day this week. He has more energy and a harder work ethic than anyone in politics.\u201d The federal judge handling Donald Trump\u2019s trial on charges related to subverting the 2020 election has allowed a new batch of evidence against the former president to be made public today, the Washington Post reports. The evidence underpins a brief filed by special counsel Jack Smith that argues Trump\u2019s conduct is not covered by a recent supreme court ruling that gave presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts. Here\u2019s more from the Post on what we can expect to see when the evidence is released: In a five-page order Thursday, U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan said Trump had failed to address the legal system\u2019s presumption in favor of public access to criminal court proceedings, and rejected the former president\u2019s assertion that it could appear the court was trying to impact the election by making public potentially unflattering material about Trump in an appendix to Smith\u2019s brief. \u201cIf the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute \u2014 or appear to be \u2014 election interference,\u201d Chutkan wrote. \u201cThe court will therefore continue to keep political considerations out of its decision-making, rather than incorporating them as Defendant requests.\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys earlier Thursday had asked Chutkan to postpone the release of the material, much of which was expected to be redacted, until nine days after the Nov. 5 election. That would fall after the former president is set to file his own blockbuster brief of up to 180 pages with its own appendix of sources arguing why he should not still face trial after the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling establishing that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for their official acts. While Trump argued that release of the materials would poison the jury pool, Chutkan said that both sides\u2019 filings ultimately would be available to potential jurors, any taint could be rooted out in jury selection, and Trump was free to make his own legal arguments in court and to the public. While Donald Trump is believed to have made gains among Black and Hispanic voters, a new poll shows the Kamala Harris continues to lead among the former group, the Guardian\u2019s Anna Betts reports: A new poll has revealed that Kamala Harris continues to lead Donald Trump among Black likely voters in battleground states. The poll, conducted by Howard University\u2019s Initiative on Public Opinion from 2 October to 8 October, surveyed 981 Black likely voters in the states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The results show that 84% of respondents said they planned to vote for the vice-president, while only 8% said they would support Trump for president in November, and another 8% remained undecided. The survey also identified the most important issues for the respondents, with \u201cdemocracy/voting rights/elections\u2019\u201d ranked as a top priority, followed by the economy and abortion rights. We\u2019ll hear more from Donald Trump at 7pm today, when he holds a rally in Detroit. That\u2019s the largest city in swing state Michigan, and a Democratic stronghold. Don\u2019t be surprised if he presses his case to the city\u2019s large African American population, a demographic where the Trump campaign is trying to make inroads, that they would be better off voting for him. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, will also be in Michigan. She rallies in Grand Rapids at 2.30pm, then has another event in the state capital Lansing at 5.25pm, and a final event in suburban Detroit\u2019s Oakland county at 8.10pm. Busy day! Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is pondering arranging a town hall with Nikki Haley, his former UN ambassador turned rival for the Republican nomination, who has since endorsed his candidacy, the Bulwark reports. The joint appearance, which could be held with conservative commentator Sean Hannity on Fox News, is a bid to shore up his standing with women voters, who polls indicate are less enthusiastic about returning Trump to the White House than are men. Haley and Trump were at-times bitter rivals in the GOP primaries earlier this year, but she later endorsed him during a speech at the Republican national convention in July. Nonetheless, Haley has lately noted that she still has her differences with Trump. Here\u2019s what the Bulwark reports: Since then, however, Haley and Trump have not appeared together. And she hinted that tensions still linger on her new SiriusXM satellite radio show last month. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with Trump 100 percent of the time,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI have not forgotten what he said about me. I\u2019ve not forgotten what he said about my husband or his, you know, deployment time or his military service. I haven\u2019t forgotten about his or his campaign\u2019s tactics from, you know, putting a bird cage outside our hotel room to calling me \u2018bird brain,\u2019\u201d Haley said on her show, adding that she\u2019s still for Trump because she thinks he \u201cwill make the country better.\u201d Those comments garnered some attention in Trump\u2019s orbit. One confidant of the ex-president privately joked that talk like that is usually taboo in his circles because \u201cif you\u2019re with him 99 percent of the time, you\u2019re a fucking traitor in Trump\u2019s eyes.\u201d Fox News anchor Bret Baier says he made \u201ca mistake\u201d when he failed to include a clip of Donald Trump referring to the \u201cenemy from within\u201d about his rivals during an interview with Kamala Harris on Wednesday. Baier showed a clip that came from a town hall broadcast earlier in the day via Fox News\u2019s \u201cThe Faulkner Focus\u201d, in which Trump said he is \u201cnot threatening anybody.\u201d \u201cThat clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy from within. \u2026 That\u2019s not what you just showed,\u201d Harris said to the Fox News anchor. \u201cYou didn\u2019t show that, and here is the bottom line: He has repeated it multiple times, and you and I both know that, and you and I both know he has talked about turning the military on the American people.\u201d Baier said on \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on Thursday that he \u201cdid make a mistake\u201d when it came to clips shown in the interview. Trump brushed off concerns from President Biden about Election Day not being peaceful, saying, \u201cthe bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in and destroyed our country.\u201d \u201cI think the bigger problem are the people from within,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.\u201d Vice-president Kamala Harris appeared at the Al Smith charity dinner, a bi-partisan fundraising event traditionally attended by presidential candidates to trade lighthearted jokes at each other, via a pre-recorded video link. Actress and former SNL cast member Molly Shannon appeared in the sketch, playing her fictional Catholic school pupil character Mary Katherine Gallagher. Harris asked for advice; Shannon-as-Gallahgher suggests she doesn\u2019t lie, as it is a sin. Harris replies you shouldn\u2019t lie, especially, about \u201cthy neighbour\u2019s election results\u201d. She would never insult Catholics, Harris said \u2013 taking another jibe at Trump: \u201cThat would be like insulting Detroiters when you\u2019re in Detroit.\u201d Harris\u2019 sketch received a lukewarm reception by those in attendance at the dinner. \u201cAs I watched that I couldn\u2019t help but think now I know how my kids felt when I face-timed into a piano recital they were at,\u201d Jim Gaffigan, the comedian who hosted the dinner, said. The crowd cheered \u2013 not hugely enthusiastically, but more than just politely \u2013 following Harris\u2019s appearance. Electioneering places a cost burden on local police forces. As the candidates descend on Michigan, a key battleground state in the upcoming election, local forces scramble to provide support to the Secret Service and other agencies. The Detroit Free Press reports that by late last month, Kent County, home of Grand Rapids, had incurred more than $300,000 in expenses. Assistant County Administrator Lori Latham said: We anticipate additional expenses as we expect more visits leading up to the election. Although we do not have a dedicated fund for these unforeseen costs, we use overtime and contingency funds to manage such unexpected expenditures. Bob Stevenson, executive director of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, said some areas feel the burden more than others: The degree of the burden sometimes depends on the size of the city and their experience with it,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cYou take a town like Dearborn or Detroit or Battle Creek. They have lots of people, they can probably divert a lot of their working people for that short period of time, and it\u2019s not a problem. But you take some of the smaller cities, not only are they already short staffed, but now you\u2019ve got to somehow come up with people.\u201d Security concerns have been the theme of this campaign, with two attempts on Trump\u2019s life taking place in less than three months. Vice President Kamala Harris is preparing for her first campaign appearances with Barack and Michelle Obama this month in Georgia and Michigan. The Associated Press reports that the vice president will appear with Barack Obama in Georgia on October 24, and with Michelle Obama in Michigan on October 26. The Obamas endorsed Harris in July and spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago. The rally is being hosted by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement organisation founded my Michelle Obama to encourage people to engage with politics. Vice President Kamala Harris did not attend the Al Smith charity dinner in New York in person, appearing via a pre-recorded video sketch, instead. Her jokes didn\u2019t appear to land with the audience. The white-tie dinner raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and traditionally candidates from both parties have attended. Trump\u2019s jokes were crude but seemed to be well received by those in attendance. Trump mocked transgender people, aiming a jibe at vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz. He also took aim at migrants and New York, saying he had to wrap up his speech so New York can \u201cturn the room into an illegal migrant shelter\u201d. Regarding Harris\u2019 absence, he posted on his Truth Social network: Just found out that Lyin\u2019 Kamala is doing a video message tonight instead of being at the Al Smith Dinner. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do a video message. Kamala should be there like almost every other Presidential Candidate in their History, except Walter Mondale, who lost 49-1. They didn\u2019t give me the option of a video message, nor would I have done it. This is very disrespectful to everyone involved. She should be here, or lose the Catholic Vote!\u201d Germany have awarded US President Joe Biden the highest class of the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his work improving the German-American friendship and the transatlantic alliance. He was presented the award by Germany\u2019s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Steinmeier said the friendship with the US is \u201cand will always be existentially important\u201d for Germany, but there have always been \u201ctimes of proximity and greater distance.\u201d \u201dEven recently, just a handful of years ago, the distance had grown so wide that we almost lost each other,\u201d Steinmeier said, alluding to tense relations during Trump\u2019s earlier presidency. He said Biden \u201crestored Europe\u2019s hope in the trans-Atlantic alliance literally overnight.\u201d \u201cIn the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is indispensable for us,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I hope that Americans remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just \u2018other countries\u2019 in the world \u2014 we are partners, we are friends.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the run-up to the US election as Donald Trump has claimed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped to start his country\u2019s war with Russia. The Republican presidential candidate\u2019s extraordinary criticism \u2013 the war started when Russia invaded Ukrainian sovereign territory \u2013 comes as Joe Biden arrives in Europe for closed-door discussions with allies with Ukraine high on the agenda. As Reuters reports, Trump\u2019s comments indicate he is likely to radically shift US policy toward Russia if he wins the 5 November election. The Republican former president has frequently criticized Zelenskyy on the campaign trail, repeatedly calling him \u201cthe greatest salesman on Earth\u201d for having solicited and received billions of dollars of US military aid since the war broke out in 2022. Trump has also slammed the Ukrainian leader for failing to seek peace with Moscow, and he has suggested Ukraine may have to cede some of its land to Russia to make a peace deal, a concession Kyiv considers unacceptable. Trump\u2019s comments on the PBD Podcast on Thursday with Patrick Bet-David went a step further than his previous criticism. He said Zelenskyy was to blame not just for failing to end the war, but for helping start it. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to help him because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war\u2019s a loser,\u201d Trump said. Meanwhile on Friday, Biden will seek to cement cooperation with key European partners on issues from the Ukraine war to conflict in the Middle East during a swift swansong trip to Berlin. \u201cWe\u2019re wheels down in Berlin,\u201d Biden wrote in a post on X overnight. \u201cReady to greet old friends and strengthen our close alliance as we stand together for freedom and against tyranny around the world.\u201d More on this shortly. In other developments: Donald Trump laid into Kamala Harris and other Democrats on Thursday in a pointed and at times bitter speech as he headlined the annual Al Smith charity dinner in New York. The Republican nominee repeatedly criticised his Democratic campaign rival over her decision to skip the event. She sent a video instead. Billionaire Elon Musk launched five nights of campaign events in Pennsylvania in support of Trump\u2019s campaign last night. \u201cThis election, I think, is going to decide the fate of America and, along with the fate of America, the fate of Western civilization,\u201d he said at a town hall event in Folsom, on the outskirts of Philadelphia. He also reportedly pushed the debunked narrative that voting machines had been used in a plot to rig the 2020 election. Harris and Trump will both be scouring for votes in Michigan on Friday as they try to lock down support in this key political battleground. Harris is scheduled to begin her day in Grand Rapids before holding events in Lansing and Oakland County, which is northwest of Detroit. Trump has his own event in Oakland County in the afternoon before holding a rally in Detroit in the evening.",

      "bodyText": "Mari was just two months into her new job when she decided she had had enough. The position at an online bank in Tokyo, found through a staffing agency, had looked like a perfect fit for the 25-year-old, a member of Japan\u2019s legions of temporary workers. But she quickly became despondent. \u201cOn my first day they gave me a thick manual to read, and when I went to my boss with questions he said: \u2018What the hell are you asking me that for?\u2019\u201d Mari, who asked that her real name not be used, was regularly forced to work late, and her boss\u2019s behaviour became more threatening. \u201cHe would ask me why I was taking so much time to finish a task and pretended to punch me when he thought I\u2019d made a mistake. And he\u2019d do things like deliberately knock my pencil case on to the floor. It was power harassment, pure and simple.\u201d Unable to summon the courage to tell her boss that she wanted to quit, she sought help from a company offering proxy resignations, a rapidly growing service for Japanese workers who can\u2019t bring themselves to hand in their notice in person. The Tokyo-based agency Momuri reports soaring demand since it started offering proxy resignation services two-and-a-half years ago. \u201cWe submit resignations on behalf of people who, for whatever reason, can\u2019t do it themselves,\u201d says Shinji Tanimoto, the head of Albatross, the firm that runs Momuri \u2013 Japanese for \u201cenough already\u201d. He adds: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just natural reluctance, but some might have experienced harassment or even violence from their employers. They are at their wits\u2019 end when they come to us.\u201d The firm, one of an estimated 100 companies across Japan offering similar services, has so far received 350,000 online consultations and completed 20,000 resignations. Experts have attributed the trend to a generational shift in attitudes towards work, accelerated by the disruption to jobs and lifestyles caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, when working from home prompted many people to reconsider their work-life balance. Japan\u2019s chronic labour shortage \u2013 a symptom of its low birthrate \u2013 has also made employers more determined to retain staff, even if it means intimidating them into staying. Some force workers to find their own replacements before accepting their resignations or rip up their resignation letters in front of them. After contacting Momuri through a popular messaging app, clients are asked to complete a questionnaire, sign a contract and pay a fee: \u00a522,000 (\u00a3110) for full-time workers and \u00a512,300 for part-time employees or those on a fixed-term contract. One of Momuri\u2019s 50 staff then calls the employer on the client\u2019s behalf. The process, from the initial consultation to resignation, can take as little as 20-30 minutes, according to Tanimoto, whose firm retains lawyers to deal with legal disputes. People in their 20s account for 60% of Momuri users, including a large number of new graduates. According to the labour ministry, more than 30% of recent graduates leave their jobs within three years \u2013 a figure that would have been unimaginable during Japan\u2019s postwar economic miracle. There are myriad reasons for wanting to resign, says Tanimoto, whose firm boasts a 100% success rate: from unpaid overtime, low wages and employer breaches of contract, to verbal abuse, violence and sexual harassment. \u201cIn Japan, companies are traditionally strong \u2013 what your employer says goes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Japanese people are generally reluctant to rock the boat. Resigning is seen as escaping and evading your responsibilities. But that is changing.\u201d The surge in demand for proxy resignations has been attributed to a mismatch between gen Z workers and companies whose corporate culture is rooted in the postwar era, when lifetime employment, promotions and pay rises were expected to be rewarded with absolute loyalty from staff. Many bosses take a resignation request as a personal insult. Although Momuri\u2019s client base is mainly young, it also receives requests for help from older workers. \u201cWe deal with all sorts of companies, from household names to small businesses,\u201d says Tanimoto, whose firm once submitted 45 resignations en masse to the same company. The reaction from employers varies. A small number show contrition and offer indirect apologies to the employee, and most simply accept the decision and complete the necessary paperwork. \u201cBut a small number go mad and threaten to turn up at our office, that sort of thing,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf they behave like that it makes you wonder how awful it must have been for the client.\u201d Proxy resignation firms say consultations spike after long public holidays, weekends and even after a rainy day \u2013 times when people tend to be more reflective. One in six workers in Japan used resignation agencies to change their jobs in the 12 months to June this year, according to Mynavi, an employment information provider. The largest group, 40.7% of respondents, said they had sought help because their employer had prevented them from leaving or was likely to. Almost a third said their working environment made it impossible to communicate their intention to quit, while almost 25% said they feared their firm would react badly. Toui Iida texted a resignation agency in September, a month after he was hired on a short-term contract by an IT company. \u201cThe job was way more physically demanding than I\u2019d been told, so I decided to quit,\u201d says Iida, who is now in between jobs. \u201cBut when I told my manager he pointed out that I\u2019d signed a one-year contract and hadn\u2019t been there long, so he refused to let me go.\u201d It took just hours for the 25-year-old to cut ties with his employer. \u201cI was so happy that I didn\u2019t have to go to work the next day.
