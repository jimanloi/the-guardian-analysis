      "bodyText": "The Albanese government has a trio of migration bills before parliament to facilitate the removal of non-citizens from Australia, including paying third countries to take them and creating powers to confiscate mobile phones in detention. Labor has been accused of trying to out-flank the former home affairs minister Peter Dutton, and even of enabling a form of \u201chuman trafficking\u201d by the campaign group Labor for Refugees NSW. On Monday the bills were listed to be debated on Wednesday and Guardian Australia revealed that the Coalition and Labor were closing in on a deal. On Wednesday the Coalition announced it would pass all three. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email What is in this package, and what new powers would the government gain? Migration amendment bill On 7 November the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, introduced the migration amendment bill, which he said would support his ability to make regulations reimposing ankle bracelets and curfews on people released from immigration detention, and \u201cstrengthen\u201d powers to remove non-citizens. The bill does so by authorising the Australian government to pay third countries to receive non-citizens from Australia. In theory more than 80,000 people are susceptible to removal, although home affairs officials stress that the bill does not expand that cohort and most leave voluntarily. The most likely potential targets are about 4,452 people on bridging visas so they can make \u201cacceptable arrangements to depart Australia\u201d, 1,179 people in immigration or community detention, and 246 people released due to the high court\u2019s ruling that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful. If people in that cohort refused to go to the third country, they could be redetained. The bill contains provisions making Australia immune from civil suits in relation to removals. The bill also expands the power of the minister to reverse a protection finding of a non-citizen on a \u201cremoval pathway\u201d, which includes transitory persons brought to Australia from offshore detention and those whose protection visa applications were determined by the fast-track process. What concerns have been raised? The main concern expressed by stakeholders is that there are no legislated criteria limiting the third countries that Australia can do deals with to remove non-citizens. As a result there is no guarantee that they must be signatories to the refugee convention. This objection was expressed by the Law Council, the Refugee Council, the Human Rights Law Centre, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and the Australian Human Rights Commission. In response, home affairs department officials told a hearing on Thursday that Australia was \u201ccommitted to its international law obligations\u201d and may as a matter of \u201cpractice or policy\u201d insist that removal countries would have to be signatories to conventions on refugee rights. Labor for Refugees NSW &amp; ACT submitted to the inquiry that paying \u201cthird countries to accept people Australia wishes to deport \u2026 could be considered a form of people trafficking\u201d. The human rights committee has warned that if the third country deals come with unreasonable conditions attached then non-citizens face lengthy spells in detention. The HRLC has warned that the latest regulations reimposing ankle bracelets and curfews could be unconstitutional for the same reason the high court struck down the first set: those conditions are punitive and can only be imposed by a court, not the minister. The government believes it has cured this defect by setting a more objective test for imposing the conditions. The minister must be satisfied the bridging visa holder \u201cposes a substantial risk of seriously harming any part of the Australian community by committing a serious offence\u201d. Immunity from civil suits is a concern because litigation is an important accountability mechanism. For example, negligence claims helped force the Australian government to bring sick people to Australia from offshore detention. Prohibited items bill On Thursday Burke introduced a bill that would allow drugs and mobile phones to be confiscated from non-citizens in immigration detention. The bill allows the minister to write regulations prohibiting items in detention if they are \u201csatisfied that the thing is unlawful to possess in place or places in Australia or if the thing would pose a risk to the health, safety or security of a person in the facility or the order of the facility\u201d. The bill includes safeguards that if a device is confiscated, detainees must be given \u201calternative means of communication\u201d to obtain legal advice, contact family and friends, or communicate on political matters. Advocates have warned the bill will make it harder for people in detention to seek accountability for their treatment, including accessing legal advice at short notice. On Monday the shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, told the lower house that the Coalition will support the prohibited items bill without amendment. Deportation bill revived In March Labor introduced a bill that would force hundreds of non-citizens to facilitate their own deportation or face 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. The bill requires non-citizens \u201cto cooperate in efforts to ensure their prompt and lawful removal\u201d, giving power to the minister to direct a non-citizen who is due to be deported \u201cto do specified things necessary to facilitate their removal\u201d. The bill also creates a power for the government to ban new visa applications from countries that do not accept removals from Australia, described by the Greens as a \u201cTrump-style travel ban\u201d. The Coalition and the Greens teamed up to delay the bill and send it to an inquiry. The opposition then recommended extensive amendments, including mandatory consideration of the best interests of children and diaspora communities before exercising new ministerial powers. These amendments are not part of the deal. Instead, the Coalition won a three-year sunset on the power for the minister to ban visa applications from a country, and a requirement to give reasons for such a designation.",

Participants were put into either an irregular sleep group (SRI score less than 71.6), moderately irregular sleep group (SRI between 71.6 and 87.3), or regular sleep group (SRI score more than 87.3). People were then followed up for eight years. Even after taking into account factors that could influence the results, irregular sleepers were 26% more likely to suffer a stroke, heart failure or heart attack than those with regular sleep, the study found. Moderately irregular sleepers were 8% more likely to do so. Researchers found the SRI score was a continuous measure, with people\u2019s risk of heart attack and stroke increasing the more irregular their sleeping patterns were. The recommended amount of sleep for 18- to 64-year-olds is seven to nine hours a night, and seven to eight hours for those aged 65 and over. The study found a greater proportion of regular sleepers (61%) met the recommended sleep quota than irregular sleepers (48%). But this made no difference to heart health for irregular sleepers, who had the same higher risk of stroke and heart attack even if they were getting enough sleep. In contrast, moderately irregular sleepers saw their risks drop if they got adequate sleep. This was an observational study, and as such, could not establish cause and effect, and the researchers acknowledged various limitations to their findings. But they concluded that the findings suggest that irregular sleep was strongly associated with a risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults, irrespective of whether or not recommended sleep quotas were met. \u201cMore importantly, our results suggest that sleep regularity may be more relevant than sufficient sleep duration in modulating major adverse cardiovascular event risk.\u201d",

Gill\u2019s recipe calls for 200ml mango puree, but swap this for the flesh of about two mangoes, blended in a food processor or blender.

It might be possible to make the dressing in a food processor or blender, but Miers recommends using a mortar and pestle \u2013 a big one. It\u2019s \u201cthe secret to many a great sauce\u201d, she writes. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/17/preserve-summer-vegetable-fruit-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-ajvar-atchar\">4.

Atchar, or achar, is a type of pickle eaten throughout south-east Asia, and is an excellent side for any dish that needs a sharp-sweet contrast. Ottolenghi\u2019s version combines mango with another orange friend \u2013 butternut pumpkin \u2013 plus green beans and warm spices. It\u2019s an excellent weekend project \u2013 and your efforts will keep well, refrigerated, for three months.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/18/nigel-slaters-recipe-for-mango-and-passion-fruit-fool\">5.

Passionfruit can be swapped out for raspberries, which are affordable and available at the moment. Find the ripest mangoes you can, writes Slater: they should be \u201cgiving to the touch, deeply fragrant, and maybe with a golden bead of juice already appearing at their stalks\u201d.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jul/04/caribbean-fish-mango-and-okra-curry-recipe-riaz-phillips\">6. Riaz Phillips\u2019 Caribbean fish, mango and okra curry</a></h2>    <p>Fish and mango are a common pairing in curries from Indonesia, the Carribean and India; and here the magic ingredient is okra, which thickens the curry. Phillips says in the Caribbean this dish is commonly made with gilbaka or hassar; but he\u2019s suggested other fish varieties which are more readily available in Australia, such as red snapper or kingfish. And where Slater calls for a super-ripe mango for his fool, it\u2019s a hard green mango you\u2019ll need to source for this curry \u2013 green mangoes can be sourced from south-east Asian grocers. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/sep/28/yotam-ottolenghi-curries-recipes-squash-poppadom-chickpea-mango-bombay-mix\">7. Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s black chickpea and mango curry with bombay mix</a></h2>    <p>Another recipe that calls for a green, unripe mango \u2013 it\u2019s added to this curry in the last 15 minutes of cooking, and simmered until it\u2019s \u201csoft but still holds its shape\u201d \u2013 a physical state many of us should aspire to. Black chickpeas can be replaced with regular chickpeas, though the former are nuttier and firmer, Ottolenghi writes. The finishing touch is bombay mix \u2013 an Indian snack mix including fried chickpea flour noodles, nuts, and fried lentils \u2013 which Ottolenghi makes from scratch.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/18/filipino-philippines-cuisine-recipes-dishes-traditions\">Yasmin Newman\u2019s watermelon ice with mango, coconut jelly and ube jam</a></h2> <p>Inspired by the Japanese shaved ice dessert kakigori, halo-halo is arguably the most loved dessert of the Philippines, writes Australian-Filipina food critic Yasmin Newman. Watermelon granita, or watermelon shaved ice, is topped with tropical fruits including mango, starfruit and lychees, coconut milk, ube jam and edible flowers. It is a riotous rainbow of refreshment.</p>",

Thomasina Miers\u2019 Thai prawn salad with green mango and peanuts Thai salads are known for a \u201cheady combination of flavours\u201d, Miers writes, and of course she\u2019s right: see the citrus tang from the lime, the fresh grassiness of the mint and coriander, the intoxicating from-the-sea funk of fish sauce. It might be possible to make the dressing in a food processor or blender, but Miers recommends using a mortar and pestle \u2013 a big one. It\u2019s \u201cthe secret to many a great sauce\u201d, she writes. 4. Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s mango and squash atchar To make your mangoes last the distance. Atchar, or achar, is a type of pickle eaten throughout south-east Asia, and is an excellent side for any dish that needs a sharp-sweet contrast. Ottolenghi\u2019s version combines mango with another orange friend \u2013 butternut pumpkin \u2013 plus green beans and warm spices. It\u2019s an excellent weekend project \u2013 and your efforts will keep well, refrigerated, for three months. 5. Nigel Slater\u2019s mango passionfruit fool Whipped cream, yoghurt, pureed mangoes and passionfruit \u2013 is this the perfect lazy person\u2019s summer dessert? Passionfruit can be swapped out for raspberries, which are affordable and available at the moment. Find the ripest mangoes you can, writes Slater: they should be \u201cgiving to the touch, deeply fragrant, and maybe with a golden bead of juice already appearing at their stalks\u201d. 6. Riaz Phillips\u2019 Caribbean fish, mango and okra curry Fish and mango are a common pairing in curries from Indonesia, the Carribean and India; and here the magic ingredient is okra, which thickens the curry. Phillips says in the Caribbean this dish is commonly made with gilbaka or hassar; but he\u2019s suggested other fish varieties which are more readily available in Australia, such as red snapper or kingfish. And where Slater calls for a super-ripe mango for his fool, it\u2019s a hard green mango you\u2019ll need to source for this curry \u2013 green mangoes can be sourced from south-east Asian grocers. 7. Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s black chickpea and mango curry with bombay mix Another recipe that calls for a green, unripe mango \u2013 it\u2019s added to this curry in the last 15 minutes of cooking, and simmered until it\u2019s \u201csoft but still holds its shape\u201d \u2013 a physical state many of us should aspire to. Black chickpeas can be replaced with regular chickpeas, though the former are nuttier and firmer, Ottolenghi writes. The finishing touch is bombay mix \u2013 an Indian snack mix including fried chickpea flour noodles, nuts, and fried lentils \u2013 which Ottolenghi makes from scratch. 8. Yasmin Newman\u2019s watermelon ice with mango, coconut jelly and ube jam Inspired by the Japanese shaved ice dessert kakigori, halo-halo is arguably the most loved dessert of the Philippines, writes Australian-Filipina food critic Yasmin Newman. Watermelon granita, or watermelon shaved ice, is topped with tropical fruits including mango, starfruit and lychees, coconut milk, ube jam and edible flowers. It is a riotous rainbow of refreshment.",

      "bodyText": "Teenagers are facing wide-ranging new restrictions over the use of beauty filters on TikTok amid concern at rising anxiety and falling self-esteem. Under-18s will, in the coming weeks, be blocked from artificially making their eyes bigger, plumping their lips and smoothing or changing their skin tone. The restrictions will apply to filters \u2013 such as \u201cBold Glamour\u201d \u2013 that change children\u2019s features in a way that makeup cannot. Comic filters that add bunny ears or dog noses will be unaffected. The billion-user social media company announced the changes during a safety forum at its European headquarters in Dublin. The effectiveness of the restrictions will depend on people using the platform under their real age, which is not always the case. There has been widespread concern that the beauty filters \u2013 some provided by TikTok, others created by users \u2013 have resulted in a pressure on teenagers, particularly girls, to adopt a polished physical appearance with negative emotional repercussions. Some young people have described how after using filters they found their real face ugly. TikTok also announced it was tightening its systems to block users under 13 from the platform, which could mean that thousands of British children are turfed off the platform. Before the end of the year, it will launch a trial of new automated systems that use machine learning to detect people cheating its age restrictions. The moves come with tougher regulation of underage social media use in the UK looming in the new year, under the Online Safety Act. The platform already removes 20m accounts every quarter worldwide for being underage. Chloe Setter, TikTok\u2019s lead on child safety public policy, said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will give us the ability to detect and remove more and more quickly.\u201d People wrongly blocked will be able to appeal. \u201cIt can obviously be annoying for some young people,\u201d said Setter, but she added that the platform will take a \u201csafety-first approach\u201d. Ofcom said in a report last December that from June 2022 to March 2023 about 1% of TikTok\u2019s total UK monthly active user base were removed for being underage. The regulator has previously warned the effectiveness of TikTok\u2019s age restriction enforcement is \u201cyet to be established\u201d. It is due to start strictly enforcing over-13 age limits for social media users next summer, requiring \u201chighly effective\u201d age checks. The new \u201cguardrails\u201d around beauty filters and age verification are part of a wave of adjustments to online safety being announced by social media platforms before tougher regulations are enforced in the coming months, with potential heavy fines for breaches of online safety rules. Last week Roblox, the gaming platform with 90 million daily users, announced it would restrict its youngest users from accessing the more violent, crude and scary content on the platform after warnings about child grooming, exploitation and the sharing of indecent images. Instagram, which is run by Meta, launched \u201cteen accounts\u201d for under-18s to allow parents greater control over children\u2019s activities, including the ability to block children from viewing the app at night. Andy Burrows, the chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up to focus on suicide prevention, said: \u201cIt will not escape anyone\u2019s attention that these shifts are being announced largely to comply with EU and UK regulation. This makes the case for more ambitious regulation, not less.\u201d He called for TikTok to be fully transparent about how its age assurance measures will work and their effectiveness at reducing the number of under-13s on the platform. Burrows added: \u201cTikTok should act quickly to fix the systemic weaknesses in its design that allows a torrent of harmful content to be algorithmically recommended to young people aged 13 or over.\u201d The NSPCC described the age protection move as \u201cencouraging\u201d but \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cOther social media sites must step up and find effective ways to assess the ages of their users,\u201d said Richard Collard, the charity\u2019s associate head of policy for child safety online. \u201cOfcom and the government also have an important role to play in compelling tech bosses to deliver age-appropriate experiences for all their users.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from tonight on this game but the City saga continues. Here\u2019s more from that Pep verdict: \u201cThe game was fine at 3-0, playing good, but then we concede a lot goals because we were not stable. We gave them the first and then the other one, that is why it was difficult. \u201cWe lost a lot of games lately, we are fragile and of course we needed a victory, the game was good for the confidence. We were playing a good level but the first time something happened we had problems. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is mental. The first goal cannot happen and the second as well. After that we forget what happen, we were desperate to win and do well, we do well but don\u2019t win games. \u201cThe situation is what it is. We played a good game but at that level we can\u2019t give them away. Right now I am not ready to think about that [needing to get to 16 points]. We have to recover and prepare for the next game. If we are not able to win games like we did today it is difficult to do it.\u201d Pep also has a cut on his nose and some other blemishes on his face. Weirder and weirder. Here\u2019s Pep on the Amazon broadcast: \u201cWe were playing well at 3-0. We lost a lot of games lately and we are fragile. The first goal cannot happen, the second too. The situation is what it is. We have to recover. Rest. Think of the next game.\u201d He was very twitchy in that interview, his face flushed. Jamie Jackson had quite the turnaround to turn around with his report from the Etihad. Nathan Ake spoke to Amazon\u2019s broadcast: \u201cDifficult, 3-0 up, playing quite well and it all changed. You have to stay strong mentally. At 3-1 they pushed on and we invited more pressure. We have to stay mentally stronger. I think we did give it away. It feels like a defeat. It\u2019s a tough night. We can look forward to Liverpool. This is where we have to show our character. We have to stay strong together.\u201d This was just five days ago. Going to make this prediction, and I\u2019m certain of this one but been wrong before: Josko Gvardiol isn\u2019t going to start at Anfield. Dry from Niall Mullen: \u201cAfter five straight defeats you just knew City would stop the rot.\u201d Justin Kavanagh: \u201cI take back that earlier comparison of City to The Faces; this is more Cut-the-Crap era Clash.\u201d This is England was the first half. OK, just about. K\u00e1ri Tulinius throws a log on the fire: \u201cGvardiol didn\u2019t suddenly forget how to defend, but he seems slow to react these days. Same can be said of many other City players. It\u2019s a bit of a caricature, I know, but I suspect that Pep\u2019s attempted solutions are getting ever more baroque and intricate, overloading his players\u2019 memory like a web browser with too many tabs open.\u201d The City players look haunted and reluctant to leave the field. Pep Guardiola will have choice words. If he says anything. His team utterly failed to manage a game totally within their control. They got punished \u2013 again \u2013 and the secret is out. City can be a soft touch. 90+5 min: Trauner, who has been excellent, makes two clearances. Then another. And mild panic when Gimenez gets the ball and spreads it. They couldn\u2019t, could they? The boos from the home fans sound at the full-time whistle. What just happened? 90+3 min: City pushing for the win but doing so nervously. They are but seconds away from a result that will feel like a defeat. Worse, probably. 90+2 min: This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. And now it happens all the time. 90+1 min: Now Grealish hits the bar. City want to win this, even though the damage is done already. Pep is going to roast them. How high was that line for the goal? Shades of Ange-ball when down to nine men. 90 min: Ederson charges out, and Igor Paixao storms away, and chips. Hancko, a defender, nods home. Nobody marking him. Just wow. Wow, just wow. City have fallen apart. 88 min: Now a matter of City squeezing play but Lotomba, who looks mustard, escapes him. Then McAtee is booked for wasting time when he manhandles Wellenreuther. That was a cheap shot though killed time. 86 min: City, nerves jangling, are having to scrap this out. They haven\u2019t been at all good\u2026but Grealish sets up De Bruyne but Wellenreuther saves with ease. 84 min: That goal came via another Gvardiol mistake, and Feyenoord took advantage in real style, patiently cutting through. City were, frankly, a rabble. A familiar scene. They have conceded two or more in six consecutive matches for the first time since 1963. Just amazing. Hello, hello. Do we have a game on our hands? Gimenez bundles over the line after Lotomba crosses. There\u2019s a VAR delay but Pep is already beside himself in pain. 80 min: An opening for McAtee? No, his shot is deflected into the hands of Wellenreuther. That sends Feyenoord back up the pitch and Pep, a sickened man, starts worrying again\u2026. 79 min: The word from the stadium is that the Feyenoord and City fans are confronting each other in the stands, and the stewards have had to step in. 78 min: If nothing else, that goal has proved that City have weaknesses and wobbles to be be picked at. Gvardiol had a bad one against Tottenham, too. 76 min: No words between Pep and Juanma, mostly because Pep has his head in his hands, and his head between the knees as if in the brace position. Now the anger returns. Gvardiol does a no-look pass, to Simpson-Pusey, who isn\u2019t looking, either, and Hadj Moussa steals in, rounds Ederson and scores from an angle. 74 min: Pep and Juanma are chatting away. So much more relaxed\u2026 72 min: Two more Feyenoord changes, with Gimenez, the star man who has been suffering from injuries, comes on for Carranza. The Feyenoord fans sound very happy to see him. 70 min: Bernardo wafts a cross that has Grealish dive-heading in the style of Andy Gray; except Gernot Trauner dives across to clear. 68 min: There\u2019s been a couple of Feyenoord subs, too. Kept waiting a long time on the sidelines. Smal and Milambo off, and on come Thomas Beelen and Ramiz Zerrouki. 66 min: Three City subs imminent, we are told. Simpson-Pusey, McAtee and KDB. To follow Richard Hirst, McAtee can be Blondie Chaplin and sail on, sailor. Off go Gundogan, Ake and Foden. 64 min: Rico Lewis has had a decent game as full-back given license to roam into midfield. The Trent role, as we now call it. 61 min: Priske is set to make some subs . Like Pep, he has weekend engagements to think of. Feyenoord welcome the mighty Fortuna Sittard to De Kuip on Saturday. 60 min: Rick Harris: \u201cI think I watched a different FA Cup Final to Chris Lawton as I saw Manchester City outplayed by Manchester United who were the better team on the day.\u201d My recollection, too. Chris is back: \u201cThere you go for the third goal \u2026 move the ball forward quicker and you get goals. Sometimes it really isn\u2019t all that difficult.\u201d Richard Hirst: \u201cI\u2019d put KdB more as a late period Beach Boys session musician.\u201d The Ricky Fataar role? 59 min: Does Haaland stay on for his hat-trick? He\u2019s not leaving it to chance, exchanging passes with Foden and then slipping to the floor, rather like Grealish just before. 57 min: Feyenoord\u2019s defensive discipline has deserted them. Carranza is booked for a hack at Rico Lewis. 55 min: Another? No, Jack Grealish loses his composure \u2013 and footing \u2013 just as the ball comes to him. That was not a confident finish. Next, Wellenreuther is asked to make a save from Gvardiol. 54 min: That winning feeling for City, then? Been a while. A long while. The plan is to take this forward to Anfield. Nunes creates this one, asking for the ball to be played into his path, and then setting up Haaland for a sliding finish. Big smile from the big man as he scores. 51 min: Gundo enjoyed that one. It\u2019s not been the happiest of returns to Manchester since he spent a year in Barcelona. The corner zips in, and Gundogan swings a boot, the ball bouncing off a defender and in, and that\u2019s celebrated wildly by Pep and Juanma. 49 min: Bernardo finds space, and slips in Nunes, whose shot is well saved by Wellenreuther; though Nunes might have done better. 47 min: There was only a point between these two in the table as they kicked off \u2013 11 places, though \u2013 all this will take a long time to get used to. 46 min: Back off they go, and it\u2019s an edgy, quiet Etihad that greets the players. It must be freezing, in mitigation. Samuel Campbell gets in touch: \u201cI understand why the penalty has been given but the reward of a free shot at goal for that offence is far too much. Feyenoord gained absolutely no advantage. Haaland was still able to lay the ball off and a city player got a show away. There has to be a different reward for such minor infractions in the penalty area \u201c Justin Kavanaugh: \u201cCity seem to have hit their mid-70\u2019s Faces phase\u2026 while their main man has his name in lights after conquering the world, they seem to know that they\u2019re just never going to be as good without the Rod.\u201d They\u2019re missing KDB as Ronnie Lane, too. Chris Lawton: \u201cReal Madrid showed how to beat Man City last season. Teams set up 4-5-1 or 5-4-1 sit deep and narrow and let City have as much possession as they want around the box - then, if they can, they look to counter on the break ( see e.g. FA Cup Final ). Really surprised Pep hasn\u2019t come up with an alternative to this like the immediately obvious of move the ball forward quicker.\u201d Michiel Vos: \u201cAlthough I may be biased as a Feyenoord fan, may I just dismissively state that the font on the Man City shirt makes Comic Sans look cool?\u201d Peter Oh: \u201cI guess it takes swinging Timber to take down the big Norwegian goal machine.\u201c The conceder of the penalty was Quinten Timber of the Timber twins. A deserved lead? City are still not at it. Their goal came from a penalty that was rather fortunate. Feyenoord will count themselves unlucky, they had begun to grow into the game. Haaland scored his penalty with anger and rage. 45 min: Quite the release of energy after that goal. Relief all round. Haaland didn\u2019t do much smiling. Guardiola looked happier than he has for a while but was no Cheshire Cat in his response. He and Juanma are still deep in discourse. Plenty of delay, and Haaland keeps his cool as the Feyenoord keeper wastes an inordinate amount of time. Pep can\u2019t look. Haaland scores coolly and then smashes the ball into the net with real rage. That makes him the quickest player to 50 goal involvements in Champions League history. Was it given for handball? Was it given for Haaland being fouled as he turned? The latter, it seems. 40 min: Haaland in space but an exemplary block by Hancko gets it done. 38 min: Steve Waterhouse gets in touch: \u201cRadu Petrescu; the Spurs mash up you never knew we needed. But we did.\u201d Matt Stephens gets in touch: \u201cI watched Pep\u2019s re-signing video interview earlier today. In his previous one two years ago, he was beaming, declaring \u201c I love it!\u201d In this video he states that he felt obliged or compelled to stay. The body language was all shaking heads and furrowed brows. It might be wishful thinking on my part, but I feel the rest of this year is not going to turn out well for City. Pep could well change his mind and depart next summer.\u201d Big call, let\u2019s see. But I like your style. 37 min: Ooof. Hwang thrashes in a shot that Nunes has to get in the way of. Then City, again set off by Ederson, their key playmaker these days, sets off a counter. A corner results from Foden\u2019s shot and there\u2019s more grappling by Haaland. Ake gets to it and heads wide. 35 min: The Etihad Campus is filling with groans. City mount an attack, Foden skating through but his ball to Haaland is blocked. The fans are getting behind the team at last. They need something to lift them. 33 min: Richard Hirst gets in touch: \u201cTimber playing for Arsenal, Timber playing for Feyenoord: if only Forest were in action.\u201d We need Chopper Harris on the case. 32 min: Yeah, not much doing here. City are way off it, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re good enough to win this, but the thrill has gone. And Igor Paixao, the Feyenoord forward, gets a sniff, though his shot is no trouble to Ederson. 29 min: John de Wolf is the on the Feyenoord bench. John de Wolf, once of Wolves, and involved in this all-time FA Cup classic fully 30 seasons ago. 27 min: City\u2026it\u2019s not really happening for them. Feels like their best football is some way off. On the bench, Guardiola and Juanma Lillo are both muttering away. Juanma looks a bit like Kevin Keegan. 25 min: The Feyenoord fans taunting the home fans. The home fans find some voice in response. The language is not to be repeated here. 23 min: Feyenoord mount a proper attack, and after the ball whistles past Ederson, a quick counter ensues. Wellenreuther makes a fine save from Foden, and City have a corner. Haaland is involved in all sorts of grappling, and that delays a corner that\u2019s eventually cleared. 21 min: Some City chanting. To Oasis\u2019s She\u2019s Electric. Quinten Timber, the brother of Arsenal\u2019s Timber, is making himself busy. Twin brother, in fact. 19 min: Feyenoord attempt to press high and succeed only in setting up a City attack. That falls flat, too, Foden crowded out. The Dutch team seem to be growing in confidence. 17 min: Some Haaland anger as he chases down a pass and hounds the defender, only for an offside to be called. Pep, in puffer jacket, looks just as anguished. 15 min: Jack Grealish attempts the rarely seen tap-corner. He succeeds only in setting up a Feyenoord attack. Gvardiol sweeps up. 14 min: Wellenreuther slides out to stop Nunes. City prompting and probing. Feyenoord really sitting back and suffering. There\u2019s a handball shout as it next goes to Nunes. Nothing doing. 13 min: Grealish gets a chance. Wellenreuther had decided to play out of goal and the ball is recovered and played in. The shot rattles away \u2013 off Foden. Lots of eagerness, lots of possession, it will come, but it\u2019s not coming yet. 11 min: Foden seems to be manning the left where you might expect Grealish to be. This time, his ball finds Haaland, who can only poke at the ball. 10 min: First chance, a header by Haaland, flicked down and Wellenreuther makes a fine save. Initially, Foden\u2019s cross had missed a rather statuesque Haaland. 8 min: Jack Grealish trying to get involved; he\u2019s been peripheral so far \u2013 and for much of the season. City retain the ball. And retain and retain. 7 min: Is a lack of tactical fouls costing City? Someone might have the stats. Maybe those aged legs are struggling to keep up with speedy opponents. The passing tonight has been a bit ponderous, too. 6 min: Gundogan is in the central role, the Rodri position. Nunes attempts to wriggle through \u2013 he\u2019s in the role of ball carrier tonight. Feyenoord are sat deep. And try to send away Carranza, who is on the end of a tactical foul. 4 min: City are doing what you\u2019d expect City to do, lots of passes, dominating possession. That said, they\u2019ve done that for spells of all the games they lost. Rico Lewis takes a whack, from two defenders at once. But he\u2019s OK. 3 min: Bernardo Silva \u2013 the captain \u2013 spins and twists. Haaland wants it, Gundogan gets it, and his shot is blocked. Foden doesn\u2019t do much with the corner. 1 min: Feyenoord set off briskly, and there are cheers from the City fans as Manuel Akanji clears the danger. The Feyenoord fans are making a racket. De Kuip is one of the best places to watch football in my opinion and they\u2019ve brought some of that to Manchester. So, the players shake hands, and soon enough, they will be kicking off. The Etihad is under capacity, we are told. At the Etihad, they\u2019re holding another light show, though not like that one for Rodri. By the way, Niall McVeigh is providing the updates on the rest of the games from his chair. News from elsewhere, relevant to City: Julian Alvarez \u2013 remember him? \u2013 has scored twice for Atletico at Sparta Prague. They replaced him with\u2026Savinho? Krishna gets in touch: \u201cHello John (or is it Scott under a new pseudonym?) \u201cLose to Spurs. Then lose to Arne\u2019s successor. And finally lose to Arne himself. Certainly Pep would not like such orderly things, a narrow win today followed by a draw this weekend is what I predict.\u201d Yes, it is John. Standing in for the great man. The headlines: De Bruyne still on the bench, and so is Gimenez. Walker dropped, as is Savinho. In: Nathan Ake, Matheus Nunes and Jack Grealish. Out: Walker, Savinho and John Stones, who isn\u2019t in the squad at all. Man City: Ederson, Lewis, Akanji, Ake, Gvardiol, Silva, Gundogan, Matheus Luiz, Foden, Haaland, Grealish. Subs: Ortega, Carson, Walker, Dias, De Bruyne, Savio, Wright, Simpson-Pusey, O\u2019Reilly, McAtee, Wilson-Esbrand. Feyenoord: Wellenreuther, Nieuwkoop, Trauner, Hancko, Smal, Hwang, Milambo, Timber, Hadj Moussa, Carranza, Igor Paixao. Subs: Bijlow, Ka, Beelen, Zerrouki, Gonzalez, Ivanusec, Mitchell, Zechel, Gimenez, Lotomba, Redmond. Referee: Radu Petrescu (Romania) As ever, Jonathan Wilson has been thinking deeply against this unexpected malaise. And yet something is different. According to Opta, City have had the third-easiest run of fixtures of any club from the start of this Premier League season, yet if they lose at Anfield next week (and Liverpool are the side Guardiola has lost to second-most often) they will be 11 points behind the leaders. The aura has gone; opponents are sensing blood in the water. This is like Chelsea in 2015-16, or Manchester United under David Moyes, or Liverpool in the early 1990s. Sides no longer face them seeking merely to avoid embarrassment; they believe there is a chance of a notable result. City aren\u2019t old, OK? Not according to Pep, that is. Missing for City: Oscar Bobb, Ruben Dias, Mateo Kovacic and, of course, Rodri. That the rest look tired is also a big problem. For Feyenoord: Santiago Gimenez will be a big miss, and he\u2019s doubtful with a thigh injury. Brian Priske, the Feyenoord coach, Arne Slot\u2019s successor on City: \u201cFor me they are still one of the best teams in the world, a world-class team. We\u2019ve seen a lot of their games and, for example, at the weekend against Spurs they were really unlucky. We know we have to play a perfect match to get a positive result, especially defensively. More Pep: \u201cIn this situation we have to be more direct in our principles. Don\u2019t change much, in fact less than ever. One day we\u2019re going to win a game and our mind will be clear. I hope it will be [against Feyenoord], if not Sunday [against Liverpool]. But the desire is there to change it and we\u2019re going to try.\u201d Does this mean they *are* going direct? And Kevin De Bruyne: \u201cIt has been a bit chaotic. I have seen so many people passed around the medical area. Seeing who is playing, who is not, people who shouldn\u2019t be playing but did with an injury; in these games we were all over the place. Everyone is down but we have to move on.\u201d Some Pep quotes from his press conference: \u201cI still have the feeling that this season we will still do very good things. I don\u2019t give up and I have a feeling we will be there. We will congratulate the team that takes our crown because they deserve it, not because we gave it to them. [When] you are defending a legacy, tradition, success it is so difficult to handle.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be six in a row, could it? Surely this is the night when the rots stops, and Manchester City recover their footing. Feyenoord are only fourth in the Eredivisie and 21st in the Champions League enormotable. They couldn\u2019t, could they? It\u2019s at the Etihad but it\u2019s also uncharted territory for Pep Guardiola. Will he ask his team to go tight, play the percentages? That\u2019s not the usual way but that\u2019s the orthodox way out of such fluxes. But then again, nothing about Pep or City is ordinary. Join me for an 8pm GMT kick-off.",

      "body": "<p>The owner of Vauxhall has announced that it plans to close its van factory at Luton, in a decision that will put 1,100 jobs at risk of being cut or moving location despite the UK government preparing to relax rules on electric cars.</p> <p>Stellantis said it would shift van production from Luton, Bedfordshire, to another factory at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, blaming the UK\u2019s economic conditions and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/22/electric-shock-carmakers-battle-strict-uk-electric-car-rules-as-big-fines-loom\">government\u2019s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate</a>.</p> <p>The news was announced on the same day that the government said it would consult on changes to the mandate as it tried to head off carmakers\u2019 complaints that its electric car sales targets were too difficult amid slumping demand.</p> <p>Stellantis\u2019s decision is a bitter blow to the UK car industry, as carmakers around the world struggle with slower demand and intense competition, while also investing in switching from petrol and diesel production to electric. Ford last week said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/20/ford-cuts-jobs-europe-uk-slowdown-ev-sales\">cut 4,000 jobs in Europe</a>, including 800 in the UK, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/03/volkswagen-cuts-plan-sends-shock-through-the-detroit-of-east-germany\">Volkswagen is preparing to close three factories in Germany</a>, the first time it has closed plants in the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/22/electric-shock-carmakers-battle-strict-uk-electric-car-rules-as-big-fines-loom\">Electric shock: carmakers battle strict UK electric car rules as big fines loom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Luton Stellantis factory employs 1,100 people. Stellantis said several hundred Luton workers could be moved to Ellesmere Port, which will receive a \u00a350m investment.</p> <p>Workers at Luton were informed of the decision on Tuesday. Less than a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/22/vauxhalls-luton-plant-to-manufacture-electric-vans-in-uk-from-next-year\">Stellantis said the Luton site would produce medium-sized Vivaro electric vans</a> for the Vauxhall, Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat Professional brands. Ellesmere Port produces smaller electric vans after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/06/vauxhall-owner-to-invest-100m-to-build-electric-vehicles-at-ellesmere-port\">\u00a3100m investment announced in 2021</a>.</p> <p>The closure will spell the end of vehicle manufacturing in Luton after nearly 120 years. The Unite union, which represents many of the workers, called for the government to oppose the closure.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Unite said it was \u201ca complete slap in the face for our members in Luton\u201d. They added: \u201cWhatever the positive benefits this plan may have for Ellesmere Port, that is not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Stellantis has repeatedly warned of possible UK factory closures. Last year, it said it would come under threat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/17/vauxhall-maker-says-brexit-deal-must-be-renegotiated-or-it-could-shut-uk-plant\">if tariffs were imposed on UK-EU trade</a>, while in June it said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/25/vauxhall-owner-car-plants-shut-uk-stellantis-ellesmere-port-luton\">factory closures were a possibility</a> if the UK government did not step in to help the industry with the ZEV mandate.</p> <p>However, industry insiders questioned whether the closure was directly linked to the ZEV mandate, pointing instead to Stellantis\u2019s unused factory capacity across Europe. Stellantis also owns brands ranging from Fiat and Chrysler to Jeep and Citro\u00ebn.</p> <p>The move will nevertheless be a blow to the UK government. The business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told car executives industry executives at a dinner on Tuesday evening hosted by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), that the government would seek to reveal the new policies in January, saying he was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about the way zero emissions policies currently operate.</p> <p>Reynolds said: \u201cWe get it. We get the seriousness of the situation and we get the urgency. It really matters to me and the government that vehicles are made here.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson announced that the government would bring forward a consultation on the mandate that will look at changes to rules that impose fines of up to \u00a315,000 for each petrol or diesel vehicle sold above a quota.</p> <p>The SMMT on Tuesday said the ZEV mandate would cost the industry \u00a36bn this year in discounts and payments for \u201ccredits\u201d to hit the targets. The industry argues that discounts are unsustainable, although they benefit British car buyers.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe need an urgent review of the automotive market and the regulation intended to drive it. Not because we want to water down any commitments, but because delivery matters more than notional targets. The industry is hurting; profitability and viability are in jeopardy and jobs are on the line. When the world changes, so must we.\u201d</p> <p>The government is likely to stick firmly to its goal of phasing out new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030, and all hybrids by 2035, according to a person with knowledge of internal discussions.</p> <p>They said the government was also very likely to stick to headline targets mandating that sales of electric cars must account for 22% of new sales in 2024 for each manufacturer, rising to 28% next year and 80% by 2030, despite reports they could change. There are separate targets for vans. However, the government will consider changes to \u201cflexibilities\u201d that in effect allow carmakers to reduce the number of electric cars they need to sell.</p> <p>Those loopholes include the ability to \u201covercomply\u201d in later years to make up for a slow start in the coming two or three years, and lowering the average emissions of the fossil fuel cars they sell.</p> <p>The \u201cfast track\u201d consultation is expected to launch before Christmas, before reporting in the first few months in 2025 \u2013 faster than most policy consultations of that type. It is also expected to include details of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/22/electric-shock-carmakers-battle-strict-uk-electric-car-rules-as-big-fines-loom\">which hybrid cars can continue to be sold after 2030</a>.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see Stellantis investing in the future of its Ellesmere Port plant, we know this will be a concerning time for the families of employees at Luton who may be affected.</p>",

Stellantis said it would shift van production from Luton, Bedfordshire, to another factory at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, blaming the UK\u2019s economic conditions and the government\u2019s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate. The news was announced on the same day that the government said it would consult on changes to the mandate as it tried to head off carmakers\u2019 complaints that its electric car sales targets were too difficult amid slumping demand. Stellantis\u2019s decision is a bitter blow to the UK car industry, as carmakers around the world struggle with slower demand and intense competition, while also investing in switching from petrol and diesel production to electric. Ford last week said it would cut 4,000 jobs in Europe, including 800 in the UK, while Volkswagen is preparing to close three factories in Germany, the first time it has closed plants in the country. The Luton Stellantis factory employs 1,100 people. Stellantis said several hundred Luton workers could be moved to Ellesmere Port, which will receive a \u00a350m investment. Workers at Luton were informed of the decision on Tuesday. Less than a year ago, Stellantis said the Luton site would produce medium-sized Vivaro electric vans for the Vauxhall, Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat Professional brands. Ellesmere Port produces smaller electric vans after a \u00a3100m investment announced in 2021. The closure will spell the end of vehicle manufacturing in Luton after nearly 120 years. The Unite union, which represents many of the workers, called for the government to oppose the closure. A spokesperson for Unite said it was \u201ca complete slap in the face for our members in Luton\u201d. They added: \u201cWhatever the positive benefits this plan may have for Ellesmere Port, that is not acceptable.\u201d Stellantis has repeatedly warned of possible UK factory closures. Last year, it said it would come under threat if tariffs were imposed on UK-EU trade, while in June it said factory closures were a possibility if the UK government did not step in to help the industry with the ZEV mandate. However, industry insiders questioned whether the closure was directly linked to the ZEV mandate, pointing instead to Stellantis\u2019s unused factory capacity across Europe. Stellantis also owns brands ranging from Fiat and Chrysler to Jeep and Citro\u00ebn. The move will nevertheless be a blow to the UK government. The business secretary Jonathan Reynolds told car executives industry executives at a dinner on Tuesday evening hosted by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), that the government would seek to reveal the new policies in January, saying he was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about the way zero emissions policies currently operate. Reynolds said: \u201cWe get it. We get the seriousness of the situation and we get the urgency. It really matters to me and the government that vehicles are made here.\u201d On Tuesday, Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson announced that the government would bring forward a consultation on the mandate that will look at changes to rules that impose fines of up to \u00a315,000 for each petrol or diesel vehicle sold above a quota. The SMMT on Tuesday said the ZEV mandate would cost the industry \u00a36bn this year in discounts and payments for \u201ccredits\u201d to hit the targets. The industry argues that discounts are unsustainable, although they benefit British car buyers. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe need an urgent review of the automotive market and the regulation intended to drive it. Not because we want to water down any commitments, but because delivery matters more than notional targets. The industry is hurting; profitability and viability are in jeopardy and jobs are on the line. When the world changes, so must we.\u201d The government is likely to stick firmly to its goal of phasing out new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030, and all hybrids by 2035, according to a person with knowledge of internal discussions. They said the government was also very likely to stick to headline targets mandating that sales of electric cars must account for 22% of new sales in 2024 for each manufacturer, rising to 28% next year and 80% by 2030, despite reports they could change. There are separate targets for vans. However, the government will consider changes to \u201cflexibilities\u201d that in effect allow carmakers to reduce the number of electric cars they need to sell. Those loopholes include the ability to \u201covercomply\u201d in later years to make up for a slow start in the coming two or three years, and lowering the average emissions of the fossil fuel cars they sell. The \u201cfast track\u201d consultation is expected to launch before Christmas, before reporting in the first few months in 2025 \u2013 faster than most policy consultations of that type. It is also expected to include details of which hybrid cars can continue to be sold after 2030. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see Stellantis investing in the future of its Ellesmere Port plant, we know this will be a concerning time for the families of employees at Luton who may be affected.",

As one of their most celebrated alumni might say: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cbssportsgolazo/video/7311867027306663210?lang=en\">Problem!</a></p> <p>Big problem? Not yet. Arsenal have seven points and sit 12th in the giant Champions League table; they will surely advance, but this game will help decide whether they do so via the playoffs, incurring more tricky away trips. As you might have heard, Sporting have lost manager Ruben Amorim, but they are still a free-scoring threat and have previous. The first of those eight Arsenal away games came in Lisbon, a 2-2 Europa League draw which led to defeat on penalties back at the Emirates.</p> <p>It may be high entertainment and relatively low stakes in Portugal, but <strong>Bayern Munich v PSG</strong> is a different story. The Parisians have been the weakest of Ligue 1\u2019s quartet so far and sit below the red line in 25th (!) place with tough games still to come. Bayern aren\u2019t faring much better, <em>that </em>opening 9-2 win over Dinamo Zagreb followed by back-to-back defeats, meaning the Croatian side are now above them in mid-table. Oh Vinnie!</p> <p>But wait, there\u2019s more. <strong>Barcelona</strong> host <strong>Brest</strong> in a top-six battle nobody expected, while <strong>Leverkusen</strong> look to rediscover their fizz against <strong>Red Bull Salzburg</strong>. Italian outfits <strong>Inter</strong> and <strong>Atalanta</strong> \u2013 playing to type by not conceding one goal between them so far \u2013 look to keep that going against pointless opponents <strong>RB Leipzig</strong> and <strong>Young Boys</strong>. Kick-off is 8pm in those games, but two early matches have already started. Eat my goal!</p> </div>   </div>",

Mikel Arteta\u2019s verdict: \u201cVery happy, it\u2019s a big result against a big opponent, they hadn\u2019t lost here in 18 months. Really good energy and belief before the game, a really positive and important win for us.\u201d Arteta adds that in the second half, \u201cthe atmosphere was changing \u2026 we showed a lot of personality, and when we scored the fourth goal, the game changed again. We adapted really well, and let\u2019s move on now.\u201d Barnsley 2-2 Reading Bristol Rovers 0-2 Blackpool Burton 0-1 Charlton Cambridge 1-1 Bolton Exeter 0-2 Birmingham Leyton Orient 0-2 Huddersfield Wigan 2-1 Northampton Wrexham 1-0 Lincoln Wycombe 1-0 Mansfield League Two results: Tranmere 0-2 Wimbledon, Walsall 2-2 Bromley. Here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s match report from Sunderland v West Brom. Burnley 2-0 Coventry Hull 0-2 Sheffield Wednesday Norwich 6-1 Plymouth Sheffield Utd 3-0 Oxford Stoke 0-0 Preston Sunderland 0-0 West Brom Watford 1-0 Bristol City Sheffield United\u2019s win takes them top as Sunderland are held by West Brom. Leeds can reclaim top spot if they beat Luton on Wednesday. Hull \u2013 who sacked Liam Rosenior for finishing in seventh last season \u2013 are mired in the bottom three. Here\u2019s Simon McMahon with a summary of some incredible late drama in Scotland. \u201cEvents at the Etihad rivalling those at Easter Road for late drama, where Hibs were 2\u20131 down to Aberdeen entering stoppage time, equalised in the 92nd minute, only for Aberdeen to immediately regain the lead, before Hibs equalised again. Finished 3-3. Football, eh?\u201d Inter are the new leaders, while Manchester City\u2019s collapse sees them drop from fifth place down to 15th. Arsenal are seventh, overtaking Sporting on goal difference. Barcelona 3-0 Brest Bayern Munich 1-0 PSG Inter 1-0 Leipzig Leverkusen 5-0 Salzburg Man City 3-3 Feyenoord Sporting 1-5 Arsenal Young Boys 1-6 Atalanta Early kick-offs Slovan Bratislava 2-3 Milan Sparta Prague 0-6 Atl\u00e9tico PSG win a couple of late corners and the keeper comes up \u2026 but Bayern hold on. They were made to work hard, but get the win thanks to Kim Min-jae\u2019s first-half header. Manchester City end their losing run \u2026 in the least impressive way possible. A hugely impressive display from Mikel Arteta\u2019s side, who raced into a three-goal half-time lead and responded when the hosts tried to apply some pressure. Lazar Samardzic strikes in injury time to complete a glorious night for Atalanta, 6-1 winners in Switzerland. Grealish has hit the bar as City seek a winner, and an escape from another deeply embarrassing performance. They were 3-0 up with 15 minutes to go \u2026 It\u2019s Champions League goal No 101 for Robert Lewandowski, who finishes smartly to wrap up victory for Barcelona. This is extraordinary! City have completely lost their heads. Ederson charges out of his goal and is beaten to the ball by Paixao, whose cross is nodded home by Hancko! Yikes: it\u2019s finished Norwich 6-1 Plymouth, while Sheffield United have beaten Oxford 3-0 and Wednesday have won 2-0 at Hull. City aside, both Bayern and Inter are holding on to one-goal leads. Can 10-man PSG, or winless RB Leipzig, hit back? Time is running out \u2026 Viktor Gyokeres hasn\u2019t had his best night, but almost gets on the scoresheet with a thumping effort that clangs off the crossbar. At the Etihad, De Bruyne\u2019s attempt at a settler is tipped behind by the keeper. Eek! City nerves are jangling as Lotomba\u2019s effort rebounds off the post, goes through Ederson and is chested into the empty net by Santiago Gimenez. It couldn\u2019t happen, could it? Leandro Trossard gets Arsenal\u2019s fifth! Merino is given too much space to shoot and his well-struck effort is spilled by the keeper, allowing the Belgian to finish on the rebound. Jamal Musiala has a chance to seal victory for Bayern, but his shot is pushed onto the post by Safonov. As it stands, though, PSG will be stuck on four points, with games against Salzburg (A), Man City (H) and Stuttgart (A) to come. City\u2019s defensive frailties return as a number of players fail to deal with a loose ball effectively, allowing Anis Hadj Moussa to go round Ederson and finish from a tight angle. The Europop is blaring in Leverkusen once agein, as Aleix Garcia finishes off a quick break to make it five. A fine save from David Raya to deny Hjulmand, whose low shot through a crowd of legs looked to be creeping in at the far post. Also being kept busy is Yann Sommer, twice denying RB Leipzig and preserving Inter\u2019s place at the top of the Champions League MegaTable. Job probably done for Barcelona, as Dani Olmo cuts in from the left and fires a shot through the keeper at the near post. Patrik Schick gets in on the act with a clinical finish, adding to Pep Lijnders\u2019 woes. Salzburg are sixth in the Austrian league at the minute, which I would imagine is not nearly acceptable. This is precisely what Arsenal needed, the pressure evaporating as Bukayo Saka finds the corner with his spot kick. It was awarded for a frankly terrible challenge on Odegaard by Diomande \u2013 thankfully, the Gunners captain seems to be fine. PSG embarrass themselves in Europe, part 1,057: with the ball at his feet in the Bayern area, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 contrives to lose possession and then kicks out at the nearest defender. Second yellow, and he\u2019s off. Sporting with plenty of possession, but Arsenal are staying organised and sitting deep, with Raya only called on to repel an ambitious shot from a tight angle. In the Championship, a tough night for Mr Coleen Rooney as Norwich lead Plymouth 4-1, Borja Sainz completing his hat-trick. Elsewhere, Watford lead Bristol City 1-0. It\u2019s men against Young Boys here, as Charles De Ketelaere continues a fine evening\u2019s work with his second goal, curled in from the edge of the area. \u201cBrest\u2019s Ludovic Ajorque is a fun player to watch,\u201d notes Kari Tulinius. \u201cAn absolute unit, taller than Haaland, but something about how he\u2019s built makes it seem that he\u2019s a normal sized player standing closer to the camera than the player marking him.\u201d Also, who doesn\u2019t love a bald No 9? Big Jan Koller vibes, although nobody ever mistook him for a normal-sized man. City starting to enjoy themselves, as Erling Haaland slides in to convert Matheus Nunes\u2019 cross. Is he back? Are they back? Bad news for Celtic\u2019s title party planners, currently mulling a Black Friday champagne deal: Aberdeen have levelled at Easter Road, Jamie McGrath with the goal. Breathing space for City, as Ilkay Gundogan\u2019s volley from a half-cleared corner is deflected into the net off Hancko\u2019s heel. Oof! Sporting make a dent in the Arsenal lead, and it\u2019s a soft goal from the visitors\u2019 perspective, with Goncalo Inacio free to head home a corner at the near post. Game on? We\u2019re back and already, there are goals \u2026 Good news for Celtic\u2019s title party planners: Aberdeen are a goal down at Hibernian. Joe Newell scored the opener just before half time; the second half has just kicked off. What\u2019s afoot in the Championship? Well, goals have been in short supply \u2013 Stoke v Preston, Watford v Bristol City and Sunderland v West Brom are all goalless \u2013 but Burnley have just taken the lead over Coventry, Jeremy Sarmiento on target. Elsewhere, Norwich lead Plymouth 2-1, Sheffield United are 2-0 up on Oxford and Sheffield Wednesday lead at Hull thanks to a Josh Windass penalty. Barcelona 1-0 Brest Bayern Munich 1-0 PSG Inter 1-0 Leipzig Leverkusen 3-0 Salzburg Man City 1-0 Feyenoord Sporting 0-3 Arsenal Young Boys 1-4 Atalanta Early kick-off results Slovan Bratislava 2-3 Milan Sparta Prague 0-6 Atl\u00e9tico Bayern finish the half on top, Joshua Kimmich going close. They take a deserved lead into the break after a lively first half, thanks to Kim Min-jae\u2019s header from a corner. An exceptional first-half display from Arsenal, who are making very light work of a tough-looking game. Martinelli, Havertz and Gabriel all on target, and the job is almost done. If I tell you this goal was scored by Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, can you picture it? It\u2019s that, basically. Declan Rice swings in a perfect corner, which is headed home by the onrushing centre-back. He celebrates with what looks like a play on Gyokeres\u2019 celebration, covering his eyes with his hands. City take the lead at the end of a frustrating first half, with Erling Haaland smashing home the spot-kick after a long old VAR check. More on that here: A second goal for Retegui, smashed into the bottom corner with interest. Starting to regret committing to covering every goal in this game, if I\u2019m honest. And it\u2019s 1-0 to Bayern, although not the scorer anyone expected. After backup keeper Safonov flaps at a corner, the ball rebounds to Kim Min-jae, who heads empathically home! The away fans are making most of the noise in Barcelona \u2013 Brest have brought 5,000-odd supporters with them, while a large section of Bar\u00e7a ultras are not present tonight after a dispute over a fine for offensive chants last season. Still 1-0 there \u2026 PSG are growing into the game, with Barcola and Dembele causing some problems. When do you think Harry Kane\u2019s going to score the opener? I\u2019ll say 56 minutes. Arsenal almost get in again down the right side, but the cross is poked away from danger with Saka lurking. At the Etihad, Feyenoord are starting to make some forays forward after keeping City\u2019s attackers at arm\u2019s length. Who\u2019s that galloping in on goal like a thoroughbred racehorse? Why, it\u2019s Sead Kolasinac, played clean through by De Ketelaere. He takes a touch and picks his spot, slotting the ball into the bottom corner. Wirtz gets his fifth goal in the Champions League this season, and it\u2019s a beauty, as he picks up the ball wide of goal, cuts past two defenders and rolls it into the far corner. Atalanta retake the lead as Young Boys keeper David von Ballmoos makes a right Ballmoos of Charles De Ketelaere\u2019s snap shot, letting the ball squirm in under his body. Inter take the lead, Federico Dimarco\u2019s wicked, curling delivery deflecting in off Castello Lukeba for an own goal. Well then. It\u2019s all going to plan for Arsenal, who unpick Sporting\u2019s defence again here. Partey\u2019s lofted ball finds Saka, who nicks it past keeper Franco Israel, allowing Kai Havertz to tap into an empty net. Not the best from the Sporting stopper, who was also a bit tentative for the opening goal. Arsenal have had to absorb a bit of pressure since going ahead, but they get upfield again here and Partey sends a low shot into the keeper\u2019s arms \u2026 After that flurry, a moment of calm \u2013 although Bayern are knocking, San\u00e9\u2019s shot saved at the near post by Safonov, starting ahead of Donnarumma tonight. At the Etihad, City keep pouring forward but without much coherence or conviction just yet. Atalanta hot-shot Mateo Retegui firesthe visitors in front, but before I can type that out, Silvere Ganvoula smashes in a leveller! That\u2019s the first goal Atalanta have conceded in the Champions League this season. Double trouble for Salzburg, as Alejandro Grimaldo scores a lovely free kick to put Leverkusen in control. Robert Lewandowski gets absolutely clattered by the Brest keeper, earning a penalty, which he converts with consummate ease. With that goal, he joins Ronaldo and Messi in the Champions League\u2019s exclusive 100 club. Florian Wirtz buries the spot kick, and there\u2019s another penalty coming up elsewhere \u2026 Now we have a goal \u2013 and it\u2019s gone to Arsenal! A neat passing move sees Rice pick out Timber on the right, and his low cross is prodded home by Martinelli at the far post. Arsenal on the front foot early against a compact-looking Sporting defence. No goals anywhere in Europe, although Leverkusen have a penalty, awarded on VAR review after one of those ricochet handballs \u2026 At the Camp Nou Montjuic, Ajorque puts a half-decent chance for Brest wide early on. At the Etihad, Gundogan sees his mid-range shot deflected behind. We\u2019re under way in Barcelona, Bern, Leverkusen, Lisbon, Milan, Manchester and Munich, where Bayern v PSG kicked off a couple of minutes late. It\u2019s dangerously close to go time in the seven 8pm Champions League kick-offs. In the Championship, Norwich lead Plymouth and Sheffield United are a goal up at home to Oxford. \u201cThat Arsenal team looking very strong,\u201d writes Bill Hargreaves. \u201cThe likes of Nwaneri, Jesus and Sterling on the bench. Could see them doing well this evening and in this competition.\u201d Charles Antaki says: \u201cThat looks a very good Arsenal team. Declan Rice reinstated, and of course the silky schemer Martin \u00d8degaard back and on top form. Of course that inevitably means, for the ever-anxious Arsenal fan, coming home with their tails between their legs. So, a draw.\u201d \u201cIs the Ibrahimovic on the bench for Bayern related to Zlatan?\u201d asks Mike Jakeman. Sadly not \u2013 but Arijon Ibrahimovic could become a star in his own right. The attacking midfielder is one of Bayern\u2019s brightest youth prospects, and is trying to win a place in Vincent Kompany\u2019s squad after recent injury. It\u2019s finished Slovan Bratislava 2-3 Milan, the Slovak side staying bottom of the pile with no points from five games. They gave it a good go here, though \u2013 unlike Sparta Prague, who have been gubbed 6-0 by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Those results mean Atl\u00e9tico and Milan sit ninth and 10th respectively, breathing down Aston Villa\u2019s necks in the battle for the top eight. There are also seven Championship games this evening, plus a bumper League One line-up, and Hibs v Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership. I will endeavour to keep you updated, but our live feed is also at your service. Milan are taking care of business in Bratislava, with Rafael Le\u00e3o putting them 2-1 up before Tammy Abraham pounced on a woeful backpass to make it three. Up the road in Prague, it\u2019s Sparta 0-4 Atl\u00e9tico, \u00c1lvarez (again) and Griezmann adding the second-half goals.

A notable name on the Atl\u00e9tico scoresheet: J\u00falian \u00c1lvarez, who left Manchester City in the summer but has had a slow start to life in Madrid. He\u2019s certainly been missed by Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, who are bidding to end a run of five (!) straight defeats at home to Feyenoord: It\u2019s half-time in the 5.45pm (GMT) kick-offs, taking place in Czechia and Slovakia. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid lead Sparta Prague 2-0, while Slovan Bratislava are holding Milan to a 1-1 draw. Arsenal\u2019s last eight away games in Europe have produced one win, three draws and four defeats; in their last four trips to the continent, they haven\u2019t scored a single goal. As one of their most celebrated alumni might say: Problem! Big problem? Not yet. Arsenal have seven points and sit 12th in the giant Champions League table; they will surely advance, but this game will help decide whether they do so via the playoffs, incurring more tricky away trips. As you might have heard, Sporting have lost manager Ruben Amorim, but they are still a free-scoring threat and have previous. The first of those eight Arsenal away games came in Lisbon, a 2-2 Europa League draw which led to defeat on penalties back at the Emirates. It may be high entertainment and relatively low stakes in Portugal, but Bayern Munich v PSG is a different story. The Parisians have been the weakest of Ligue 1\u2019s quartet so far and sit below the red line in 25th (!) place with tough games still to come. Bayern aren\u2019t faring much better, that opening 9-2 win over Dinamo Zagreb followed by back-to-back defeats, meaning the Croatian side are now above them in mid-table. Oh Vinnie! But wait, there\u2019s more. Barcelona host Brest in a top-six battle nobody expected, while Leverkusen look to rediscover their fizz against Red Bull Salzburg. Italian outfits Inter and Atalanta \u2013 playing to type by not conceding one goal between them so far \u2013 look to keep that going against pointless opponents RB Leipzig and Young Boys. Kick-off is 8pm in those games, but two early matches have already started. Eat my goal!",

James McGovern, a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts, and Thomas Massie, a libertarian Republican from Kentucky, wrote to the president with the bipartisan request to pardon the Australian publisher earlier in November. The pair urged Biden to \u201csend a clear message that the US government under your leadership will not target or investigate journalists and media outlets simply for doing their jobs\u201d. Assange was freed in June 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US espionage law, in a deal that allowed him to return home to Australia and brought an end to an extraordinary 14-year legal saga.

But they remain a listing ship that can go down at any moment. \u201cFragile\u201d was Pep Guardiola\u2019s summation of his team\u2019s state, and a clue to the manager\u2019s own mood was the cut to his nose that he stated was&nbsp;self\u2011inflicted, by a finger, due to the \u00adcontest\u2019s travails.</p> \n<p>City were 3-0 up after 75 minutes but a late horror show ceded the advantage as Feyenoord preyed on home nerves via Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gim\u00e9nez and David Hancko, who drew \u00adFeyenoord level to secure a well-fought point.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-fragile-liverpool-feyenoord\">Pep Guardiola worried by mentally \u2018fragile\u2019 City as trip to Liverpool looms</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After five consecutive defeats, on the cards was a canter of a victory that&nbsp;would have made Guardiola and his players feel far brighter before the champions\u2019 next challenge: the game at Liverpool on Sunday. After the shaky finish, however, the trip to Arne Slot\u2019s leaders is the last one City would want.</p> \n<p>Feyenoord, who arrived as the Eredivisie\u2019s fourth-placed side, appeared beaten by two Erling Haaland goals and one from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. The second and third goals came shortly after&nbsp;the interval as Guardiola discarded the narrow 4-3-3 that proved toothless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">against Ange Postecoglu\u2019s Tottenham</a> on Satur\u00adday for a 4-2-3-1 that, in the opening 45 minutes, still allowed gaps and was profligate.</p> \n<p>The bigger picture, here, is that Rodri remains badly missed \u2013 for his steady head and cool control. Hadj&nbsp;Moussa\u2019s and Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s 75th\u2011 and 82nd-minute strikes each came because of Josko Gvardiol losing his calm and playing sloppy passes, while \u00adEderson was at fault for rushing out for the visitors\u2019 equaliser.</p> \n<p>City are 15th, with eight points and nine to play for, so finishing in the top-eight berth that takes a side straight into the last 16 is no gimme, particularly as Juventus and Paris Saint-\u00adGermain are two of their final three foes, Club Brugge the other. City conceded at least twice for a sixth successive game for the first time since 1963. Guardiola was calm afterwards, while acknowledging none of Feyenoord\u2019s \u201cthree episodes\u201d should have been allowed.</p> \n<p>City began as relaxed as they ended haunted, Haaland and Phil Foden sharing a joke before kick-off then taking part in a fluid move: the \u00adlatter crossed, the ball was turned back by Manuel Akanji, and the Norwegian headed but Timon Wellenreuther saved with a frantic dive low to the right.</p> \n<p>Wellenreuther was then at fault. A misdirected pass was mopped up by City and suddenly a Jack \u00adGrealish volley rocketed goalwards before Foden\u2019s back deflected it away.</p> \n<p>But now we saw the clumsiness that has troubled Guardiola\u2019s side as a sluggish G\u00fcndogan was robbed, City turned, and \u00adGvardiol\u2019s muscle was required to stymie \u00adFeyenoord along the right.</p> \n<p>Cutting edge is another element City have lacked and while Foden\u2019s pivot-and-shot made Wellenreuther save it was an emblem of this. Another issue has been the midfield gaps and the way Feyenoord punched down the left was one of many examples, causing the ever-more frustrated Guardiola to direct his ire at Bernardo Silva for not patrolling his flank.</p> \n<p>City\u2019s famed press malfunctioned, too. Brian Priske\u2019s men stroked possession about in the manner their hosts wanted to. Feyenoord kept slipping through \u2013 as when the ball went tap-tap-tap-tap forward, and Igor Paix\u00e3o hit the ball straight to Ederson.</p> \n<p>Defending, City looked like a goal \u00adwaiting to happen. Attack was far easier: a swashbuckling Foden surge that \u00adculminated in a blocked attempt took his team to the end in which they wanted to operate. After a Hwang In-beom rocket was repelled, City moved upfield again. But the same lack of precision meant Haaland hit a leg instead of kissing the back of Wellenreuther\u2019s net.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/champions-league-bayern-munich-psg-inter-leipzig-barcelona-brest\">Champions League roundup: Bayern\u2019s Kim Min-jae leaves PSG in trouble</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But then a break. Quinten Timber caught Haaland and Radu Petrescu pointed to the spot. Feyenoord\u2019s captain lost the argument with the referee and, after a delay, Haaland rammed the penalty into the bottom right corner, the relief among City enthusiasts tangible.</p> \n<p>Could City grow from here and swagger through the second half before the weekend test?

      "bodyText": "Manchester City\u2019s losing sequence is over \u2013 just. But they remain a listing ship that can go down at any moment. \u201cFragile\u201d was Pep Guardiola\u2019s summation of his team\u2019s state, and a clue to the manager\u2019s own mood was the cut to his nose that he stated was self\u2011inflicted, by a finger, due to the contest\u2019s travails. City were 3-0 up after 75 minutes but a late horror show ceded the advantage as Feyenoord preyed on home nerves via Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gim\u00e9nez and David Hancko, who drew Feyenoord level to secure a well-fought point. After five consecutive defeats, on the cards was a canter of a victory that would have made Guardiola and his players feel far brighter before the champions\u2019 next challenge: the game at Liverpool on Sunday. After the shaky finish, however, the trip to Arne Slot\u2019s leaders is the last one City would want. Feyenoord, who arrived as the Eredivisie\u2019s fourth-placed side, appeared beaten by two Erling Haaland goals and one from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. The second and third goals came shortly after the interval as Guardiola discarded the narrow 4-3-3 that proved toothless against Ange Postecoglu\u2019s Tottenham on Saturday for a 4-2-3-1 that, in the opening 45 minutes, still allowed gaps and was profligate. The bigger picture, here, is that Rodri remains badly missed \u2013 for his steady head and cool control. Hadj Moussa\u2019s and Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s 75th\u2011 and 82nd-minute strikes each came because of Josko Gvardiol losing his calm and playing sloppy passes, while Ederson was at fault for rushing out for the visitors\u2019 equaliser. City are 15th, with eight points and nine to play for, so finishing in the top-eight berth that takes a side straight into the last 16 is no gimme, particularly as Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are two of their final three foes, Club Brugge the other. City conceded at least twice for a sixth successive game for the first time since 1963. Guardiola was calm afterwards, while acknowledging none of Feyenoord\u2019s \u201cthree episodes\u201d should have been allowed. City began as relaxed as they ended haunted, Haaland and Phil Foden sharing a joke before kick-off then taking part in a fluid move: the latter crossed, the ball was turned back by Manuel Akanji, and the Norwegian headed but Timon Wellenreuther saved with a frantic dive low to the right. Wellenreuther was then at fault. A misdirected pass was mopped up by City and suddenly a Jack Grealish volley rocketed goalwards before Foden\u2019s back deflected it away. But now we saw the clumsiness that has troubled Guardiola\u2019s side as a sluggish G\u00fcndogan was robbed, City turned, and Gvardiol\u2019s muscle was required to stymie Feyenoord along the right. Cutting edge is another element City have lacked and while Foden\u2019s pivot-and-shot made Wellenreuther save it was an emblem of this. Another issue has been the midfield gaps and the way Feyenoord punched down the left was one of many examples, causing the ever-more frustrated Guardiola to direct his ire at Bernardo Silva for not patrolling his flank. City\u2019s famed press malfunctioned, too. Brian Priske\u2019s men stroked possession about in the manner their hosts wanted to. Feyenoord kept slipping through \u2013 as when the ball went tap-tap-tap-tap forward, and Igor Paix\u00e3o hit the ball straight to Ederson. Defending, City looked like a goal waiting to happen. Attack was far easier: a swashbuckling Foden surge that culminated in a blocked attempt took his team to the end in which they wanted to operate. After a Hwang In-beom rocket was repelled, City moved upfield again. But the same lack of precision meant Haaland hit a leg instead of kissing the back of Wellenreuther\u2019s net. But then a break. Quinten Timber caught Haaland and Radu Petrescu pointed to the spot. Feyenoord\u2019s captain lost the argument with the referee and, after a delay, Haaland rammed the penalty into the bottom right corner, the relief among City enthusiasts tangible. Could City grow from here and swagger through the second half before the weekend test? The answer was yes \u2013 up to 75 minutes. Gvardiol zipped the ball to Haaland at the fast pace required but the No 9 turned into traffic. Matheus Nunes, more direct, shot; a corner was claimed, and City were about to score a second for the first time since blasting Sparta Prague 5-0 here on 23 October. The ball was flighted in from the right quadrant, it popped out to G\u00fcndogan, and his left-foot volley pinged into the net off Hancko, wrongfooting Wellenreuther, and those wearing blue breathed calmer. City moved on to easy street seconds later via the kind of back-to-front foray that had seemed extinct recently. Akanji fed G\u00fcndogan whose pirouette presaged a pass to the marauding Nunes down the right. He skated forward and skimmed over a cross that had Haaland, ever the arch predator, sliding home for 3-0. Guardiola, as he likes to, pointed a celebration towards the posh seats in the gods behind him, and his players cruised. Grealish, Gvardiol and Foden all went close. City approached their usual imperiousness, so when Akanji sprayed the ball straight to Hancko he was relieved the Feyenoord defender steered wide.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s team announced on Tuesday it had signed an agreement to start the complex process of transferring control of the federal government to themselves, although the details of the plan suggested some breaks with standard practice. The incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the team would now be sending in \u201clanding teams\u201d into the various departments and agencies as it prepares to take over the bureaucracy of the executive branch. \u201cAfter completing the selection process of his incoming cabinet, president-elect Trump is entering the next phase of his administration\u2019s transition,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThis engagement allows our intended cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations.\u201d But the agreement with the Biden administration, known as a memorandum of understanding, appeared to be a pared-down version of what is normally signed by presidential transitions with caveats that indicated a departure from usual restrictions. The signing of the memo normally unlocks up to $7.2m in government funding to help staffing costs and other expenses, as well as the use of government office space through the nonpartisan General Services Administration. The financial assistance comes with strings attached \u2013 the transition team has to agree to disclose its donors and impose a $5,000 limit on contributions \u2013 and the agreement was supposed to be signed months before the election. The transition team is normally supposed to sign an ethics agreement, which paves the way for transition aides to start receiving government information such as classified briefings and the granting of security clearances. The announcement by Wiles in a press release suggested that the Trump team had negotiated its own language around some of those restrictions. While the Trump team was committed to making the identities of its donors public, and would not accept any foreign contributions, Wiles said that it would not be using any government money and its entire operation would be privately funded. Government ethics experts have previously noted that such an arrangement would allow people seeking to curry favor with the Trump White House to donate directly to him, raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Wiles also said that the Trump team had its own ethics plan, rather than the formal government one, leaving unclear whether all relevant transition aides would be eligible to receive full government briefings that included classified information. That caveat on the ethics plan dovetailed with reporting by the Guardian that the Trump team is planning for political appointees to receive temporary security clearances on the first day and only face FBI background checks after it had taken over the bureau. Trump\u2019s lack of interest in engaging with the formal transition stems from the first Trump administration, when officials turned over transition team records to the Russia investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump has previously broken convention with the transfer of power. In 2016, his campaign organized what appeared to be a standard process, until Trump fired his transition team\u2019s leadership after he won the election and cut off communications with the Obama administration. In 2020, Trump again seemed to follow standard procedure until immediately after the election, pressuring the General Services Administration to not recognize Joe Biden\u2019s election win so his team could not access the federal financial assistance.",

This time the rewards were bountiful and, when it was put to Mikel Arteta that it was the best display on foreign soil of his tenure the answer was unequivocal. \u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially against the opponent we played in their home. They\u2019ve been in top form, they\u2019ve been better than everyone they\u2019ve played here.

It has become a truism that \u00adMartin \u00d8degaard\u2019s prompting raises the levels of everyone around him but he was magnificent here, picking holes through Sporting for fun and setting a relentless tone in waving his teammates forward when play restarted following Gabriel Martinelli\u2019s opener.</p> \n<p>\u00d8degaard had, naturally, been involved in the move for that goal although it owed most to a gorgeously curved low cross from Jurri\u00ebn Timber. Kai Havertz was unable to reach the ball but Martinelli, hovering behind him, could not miss and \u00adArsenal\u2019s early intent had been rewarded. Sporting were grievously open, the left side of their defence a clear weakness, and it never appeared likely that the damage to their pre-match \u00adbuoyancy would be limited.</p> \n<p>They were exposed again in the 22nd minute by a clipped pass over the top from Thomas Partey that sent Bukayo Saka haring beyond Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo. When Israel came out to meet him, Saka showed presence of mind to nudge the ball left and let Havertz reap the benefits.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were so effective and efficient when we started to attack the opposition goal,\u201d Arteta said. They had been threatening a third when, after a rare moment of Sporting cohesion led to Raya tipping over from \u00adGeovany Quenda, a deep left-sided corner from Declan Rice was met by the leaping Gabriel and the outcome was in effect settled.</p> \n<p>The danger for Arsenal, as Arteta acknowledged, tends to come when they try to manage a game rather than keep their foot on the gas. \u201cWe\u2019re not very good at that,\u201d he admitted. Almost immediately after the break In\u00e1cio escaped Riccardo Calafiori and met a corner at the near post, volleying past Raya. Sporting had seen City off at a similar time of the game and, for a while, their followers audibly sensed a similar level of heroism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/26/champions-league-bayern-munich-psg-inter-leipzig-barcelona-brest\">Champions League roundup: Bayern\u2019s Kim Min-jae leaves PSG in trouble</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Arsenal were rocking when \u00ad\u00d8degaard, yet again seizing the initiative, passed through In\u00e1cio as if the defender were a hologram. Ousmane Diomande clipped him from behind as he fed Saka; it was idiotic work from Sporting and a simple call for the referee, Szymon Marciniak, to award a penalty. Saka put it away and Arteta\u2019s players could enjoy themselves once again.</p> \n<p>Trossard added gloss when nodding in after Israel had parried from another substitute, Mikel Merino. There was a late runout for Ethan Nwaneri in the closing stages and no final say for Sporting, although Viktor Gy\u00f6keres rattled the woodwork towards the end. While the vaunted Swede had perked up during his side\u2019s recovery, his headline piece of work until then had been a wild free-kick from inside the D; Gabriel and William Saliba, who was making his 100th appearance for Arsenal, handled his \u00adrumbustious form expertly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The only real blot was a late injury to Gabriel, who appeared to have aggravated a hamstring. \u201cHe was feeling some discomfort,\u201d Arteta said.</p> \n<p>But the manager\u2019s ease with every\u00adthing else he had seen was clear.

They were exposed again in the 22nd minute by a clipped pass over the top from Thomas Partey that sent Bukayo Saka haring beyond Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo. When Israel came out to meet him, Saka showed presence of mind to nudge the ball left and let Havertz reap the benefits. \u201cWe were so effective and efficient when we started to attack the opposition goal,\u201d Arteta said. They had been threatening a third when, after a rare moment of Sporting cohesion led to Raya tipping over from Geovany Quenda, a deep left-sided corner from Declan Rice was met by the leaping Gabriel and the outcome was in effect settled. The danger for Arsenal, as Arteta acknowledged, tends to come when they try to manage a game rather than keep their foot on the gas. \u201cWe\u2019re not very good at that,\u201d he admitted. Almost immediately after the break In\u00e1cio escaped Riccardo Calafiori and met a corner at the near post, volleying past Raya. Sporting had seen City off at a similar time of the game and, for a while, their followers audibly sensed a similar level of heroism. Arsenal were rocking when \u00d8degaard, yet again seizing the initiative, passed through In\u00e1cio as if the defender were a hologram. Ousmane Diomande clipped him from behind as he fed Saka; it was idiotic work from Sporting and a simple call for the referee, Szymon Marciniak, to award a penalty. Saka put it away and Arteta\u2019s players could enjoy themselves once again. Trossard added gloss when nodding in after Israel had parried from another substitute, Mikel Merino. There was a late runout for Ethan Nwaneri in the closing stages and no final say for Sporting, although Viktor Gy\u00f6keres rattled the woodwork towards the end. While the vaunted Swede had perked up during his side\u2019s recovery, his headline piece of work until then had been a wild free-kick from inside the D; Gabriel and William Saliba, who was making his 100th appearance for Arsenal, handled his rumbustious form expertly. The only real blot was a late injury to Gabriel, who appeared to have aggravated a hamstring. \u201cHe was feeling some discomfort,\u201d Arteta said. But the manager\u2019s ease with everything else he had seen was clear. He had maintained that Arsenal\u2019s showing in their narrow defeat at Inter was a pointer to better things and that view was borne out spectacularly here. \u201cI knew that in that pathway good things were going to happen in Europe,\u201d he said. The enticing question, now, is how far that can take them.",

What would the world do?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>However, the federal police report claimed: \u201cThe evidence obtained over the course of the investigation shows unequivocally that the then president Jair Messias Bolsonaro planned, took action and had direct and effective control of the executory acts carried out by the criminal organization that sought to execute a military coup and dismantle the rule of law, something that did not occur as a result of circumstances beyond his control.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gen Braga Netto last week denied a coup plot had been afoot, calling such claims \u201cfanciful and absurd\u201d. Gen Heleno has yet to comment on the police claims but last year publicly denied being involved in preparations for a coup.</p> \n<p>Gen Nogueira de Oliveira and Adm Almir Garnier Santos have yet to publicly comment on the claims.</p> \n<p>The police report indicates that schemers close to Bolsonaro had put in place contingency plans in case the alleged coup attempt failed. A laptop seized from Lt Col Mauro Cid, who was Bolsonaro\u2019s aide-de-camp during his 2019-23 presidency, allegedly contained a PowerPoint presentation with details of a military-style escape plan for Bolsonaro \u201cin case the attempted coup was thwarted\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan involves the use of weapons to ensure the ex-president\u2019s escape,\u201d the report adds of the alleged \u201cexfiltration\u201d plan.</p> \n<p>The police inquiry also contains shocking details of how close plotters may have come to abducting or assassinating the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes.</p> \n<p>On 15 December, as plotters unsuccessfully pushed for Bolsonaro to sign the decree authorizing a military intervention, the report claims that at least six members of a pro-Bolsonaro cell \u201cpositioned themselves in strategic points near the minister\u2019s official residence and the supreme court to carry out the action\u201d. However, at the last minute the \u201cclandestine\u201d mission to \u201cneutralize\u201d Moraes was aborted, police said, partly because of the army chief\u2019s refusal to support the conspiracy.</p> \n<p>Police said they had also discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/jair-bolsonaro-charged-coup-plot\">plans to murder Lula and his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin</a>, in Lula\u2019s case with poison or toxic chemicals.

      "bodyText": "Brazil came within a whisker of a far-right military coup and the assassination of a supreme court judge just days before President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva took power in January 2023, a federal police report has claimed. The report about the alleged plot to help the rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro cling to power was made public on Tuesday, and paints a chilling portrait of how close one of the world\u2019s largest democracies came to being plunged back into authoritarian rule. The 884-page document describes a complex, three-year conspiracy that investigators believe was designed to pave the way for a military power grab by using social media to disseminate false claims of electoral fraud that plotters hoped would justify such an intervention in the public eye. Police claim that plot was supposed to reach \u201cits zenith\u201d on 15 December 2022 \u2013 a fortnight before Lula was due to be sworn in after narrowly beating Bolsonaro in October\u2019s presidential election. Conspirators, including several senior military figures, allegedly hoped that on that day Bolsonaro would sign a \u201ccoup decree\u201d which would in effect allow a military takeover. On 16 December 2022, \u201cafter the consummation of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d, the report claims two close Bolsonaro allies \u2013 the former defence minister Gen Walter Braga Netto and the former minister of institutional security Gen Augusto Heleno \u2013 were to be placed in charge of a \u201ccrisis management\u201d cabinet. The federal police report \u2013 which the Guardian has reviewed \u2013 claims the only reason Bolsonaro did not sign that decree blocking the transfer of power was because the plotters had failed to secure sufficient support from Brazil\u2019s military top brass. \u201cThe evidence [gathered] \u2026 shows that the commander of the navy, Adm Almir Garnier [Santos], and the defence minister, [Gen] Paulo S\u00e9rgio [Nogueira de Oliveira], adhered to the coup attempt. However, the [army] commander [Marco Ant\u00f4nio] Freire Gomes and [Carlos de Almeida] Baptista J\u00fanior of the air force positioned themselves against any kind of measure that would cause an institutional rupture in the country,\u201d the report alleges. Federal police said the only thing that prevented the coup attempt taking place was \u201cthe unequivocal stance\u201d of Freire Gomes, Baptista Junior and the majority of the army high command. It claimed those people \u201cremained faithful to the values that govern the democratic rule of law state and did not cave in to coup-mongering pressure\u201d. Bolsonaro was last week formally accused of being one of 37 people involved in criminal conspiracy designed to obliterate Brazil\u2019s democratic system through a rightwing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. He denied those accusations on Tuesday, calling them madness. \u201cI never discussed a coup with anyone,\u201d he told reporters in the capital, Bras\u00edlia. \u201cIf someone had come and talked to me about a coup, I would have asked them: \u2018What about the day after? What would the world do?\u2019\u201d However, the federal police report claimed: \u201cThe evidence obtained over the course of the investigation shows unequivocally that the then president Jair Messias Bolsonaro planned, took action and had direct and effective control of the executory acts carried out by the criminal organization that sought to execute a military coup and dismantle the rule of law, something that did not occur as a result of circumstances beyond his control.\u201d Gen Braga Netto last week denied a coup plot had been afoot, calling such claims \u201cfanciful and absurd\u201d. Gen Heleno has yet to comment on the police claims but last year publicly denied being involved in preparations for a coup. Gen Nogueira de Oliveira and Adm Almir Garnier Santos have yet to publicly comment on the claims. The police report indicates that schemers close to Bolsonaro had put in place contingency plans in case the alleged coup attempt failed. A laptop seized from Lt Col Mauro Cid, who was Bolsonaro\u2019s aide-de-camp during his 2019-23 presidency, allegedly contained a PowerPoint presentation with details of a military-style escape plan for Bolsonaro \u201cin case the attempted coup was thwarted\u201d. \u201cThe plan involves the use of weapons to ensure the ex-president\u2019s escape,\u201d the report adds of the alleged \u201cexfiltration\u201d plan. The police inquiry also contains shocking details of how close plotters may have come to abducting or assassinating the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes. On 15 December, as plotters unsuccessfully pushed for Bolsonaro to sign the decree authorizing a military intervention, the report claims that at least six members of a pro-Bolsonaro cell \u201cpositioned themselves in strategic points near the minister\u2019s official residence and the supreme court to carry out the action\u201d. However, at the last minute the \u201cclandestine\u201d mission to \u201cneutralize\u201d Moraes was aborted, police said, partly because of the army chief\u2019s refusal to support the conspiracy. Police said they had also discovered plans to murder Lula and his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, in Lula\u2019s case with poison or toxic chemicals. The report claimed Bolsonaro had \u201cfull knowledge\u201d of the \u201coperational planning\u201d for such criminal acts. This week\u2019s revelations have horrified and shocked many citizens in a country which only emerged from 21 years of military dictatorship in 1985. Several of those accused of being part of the 2022 pro-Bolsonaro coup plot were part of that 1964-85 regime. During the 1970s, Gen Heleno was an aide to Gen Sylvio Frota, a notoriously hardline member of the military regime who was involved in the 1964 coup that overthrew Brazil\u2019s leftwing president Jo\u00e3o Goulart. \u201cHow safe is our democracy?\u201d asked the headline of an opinion article in one of Brazil\u2019s largest newspapers, the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, on Tuesday evening.",

The best-of-14-games match is scheduled to take place from 23 November to 15 December at Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore for an overall prize fund of $2.5m (\u00a31.98m).</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ding became China's first men\u2019s world chess champion by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi last year in Kazakhstan, winning the title vacated by longtime world No 1 Magnus Carlsen of Norway. But the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title while battling personal difficulties including depression and will go off as an underdog in his first world title defense.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gukesh, commonly known as Gukesh D, stunned the chess establishment by winning the eight-man Candidates tournament in Toronto aged 17 to become the youngest ever challenger for the world championship, finishing top of a stacked field that included Nepomniachtchi, Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana. The 18-year-old can shatter the record for youngest ever world champion held by Garry Kasparov, who was 22 when he dethroned Karpov in their 1985 rematch in Moscow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The format</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The match will consist of 14 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The time control for each game in the classical portion is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, then 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the score is equal after 14 games, tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played:</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;A match consisting of four rapid games with 15 minutes per side and a 10-second increment starting with move 1 would be played. If a player scores 2\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is still equal, a mini-match of two rapid games would be played, with 10 minutes per side and a five-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the score is equal after the rapid portion, a mini-match of two blitz games would be played, with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1. If a player scored 1\u00bd points or more, he would win the championship. A drawing of lots would take place before each mini-match to decide which player plays with the white pieces.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022&nbsp;If the blitz mini-match are tied, a single blitz game with a time control of three minutes per side and a two-second increment starting with move 1 would be played, and the winner would win the championship. A drawing of lots would decide which player plays with the white pieces. If this game was drawn, another blitz game with reversed colors would be played with the same time control, and the winner would win the championship. This process is repeated until either player wins a game.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Players are not allowed to agree to a draw before black's 40th move. A draw claim before then is only permitted if a threefold repetition or stalemate has occurred.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The schedule</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Sat 23 Nov</b> Opening ceremony and technical meeting</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 24 Nov</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 25 Nov</b> Game 1</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 26 Nov</b> Game 2</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 27 Nov</b> Game 3</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 28 Nov</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 29 Nov</b> Game 4</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 30 Nov</b> Game 5</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 1 Dec</b> Game 6</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 2 Dec</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 3 Dec</b> Game 7</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 4 Dec</b> Game 8</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 5 Dec</b> Game 9</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 6 Dec</b> Rest day</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 7 Dec</b> Game 10</p>\n    <p><b>Sun 8 Dec</b> Game 11</p>\n    <p><b>Mon 9 Dec</b> Game 12</p>\n    <p><b>Tue 10 Dec</b> Rest Day</p>\n    <p><b>Wed 11 Dec</b> Game 13</p>\n    <p><b>Thu 12 Dec</b> Game 14</p>\n    <p><b>Fri 13 Dec</b> Tiebreaks (if necessary)</p>\n    <p><b>Sat 14 Dec</b> Closing ceremony</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>All games start at 5pm local time, 2.30pm in India, 9am in London, 4am in New York.</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ding was similarly content with the outcome, suggesting he had felt out of sorts. \u201cI was feeling a little up and down,\u201d he said. \u201cI was slightly worse in the middle game.

The area resembled a fortress of barriers, shipping containers and police personnel in riot gear.</p> \n<p>The protesters were led by Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, who was recently released from prison, and Khan\u2019s key aide, Ali Amin Gandapur, who is the chief minister of the PTI stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Tens of thousands more were expected to join from neighbouring Punjab and Rawalpindi.</p> \n<p>As the protesters approached Islamabad\u2019s D-Chowk, a roundabout in the heart of the red zone, the area resembled a battleground as police and paramilitary officers rained down rubber bullets and teargas on the crowds. By the afternoon, security personnel had succeeded in pushing back the crowds from D-Chowk but protesters refused to vacate the city and continued to violently push back against the riot police.</p> \n<p>PTI\u2019s main demand for the protest is for Khan to be released, alleging that the former prime minister is being held as a political prisoner and that the hundreds of charges against him are trumped up by his political opponents.</p> \n<p>Voted out of power by parliament in 2022 after he fell out with Pakistan\u2019s powerful military, Khan faces charges ranging from corruption to instigation of violence, all of which he and his party deny.</p> \n<p>Among those who reached D-Chowk was Ibrar Khan, who had travelled from Khan\u2019s province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a convoy of protesters to reach the capital. \u201cImran Khan is like a father figure for us and father of the nation. We are here for him. We won\u2019t go without releasing Khan,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said that they had gone up against teargas and live bullets to reach the capital. \u201cThe government tried their best to stop us but despite all obstacles, we made it here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are ready to sacrifice our lives for Khan but won\u2019t leave without Khan.\u201d</p> \n<p>The interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, had said earlier that Khan\u2019s supporters would not be allowed to reach D-Chowk or get close to the red zone or parliament buildings. He said the government would not hesitate to use \u201cextreme\u201d steps to stop them, which could include imposing a curfew or deploying army troops. \u201cWe will not let them cross our red lines,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Naqvi said the government had offered PTI a field outside Islamabad to hold their protest and that the offer had been taken to Khan in his jail cell, but they were still waiting for a response.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/31/imran-khan-pakistan-former-pm-sentenced-prison-14-years-corruption-charges\">Imran Khan, Pakistan former PM, sentenced to 14 years in prison for corruption</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The government, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/03/shehbaz-sharif-sworn-in-as-prime-minister-of-pakistan\">the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif</a>, was heavy-handed in its attempt to prevent Khan\u2019s supporters reaching the capital. Highways into Islamabad were blocked with shipping containers and thousands of police and paramilitary lined the streets, firing rubber bullets and teargas at the protesters.

      "bodyText": "Pakistani security forces have launched a sweeping midnight raid on supporters of the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan who had earlier forced their way through security barriers and entered Islamabad. Thousands of protesters had gathered in the centre of the capital after a convoy, led by Khan\u2019s wife, broke through several lines of security all the way to the edge of the city\u2019s highly fortified red zone. But late on Tuesday, hundreds were arrested and most of the protesters dispersed amid chaotic scenes as security forces launched a massive raid, firing teargas, according to local broadcasters. At least seven people had earlier been killed and dozens injured in the unrest. Authorities had enforced a security lockdown in the capital for the last three days after Khan called for supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party to march on parliament for a sit-in demonstration to demand his release. By Tuesday morning, upwards of 50,000 of Khan\u2019s supporters had broken through the heavily fortified barriers and entered Islamabad, where they marched toward the \u201cred zone\u201d, an area in the centre of the capital where the parliament, supreme court and prime minister\u2019s office are located. The area resembled a fortress of barriers, shipping containers and police personnel in riot gear. The protesters were led by Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, who was recently released from prison, and Khan\u2019s key aide, Ali Amin Gandapur, who is the chief minister of the PTI stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Tens of thousands more were expected to join from neighbouring Punjab and Rawalpindi. As the protesters approached Islamabad\u2019s D-Chowk, a roundabout in the heart of the red zone, the area resembled a battleground as police and paramilitary officers rained down rubber bullets and teargas on the crowds. By the afternoon, security personnel had succeeded in pushing back the crowds from D-Chowk but protesters refused to vacate the city and continued to violently push back against the riot police. PTI\u2019s main demand for the protest is for Khan to be released, alleging that the former prime minister is being held as a political prisoner and that the hundreds of charges against him are trumped up by his political opponents. Voted out of power by parliament in 2022 after he fell out with Pakistan\u2019s powerful military, Khan faces charges ranging from corruption to instigation of violence, all of which he and his party deny. Among those who reached D-Chowk was Ibrar Khan, who had travelled from Khan\u2019s province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a convoy of protesters to reach the capital. \u201cImran Khan is like a father figure for us and father of the nation. We are here for him. We won\u2019t go without releasing Khan,\u201d he said. He said that they had gone up against teargas and live bullets to reach the capital. \u201cThe government tried their best to stop us but despite all obstacles, we made it here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are ready to sacrifice our lives for Khan but won\u2019t leave without Khan.\u201d The interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, had said earlier that Khan\u2019s supporters would not be allowed to reach D-Chowk or get close to the red zone or parliament buildings. He said the government would not hesitate to use \u201cextreme\u201d steps to stop them, which could include imposing a curfew or deploying army troops. \u201cWe will not let them cross our red lines,\u201d he said. Naqvi said the government had offered PTI a field outside Islamabad to hold their protest and that the offer had been taken to Khan in his jail cell, but they were still waiting for a response. The government, led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, was heavy-handed in its attempt to prevent Khan\u2019s supporters reaching the capital. Highways into Islamabad were blocked with shipping containers and thousands of police and paramilitary lined the streets, firing rubber bullets and teargas at the protesters. Public transport into the city was also shut down to keep Khan\u2019s supporters away. One police officer was shot and killed in the clashes while more than 100 were injured, and 22 police vehicles were torched in clashes just outside Islamabad and elsewhere in the Punjab province, the provincial police chief, Usman Anwar, said. Two officers were in critical condition, he said. Another four Rangers paramilitary officers were killed on the outskirts of Islamabad, reportedly when they were run over by a car driven by PTI protesters. According to PTI, two supporters were killed by excessive police violence and scored more had been injured. \u201cThey are even firing live bullets,\u201d said one of Khan\u2019s aides, Shaukat Yousafzai. The provincial information minister, Uzma Bukhari, said about 80 of Khan\u2019s supporters had been arrested but PTI said that about 5,000 had been picked up by police as they marched to Islamabad from across the country. Gatherings in Islamabad have been banned, while all schools in the capital and the adjacent city of Rawalpindi were to remain closed on Monday and Tuesday, the authorities said. The march, which Khan has described as the \u201cfinal call\u201d, is one of many his party had held to seek his release since he was jailed in August last year. He now faces upwards of 100 charges, all of which he denies.",

      "bodyText": "A young mother killed herself and left a note saying \u201cI was murdered\u201d after suffering years of abuse at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, a court has heard. Kiena Dawes, 23, a hairdresser, said in her note that \u201cRyan Wellings killed me\u201d, a jury heard. She continued: \u201cHe ruined every bit of strength I had left. I didn\u2019t deserve it. I hope my life saves another by police services acting faster. Don\u2019t let bullies live free.\u201d Wellings, 30, is standing trial for the manslaughter of Dawes. He is also accused of assault and controlling and coercive behaviour towards Dawes during their two-year relationship. He denies the charges. Paul Greaney KC, prosecuting, told Preston crown court that Dawes was a \u201cbright and popular\u201d young woman who had a nine-month-old daughter. He said Dawes, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, had driven to a friend\u2019s home but when she got there, her friend was in the shower. She let herself in and left the baby in her friend\u2019s home before driving to a nearby railway line and killing herself. Greaney said Dawes had left her mobile phone alongside her daughter and had written a suicide note on it. A phone note written by Dawes was shown and read out to the jury. It said: \u201cThe end. I fought hard, I fought long. I went through pain no one could imagine. \u201cI was murdered. Ryan Wellings killed me. He ruined every bit of strength I had left. I didn\u2019t deserve it. I hope my life saves another by police services acting faster. Don\u2019t let bullies live free.\u201d Addressing her daughter, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I let you go \u2026 I\u2019m so sorry I had to go. The world turned their back on me. I was strong. I had dreams. I had a future at one point. That was taken away from me.\u201d She added in the note she hoped her daughter was \u201ckept away from the monster who is called her dad\u201d. Greaney told jurors that Dawes\u2019s own words represented the prosecution case, that her death was caused by Wellings\u2019s actions, and he was guilty of her manslaughter. He said almost from the beginning of their relationship, Wellings had repeatedly subjected Dawes to controlling and coercive behaviour, abuse and violence, over a prolonged period. Dawes had been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder, resulting in increased impulsivity, poor self-esteem and difficulty in relationships, the court heard. Wellings exploited her mental health condition, jurors were told, and while her condition played a part in her decision to take her own life, so too did his abuse, including a final assault which left her in hospital 11 days before she killed herself, the prosecution said. The defendant claims Dawes\u2019s accusations against him are either untrue or exaggerated, and any injuries she suffered before her death were a result of his attempts to restrain her or accidental. The court heard that Dawes, a hairdresser, and Wellings first met each other through Dawes\u2019s brother, a friend of the defendant, in January 2020. An \u201cintense\u201d relationship began and within weeks Wellings had Dawes\u2019s name and face tattooed on his body, the court heard. After the first Covid lockdown began Dawes moved to Dorset and Wellings followed shortly after. But in May 2020 a friend of Dawes visited the flat to find it smashed up, and Dawes told her friend that Wellings had tried to strangle her with an iPhone charger cable, the jury heard. On another occasion, Wellings accused Dawes of sleeping with a friend of theirs, screamed at her that she was a \u201cslag\u201d, threw a stool at her, and told her to kill herself, it is alleged. Greaney said for more than two years Dawes was in a relationship with a man who \u201cassaulted her, bullied and demeaned her\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is clear, suggests the prosecution, that despite a desire to see her daughter grow up, Kiena could not take any more.\u201d The case continues. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The collision left her with severe brain injuries requiring multiple surgeries.</p> <p>Her daughter Cat Rubens says insurance company Axa Partners insisted Jane be repatriated to the UK \u2013 against the advice of multiple experts.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been shown zero empathy, customer care or reasonableness from Axa at one of the darkest times of our lives,\u201d she said. The firm later backed down after a social media outcry.</p> <p>Cat Rubens, a solicitor, described how she communicated the medical advice from neurologists in both the UK and US to the insurer, but was told on Sunday that the family had to agree that day to repatriate Jane by Wednesday 27 November or cover for her medical expenses in the US would cease.</p> <p>\u201cJane has had a craniectomy where part of the skull was removed to relieve pressure in the brain,\u201d said Rubens. \u201cWe were advised by an NHS neurologist and a brain injury charity that they would not expect a patient with my mum\u2019s type of injury to be flown this early in her recovery.\u201d</p> <p>The family said they asked for the decision to be delayed for 48 hours so they could consult the neurology team, but this was turned down.

      "bodyText": "The daughter of a woman who suffered brain injuries while on holiday in the US has said she was told by her mother\u2019s insurer that she must return to the UK, against the advice of doctors, or face having funding for her medical care withdrawn. Jane Rubens, 73, from Edinburgh, is in a coma after being hit, as a pedestrian, by a large vehicle in St Louis, Missouri, at the start of November. The collision left her with severe brain injuries requiring multiple surgeries. Her daughter Cat Rubens says insurance company Axa Partners insisted Jane be repatriated to the UK \u2013 against the advice of multiple experts. \u201cWe have been shown zero empathy, customer care or reasonableness from Axa at one of the darkest times of our lives,\u201d she said. The firm later backed down after a social media outcry. Cat Rubens, a solicitor, described how she communicated the medical advice from neurologists in both the UK and US to the insurer, but was told on Sunday that the family had to agree that day to repatriate Jane by Wednesday 27 November or cover for her medical expenses in the US would cease. \u201cJane has had a craniectomy where part of the skull was removed to relieve pressure in the brain,\u201d said Rubens. \u201cWe were advised by an NHS neurologist and a brain injury charity that they would not expect a patient with my mum\u2019s type of injury to be flown this early in her recovery.\u201d The family said they asked for the decision to be delayed for 48 hours so they could consult the neurology team, but this was turned down. Axa also declined to let Rubens\u2019 neurosurgeon speak to its medical advisers, they claim, and was unable to produce a medical plan for the repatriation and ongoing care. \u201cThe call handler accepted that we were being asked to agree to a plan we had not seen. Despite this, he reiterated that we had to agree by the afternoon or no further medical expenses would be covered,\u201d said Cat, who has flown from the UK to the US to be at her mother\u2019s bedside. \u201cWe asked to speak to a manager. We were told no manager was available. We asked the call handler for a manager to call us back. He said that could not be arranged. We asked to speak to an underwriter. The call handler said that was not allowed. We asked for more time. Again, Axa said no. Backed into a corner, we had no choice but to agree to their repatriation plan, since we can\u2019t afford to lose her medical cover.\u201d Jane\u2019s neurosurgeon subsequently told the family that it would be in her best interests to fly after part of her skull had been reattached. \u201cThat\u2019s 3-6 months down the line,\u201d Rubens wrote on X. Axa changed its stance after the family highlighted their plight on social media. It has now withdrawn its deadline for repatriation pending discussions with Rubens\u2019 medical team, and said it would continue to cover medical expenses while discussions were ongoing. An Axa Partners spokesperson said: \u201cWe are sorry for the distress Ms Rubens and her family have experienced when making a claim and we sympathise with their situation. \u201cWe have spoken with Ms Rubens\u2019 family and will remain in contact with them over the coming days to support them. Our medical team and Ms Rubens\u2019 treating doctors will agree the best course of action going forward. \u201cWe are considering all available options, and the welfare of Ms Rubens and her family remains our priority.\u201d Axa\u2019s conduct had caused the family intolerable additional suffering, claimed Rubens. \u201cAll the time we are having to fight these battles to try to protect her is time we can\u2019t spend in the room with her, holding her hand and talking to her and doing the things that might make her, if she has moments of greater awareness, feel less lonely and scared.

      "bodyText": "The supreme court has been urged to recognise \u201cthe facts of biological reality rather than the fantasies of legal fiction\u201d in a case brought by Scottish campaigners to resolve how women are defined in law. For Women Scotland is challenging a prior ruling by the court of session in Edinburgh, which found that guidance extending the definition of \u201cwoman\u201d to transgender women with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) was lawful. The supreme court hearing, which began on Tuesday, marks the conclusion of a long-running court action by For Women Scotland over the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018, which was aimed at improving gender balance. They have argued consistently that this minor piece of Holyrood legislation has wide-ranging ramifications for women\u2019s rights under the UK-wide 2010 Equality Act. Addressing the court, Aidan O\u2019Neill KC said that For Women Scotland\u2019s submission was that \u201cin the Equality Act sex just means sex, as that word and the words woman and man are understood and used in ordinary, everyday language \u2026 by ordinary people\u201d. He argued that Scottish ministers\u2019 position that the Equality Act created a \u201cnew legal category of \u2018certificated sex\u2019\u201d \u2013 determined by what it says on a birth certificate, whether that remains as it was or is later altered by a GRC \u2013 was wrong and should be rejected by the court. Campaigners who argue that the rights of trans women with a GRC could come into conflict with women\u2019s rights under the Equality Act \u2013 such as over access to single-sex services \u2013 are hoping for a definitive ruling on the legal definition of woman. That issue has challenged politicians and policymakers in recent years as concerns about the apparent clash have grown in force. For Women Scotland, with interventions from other campaign groups including Sex Matters and the LGB Alliance, is appealing against the ruling of Lady Haldane in 2022, who stated in her judgment that the meaning of \u201csex\u201d for the purposes of the 2010 act \u201cis not limited to biological or birth sex, but includes those in possession of a GRC\u201d. O\u2019Neill told the court that historically women had been discriminated against by biological determinism \u2013 for example, defining jobs they were deemed capable of doing \u2013 but now faced \u201cbiological denialism\u201d. He said: \u201cThat is to say that being a woman has nothing to do with biology and it is therefore not open to women to seek to deny men who identify as women and [have a GRC] access to women\u2019s spaces.\u201d O\u2019Neill argued that to take the Scottish government\u2019s view was \u201cto capitulate to patriarchy rather than confront it\u201d. The Harry Potter author and activist JK Rowling donated \u00a370,000 to the appeal\u2019s crowdfunder, which has now raised more than \u00a3200,000. Other prominent campaigners packed the court benches, including Maya Forstater, who founded Sex Matters after winning an employment tribunal that found she was unfairly discriminated against because of her gender-critical beliefs, and the former SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who has been outspoken on the Scottish government\u2019s stalled attempts to change the process of gender recognition.

Daniel Andreas San Diego, 46, has been on the FBI\u2019s \u201cmost wanted terrorists\u201d list for almost two decades for his alleged involvement in two office building bombings in San Francisco in 2003. The FBI had offered a reward of up to $250,000 (\u00a3200,000) for information leading directly to his arrest and considered him \u201carmed and dangerous\u201d. He was arrested on Monday \u201cat a property in a rural area next to woodland\u201d in the Conwy area of north Wales by specialist officers from the national extradition unit of the National Crime Agency (NCA).

National charity the Traveller Movement held preliminary talks with lawyers on Monday, and said it was considering taking legal action over the incident, and supporting affected families. Some of the parents of children involved as well as community leaders attended a meeting in Manchester on Tuesday afternoon with the deputy mayor, Kate Green, after concerns had been raised about the incident. Greater Manchester police (GMP) put in a 48-hour dispersal notice on Saturday afternoon, after reports of antisocial behaviour in the city centre, and on trains to Manchester. Videos posted to social media showed young people being herded on to trains at Manchester Victoria station, with one boy heard shouting: \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going.\u201d One parent who spoke anonymously to the Manchester Evening News (MEN) said her 13-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son had ended up more than 100 miles away, in Grimsby.

The adverts ask people to write to their MPs to vote against the bill on Friday.</p> <p>The adverts also use the NHS logo, which is a protected brand. MPs targeted by the campaign include Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq and Dan Tomlinson and Reform\u2019s Lee Anderson, who have said publicly they are undecided.</p> <p>A significant number of adverts in the last week targeted new Labour MPs, about 100 of whom have told colleagues they have not made their minds up about the legislation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a really important decision on a very detailed bill.

      "bodyText": "Mass advertising campaigns on assisted dying, including billboards at Westminster station and targeted Facebook adverts, have sparked anger among MPs. Amid an increasingly fractious debate on assisted dying before a vote on Friday, MPs have raised concerns about \u201cinappropriate\u201d tactics used by both camps. MPs have objected to a billboard campaign featuring terminally ill patients promoted by Dignity in Dying, which is in favour of the legislation. One MP said the billboards, some of which have been covered by Samaritans posters, were inappropriate in a tube station. Meanwhile, Care Not Killing, one of the main groups campaigning against assisted dying, has used photographs of more than 50 MPs in Facebook adverts targeted at voters in their constituencies. The adverts ask people to write to their MPs to vote against the bill on Friday. The adverts also use the NHS logo, which is a protected brand. MPs targeted by the campaign include Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq and Dan Tomlinson and Reform\u2019s Lee Anderson, who have said publicly they are undecided. A significant number of adverts in the last week targeted new Labour MPs, about 100 of whom have told colleagues they have not made their minds up about the legislation. \u201cThis is a really important decision on a very detailed bill. These kind of tactics are completely inappropriate when we\u2019re trying to consider this carefully,\u201d one new MP said. Another said it was \u201cdeeply misleading for this religious campaign group to use the NHS logo\u201d.

The Labour MP Patrick Hurley wrote on Bluesky: \u201cWhile I\u2019ve not yet made my decision on how I\u2019ll vote on the assisted dying bill this coming Friday, I must admit to being uneasy with advertisements promoting suicide on the tube.

More than three years ago, these vast vessels were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/13/italy-bans-cruise-ships-from-venice-lagoon-after-unesco-threat\">barred from Venice\u2019s lagoon</a> on grounds of the risk they posed to the city\u2019s historic buildings. This summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/19/europe-ports-bear-brunt-of-cruise-ship-pollution\">cruise ships</a> in Amsterdam and Barcelona were targeted by protesters, on grounds of chemical pollution but also as part of a wider movement against overtourism (as the negative impacts of huge influxes of visitors have become known). But \u2013 as revealed this week in a series of Guardian articles, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-real-cost-of-cruises\">The real cost of cruises</a> \u2013 the environmental and social impact of this fast-growing industry goes way beyond individual cities, and requires action on a global scale.</p> <p>The carbon emissions of a cruise are roughly double that of the equivalent flights plus a hotel stay. The industry is also responsible for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/19/europe-ports-bear-brunt-of-cruise-ship-pollution\">vast quantity of waste</a> discharged directly into the sea, as well as high levels of toxic air pollution in the ports where ships are docked \u2013 usually with their engines running. Once seen as the exclusive pursuit of a minority of wealthy retired people, these holidays are now mainstream, with vast floating resorts designed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/26/selfies-and-surf-simulators-the-young-cruisers-driving-boom-in-sea-holidays\">marketed for families and young adults</a>. The largest ships <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/26/icon-of-the-seas-largest-cruise-ship-human-lasagne-climate-fuel-lng-greenwashing\">have up to 20 floors</a> and room for several thousand people.</p> <p>With numerous new vessels under construction, and the latest models <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/07/cruisezilla-passenger-ships-have-doubled-in-size-since-2000-campaigners-warn\">twice the size</a> of older ones, the industry is predicted to be worth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/26/tuesday-briefing-first-edition-cruisezillas\">nearly 4% of the \u00a31.9tn global holiday market</a> by 2028. Rightly, environmental campaigners are calling for much tougher regulations.</p> <p>Like aviation, shipping in general has benefited from lenient environmental and tax rules \u2013 partly due to the difficulty of deciding in which national jurisdiction, and under whose regulatory regime, their activities belong. The EU has recently agreed new penalties for those that use dirty fuel. But in the UK, shipping has <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/cop29-the-uk-is-wrong-to-exclude-international-shipping-and-aviation-emissions-from-its-ndc-7b76c27f/\">not so far been included</a> in the emissions reductions plans submitted to the United Nations \u2013 though this should change when these are renewed. The International Maritime Organization\u2019s&nbsp;own <a href=\"https://globalmaritimeforum.org/insight/the-implications-of-the-imo-revised-ghg-strategy-for-shipping/\">carbon reduction targets</a> do not put it on a path to net zero or even the 1.5C average temperature rise allowed for in the Paris&nbsp;climate&nbsp;agreement.</p> <p>As with aviation, there is an urgent need for increased international cooperation and agreement. Cruise companies should not be able to operate with lower environmental standards than other kinds of travel businesses. Their track record is poor, with many opting to fit \u201cscrubbers\u201d that dump emissions into the sea when they were told to reduce air pollution. In future, the ocean, as well as the air, must be protected when rules are tightened.</p> <p>As in other industries, the development and adoption of green technologies must become compulsory, not optional.

      "bodyText": "Local pushback against cruise ships in the world\u2019s top tourist destinations is nothing new. More than three years ago, these vast vessels were barred from Venice\u2019s lagoon on grounds of the risk they posed to the city\u2019s historic buildings. This summer, cruise ships in Amsterdam and Barcelona were targeted by protesters, on grounds of chemical pollution but also as part of a wider movement against overtourism (as the negative impacts of huge influxes of visitors have become known). But \u2013 as revealed this week in a series of Guardian articles, The real cost of cruises \u2013 the environmental and social impact of this fast-growing industry goes way beyond individual cities, and requires action on a global scale. The carbon emissions of a cruise are roughly double that of the equivalent flights plus a hotel stay. The industry is also responsible for a vast quantity of waste discharged directly into the sea, as well as high levels of toxic air pollution in the ports where ships are docked \u2013 usually with their engines running. Once seen as the exclusive pursuit of a minority of wealthy retired people, these holidays are now mainstream, with vast floating resorts designed and marketed for families and young adults. The largest ships have up to 20 floors and room for several thousand people. With numerous new vessels under construction, and the latest models twice the size of older ones, the industry is predicted to be worth nearly 4% of the \u00a31.9tn global holiday market by 2028. Rightly, environmental campaigners are calling for much tougher regulations. Like aviation, shipping in general has benefited from lenient environmental and tax rules \u2013 partly due to the difficulty of deciding in which national jurisdiction, and under whose regulatory regime, their activities belong. The EU has recently agreed new penalties for those that use dirty fuel. But in the UK, shipping has not so far been included in the emissions reductions plans submitted to the United Nations \u2013 though this should change when these are renewed. The International Maritime Organization\u2019s own carbon reduction targets do not put it on a path to net zero or even the 1.5C average temperature rise allowed for in the Paris climate agreement. As with aviation, there is an urgent need for increased international cooperation and agreement. Cruise companies should not be able to operate with lower environmental standards than other kinds of travel businesses. Their track record is poor, with many opting to fit \u201cscrubbers\u201d that dump emissions into the sea when they were told to reduce air pollution. In future, the ocean, as well as the air, must be protected when rules are tightened. As in other industries, the development and adoption of green technologies must become compulsory, not optional. One example is the currently patchy use of shoreside electricity, which is much lower-carbon than on-board power. The green taxes being discussed in relation to air travel should also be imposed on cruises. If this means that the industry\u2019s plans for rapid further expansion are checked, that would be for the best. In its current form, it is not only unsustainable but causing disproportionate harm by comparison with other forms of tourism, including air travel. The environmental costs of the hedonistic visions it promotes \u2013 trips of a lifetime, and so on \u2013 must also be more effectively communicated.

      "bodyText": "Russia has banned cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves from entering the country under new sanctions announced by Moscow\u2019s foreign affairs ministry. More than a dozen other senior Labour politicians are among the 30 British citizens on the Russian \u201cstop list\u201d after tensions between London and Moscow rose following Ukraine\u2019s recent use of British missiles to strike deeper into Russia. Moscow also said it was expelling a British diplomat for alleged spying, the latest in a series of tit-for-tat expulsions reflecting strained relations since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The UK this week imposed fresh sanctions on 30 oil tankers from Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d as it tries to squeeze Vladimir Putin\u2019s funding of the war in Ukraine. The Russian ministry said it was putting politicians, military officials, journalists and tech industry figures on its \u201cstop list\u201d as a result of \u201cincessant aggressive anti-Russian rhetoric\u201d by the UK government. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and David Lammy, the foreign secretary, have already been banned from entering Russia, and were on an equivalent list of 39 senior British politicians, businesspeople and journalists in 2022. The FSB, Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, announced on Tuesday that it had acted on documents accusing a British diplomat of engaging in \u201creconnaissance and subversive activities that threaten the country\u2019s security\u201d. It claimed the diplomat \u201cintentionally provided false information when applying for entry into Russia, thereby violating Russian law\u201d. Russian media reported that the diplomat had been given two weeks to leave the country. According to the FSB, the diplomat, whose photo was splashed across Russian TV news bulletins, had been a replacement for one of six UK diplomats expelled in August, also over accusations of espionage. The British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said at the time that the accusations were baseless. The Russian foreign ministry said it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Nigel Casey. An FCDO spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we do not comment on Russian designations, we can\u2019t see any member of this government travelling to Russia anytime until Putin rolls back his tanks and ends his illegal invasion of Ukraine.\u201d A No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cTo be clear, we refute these allegations.

In September, Russia announced it had revoked the accreditation of six British diplomats it accused of spying, coinciding with Starmer\u2019s visit to Washington, where the use of Storm Shadow missiles was to be discussed. The spokesperson added: \u201cThe UK government is unapologetic about protecting our national interests and will now respond in due course, and our embassy in Moscow will continue its important work in Russia to support UK interests.\u201d Relations between Britain and Russia reached a new low last week after Britain agreed to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles on targets inside Russia. The green light came days after Joe Biden, the US president, agreed to do the same for America\u2019s long-range Atacms weapon. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, which UK and US officials warned was a significant escalation of the near three-year conflict. Kyiv has since used Storm Shadow missiles to strike a command headquarters in the village of Maryno in the Kursk region. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Britain had sent dozens more of the missiles to Ukraine several weeks ago. Meanwhile, British troops have been drafted in to help the US Air Force find out who is responsible for flying drones over three bases in England. A small number of drones were spotted overnight flying over RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk and RAF Feltwell in Norfolk, the USAF confirmed. It comes days after it was confirmed that a small number of \u201cunmanned aerial systems\u201d were spotted in the vicinity of the three bases between Wednesday and Sunday. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: \u201cWe take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defence sites. \u201cWe are supporting the US Air Force response.\u201d",

In Wales, the first minister, Eluned Morgan, said 400 homes had been damaged as well as businesses and infrastructure, and reviews were being done to find out why some householders appeared not to have received warnings in time. She said her administration would be asking for more money from the UK government to keep old coal tips safe after a landslip in Cwmtillery, south Wales, forced people out of their homes. The UK environment secretary, Steve Reed, said 107 properties had been hit in England and that more flooding was likely but its impacts should be less severe than they were at the weekend. The Met Office has issued a yellow severe weather warning from 10pm on Tuesday to midday on Wednesday for parts of London, Essex, Kent, Sussex, the Isle of Wight, Dorset and a small area around Plymouth in Devon.

It generated perhaps the first ever positive headline he has received in the paper, not because it included a vague reference to his plans to devolve some aspects of employment policy to local government (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live?page=with:block-6745bbdb8f08a93d9a46c583#block-6745bbdb8f08a93d9a46c583\">12.22pm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live?page=with:block-6745dbd38f08a93d9a46c76a#block-6745dbd38f08a93d9a46c76a\">2.46pm</a>), but because Starmer said he would cut welfare spending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sgfmann/status/1860436015032226237\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Mail on Sunday: STARMER DECLARES WAR ON BENEFITS BRITAIN  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fT2jynJsgh\">pic.twitter.com/fT2jynJsgh</a></p>&mdash; George Mann (@sgfmann) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sgfmann/status/1860436015032226237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 23, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>In fact, most of<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14118885/SIR-KEIR-STARMER-Jobs-dignity-pride-not-just-paying-bills.html\"> Starmer\u2019s article </a>was about the value of work, but it included this passage that secured him the splash.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No more business as usual.</p> <p>We must go further. That\u2019s why, in the coming months, Mail on Sunday readers will see even more sweeping changes.</p> <p>Because, make no mistake, we will get to grips with the bulging benefits bill blighting our society.</p> <p>And don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we will crack down hard on anyone who tries to game the system, to tackle fraud so we can take cash straight from the banks of fraudsters. There will be a zero-tolerance approach to these criminals.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today\u2019s Get Britain Working white paper says almost nothing about these implied benefit cuts. But a lot of decisions about disability benefits have been postponed, and the government is still committed to obtaining savings from <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/disability-benefit-reforms-autumn-budget/\">changes to the work capability assessment first announced by the Tories </a>(although how those savings are obtained may change). Charities and thinktanks, while broadly positive about what has been announced today, have expressed concern about what is coming down the track. Here are some of their comments.</p> <p>Mark Rowland, chief executive of the <strong>Mental Health Foundation</strong>, welcomed the approach taken by the white paper. He said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For too long, the discussion around enabling people who are too unwell to work to return to the workplace has been toxic and unrelated to the real experiences of people in receipt of benefits. Our own research shows that people on low incomes in the UK experience poverty stigma, which is associated with worse mental health. We\u2019re pleased to see the \u2018Get Britain Working\u2019 white paper \u2013 and the language of government spokespeople talking about this announcement - suggest a departure from this narrative.</p> </blockquote> <p>This seems a reference to interviews like Alison McGovern\u2019s this morning. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/26/keir-starmer-labour-tory-jobs-plan-latest-politics-news-live?page=with:block-674598208f086501868e9e46#block-674598208f086501868e9e46\">10.07am</a>.)</p> <p>But Rowland also said there were \u201cworrying\u201d elments in the white paper.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>References in the white paper to sanctions remain worrying, and the wait to hear about changes to the work capability assessment will be concerning for many, so we urge the government to publish their proposals for the welfare system as soon as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>James Taylor, director of strategy at the disability equality charity <strong>Scope</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There much that is positive about this white paper. The Connect to Work scheme and a desire to enhance the role of employers are both promising developments.</p> <p>But we still know there\u2019s still a huge amount of anxiety about what changes the government is planning to make to the benefits system.</p> <p>Disabled people fear being forced into unsuitable jobs, or losing benefits if they engage with employment services. This lack of trust could seriously undermine the government\u2019s plans to boost employment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Iain Porter, senior solicy adviser at <strong>Joseph Rowntree Foundation</strong> thinktank, said</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The white paper is an important first step towards rebooting the relationship between employment services and disabled people away from a culture of blaming and shaming and towards genuinely supporting people back to work.</p> <p>Many of the reforms announced today are rightly focused on tackling the root causes holding people back from decent work including by encouraging employers to recruit and retain disabled people and intervene early to help people stay in work.</p> <p>However, these positive first steps risk being undermined by the government\u2019s commitment to \u00a33bn of cuts to the health and disability benefits budget, if this simply comes from removing support for disabled people. Putting arbitrary cost savings ahead of effective reforms leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the disabled people on low incomes who rely on health and disability benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Tom Pollard, head of social policy at the <strong>New Economics Foundation</strong> thinktank, <a href=\"https://neweconomics.org/2024/11/government-must-resist-pressure-to-be-tough-on-people-on-benefits\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The high number of people out of work due to disabilities and poor health is symptomatic of long-term government failure to help people to stay well and, where possible, in work, so it is welcome to see new government plans today to improve support \u2026</p> <p>If the government is going to fulfil its ambition of delivering more effective employment support, it must resist pressure to focus on short-term savings or being \u200b\u2018tough\u2019 on people on benefits.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T18:04:19.136Z\">at 6.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-674606e78f08917e9a1d728d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T17:40:18.845Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Russian embassy in the UK</strong> says hostility towards Vladimir Putin in this country is irrational.

There can be few bigger priorities than ensuring young people get the education and careers they need.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is from Becci Newton, director of public policy research at the <strong>Institute for Employment Studies</strong>, a consultancy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Get Britain Working white paper brings a welcome focus on overcoming worklessness and improving outcomes for young people and adults, and we are pleased that much of the proposed reform chimes with our own research for the Commission on the Future of Employment Support.</p> <p>While not specific on the details yet, the white paper\u2019s focus on rights and responsibilities brings a welcome return to a welfare system that meets young people halfway. We have seen success with the New Deal for Young People and the Activity Agreement Pilots for 16-17s under the former Labour government. The offer of careers support, tailoring to health and wellbeing and ensuring young people have the skills employers are looking for should be an attractive offer to motivate young people to get active.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from Ben Harrison, director of the <strong>Work Foundation</strong>, a thinktank based at Lancaster University</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prioritising improvements to Jobcentres, the reforms rightly aim to make it easier for those out of work \u2013 whether claiming Universal Credit or not \u2013 to access tailored employment support, training and skills development. Ensuring that local decision-makers have the powers and funding to design and deliver more of this support will be key to ensuring interventions are better tailored to the needs of communities.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Harrison also argues that these plans will only work if future changes to the benefit system, which are not spelt out today, do not undermine them. He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the success of these measures will depend on wider changes to the benefits system to de-risk the journey back to employment. Government must ensure that those with long-term health issues are not inadvertently pushed into insecure and low-quality work which may only serve to worsen their condition in the long run. And it is critical that those with health conditions do not face the risk of losing their welfare entitlements should they attempt to return to the labour market and yet are unable to sustain work over the medium to long-term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6745a6668f0826f02ca42a14\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T10:55:19.037Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK recently sent more Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine, before strikes against Russia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain recently supplied Ukraine with dozens more Storm Shadow missiles, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/uk-sends-kyiv-more-storm-shadows-as-starmer-pledges-support?embedded-checkout=true\">a Bloomberg report</a> by <strong>Alex Wickham</strong>. \u201cThe deliveries, which were not publicly announced, took place several weeks ago and were ordered after Kyiv ran low on the long-range missiles, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing security issues,\u201d Wickham writes.

It seems to me it needs to be grappled with now.</p> </blockquote> <p>The government has not yet published an impact assessment for the bill, which would explain the effect it would have on public services and how much implementation would cost.

Here are the main lines from what she said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>McGovern said it was good that people are more open about their mental health and she refused to blame people for not working on mental health grounds. </strong>Some commentators, and politicians, argue that conditions that were once \u201cnormal\u201d, like anxiety, have now been medicalised, and that this partly explains why the number of people off work sick has risen. McGovern did not argue this. She told Times Radio:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that it\u2019s a good thing that people are able to be more open about mental health conditions in work, and that we understand more about how people\u2019s mental ill health can affect them in work.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think having a go at people and blaming them is the right approach.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s definitely the case that we will help work be more sustainable for everybody, if we can take a broad approach to our mental wellbeing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she was saying the government wanted to change work, not to change people, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Exactly. That\u2019s the culture we need to change.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>McGovern said that Britain was unusual internationally in not seeing employment rise again after Covid. </strong>She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you look at those international statistics, what you see is that post-pandemic almost all of the countries around the world except us recovered in employment terms. The employment rate did increase, people did go back to work.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t happen in Britain, something is different, and the level of sickness that we\u2019re experiencing as a country is really high.</p> </blockquote> <p>Explaining why, she said \u201creally bad\u201d waiting lists in the NHS and \u201clong-term differences in our economy depending on where you live\u201d were among the reasons.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>McGovern declined to say how much she expected the welfare reforms to save the taxpayer.</strong></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>She said jobcentres should be more attractive to employers. </strong>She told the Today programme:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Only one in six of our employers really thinks about using a jobcentre.

On the Today programme, she stressed that most young people would want to accept what was offered, and that sanctions already operate in the system. She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When good help is offered, it is taken up, that is normally what happens. Of course, people will always think of that small minority [\u2026] people who are not interested, they don\u2019t want to do it \u2026</p> <p>There are rules in the system.

Today the government is unveiling what it is calling, in the headline on its overnight press release, the \u201cbiggest employment reforms in a generation\u201d. The reforms are intended to tackle the fact that Britain is the only major economy where the employment rate has fallen over the last five years, largely because more people are out of work due to long-term ill health. A white paper called Get Britain Working is being published later, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is due to make a statement in the Commons.</p> <p>In its overnight briefing, the Department for Work and Pensions has already flagged up numerous initiatives which are in the white paper. Overall, the focus seems to be more carrot than stick. \u201cOur reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven\u2019t been getting the support they need to get back to work,\u201d <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> says. But quite a lot of key decisions have been postponed, and at this point it is hard to assess quite how significant, or effective, these meaures will turn out to be. The history of welfare reform is littered with announcements that don\u2019t quite live up to \u201cbiggest in a generation\u201d hype.</p> <p>This is how Starmer sums up what is government is doing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>From the broken NHS, flatlining economy, and the millions of people left unemployed and trapped in an inactivity spiral \u2013 this government inherited a country that simply isn\u2019t working. But today we\u2019ve set out a plan to fix this. A plan that tackles the biggest drivers of unemployment and inactivity and gives young people their future back through real, meaningful change instead of empty rhetoric and sticking plaster politics.</em></p> <p><em>We\u2019re overhauling jobcentres to make them fit for the modern age. We\u2019re giving young people the skills and opportunities they need to prepare them for the jobs of the future. We\u2019re fixing the NHS so people get the treatment and mental health support they desperately need to be able to get back to work. We\u2019re working with businesses and employers to better support people with disabilities and health conditions to stay and progress in work, and it doesn\u2019t stop there.</em></p> <p><em>Our reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven\u2019t been getting the support they need to get back to work. Helping people into decent, well-paid jobs and giving our children and young people the best start in life - that\u2019s our plan to put more money in people\u2019s pockets, unlock growth and make people better off.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The Conservatives say the plans won\u2019t work because the government is ducking tough decisions. This is what <strong>Helen Whately</strong>, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said overnight.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This latest announcement shows that Labour are not prepared to take the tough but necessary choices to bring down the benefits bill.</p> <p>There is no attempt to match the \u00a312bn in welfare savings we promised in our manifesto. They have even dodged the difficult decisions on sickness benefits, which are needed to make the welfare system sustainable in the long term.</p> <p>To get people off benefits you also need jobs for them to go to.

      "bodyText": "Russia has announced that it is imposing a travel ban on 30 Britons it deems anti-Russian, including 15 cabinet ministers. (See 5.02pm.) The announcement came after a British diplomat was expelled from Moscow for allegedly spying \u2013 a charge the UK government has dismissed as baseless. (See 4.29pm.) Campaigners, charities and thinktanks have broadly welcomed proposals in the government\u2019s Get Britain Working white paper to boost employment \u2013 but warned that the positive impact of the plans could be undermined by benefit cuts expected to be confirmed at some point in the future. (See 11.17am and 5.54pm.) The final asylum seekers housed on the Bibby Stockholm barge left the boat today and crew members are set to leave tomorrow, with the controversial vessel\u2019s final day in port expected to be 8 January. Labour has written to parliament\u2019s standards watchdog asking for an investigation into claims that Lee Anderson was offered a six-figure financial incentive to join the Reform party the year before he defected. At the weekend Keir Starmer wrote an article for the Mail on Sunday about his plans for employment and welfare reform. It generated perhaps the first ever positive headline he has received in the paper, not because it included a vague reference to his plans to devolve some aspects of employment policy to local government (see 12.22pm and 2.46pm), but because Starmer said he would cut welfare spending. In fact, most of Starmer\u2019s article was about the value of work, but it included this passage that secured him the splash. No more business as usual. We must go further. That\u2019s why, in the coming months, Mail on Sunday readers will see even more sweeping changes. Because, make no mistake, we will get to grips with the bulging benefits bill blighting our society. And don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we will crack down hard on anyone who tries to game the system, to tackle fraud so we can take cash straight from the banks of fraudsters. There will be a zero-tolerance approach to these criminals. Today\u2019s Get Britain Working white paper says almost nothing about these implied benefit cuts. But a lot of decisions about disability benefits have been postponed, and the government is still committed to obtaining savings from changes to the work capability assessment first announced by the Tories (although how those savings are obtained may change). Charities and thinktanks, while broadly positive about what has been announced today, have expressed concern about what is coming down the track. Here are some of their comments. Mark Rowland, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, welcomed the approach taken by the white paper. He said. For too long, the discussion around enabling people who are too unwell to work to return to the workplace has been toxic and unrelated to the real experiences of people in receipt of benefits. Our own research shows that people on low incomes in the UK experience poverty stigma, which is associated with worse mental health. We\u2019re pleased to see the \u2018Get Britain Working\u2019 white paper \u2013 and the language of government spokespeople talking about this announcement - suggest a departure from this narrative. This seems a reference to interviews like Alison McGovern\u2019s this morning. (See 10.07am.) But Rowland also said there were \u201cworrying\u201d elments in the white paper. References in the white paper to sanctions remain worrying, and the wait to hear about changes to the work capability assessment will be concerning for many, so we urge the government to publish their proposals for the welfare system as soon as possible. James Taylor, director of strategy at the disability equality charity Scope, said: There much that is positive about this white paper. The Connect to Work scheme and a desire to enhance the role of employers are both promising developments. But we still know there\u2019s still a huge amount of anxiety about what changes the government is planning to make to the benefits system. Disabled people fear being forced into unsuitable jobs, or losing benefits if they engage with employment services. This lack of trust could seriously undermine the government\u2019s plans to boost employment. Iain Porter, senior solicy adviser at Joseph Rowntree Foundation thinktank, said The white paper is an important first step towards rebooting the relationship between employment services and disabled people away from a culture of blaming and shaming and towards genuinely supporting people back to work. Many of the reforms announced today are rightly focused on tackling the root causes holding people back from decent work including by encouraging employers to recruit and retain disabled people and intervene early to help people stay in work. However, these positive first steps risk being undermined by the government\u2019s commitment to \u00a33bn of cuts to the health and disability benefits budget, if this simply comes from removing support for disabled people. Putting arbitrary cost savings ahead of effective reforms leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the disabled people on low incomes who rely on health and disability benefits. And Tom Pollard, head of social policy at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: The high number of people out of work due to disabilities and poor health is symptomatic of long-term government failure to help people to stay well and, where possible, in work, so it is welcome to see new government plans today to improve support \u2026 If the government is going to fulfil its ambition of delivering more effective employment support, it must resist pressure to focus on short-term savings or being \u2018tough\u2019 on people on benefits. The Russian embassy in the UK says hostility towards Vladimir Putin in this country is irrational. It has posted this on social media. Irrational hostility towards Russia is promoted as dogma by the UK political and media mainstream, expected to be swallowed by the British public without scrutiny or critical analysis. Notably absent from public discourse is any examination of the potential connection between London\u2019s leading role in escalating the conflict in Ukraine and the growing sense of insecurity among British citizens, even when this insecurity is based on questionable premises. Readers won\u2019t need reminding that there are countless reasons why outrage at the conduct of the Russian government is well founded. The National Autistic Society says it hopes today\u2019s Get Britain Working white paper will make a difference for autistic people. Mel Merritt, the charity\u2019s head of policy and campaigns, said: Only 30% of autistic people are in work, the lowest of any disability. This shouldn\u2019t be the case. Most autistic people can and want to work but face multiple barriers in finding and progressing in employment. We hope today\u2019s reforms will close the unacceptable autism employment gap and genuinely remove these barriers. The Department for Work and Pensions has now published the 68-page white paper. It has also released an analytical annex, and data tables. The Russian foreign ministry has published the list of 30 Britons subject to a travel ban. It says: The Russian foreign ministry is once again forced to draw attention to the incessant aggressive anti-Russian rhetoric of the British authorities, the illegitimate unilateral restrictions systematically introduced by London against our country, as well as the thoughtless policy of the leadership of this country to support the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime, pursuing purely selfish geopolitical interests and leading to a senseless prolongation of the Ukrainian conflict. Russophobic policies, which combine attempts to discredit Russia\u2019s actions and isolate it in the international arena, the dissemination of disinformation about our country, including in the context of a special military operation, coupled with military support for the Ukrainian armed forces, bordering on the direct involvement of Great Britain in the conflict with all the accompanying escalation risks, indicate London\u2019s attitude towards further systemic confrontation with respect to Russia. And here are the 20 political figures on the list, as set out on the foreign ministry\u2019s website. They are now banned from entering Russia because of their alleged anti-Russian activities. 1) Angela RAYNER, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing, Communities and Local Government; 2) Yvette COOPER, Minister of the Interior; 3) Shabana MAHMOOD, Lord Chancellor and Minister of Justice; 4) Rachel Jane REEVES, Minister of Finance; 5) Patrick Bosco MCFADDEN, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; 6) Edward Samuel MILIBAND, Minister for Energy Security and Carbon Neutrality; 7) Wesley Paul William STREETING, Minister of Health; 8) Steven Mark Ward REED, Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; 9) Jonathan Neil REYNOLDS, UK Secretary of State for Enterprise and Trade, Chairman of the UK Board of Trade; 10) Elizabeth Louise KENDALL, Minister for Work and Pensions; 11) Bridget Maeve PHILLIPSON, Minister of Education; 12) Hilary James Wedgwood BENN, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; 13) Joanna Meriel STEVENS, Secretary of State for Wales; 14) Lucy Maria POWELL, Leader of the House of Commons of the British Parliament and Lord President of the Privy Council; 15) Angela Evans SMITH, Baroness Smith of Basildon, Leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal; 16) Maria EAGLE, Deputy Minister of Defence; 17) Benjamin William JUDAH, Adviser to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; 18) Gurinder Singh JOSAN, Labour MP in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament; 19) John Derek TWIGG, Labour MP in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament; 20) Andrew James SNOWDEN, Conservative MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; The other 10 people on the list are business, military and media figures. A ban of this sort may look like a hostile act, but it will have almost no practical impact. It is not likely that any of the people on the list were planning a trip to Russia in the foreseeable future anyway. Foreign Office travel advice advises against \u201call travel to Russia due to the risks and threats from its continuing invasion of Ukraine, including: security incidents, such as drone attacks, in parts of the country; lack of flights to return to the UK; [and] limited ability for the UK government to provide support\u201d. The owner of Vauxhall has announced that it plans to close its van factory at Luton, in a decision that will put 1,100 jobs at risk of cuts or moving location, Jasper Jolly reports. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has described this as a \u201cvery difficult day for Luton\u201d, PA Media reports. This is from Steve Rosenberg, the BBC\u2019s Russia editor, reflecting on today\u2019s developments in UK-Russia relations. This was a day that reflected the current state of UK-Russian relations, i.e. very bad: \u00b7 UK diplomat expelled; \u00b7 Several UK cabinet ministers barred from Russia; \u00b7 Russian court accuses British citizen of taking part in \u201carmed hostilities\u201d on the territory of Kursk region. Downing Street has denied allegations the UK diplomat kicked out of Russia was a spy. Speaking at the afternoon lobby briefing, a No 10 spokesperson said: To be clear, we refute these allegations. They\u2019re baseless. We\u2019re now considering our response. Downing Street said it would not pre-empt what the UK\u2019s response might be, when asked if a tit-for-tat expulsion would occur. The spokesperson said: This is not the first time that [Vladimir] Putin\u2019s government has made malicious, baseless accusations against our staff. You\u2019ll remember that the Kremlin baselessly curtailed the accreditation of six UK diplomats in Russia earlier this year following action taken by the UK government in response to the Russian state directing activity across Europe and in the UK. Today\u2019s announcement is no surprise coming from President Putin\u2019s government, which has overseen an illegal war in Ukraine. The UK government is unapologetic about protecting our national interests and will now respond in due course, and our embassy in Moscow will continue its important work in Russia to support UK interests. The government has said it is \u201cdetermined\u201d to ensure earlier intervention for children with special educational needs (Send) after a report found that the crisis in provision has left children vulnerable to exploitation. Research funded by the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre found a \u201chigh proportion\u201d of cases of child sexual exploitation, internal trafficking and modern slavery involve children with Send. In a statement provided to the Guardian in response to the report\u2019s findings, a government spokesperson said: Every child and young person deserves the opportunity to achieve and thrive, and we\u2019re determined to ensure there is earlier intervention for children with Send and a greater focus on mainstream provision. All schools must follow statutory safeguarding guidance, which highlights how some children are more vulnerable to abuse and harm than others, including those with Send. We are committed to tackling exploitation and are continuing funding for a prevention programme run by the Children\u2019s Society which targets and prevents child abuse in its different forms. The government says it recognises the \u2018immense need\u2019 in the sector, providing almost a \u00a31bn increase in high-needs funding for 2025-2026 to help local authorities with the increasing costs of supporting children and young people with education and healthcare plans. The Labour manifesto committed to introduce a new offence of criminal exploitation of children, and the Independent Child Trafficking Guardian (ICTG) service has been rolled out to two thirds of local authorities in England and Wales to provide \u201can additional source of advice and support for potential child victims of modern slavery, regardless of nationality or immigration status, to ensure the child is protected from further harm, prevent possible repeat victimisation, re-trafficking or going missing, and to promote the child\u2019s recovery\u201d, the government has said. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secrtary, and Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, are also among the 30 British citizens subject to a travel ban by Russia (see 4.04pm), PA Media reports. The Russian ministry said it was putting members of the UK\u2019s political and military establishment as well as journalists on its \u201cstop list\u201d, PA says. Russia has banned a string of Britain\u2019s cabinet ministers from entering the country in response to what it called London\u2019s \u201cRussophobic\u201d policies, the Associated Press news agency reports. Among those it was targeting included chancellor Rachel Reeves, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, home secretary Yvette Cooper and more than a dozen other senior politicians in the new Labour government, AP says. It\u2019s Andrew Sparrow, picking up again from Sammy Gecsoyler. The former prime minister Tony Blair is evangelical about the possible benefits of using technology more effectively in healthcare and, in a statement on today\u2019s Get Britain Working white paper, his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI), says the government could save more than \u00a310bn a year by making workers healthier. In a statement TBI said: The key to getting Britain back to work is to keep our working age population healthy for longer. This means shifting to preventative-health measures, made possible by advances in screening, digital tools and early interventions. TBI estimates that even a 20% reduction in the incidence of six major disease categories that are keeping people out of work \u2013 cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic respiratory illness, diabetes and mental-health and musculoskeletal disorders \u2013 would have significant macroeconomic benefits. A comprehensive programme of preventative medicine could raise GDP by an estimated 0.74% within five years \u2013 an annual boost of \u00a319.8bn \u2013 and by 0.98% within ten years, equating to \u00a326.3bn annually. Annual fiscal savings from increased tax revenues and reduced benefit payments could amount to \u00a310.2bn and \u00a313.0bn by 2030 and 2035, respectively. The evidence is undeniable - shifting healthcare towards prevention would save lives and save money. In the Commons, Liz Kendall is facing more questions about the newly announced Get Britain Working white paper. Kirsty Blackman, the SNP MP for Aberdeen North, asked: Many disabled or ill people were terrified by the Tories\u2019 proposals to cut \u00a33bn from the sickness benefit. Given that Labour are continuing along this cut, will the secretary of state today promise to sign up to the principle of \u2018nothing about us without us\u2019, and ensure that disabled people, those with ill health and those with lived experience of these systems are round the table? Kendall said: We do need change. I understand how worried people are when they hear about change, but they themselves I think would also say the change needs to happen. Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, told the Commons: Barriers to employment and a lack of workplace support for disabled people remain persistent challenges, as well as inadequate social security payments for everyone regardless of employment status. Can [Kendall] reassure disabled people that the government\u2019s new support measures will not be conditional on being able to work? Kendall said: I understand why disabled people, when they hear talk about helping people into work or reforms to sickness and disability benefits, why they\u2019re worried because of what happened over the last 14 years, we are determined to break down those barriers to work. I think many disabled people, given the right help and support and the right flexibility to work, could work and want to work. The Scottish government is coming under pressure from all sides ahead of its budget next Wednesday. On Monday, the UK Treasury was briefing it was offering a further \u00a3300m to the SNP government to cover the rise in employer national insurance contributions for public sector staff \u2013 but the Scottish finance secretary Shona Robison has warned this is not enough, estimating that at least \u00a3500m is required to pay for staff directly employed in the public sector. This adds to the squeeze on Scotland\u2019s finances, which are already under severe constraints because of public sector pay deals \u2013 making up almost half of the budget \u2013 and rising inflation. Meanwhile a new campaign group of 50 civil society groups is urging first minister John Swinney to make bold reforms to Scotland\u2019s tax system, calling on him to increase wealth taxes and scrap the outdated council tax \u2013 which remains frozen, putting local authority budgets under extreme pressure too. Indeed, new research out today from Local Government Information Unit Scotland reveals that 70% of all councils believe they will be unable to pass a balanced budget within the next five years without immediate changes. Tomorrow Swinney delivers a keynote speech ahead of the budget calling on the country to \u201cpull together in the spirit of collaboration\u201d \u2013 but as cuts bite and with more coming down the line that goodwill he seeks will be thin on the ground. Back in the Commons, Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said the government wants to \u201cdrive down\u201d economic inactivity caused by poor health, adding work is under way but ministers want to go \u201cmuch further and faster to tackle this issue\u201d. She told the Commons: To meet the scale of the challenge, we will devolve new funding, new powers and new responsibilities to tackle economic inactivity to mayors and local areas because local leaders know their communities best. We\u2019ll support all areas in England to produce local \u2018Get Britain Working\u2019 plans, joining up work, health and skills support. Today I\u2019m announcing eight trailblazer areas backed by \u00a3125m of additional funding in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the north-east, Greater Manchester, Wales, York and North Yorkshire, and two Greater London areas. In three of these areas \u2013 South and West Yorkshire and the north-east - this will include dedicated input and \u00a345m of funding for local NHS integrated care systems. And we\u2019re funding a new supported employment programme called \u2018Connect to Work\u2019 backed by \u00a3115m of initial funding for next year. This will be included in the integrated settlements for combined authorities, starting with Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. Keir Starmer has held a meeting at Downing Street with the head of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) to discuss continued worries among farmers about changes to inheritance tax announced in the budget. While the government still has no plans to offer any concessions over the changes, the NFU president, Tom Bradshaw, said the prime minister \u201cwas very much in listening mode\u201d, and that he hoped ministers could still change course. The meeting, held on Monday but not publicised by No 10, came six days after thousands of farmers gathered in central London to protest against the decision to levy inheritance tax on some farms for the first time. Previously, farmland had not been subject to inheritance tax, with ministers saying this has often been used as a tax loophole by wealthy people who buy up agricultural plots. Under the new plans, from April 2026, farmland worth more than \u00a31m will be taxed at 20%, half the usual inheritance tax rate. Last week, Bradshaw called the tax a \u201cstab in the back\u201d for the sector, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever seen the industry this angry, this disillusioned, this upset.\u201d In a video update to members after the meeting with Starmer, Bradshaw took a more measured tone, while saying he had still pressed the case over the tax changes. He said: The PM was very much in listening mode, and I hope that he\u2019s able to act on what he\u2019s heard this afternoon, and really understand that when we talk about the very real human impacts. When we talk about the viability of our family farms, the low returns from producing the country\u2019s food, these are all conversations that we\u2019ve picked up this afternoon. Saying the conversation also took in food security and trade deals, he added: \u201cThe prime minister engaged with us and made time to hear our story. And I really hope this marks a moment where we can move forwards and get to an outcome that works for everyone.\u201d Kendall told the Commons that 2.8 million people are out of work due to long-term sickness, and almost one million young people are not in education, employment or training. She said the situation is \u201cfar worse in parts of the country - in the Midlands and the North - that were deindustrialised in the 80s and 90s, the very same places that have lower life expectancy and chronic poor health, areas which the party opposite [the Conservatives] repeatedly promised to level up, but repeatedly failed to deliver\u201d. She continued: And the result is an economic but above all social crisis, paid for in the life chances and living standards of people right across this country, and by a benefits bill for sickness and disability that is set to rise by \u00a326bn by the end of this parliament. Helen Whately, the shadow works and pensions secretary, accused Kendall of \u201cpinching our ideas\u201d. Responding to Kendall\u2019s statement in the Commons, Whatley said her government counterpart had rebranded the WorkWell programme, which was introduced under the Conservatives, \u201cas her own Connect to Work scheme\u201d. She said: Far from being cross that the government is pinching our ideas, I welcome the right honourable lady taking our work forwards and that she\u2019s making the right noises about how important this is to fix economic inactivity, which is a big problem for our economy and for each and every individual who risks being written off to a life on benefits. I am disappointed in the substance of what she is announcing today, because far from matching her rhetoric, this appears to be little more than a pot of money for local councils, some disparaging language about the work of jobcentres and a consultation which will be launched in the spring. Given that they have had 14 years to prepare for this moment, where are the reforms to benefits which will actually make material savings to the taxpayer? Like the \u00a312bn we committed to save in our manifesto. Where are the reforms to fit notes which we had handed over already to go? Where is her plan for reforming the workplace capability assessment? She has banked the \u00a33bn savings from our plan but fails to set out her own and her big announcement on making benefits for young people conditional. Did she forget that they already are? The fact is, the secretary of state has dodged the tough decisions every day she kicks the can down the road. Work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall has begun her statement in the Commons outlining the Get Britain Working white paper. She told the Commons that young people \u201chave a responsibility\u201d to take up new opportunities. She said: This comes alongside our commitment to provide mental health support in every school, our work experience and careers advice offer, and our plans to reform the last government\u2019s failed apprenticeship levy to give more young people the opportunities they deserve. But our new Youth Guarantee will go further, bringing together all the support for 18 to 21-year-olds under the leadership of mayors and local areas so all young people have access to education, training and employment opportunities, and so that no young person misses out. She announced eight Youth Guarantee \u201ctrailblazers\u201d in the Liverpool City Region, West Midlands, Tees Valley, East Midlands, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, West of England, and two areas in Greater London, backed by \u00a345m. (See 12.22pm.) She continued: I can also announce a new national partnership to provide exciting opportunities for young people in sports, arts and culture, starting with some of Britain\u2019s most iconic cultural and sporting organisations including the Premier League, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Channel 4, building on the brilliant work they already do to inspire and engage the younger generation and get them on the pathway to success. Kendall later said: In return for these new opportunities, you have a responsibility to take them up, because being unemployed or lacking basic qualifications when you\u2019re young can harm your job prospects and wages for the rest of your life, and that is not good enough for young people or for our country. Her measures were reported ahead of her Commons statement. Paul Brand from ITV News says he thinks turnout for the assisted dying debate on Friday will be particularly high. Think turnout on Friday will be unusually high for a private members bill. I had wondered whether undecided/unsure MPs would stay away. But I\u2019m hearing that many feel - because the issue has punched through so significantly - that they can\u2019t hide from and have to vote. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is just starting her statement about the Get Britain Working white paper. My colleague Sammy Gecsoyler is taking over for a bit, but I will be back later. Seven backbench MPs have signed an amendment to the second reading motion for the assisted dying bill, which is being debated on Friday, saying the bill should be shelved to allow a proper review of the policy. They call for \u201ca fully-informed debate and vote on assisted dying, which should be subsequent to an independent review of and public consultation on the existing law and proposals for change\u201d. The amendment has been signed by two Conservative MPs (Ben Spencer and John Lamont), four Labour MPs ( Anna Dixon, Polly Billington, Josh Fenton-Glynn and Uma Kumaran) and one Lib Dem one (Munira Wilson). MPs are unlikely to be allowed to get a chance to vote on this amendment. But the fact that it has been tabled is significant, because it suggests there is growing support in the Commons for some sort of pause to the legislation, and for a proper, government-led review of policy in this areas. Even MPs in favour of assisted dying worry that the private members\u2019 bill procedures in the Commons do not allow enough time for scrutiny for a social change as significant as this one, and last week the former Labour MP Ed Balls suggested that the best option might be for the vote to be pulled on Friday, and for the government to launch a review instead. In a blog earlier this month David Natzler, a former clerk to the Commons, said MPs should come to a decision at second reading \u2013 but that after that a government-led review might be the best way forward. Downing Street lobby briefings can often end up sounding like the Sky News papers review, and this morning the PM\u2019s spokesperson was also asked about a report in the Times by Steven Swinford about Boris Johnson\u2019s latest thoughts on the reasons for Britain\u2019s obesity problems. Johnson, the former PM, sounded off in evidence given to an inquiry on food policy backed by the charities Nesta and Impact on Urban Health. The report was out yesterday. Summing up Johnson\u2019s reasoning (no easy feat), Swinford says: Boris Johnson has blamed the Church of England for Britain\u2019s obesity crisis, saying that its failure to provide people with the \u201cspiritual sustenance\u201d they need was leading people to \u201cgorge themselves\u201d. The former prime minister said that when he was younger it was \u201cvery rare for there to be a fatso in the class. Now they\u2019re all fatsos, and I\u2019d be shot for saying they\u2019re fatsos, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d He criticised the Most Rev Justin Welby and other religious leaders for going on about slavery reparations rather than addressing \u201cpeople\u2019s spiritual needs\u201d. Asked if Keir Starmer agreed that Welby was in part to blame for the obesity crisis, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cI didn\u2019t quite follow [Johnson\u2019s] line of argument.\u201d But the government is taking action to deal with the obesity problem, he added. The government\u2019s entire public sector financial accounts are not fit for purpose, the official audit watchdog has said after the collapse of the \u201cred flag\u201d system that scrutinises billions of pounds of spending in local government. Patrick Butler and Michael Goodier report: The National Audit Office (NAO) said it was impossible to sign off the government\u2019s latest public spending figures as accurate because of the unreliability of financial data relating to hundreds of councils and police and fire authorities. The NAO\u2019s unprecedented decision to \u201cdisclaim\u201d the government\u2019s accounts comes amid warnings that the chronic inadequacy of the council audit system \u2013 seen as an \u201cearly warning\u201d indicator of financial failure or wrongdoing \u2013 could result in more councils going bust. Just one in 10 local authorities submitted reliable formal accounts of their spending in 2022-23. Of the remaining 90%, half failed to submit any financial data at all and half submitted accounts that had not been audited, the NAO said. Here is the full story. This morning the Daily Express splashed on a story claiming the government would announce extra bank holidays to mark the 80th anniversary of end of the second world war next year. Someone\u2019s had a duff steer. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the PM\u2019s spokesperson said that, while there will be special events to mark the 80th anniversary of VE (Victory in Europe) day next year, \u201cthese plans do not include an additional bank holiday\u201d. Russia has expelled a British diplomat, accusing him of espionage. Yohannes Lowe has more on our Ukraine war live blog. Under the Get Britain Working plans announced today, eight areas in England will get funding for \u201cinactivity trailblazers\u201d. One of them is Greater Manchester, which will get \u00a310m for its Working Well employment scheme, which it describes as \u201cone of the top national programmes for job outcomes\u201d and which is part of Greater Manchester\u2019s Live Well wellbeing initiative. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, who has long called for mayors to have more power over employment policy, said: For people to be working well, they have to be living well \u2013 and the current job support system cannot do that with a narrow, box-ticking focus. Greater Manchester has already got a proven track record of helping people back into work. Our focus is on names and not numbers, and on providing a more empowering, more supportive experience within the community. This trailblazer will enable us to build on strong foundations and develop Live Well on a bigger scale, so we can tackle the root causes of inequality and help more people get good jobs here in our city-region. There is a full briefing on the Working Well programme here. Water quality has been designated as poor in a record number of bathing areas this year after 16 rivers were included in summer testing for harmful bacteria, Sandra Laville reports. Sandra writes: The push to clean up England\u2019s rivers has led to a spike in demand for bathing water status at river locations across the country. Rivers suffer from water company sewage pollution and agricultural pollution, and the results show river water quality is distinctly worse than that of coastal bathing sites. The results come after sewage pollution into rivers by water companies reached record levels last year. This year, 16 river areas were designated as bathing water sites out 27 new areas, which meant they were tested for harmful bacteria, E coli and intestinal enterococci. Across the country, 450 locations have bathing water status and are tested during the summer season, from May to September. This year a record number of areas \u2013 37, or 8.2% \u2013 did not meet the minimum standards for bathing waters, and were classified as poor. Of the 27 new bathing water sites tested, 18 were classified as having \u201cpoor\u201d water quality, most of which were rivers. There was a marked difference between river areas and coastal waters, with 95% of coastal waters meeting minimum standards, compared with just over half \u2013 53% \u2013 of inland sites. Here is the full story. Here are the figures from the Department for Environment, Food And Rural Affairs. Here is a chart illustrating the figures. Commenting on the figures, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem environment spokesperson, said: It is truly shocking to see just how many swimming spots are rated as poor water quality, enough is enough, this scandal must end. People are rightly furious at water companies who continue to pump outrageous amounts of sewage into our rivers and seas and a previous Conservative government that let this scandal spiral with no consequences for those responsible. For the Lib Dems, water quality has become a key campaigning issue. Here is some more business reaction to the Get Britain Working white paper. This is from Jane Gratton, deputy director for public police at the British Chambers of Commerce. Today\u2019s white paper \u2013 with its emphasis on improving access to health, skills and employment support \u2013 has the potential to make a real difference for employers, employees and local economies. Our research shows only 1 in 10 SMEs are using jobcentres and this is a lost opportunity. It\u2019s crucial to modernise the service to better connect businesses and job seekers. The high number of working age people who are economically inactive though ill health is a particular concern for employers. We look forward to engaging with the review into how employers can be supported to promote healthy and inclusive workplaces. Tax reforms would make it easier for employers to take a proactive role. And this is from Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. I agree with a lot of stuff in the white paper, but the employment rate is 74.8%. This is about supporting a jobs market that is already dynamic by increasing the flow from inactivity. A good way of doing that is realising that the private sector is the engine of job growth.. There will be two statements in the Commons today after Foreign Office questions. First, at 12.30pm, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, will make a statement about the Cop29 climate conference. And about an hour later Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will make a statement about the Get Britain Working white paper. The last asylum seekers living on the Bibby Stockholm are set to leave the barge, PA Media reports. PA says: A group of eight remaining men will leave the accommodation moored in Portland, Dorset, today, according to a support group. A spokesperson for Portland Global Friendship Group told PA: \u201cWe held our last community drop-in yesterday. We have been saying goodbye to the men for months as there has been a continual movement since the men first arrived in August last year. We continue to support many asylum seekers nationwide from the Bibby Stockholm remotely as they navigate the complex asylum process.\u201d Hundreds of residents have departed from the barge after the government said it would not renew its contract which expires in January. One asylum seeker previously told PA that \u201ceveryone was happy\u201d that the barge accommodation was shutting down so that other people will be saved from going through the same experience on the ship he described as sometimes feeling like a prison. Labour has said continuing the use of the Bibby Stockholm would have cost more than \u00a320m next year, and that scrapping it forms part of the expected \u00a37.7bn of savings in asylum costs over the next 10 years. The asylum seekers accommodated on the barge, who were all men, were being dispersed to accommodation in places including Cardiff, Wolverhampton and Bristol, according to the BBC. None of them will be moved to the Dorset Council catchment, which includes the area around Portland and Weymouth. The Federation of Small Businesses applauds the ambition in the government\u2019s Get Britain Working, but says that overcoming the \u201cpervasive poverty of ambition\u201d about employment in the public sector won\u2019t be easy. This is from Tina McKenzie, the FSB\u2019s policy chair. This is a start \u2013 but only a start \u2013 in fixing the pervasive poverty of ambition in the Jobcentre, health and other state systems when it comes to getting people back into work. Increasing employment is ultimately the most sure-fire way to drive up living standards and economic growth. Ministers have a huge job to persuade public institutions that work is good for health and that everyone who needs work should be helped to get a job or start-up in self-employment \u2013 not least getting rid of the idea that the only good work is in graduate jobs, the public sector or volunteering. The ambition behind the 80 per cent employment target is both clear and important .. To deliver on this policy agenda, government and small businesses must work in partnership to drive real change through the whole employment system and make sure the country is helping those who most need work. The TUC has also broadly welcomed the white paper, although it is also calling for proper investment in training and health support. This is from Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary. It is right to ensure that young people who are seeking work are helped to find a job or training. Positive early experiences in the jobs market are vital for young people\u2019s future life chances. They must be supported to take part, not faced with self-defeating sanctions. Success will also depend on ministers making the investment that\u2019s needed in health services and quality training. Jobcentre staff must have a central role in redesigning their services, and devolution must never come at the cost of staff terms and conditions. Employment specialists are broadly positive about the Get Britain Working white paper \u2013 or at least what they have read about it so far. Here is some reaction that has come in. This is from Stephen Evans, chief executive at the Learning and Work Institute, a thinktank. The government\u2019s ambition for an 80% employment rate is the right one and our research shows it will benefit people, employers and the economy. More than three million people who are out of work want a job, but too often don\u2019t get the right support. This white paper starts us on the path to change that. I\u2019m particularly pleased to see the Youth Guarantee, which we have long called for. There can be few bigger priorities than ensuring young people get the education and careers they need. This is from Becci Newton, director of public policy research at the Institute for Employment Studies, a consultancy. The Get Britain Working white paper brings a welcome focus on overcoming worklessness and improving outcomes for young people and adults, and we are pleased that much of the proposed reform chimes with our own research for the Commission on the Future of Employment Support. While not specific on the details yet, the white paper\u2019s focus on rights and responsibilities brings a welcome return to a welfare system that meets young people halfway. We have seen success with the New Deal for Young People and the Activity Agreement Pilots for 16-17s under the former Labour government. The offer of careers support, tailoring to health and wellbeing and ensuring young people have the skills employers are looking for should be an attractive offer to motivate young people to get active. And this is from Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation, a thinktank based at Lancaster University Prioritising improvements to Jobcentres, the reforms rightly aim to make it easier for those out of work \u2013 whether claiming Universal Credit or not \u2013 to access tailored employment support, training and skills development. Ensuring that local decision-makers have the powers and funding to design and deliver more of this support will be key to ensuring interventions are better tailored to the needs of communities. But Harrison also argues that these plans will only work if future changes to the benefit system, which are not spelt out today, do not undermine them. He explains: Overall, the success of these measures will depend on wider changes to the benefits system to de-risk the journey back to employment. Government must ensure that those with long-term health issues are not inadvertently pushed into insecure and low-quality work which may only serve to worsen their condition in the long run. And it is critical that those with health conditions do not face the risk of losing their welfare entitlements should they attempt to return to the labour market and yet are unable to sustain work over the medium to long-term. Britain recently supplied Ukraine with dozens more Storm Shadow missiles, according to a Bloomberg report by Alex Wickham. \u201cThe deliveries, which were not publicly announced, took place several weeks ago and were ordered after Kyiv ran low on the long-range missiles, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing security issues,\u201d Wickham writes. The missiles were sent before the UK and the UK allowed Ukraine to use their long-range missiles to strike targets in Russia. Asked about the report, which has been independently confirmed by the Guardian, the Ministry of Defence said: We do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit Putin. The UK\u2019s support for Ukraine is ironclad, that\u2019s why we have committed to providing \u00a33bn in military aid for as long as it takes and have trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian military recruits. A former lord chief justice has argued that there is a serious gap in the assisted dying bill that will be debated in the Commons on Friday. The terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, introduced by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow a terminally ill person to get help from a doctor to end their life, provided that two doctors and then a judge agree that they are making a \u201cclear, settled and informed\u201d decision. But the legislation does not spell out in detail what the process would be for the judge to approve that decision \u2013 what evidence they would have to consider, and who would present it \u2013 and in an interview with the Today programme this morning Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd said this was a problem. Thomas, who as lord chief justice between 2013 and 2017 was head of the judiciary in England and Wales, told the programme that he was not speaking as a supporter or opponent of the bill, and that he could see the arguments on both sides. But he said the lack of detail in the bill about how the judicial process would work meant it was not clear what impact it would have on courts. He said \u201cthe process and the impact on the court system is really something about which there should be information before we decide in principle to proceed\u201d. He explained: It seems to me that the one really difficult question that hasn\u2019t been addressed in this is how is the judge to proceed, as it cannot possibly be a rubber-stamping exercise. There has to be a process, by which the evidence is put before the judge, and the judge will need help \u2013 will need either the official solicitor or some other body that can bring the evidence before him. What is not possible is to assess from the bill the impact this has \u2026 As far as I can see, no one has grappled with the detail. And of course, as it\u2019s an integral part of the bill, you can\u2019t say, \u2018well, look, this is to be sorted out later\u2019. It seems to me it needs to be grappled with now. The government has not yet published an impact assessment for the bill, which would explain the effect it would have on public services and how much implementation would cost. Opponents of the bill, and constitutional experts (like the law professor Mark Elliott, in this blog) have criticised the government for this. Downing Street has suggested, if the bill passes at second reading, an impact assessment would be published later in the parliamentary process. Alison McGovern, the employment minister, said this morning she still has not decided how she will vote on the assisted dying private member\u2019s bill on Friday. MPs have a free vote. Explaining her dilemma, McGovern said: I haven\u2019t decided how I\u2019m going to vote. I\u2019ve listened to my constituents who have been so kind and so generous to share with me their experiences, and I want to listen to my colleagues in the debate in full and decide how to vote.\u201d I think it\u2019s so important that people are able to have a good death and that families feel that their loved one was able to die in the most peaceful way possible in accordance with their views, but I haven\u2019t decided on this issue. Alison McGovern, the employment minister, was on interview round duty on behalf of the government this morning, talking mostly about the Get Britain Working white paper. Here are the main lines from what she said. McGovern said it was good that people are more open about their mental health and she refused to blame people for not working on mental health grounds. Some commentators, and politicians, argue that conditions that were once \u201cnormal\u201d, like anxiety, have now been medicalised, and that this partly explains why the number of people off work sick has risen. McGovern did not argue this. She told Times Radio: I think that it\u2019s a good thing that people are able to be more open about mental health conditions in work, and that we understand more about how people\u2019s mental ill health can affect them in work. I don\u2019t think having a go at people and blaming them is the right approach. She also said: I think it\u2019s definitely the case that we will help work be more sustainable for everybody, if we can take a broad approach to our mental wellbeing. Asked if she was saying the government wanted to change work, not to change people, she replied: Exactly. That\u2019s the culture we need to change. McGovern said that Britain was unusual internationally in not seeing employment rise again after Covid. She said: If you look at those international statistics, what you see is that post-pandemic almost all of the countries around the world except us recovered in employment terms. The employment rate did increase, people did go back to work. That didn\u2019t happen in Britain, something is different, and the level of sickness that we\u2019re experiencing as a country is really high. Explaining why, she said \u201creally bad\u201d waiting lists in the NHS and \u201clong-term differences in our economy depending on where you live\u201d were among the reasons. McGovern declined to say how much she expected the welfare reforms to save the taxpayer. She said jobcentres should be more attractive to employers. She told the Today programme: Only one in six of our employers really thinks about using a jobcentre. That is not OK because it means that the public employment service that\u2019s supposed to be there to support our businesses is failing. She confirmed that sanctions would apply to young people who do not take up offers of education, employment or training. But whereas Conservative ministers were normally eager to talk up sanctions, McGovern wasn\u2019t. On the Today programme, she stressed that most young people would want to accept what was offered, and that sanctions already operate in the system. She said: When good help is offered, it is taken up, that is normally what happens. Of course, people will always think of that small minority [\u2026] people who are not interested, they don\u2019t want to do it \u2026 There are rules in the system. Those rules have got to be made to work to make sure that if you take out in the form of social security, you have to do your part of the bargain. The Department for Work and Pensions has now published its summary of what\u2019s in the Get Britain Working white paper. The white paper itself is coming later. Good morning. Today the government is unveiling what it is calling, in the headline on its overnight press release, the \u201cbiggest employment reforms in a generation\u201d. The reforms are intended to tackle the fact that Britain is the only major economy where the employment rate has fallen over the last five years, largely because more people are out of work due to long-term ill health. A white paper called Get Britain Working is being published later, and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is due to make a statement in the Commons. In its overnight briefing, the Department for Work and Pensions has already flagged up numerous initiatives which are in the white paper. Overall, the focus seems to be more carrot than stick. \u201cOur reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven\u2019t been getting the support they need to get back to work,\u201d Keir Starmer says. But quite a lot of key decisions have been postponed, and at this point it is hard to assess quite how significant, or effective, these meaures will turn out to be. The history of welfare reform is littered with announcements that don\u2019t quite live up to \u201cbiggest in a generation\u201d hype. This is how Starmer sums up what is government is doing. From the broken NHS, flatlining economy, and the millions of people left unemployed and trapped in an inactivity spiral \u2013 this government inherited a country that simply isn\u2019t working. But today we\u2019ve set out a plan to fix this. A plan that tackles the biggest drivers of unemployment and inactivity and gives young people their future back through real, meaningful change instead of empty rhetoric and sticking plaster politics. We\u2019re overhauling jobcentres to make them fit for the modern age. We\u2019re giving young people the skills and opportunities they need to prepare them for the jobs of the future. We\u2019re fixing the NHS so people get the treatment and mental health support they desperately need to be able to get back to work. We\u2019re working with businesses and employers to better support people with disabilities and health conditions to stay and progress in work, and it doesn\u2019t stop there. Our reforms put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven\u2019t been getting the support they need to get back to work. Helping people into decent, well-paid jobs and giving our children and young people the best start in life - that\u2019s our plan to put more money in people\u2019s pockets, unlock growth and make people better off. The Conservatives say the plans won\u2019t work because the government is ducking tough decisions. This is what Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said overnight. This latest announcement shows that Labour are not prepared to take the tough but necessary choices to bring down the benefits bill. There is no attempt to match the \u00a312bn in welfare savings we promised in our manifesto. They have even dodged the difficult decisions on sickness benefits, which are needed to make the welfare system sustainable in the long term. To get people off benefits you also need jobs for them to go to. But Labour\u2019s disastrous anti-growth budget is already making businesses think twice about taking people on. Here is Pippa Crerar\u2019s overnight story. I will be posting a lot more reaction and analysis as the day goes on. But here is a full list of what is coming up today. 9.30am: Keir Starmer chair cabinet. 10.30am: The supreme court begins a two-day hearing on a legal case brought by For Women Scotland who are arguing that trans women should not be regarded female for the purposes of the 2010 Equality Act. 11.30am: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is expected to make a Commons statement about the Get Britain Working white paper. After 1.30pm: MPs debate the tobacco and vapes bill, which would over time ban smoking by gradually raising the age at which people can legally buy cigarettes.

The corporation, which owns and operates the central London site of the centuries-old market, had earlier this month put on hold relocation plans to a new \u00a31bn site in Dagenham, east London, to review the \u201cfinancial sustainability\u201d of the planned move. The court of common council, the main decision-making body for the corporation, voted on Tuesday to pull out of running the sites. A market has existed around the Smithfield site for more than 800 years. The corporation was given the right to run it and other wholesale food markets in 1327 by Edward III. The current market site was built in the 1860s and opened in 1868. It was designed by the architect Horace Jones, who also designed Billingsgate when it was redeveloped in the 19th century.

Compensation could total more than \u00a3300m, according to the Times. The authority is said to want to turn the Smithfield site into a mixed-use cultural development alongside the London Museum, which is in the process of relocating to part of the Smithfield site where the poultry market was. There are proposals to transform the land of the current Billingsgate site for a mixed-use housing scheme. Announcing the decision, the corporation said it was \u201cactively supporting traders to identify suitable new sites\u201d and they can continue their operations at Smithfield and Billingsgate until at least 2028. It added that its decision reflects a \u201ccareful balance between respecting the history of Smithfield and Billingsgate markets and managing resources for this project responsibly\u201d. Project costs had risen owing to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction that have made the move unaffordable, it said. Both Smithfield and Billingsgate markets are governed by acts of parliament, effectively fixing the markets to the existing sites and imposing certain rights, restrictions and obligations as to the use of the land.

      "body": "<p>Where would we be without a mind like this? The genius that is Boris Johnson. The man who has done more for this country than all other politicians of his generation. Never mind that most of it has been for the worse. Let\u2019s not bother ourselves with inconvenient details.</p> <p>Instead let\u2019s focus on the greater truth. That, in Boris, we have had a prime minister of startling insight. A man who has thought about the obesity crisis for all of 10 seconds and decided the blame lies with the Church of England. Even more unbelievably, it\u2019s an opinion for which he doesn\u2019t seemed to have charged. Boris will be devastated when he realises he could have got \u00a310k from the Daily Mail for it.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the great brain works. Boris was being interviewed by the food writer Henry Dimbleby and public health expert Dolly van Tulleken when he was worried that both had dozed off. For a narcissistic sociopath like Johnson the greatest crime is to be boring; for his words to go unreported. So he started ad-libbing. Anything to get their attention.</p> <p>Bluh \u2026 Blah \u2026 Bluh \u2026 Boris cast his mind back to when he was young. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we were all out playing in the streets the whole time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that with kids nowadays \u2026 Now they are all fatsos. And I\u2019d be shot for saying they\u2019re fatsos, but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d It takes one to know one. After all, Boris is prime fatso material. Bathroom scales live in terror of him standing on them. \u201cGet off, you fat bastard,\u201d they sob. \u201cYou\u2019re going to break me.\u201d</p> <p>Boris was just getting started. Back in the 1960s, children were running around a lot, drinking too much Tizer and munching Curly Wurlys and dog shit. I was alive then and don\u2019t remember the craze for dog shit. But Boris said it so it must be true.</p> <p>Now we get to the synaptic leap of which only Bozza is capable. Kids weren\u2019t thinner back then because they ate less processed food and exercised more. It was because they were spiritually nourished by the teachings of the Church of England. God turned the sweets, soft drinks and dog shit into negative calories. The children got all they needed by going to church and studying the Bible.</p> <p>It was all quite mad. The modern-day church \u2013 especially the former archbishop of Canterbury \u2013 was too busy scaring children away with talk of paedophiles. Mmm. Arguably. Justin Welby didn\u2019t do nearly enough to warn of paedos. Starting with the C of E itself. So the poor kiddies had nothing to do but stuff themselves to death while hunched over their computers.</p> <p>The evidence for all this seems to have been spurred by his recent attendance at a church service. Presumably a Catholic one. Because just a few years ago he went to all that trouble to have his previous marriages annulled \u2013 they never really happened \u2013 so that he could marry Carrie in Westminster Cathedral. Boris clearly favours a religion where you can rewrite reality. So much so that the person to blame for there only being 10 other people in the congregation was the Church of England.</p> <p>Predictably the service didn\u2019t meet Johnson\u2019s high standards. \u201cIt was all about how rich men can\u2019t go through the eye of a needle, all that sort of rot,\u201d he said. In other words, it was a profoundly Christian message. Though obviously one with which Boris disagrees. Can\u2019t see him donating a couple of the millions he has earned since being forced to resign to charity. There again, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of other doctrine he finds tricky. Not lying. Not committing adultery. Just for starters.</p> <p>His core demand was that the church should just tell people not to be so bloody fat. That was it. Happy fucking Christmas, everyone. The fat man wants you to be thinner. We\u2019d quite like the fat man to remain quiet for a bit. You only remember how much you\u2019ve appreciated the comparative silence when he starts talking again. He inspires a momentary panic. Is it me losing my mind? Or him? Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s Boris.</p> <p>Curiously, the government has reached a rather different conclusion from Johnson. It reckons there are other factors at play in why the number of people out of work rose during the pandemic and has not fallen since.</p> <p>The new work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, came to the Commons to give a statement on her new Get Britain Working white paper.

      "bodyText": "Where would we be without a mind like this? The genius that is Boris Johnson. The man who has done more for this country than all other politicians of his generation. Never mind that most of it has been for the worse. Let\u2019s not bother ourselves with inconvenient details. Instead let\u2019s focus on the greater truth. That, in Boris, we have had a prime minister of startling insight. A man who has thought about the obesity crisis for all of 10 seconds and decided the blame lies with the Church of England. Even more unbelievably, it\u2019s an opinion for which he doesn\u2019t seemed to have charged. Boris will be devastated when he realises he could have got \u00a310k from the Daily Mail for it. Here\u2019s how the great brain works. Boris was being interviewed by the food writer Henry Dimbleby and public health expert Dolly van Tulleken when he was worried that both had dozed off. For a narcissistic sociopath like Johnson the greatest crime is to be boring; for his words to go unreported. So he started ad-libbing. Anything to get their attention. Bluh \u2026 Blah \u2026 Bluh \u2026 Boris cast his mind back to when he was young. \u201cWhen I was a kid, we were all out playing in the streets the whole time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that with kids nowadays \u2026 Now they are all fatsos. And I\u2019d be shot for saying they\u2019re fatsos, but that\u2019s the truth.\u201d It takes one to know one. After all, Boris is prime fatso material. Bathroom scales live in terror of him standing on them. \u201cGet off, you fat bastard,\u201d they sob. \u201cYou\u2019re going to break me.\u201d Boris was just getting started. Back in the 1960s, children were running around a lot, drinking too much Tizer and munching Curly Wurlys and dog shit. I was alive then and don\u2019t remember the craze for dog shit. But Boris said it so it must be true. Now we get to the synaptic leap of which only Bozza is capable. Kids weren\u2019t thinner back then because they ate less processed food and exercised more. It was because they were spiritually nourished by the teachings of the Church of England. God turned the sweets, soft drinks and dog shit into negative calories. The children got all they needed by going to church and studying the Bible. It was all quite mad. The modern-day church \u2013 especially the former archbishop of Canterbury \u2013 was too busy scaring children away with talk of paedophiles. Mmm. Arguably. Justin Welby didn\u2019t do nearly enough to warn of paedos. Starting with the C of E itself. So the poor kiddies had nothing to do but stuff themselves to death while hunched over their computers. The evidence for all this seems to have been spurred by his recent attendance at a church service. Presumably a Catholic one. Because just a few years ago he went to all that trouble to have his previous marriages annulled \u2013 they never really happened \u2013 so that he could marry Carrie in Westminster Cathedral. Boris clearly favours a religion where you can rewrite reality. So much so that the person to blame for there only being 10 other people in the congregation was the Church of England. Predictably the service didn\u2019t meet Johnson\u2019s high standards. \u201cIt was all about how rich men can\u2019t go through the eye of a needle, all that sort of rot,\u201d he said. In other words, it was a profoundly Christian message. Though obviously one with which Boris disagrees. Can\u2019t see him donating a couple of the millions he has earned since being forced to resign to charity. There again, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of other doctrine he finds tricky. Not lying. Not committing adultery. Just for starters. His core demand was that the church should just tell people not to be so bloody fat. That was it. Happy fucking Christmas, everyone. The fat man wants you to be thinner. We\u2019d quite like the fat man to remain quiet for a bit. You only remember how much you\u2019ve appreciated the comparative silence when he starts talking again. He inspires a momentary panic. Is it me losing my mind? Or him? Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s Boris. Curiously, the government has reached a rather different conclusion from Johnson. It reckons there are other factors at play in why the number of people out of work rose during the pandemic and has not fallen since. The new work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, came to the Commons to give a statement on her new Get Britain Working white paper. It all sounded promising, but these things always do until it turns out they have made no difference. A bit of stick \u2013 remove benefits from the idle, and the fat \u2013 and lots of carrot. The healthy option. A more personal service from improved jobcentres, and better physical and mental health provision. The problem is that the previous Tory government had any number of variations of the same theme and things have only got worse. Maybe we Brits are a bit different to other countries and don\u2019t really get that excited about our work. Still, Kendall has to look as if she\u2019s doing something. She\u2019s even promised some lucky job-seekers some work experience with the Premier League, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Channel 4. Look at it this way.

      "bodyText": "The final asylum seekers housed on the Bibby Stockholm barge left the boat on Tuesday and crew members are set to leave on Wednesday, with the controversial vessel\u2019s final day in port expected to be 8 January. The accommodation on the barge, moored in Portland, Dorset, will now be dismantled after the Labour government decided to discontinue the previous government\u2019s contract to house asylum seekers on the vessel. The last departures bring to an end a 15-month saga over the use of the barge to house asylum seekers, featuring protests, arrests and condemnation from campaign groups. Last year Leonard Farruku, a musician who was seeking asylum after travelling from Albania, is thought to have killed himself on the barge. Many of those housed on the Bibby Stockholm had been in the UK for a number of years and had been moved already to two or three different locations. The news was welcomed by Lloyd Hatton, the local Labour MP for South Dorset, who called the use of the barge \u201can expensive and unworkable gimmick\u201d. A Home Office team has been processing claims from the 400 men housed on the boat. A significant majority are understood to have been granted asylum and most are expected to leave the area for accommodation elsewhere. About eight were left on the vessel when the final residents departed on Tuesday. The local council has said that none of the men moved from the vessel will be based in other accommodation in Dorset, with reports saying they are likely to be moved to other areas including Cardiff and Wolverhampton. The barge will be handed back to its owners, Bibby Marine, on 8 January when it will sail from the port as its contract formally expires. The Home Office said in an announcement in July that ending the use of the Bibby Stockholm formed part of an expected \u00a37.7bn of savings in asylum costs over the next 10 years. Extending its use would have cost more than \u00a320m next year, according to the department. Hatton said: \u201cI welcome the news that the Home Office has processed all of the asylum cases on the Bibby Stockholm barge. They promised to empty the barge by the end of November, and they have made good on that promise. \u201cFrom the get-go, our entire community knew that this barge was an expensive and unworkable gimmick. The previous Conservative government landed us with this wasteful barge, by closing it down we are saving the taxpayer a small fortune. \u201cWorking closely with the new government, I have been able to help shut down the barge for good.\u201d The first asylum seekers were taken on to the barge last year as the Conservative government tried to find alternatives to accommodating people in hotels, prompting protests from campaign groups. There were also concerns from the Fire Brigades Union, which called the barge a \u201cpotential deathtrap\u201d because of possible overcrowding and a lack of suitable fire exits. The first group of people were taken onboard in early August last year but were promptly removed again after the discovery of potentially deadly bacteria in the barge\u2019s water system. There were protests when asylum seekers were brought on to the vessel again that October. Shortly before the general election, in May this year, police arrested dozens of people who blocked a road near a hotel in Peckham, south London, in an attempt to block their transfer to the barge. It eventually accommodated 400 people, but within days of the Labour government taking power, ministers said it would no longer be used after the contract ended. The Bibby Stockholm, an engineless specialist accommodation vessel, was previously used to house oil workers, as well as asylum seekers outside the UK. The Home Office was contacted for comment.",

No more tiresome weekly stints of vacuuming, and no more last-minute panic sessions when you have visitors on the way. Instead, your compact robot chum regularly trundles out from its dock, sucking up dust, hair and debris to leave your floors looking spick and span.</p> <p>Over the past few years, robot vacuums have become much more affordable, with basic units starting at about \u00a3150. They\u2019re also doing more than they used to, mopping areas of hard flooring and charging in sophisticated cleaning stations that empty their dust collectors and clean their mop pads for you.</p> <p>In fact, the biggest effort required by you is deciding which one to buy.

I\u2019ve tested a wide range of smart-home appliances and devices, and I know the features that make them more effective and easier to use \u2013 and those that don\u2019t bring any real value.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>Our team scoured the stores and spoke to manufacturers to pull in the leading robot vacuum cleaners. I then gave our test subjects the workout of their little robot lives in my three-bedroom, two-floor home. Over three weeks I had them cleaning every room, switching vacuums and docks around to give each a shot at the upstairs and downstairs spaces.</p> <p>The house has a mix of wooden and composite hard flooring, rugs and carpets, with various awkward, dusty corners as well as two cats shedding inconceivable quantities of hair. What\u2019s more, the living room is a fiendish obstacle course, with two sofas, a packed TV cabinet, an Ikea Po\u00e4ng armchair and a vintage suspended egg chair to navigate. Even with some lighter furnishing removed, these robot vacuums had their work cut out.</p> <p>I used a smartphone sound meter to measure noise levels, and a plug-in power meter to see how much energy the docks or chargers used while idle and when charging. I also spilled flour and crunched cereal on to a barrier mat to check the suction and cleaning power of each model, treading in the crumbled shredded wheat to up the challenge. I also used the apps to check the vacuums\u2019 mapping and scheduling capabilities and to add rooms, zones and no-go areas.</p> <p>After testing, the cleaners are either being returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>The best robot vacuums for 2024</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best overall:</em> <br>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</h2>    <p>The X10 Pro Omni is not a bad price for a self-emptying, self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum. The base station washes and dries the heads between uses, refilling the internal water tank and emptying the dust collector. It uses a front-facing camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors, spotting and identifying items, such as socks or cables, that it can then avoid. It\u2019s powerful, with 8,000Pa of suction force, and its twin rotating mop heads can apply 1kg of downwards pressure, to give your hard floors a serious scrubbing when they need it.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>This Eufy machine does almost everything for you, as long as you periodically empty the base station\u2019s dust bag and dirty-water tank and refill the clean-water tank. Like the Samsung, reviewed further down, it\u2019s great at mapping out your home and dodging potential obstacles, but it\u2019s also better than the Samsung at cleaning on the first pass. The side brush and vacuum can shift dust and hair in seconds, while the mop left my hard floors sparkling, even dealing with dried-on spots of juice.</p> <p>The app gives you plenty of control, allowing you to set up cleaning scenarios to focus on different areas. You can also tweak cleaning options such as suction power if, say, you\u2019ve got a deep pile carpet to clean and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s really making an impact. The brush and roller seem particularly resistant to getting clogged with hair.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>mopping isn\u2019t so effective on the low water setting \u2013 switching up to medium will get you better results. It\u2019s also bigger and louder than rivals, struggling to fit under low furniture and hitting 68dB on max power. Cleaning and drying the mop can be a long and noisy process.</p> <p><strong>Suction power: </strong>8,000Pa<strong><br></strong><strong>Robot</strong> <strong>dimensions: </strong>327 x 353 x 114mm (WDH)<br><strong>Dock dimensions:</strong> 365 x 480 x 360mm (WDH)<br><strong>Maximum noise level: </strong>68dBA<strong><br>Battery life: </strong>180 mins<strong><br>Power consumption (charging): </strong>26.4W</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eufy.com/uk/products/t2351v11\"><sub>\u00a3579 at Eufy</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/eufy-Auto-Lift-Self-Drying-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling/dp/B0CPDVV72T/\"><sub>\u00a3579 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best for fuss-free vacuuming and mopping:</em> <br>iRobot Roomba Combo J9+</h2>    <p>iRobot has been in the robot vacuum game for longer than anyone else, and it shows. The Roomba Combo j9+ is one smart cookie. It uses its camera and sensors not only to navigate your home but also to dodge obstacles and to work out which surfaces need vacuuming and which need its retractable mop.</p> <p>Give it time to learn your floors and it\u2019ll even use its Dirt Detective feature to prioritise the areas that need the most attention. When it\u2019s done, it trundles back into its charging station, where the dust is sucked into a bag and the mop\u2019s water tank is refilled.</p>    <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The Roomba is quiet and effective, and it just gets on with the job. It explores rooms and then cleans in a logical fashion, working methodically through the centre before tackling the edges. It reached every area in my living room without getting caught up in tricky furniture or rugs.</p> <p>The mop slides out of the top of the unit, flipping underneath while it works then popping away when not in use \u2013 a clever way to avoid it dragging along the carpet and making it soggy. And it does a great job of tackling hard floors. The app makes it easy to set schedules and mark up areas to clean or avoid, too.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>the initial setup took a while, with the Roomba failing to connect to my network on the first three tries. It also missed a small area in my spot-cleaning test, though it was consistently impressive elsewhere.</p> <p>You\u2019ll have to remove and wash the mop pads yourself, and it can be expensive if you miss it while it\u2019s on sale.</p> <p><strong>Suction power: </strong>not stated<strong><br></strong><strong>Robot</strong><strong> dimensions: </strong>338 x 339 x 87mm (WDH)<br><strong>Dock</strong> <strong>dimensions:</strong> 312 x 400 x 416mm (WDH)<strong><br>Maximum noise level: </strong>64dBA<strong><br>Battery life: </strong>90 mins<strong><br>Power consumption (charging): </strong>24.4W</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.irobot.co.uk/en_GB/roomba-combo-j9plus/C975840.html\"><sub>\u00a3599 at iRobot</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/ROOMBA-iRobot-Self-Emptying-Auto-Fill-Vacuum/dp/B0CHGJHJRM\"><sub>\u00a3599 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best for power cleaning:</em> <br>Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+</h2>    <p>It\u2019s hard to miss Samsung\u2019s robot mop and vacuum cleaner, not least because its white base station is more of a mansion than a house, standing over half a metre tall. It\u2019s also unnervingly speedy and has a habit of playing jingles when it starts or finishes, or on any event in between.</p> <p>It uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner and two 3D cameras to navigate your home, and it features twin rotating mop heads, which attach magnetically to the bottom of the unit. These are steam-cleaned and dried when the robot returns home.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>It\u2019s a strong all-rounder. It doesn\u2019t have as much suction as the mighty Dyson, reviewed below, but makes up for it by hunting hair, dust and debris relentlessly until it\u2019s gone. The rotating mop heads do a fantastic job of removing marks and stains from kitchen floors, and they lift up when not in use to avoid rubbing on the carpet.</p> <p>It\u2019s also great at navigation, picking up and even identifying potential obstacles, before carefully manoeuvring around them. Even my troublesome egg chair didn\u2019t cause this machine any issues. With the dock\u2019s integrated dust bin and water tanks, it\u2019s also no great effort to maintain.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 </strong>the base station is enormous, and this model is among the most expensive on test. It also struggles with rugs more than the other top vacuums, regularly pulling up the edges and creating a rumpled mess that it subsequently had trouble traversing.</p> <p><strong>Suction power:</strong> 6,000Pa<strong><br></strong><strong>Robot</strong> <strong>dimensions: </strong>359 x 364 x 100mm (WDH)<br><strong>Dock</strong> <strong>dimensions:</strong> 444 x 510 x 547mm (WDH)<strong><br>Maximum noise level: </strong>68dBA<strong><br>Battery life: </strong>180 mins<strong><br>Power consumption (charging): </strong>45.8W</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/samsung-bespoke-jet-bot-combo-ai-3-in-1-cleaning-robot-vacuum-cleaner-satin-grey/p112093195\"><sub>\u00a3800 at John Lewis</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/vacuum-cleaners/robot/jet-bot-combo-ai--ai-object-recognition--satin-greige-satin-greige-vr7md97714g-eu/\"><sub>\u00a3800 at Samsung</sub></a></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong><br></strong></h2> <h2><em>Best for small homes and small budgets:</em> <br>Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart</h2>    <p>Short of space? Beko\u2019s compact cleaner doesn\u2019t need much: it\u2019s just 34cm across and 8cm high, with a small, simple dock for charging. There\u2019s no mop and not a huge amount of suction power, but it uses laser tech to map out and make its way around your rooms, automatically detecting rugs and carpets then boosting up the suction power. It\u2019ll also get into nooks and under low furniture that halts bigger robot vacuums in their tracks.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>It\u2019s relatively tiny and inexpensive, but don\u2019t dismiss the Beko as a toy. Thanks to chunky wheels and ingenious suspension, it\u2019ll make its way over tricky rugs and thresholds without any worries, and its rotating side brush has enough oomph to compensate for a meagre 2,000Pa of suction.</p> <p>While it\u2019s not the best vacuum for deep cleaning, it\u2019s great at heading out daily to keep dust under control. Battery life isn\u2019t epic, but two hours should be more than enough for the two floors of the average home, and it can always head back to its dock and start again later.

      "bodyText": "Robot vacuum cleaners take the drudge work out of cleaning your floors and carpets. No more tiresome weekly stints of vacuuming, and no more last-minute panic sessions when you have visitors on the way. Instead, your compact robot chum regularly trundles out from its dock, sucking up dust, hair and debris to leave your floors looking spick and span. Over the past few years, robot vacuums have become much more affordable, with basic units starting at about \u00a3150. They\u2019re also doing more than they used to, mopping areas of hard flooring and charging in sophisticated cleaning stations that empty their dust collectors and clean their mop pads for you. In fact, the biggest effort required by you is deciding which one to buy. That\u2019s where I can help. I\u2019ve tested seven of the most popular models to help you find the best robot vacuum for your space. At a glance Best overall robot vacuum cleaner: Eufy X10 Pro Omni \u00a3579 at Eufy Best robot vacuum for power cleaning: Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ \u00a3800 at John Lewis Best for no-fuss robot vacuuming and mopping: iRobot Roomba Combo J9+ \u00a3599 at iRobot Best robot vacuum cleaner for small homes and small budgets: Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart \u00a3239 at Currys Why you should trust me I\u2019ve spent almost three decades reviewing technology, home and garden products, covering everything from PCs, printers and tablets to lawnmowers, coffee machines, steam cleaners and fans. I\u2019ve tested a wide range of smart-home appliances and devices, and I know the features that make them more effective and easier to use \u2013 and those that don\u2019t bring any real value. How I tested Our team scoured the stores and spoke to manufacturers to pull in the leading robot vacuum cleaners. I then gave our test subjects the workout of their little robot lives in my three-bedroom, two-floor home. Over three weeks I had them cleaning every room, switching vacuums and docks around to give each a shot at the upstairs and downstairs spaces. The house has a mix of wooden and composite hard flooring, rugs and carpets, with various awkward, dusty corners as well as two cats shedding inconceivable quantities of hair. What\u2019s more, the living room is a fiendish obstacle course, with two sofas, a packed TV cabinet, an Ikea Po\u00e4ng armchair and a vintage suspended egg chair to navigate. Even with some lighter furnishing removed, these robot vacuums had their work cut out. I used a smartphone sound meter to measure noise levels, and a plug-in power meter to see how much energy the docks or chargers used while idle and when charging. I also spilled flour and crunched cereal on to a barrier mat to check the suction and cleaning power of each model, treading in the crumbled shredded wheat to up the challenge. I also used the apps to check the vacuums\u2019 mapping and scheduling capabilities and to add rooms, zones and no-go areas. After testing, the cleaners are either being returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation. * * * The best robot vacuums for 2024 *** Best overall: Eufy X10 Pro Omni The X10 Pro Omni is not a bad price for a self-emptying, self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum. The base station washes and dries the heads between uses, refilling the internal water tank and emptying the dust collector. It uses a front-facing camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors, spotting and identifying items, such as socks or cables, that it can then avoid. It\u2019s powerful, with 8,000Pa of suction force, and its twin rotating mop heads can apply 1kg of downwards pressure, to give your hard floors a serious scrubbing when they need it. Why we love it This Eufy machine does almost everything for you, as long as you periodically empty the base station\u2019s dust bag and dirty-water tank and refill the clean-water tank. Like the Samsung, reviewed further down, it\u2019s great at mapping out your home and dodging potential obstacles, but it\u2019s also better than the Samsung at cleaning on the first pass. The side brush and vacuum can shift dust and hair in seconds, while the mop left my hard floors sparkling, even dealing with dried-on spots of juice. The app gives you plenty of control, allowing you to set up cleaning scenarios to focus on different areas. You can also tweak cleaning options such as suction power if, say, you\u2019ve got a deep pile carpet to clean and you don\u2019t think it\u2019s really making an impact. The brush and roller seem particularly resistant to getting clogged with hair. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 mopping isn\u2019t so effective on the low water setting \u2013 switching up to medium will get you better results. It\u2019s also bigger and louder than rivals, struggling to fit under low furniture and hitting 68dB on max power. Cleaning and drying the mop can be a long and noisy process. Suction power: 8,000Pa Robot dimensions: 327 x 353 x 114mm (WDH) Dock dimensions: 365 x 480 x 360mm (WDH) Maximum noise level: 68dBA Battery life: 180 mins Power consumption (charging): 26.4W \u00a3579 at Eufy \u00a3579 at Amazon *** Best for fuss-free vacuuming and mopping: iRobot Roomba Combo J9+ iRobot has been in the robot vacuum game for longer than anyone else, and it shows. The Roomba Combo j9+ is one smart cookie. It uses its camera and sensors not only to navigate your home but also to dodge obstacles and to work out which surfaces need vacuuming and which need its retractable mop. Give it time to learn your floors and it\u2019ll even use its Dirt Detective feature to prioritise the areas that need the most attention. When it\u2019s done, it trundles back into its charging station, where the dust is sucked into a bag and the mop\u2019s water tank is refilled. Why we love it The Roomba is quiet and effective, and it just gets on with the job. It explores rooms and then cleans in a logical fashion, working methodically through the centre before tackling the edges. It reached every area in my living room without getting caught up in tricky furniture or rugs. The mop slides out of the top of the unit, flipping underneath while it works then popping away when not in use \u2013 a clever way to avoid it dragging along the carpet and making it soggy. And it does a great job of tackling hard floors. The app makes it easy to set schedules and mark up areas to clean or avoid, too. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the initial setup took a while, with the Roomba failing to connect to my network on the first three tries. It also missed a small area in my spot-cleaning test, though it was consistently impressive elsewhere. You\u2019ll have to remove and wash the mop pads yourself, and it can be expensive if you miss it while it\u2019s on sale. Suction power: not stated Robot dimensions: 338 x 339 x 87mm (WDH) Dock dimensions: 312 x 400 x 416mm (WDH) Maximum noise level: 64dBA Battery life: 90 mins Power consumption (charging): 24.4W \u00a3599 at iRobot \u00a3599 at Amazon *** Best for power cleaning: Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ It\u2019s hard to miss Samsung\u2019s robot mop and vacuum cleaner, not least because its white base station is more of a mansion than a house, standing over half a metre tall. It\u2019s also unnervingly speedy and has a habit of playing jingles when it starts or finishes, or on any event in between. It uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner and two 3D cameras to navigate your home, and it features twin rotating mop heads, which attach magnetically to the bottom of the unit. These are steam-cleaned and dried when the robot returns home. Why we love it It\u2019s a strong all-rounder. It doesn\u2019t have as much suction as the mighty Dyson, reviewed below, but makes up for it by hunting hair, dust and debris relentlessly until it\u2019s gone. The rotating mop heads do a fantastic job of removing marks and stains from kitchen floors, and they lift up when not in use to avoid rubbing on the carpet. It\u2019s also great at navigation, picking up and even identifying potential obstacles, before carefully manoeuvring around them. Even my troublesome egg chair didn\u2019t cause this machine any issues. With the dock\u2019s integrated dust bin and water tanks, it\u2019s also no great effort to maintain. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 the base station is enormous, and this model is among the most expensive on test. It also struggles with rugs more than the other top vacuums, regularly pulling up the edges and creating a rumpled mess that it subsequently had trouble traversing. Suction power: 6,000Pa Robot dimensions: 359 x 364 x 100mm (WDH) Dock dimensions: 444 x 510 x 547mm (WDH) Maximum noise level: 68dBA Battery life: 180 mins Power consumption (charging): 45.8W \u00a3800 at John Lewis \u00a3800 at Samsung *** Best for small homes and small budgets: Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart Short of space? Beko\u2019s compact cleaner doesn\u2019t need much: it\u2019s just 34cm across and 8cm high, with a small, simple dock for charging. There\u2019s no mop and not a huge amount of suction power, but it uses laser tech to map out and make its way around your rooms, automatically detecting rugs and carpets then boosting up the suction power. It\u2019ll also get into nooks and under low furniture that halts bigger robot vacuums in their tracks. Why we love it It\u2019s relatively tiny and inexpensive, but don\u2019t dismiss the Beko as a toy. Thanks to chunky wheels and ingenious suspension, it\u2019ll make its way over tricky rugs and thresholds without any worries, and its rotating side brush has enough oomph to compensate for a meagre 2,000Pa of suction. While it\u2019s not the best vacuum for deep cleaning, it\u2019s great at heading out daily to keep dust under control. Battery life isn\u2019t epic, but two hours should be more than enough for the two floors of the average home, and it can always head back to its dock and start again later. It\u2019s also quiet, putting out 60-61dB even at maximum power. It\u2019s a shame that \u2026 long hair can bind itself around the side brush and roller, and it struggled to shift all the flour in the spot cleaning test. You\u2019ll also need to empty the internal dust collector yourself \u2013 although it has a large capacity, the vacuum works better if you do so after every session. Suction power: 2,000Pa Robot dimensions: 342 x 342 x 800mm (WDH) Dock dimensions: 154 x 146 x 90mm (WDH) Maximum noise level: 61dBA Battery life: 130 mins Power consumption (charging): 13.2W \u00a3239 at Currys \u00a3239.10 at Amazon * * * The best of the rest *** Dyson 360 Vis Nav Best for: power Dyson\u2019s robot vac is the most powerful I\u2019ve tested, dragging dirt and long hair out of carpet more effectively than any other model.

Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% tariff\u201d.</p> <p>China has disputed this characterisation of the flow of deadly synthetic opioids into the US. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said: \u201cChina is one of the world\u2019s toughest countries on counternarcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation. Fentanyl is an issue for the US. In the spirit of humanity, China has given support to the US\u2019s response to this issue.\u201d</p>  <h2>What is fentanyl?</h2>  <p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is far more powerful than heroin. Although it has legitimate medical uses for pain management, it is also at the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/opioids\">US opioids crisis</a>. Last year, nearly 75,000 people in the US died from a fentanyl overdose. The White House describes fentanyl as \u201ca scourge that has no geographic or political boundaries\u201d while Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-fentanyl-pipeline-and-chinas-role-in-the-us-opioid-crisis/\">has said</a> that the crisis is the \u201cmost lethal drug epidemic ever in human history\u201d.</p> <h2>How much of it comes from China?</h2>  <p>Fentanyl started arriving in the US from China about 10 years ago. In 2020, the US Drug Enforcement Administration said that China was the \u201cprimary source of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked through international mail\u201d. As authorities in the US and China have cracked down on traffickers and criminal gangs, much of that flow has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/18/china-mexico-opioid-traficking-us-sanctions\">re-routed through cartels in Mexico</a>. Rather than sending shipments of finished illicit fentanyl directly to the US, drug traffickers and exporters in China send precursor chemicals to Mexico, where they can be turned into fentanyl and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/mexico-cartel-project-synthetic-opioid-fentanyl-drugs\">sent on to the US.</a></p> <h2>What has China done to curb the flow of fentanyl into the US?</h2>  <p>The 2010s were a bright spot for US-China cooperation on fentanyl. In 2019, at the behest of the US, <a href=\"http://us.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zmgx/zxxx/202306/t20230630_11105938.htm\">China scheduled all forms of fentanyl,</a> the only major country to permanently include the drugs on a list of controlled substances. In the US, fentanyl analogues are only temporarily controlled, with the classification set to expire in December 2024.</p> <p>But in 2022, when the then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-visit-military\">speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan</a>, Beijing responded angrily by cutting off several channels of communication with the US, including counternarcotics co-operation.</p> <p>It was only last year, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/15/joe-biden-xi-jinping-san-francisco-china-apec\">Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in San Francisco</a>, that bilateral talks on fentanyl were re-opened. In the past few months, China has been scheduling fentanyl precursors that have been banned internationally, catching up with moves to block the flow of the chemicals that are used to make fentanyl as well as blocking the flow of the drug itself. This would, in theory, make it easier to crack down on drugs traffickers.</p> <p>China and the US have also agreed to co-operate on tackling money laundering. Chinese and Mexican organised criminal gangs form the financial backbone of the international fentanyl trade.</p> <p>But China insists that the fentanyl crisis is, at its heart, a problem of the US\u2019s own making. \u201cThe root cause of the overdose lies in the US itself, which calls for more effective measures from the US government,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said last month.</p>",

On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said: \u201cChina is one of the world\u2019s toughest countries on counternarcotics both in terms of policy and its implementation. Fentanyl is an issue for the US. In the spirit of humanity, China has given support to the US\u2019s response to this issue.\u201d What is fentanyl? Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is far more powerful than heroin. Although it has legitimate medical uses for pain management, it is also at the heart of the US opioids crisis. Last year, nearly 75,000 people in the US died from a fentanyl overdose. The White House describes fentanyl as \u201ca scourge that has no geographic or political boundaries\u201d while Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has said that the crisis is the \u201cmost lethal drug epidemic ever in human history\u201d. How much of it comes from China? Fentanyl started arriving in the US from China about 10 years ago. In 2020, the US Drug Enforcement Administration said that China was the \u201cprimary source of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked through international mail\u201d. As authorities in the US and China have cracked down on traffickers and criminal gangs, much of that flow has been re-routed through cartels in Mexico. Rather than sending shipments of finished illicit fentanyl directly to the US, drug traffickers and exporters in China send precursor chemicals to Mexico, where they can be turned into fentanyl and sent on to the US. What has China done to curb the flow of fentanyl into the US? The 2010s were a bright spot for US-China cooperation on fentanyl. In 2019, at the behest of the US, China scheduled all forms of fentanyl, the only major country to permanently include the drugs on a list of controlled substances. In the US, fentanyl analogues are only temporarily controlled, with the classification set to expire in December 2024. But in 2022, when the then speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, Beijing responded angrily by cutting off several channels of communication with the US, including counternarcotics co-operation. It was only last year, when Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in San Francisco, that bilateral talks on fentanyl were re-opened. In the past few months, China has been scheduling fentanyl precursors that have been banned internationally, catching up with moves to block the flow of the chemicals that are used to make fentanyl as well as blocking the flow of the drug itself. This would, in theory, make it easier to crack down on drugs traffickers. China and the US have also agreed to co-operate on tackling money laundering. Chinese and Mexican organised criminal gangs form the financial backbone of the international fentanyl trade. But China insists that the fentanyl crisis is, at its heart, a problem of the US\u2019s own making. \u201cThe root cause of the overdose lies in the US itself, which calls for more effective measures from the US government,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said last month.",

      "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau has called an emergency meeting with provincial premiers across Canada after the US president-elect, Donald Trump, threatened a 25% tariff on the United States\u2019 northern neighbour. Trump posted on social media that he would \u201csign all necessary documents\u201d to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all goods products coming into the United States, adding the levy would remain in place until \u201csuch time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country!\u201d The Canadian prime minister said on Tuesday he had held a \u201cgood\u201d conversation with Trump shortly after the social media post, working to tamp down fears of an immense economic hit to Canada. He did not say if Canada would impose retaliatory tariffs, as it did during a previous round of trade hostilities during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cWe talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together.\u201d Given the United States, Canada and Mexico renegotiated a trade pact in 2018 and have deeply intertwined supply chains, a levy of 25% would prove devastating to Canada\u2019s economy. The United States remains Canada\u2019s biggest trading partner, with nearly C$600bn in goods exported to the US last year. Canadian ministers reacted with measured skepticism over the key claims made by Trump on immigration and drug trafficking. While a small but growing number of migrants are using Canada as a way into the US, far more people enter through Mexico. Canada\u2019s immigration minister, Marc Miller, likened the 23,000 interceptions by US officials at the northern border last year to a \u201csignificant weekend at the Mexico border\u201d, where 1,530,523 \u201cencounters\u201d were recorded last year. When it comes to the movement of fentanyl across the continent, so little enters the US through its northern border that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does not even mention Canada in a report from 2020, instead citing Mexico, China and India. \u201cThe amount of fentanyl that crosses the US-Canadian border is basically homeopathic!\u201d wrote Toronto-based journalist John Michael McGrath on X, critiquing people who \u201csanewash\u201d Trump\u2019s demands. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a serious demand! You don\u2019t have to be stupid in public!\u201d But the rightwing premier of the oil-rich province of Alberta said Trump had valid concerns over illegal activities at the shared border. \u201cWe are calling on the federal government to work with the incoming administration to resolve these issues immediately, thereby avoiding any unnecessary tariffs on Canadian exports to the US,\u201d Danielle Smith said in a social media post. \u201cThe vast majority of Alberta\u2019s energy exports to the US are delivered through secure and safe pipelines which do not in any way contribute to these illegal activities at the border,\u201d said Smith, whose relations with Trudeau are icy. For Trudeau, the tariff saga is likely to revive bitter memories of the trade feud with the US during Trump\u2019s first term, when Canadian officials worked to minimize damage to the prized relationship with the US. At one point, Trump said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the negotiations, singling out Canada\u2019s chief negotiator, the then foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, who now serves as finance minister and deputy prime minister. The threat of Trump\u2019s tariffs pushed Canada\u2019s main stock exchange down on Tuesday and Candace Laing, the head of Canada\u2019s chamber of commerce, warned that \u201cbeing America\u2019s \u2018nice neighbour\u2019 won\u2019t get us anywhere\u201d in a sign of the potential shift in relations between the longtime allies. \u201cTo [Trump], it\u2019s about winners and losers \u2013 with Canada on the losing end,\u201d said Laing in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cCanada\u2019s signature approach needs to evolve: we must be prepared to take a couple of punches if we\u2019re going to stake out our position.

      "bodyText": "We are encouraged to note that Wes Streeting is taking serious steps to stop NHS managers persecuting whistleblowing doctors just because they have raised patient safety concerns (NHS bosses who silence whistleblowers face sack under government plans, 24 November). The unwarranted and widely publicised detriments to some doctors who have spoken up about safety matters over the past 20 years have had serious consequences, despite laws intended to protect them. Trusts must be banned from dismissing doctors who raise patient safety concerns, and obliged to investigate their concerns, which at present are frequently covered up. The employment tribunal system, which some doctors may forlornly engage with to save their careers and livelihoods, is heavily biased against them. If dismissal was banned, most of the massive legal costs borne by the taxpayer would be avoided. In any case, why is the judiciary, which has little or no understanding of patient safety matters, involved if no laws have been broken? The entire law in this area requires revisiting. Mr Streeting has the important task of reviewing the current egregious arrangements. Why are no data formally collected about most of these major issues?

But you just know that when they get in, they just don\u2019t do what they say.\u201d</p> <p>David, nodding, added: \u201cI don\u2019t trust [Keir] Starmer, so that\u2019s why I voted for Reform.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of faith in politics is a running theme among the voters the Guardian interviewed; the vast majority said they would not vote for any party.</p> <p>But of those who would vote, Reform UK supporters were easy to find. It is unsurprising, then, that the party is making loud noises in Wales \u2013 declaring earlier this month it was \u201cleading in Wales\u201d and was now the \u201cofficial opposition\u201d to Labour in the Senedd, which is due to hold elections in May 2026.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/wales-zip/giv-4559RDRDAPxqz05Y\" data-alt=\"Map of Wales\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/11/wales-zip/giv-4559RDRDAPxqz05Y\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>This confidence comes after the party\u2019s Welsh conference in Newport on 8 November, at which time a number of polls suggested encouraging results for the party .</p> <p>The south Wales valleys are home to numerous post-industrial towns that were hit by the decline of the coal industry; similar to other targets in South Yorkshire that the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has also revealed to be in his sights.</p> <p>So if they are to deliver on these forecasts, who do they need to convince and what do they need to campaign on?</p> <p>Olivia Jones, 32, a paramedic who lives in Cwmbran, engages with politics mostly on social media, particularly Instagram. \u201cLots of friends of mine repost reels of different things about the Reform party,\u201d she said, explaining she would consider voting for them.</p> <p>\u201cJust want to vote for someone different,\u201d she said. \u201cI find Nigel Farage speaks more sense to me than a lot of the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a lot to do with the borders. People coming into the country should be vetted properly and [abide] by the right laws. Reform stand strongly on that.\u201d</p> <p>Immigration is an issue frequently mentioned by voters in the town, but not exclusively; many are frustrated with the state of public services, as well as a general apathy and distrust with capital-centric politics, be that London or Cardiff; and many cite the perceived charisma of Farage as a major appeal.</p>    <p>Ian Stevenson, 45, who is originally from Birmingham but now lives in Abergavenny, said: \u201cWhat have Labour done?

      "bodyText": "Crossing Gwent Square on a cold, crisp day in Cwmbran, married couple Maxine and David Griffin have more in common with each other than they did a year ago. In July, the Brexit supporters voted for the Reform UK party in the constituency of Torfaen; it was the first time they had both voted for the same party. Maxine, 52, who works in a cafe, had previously voted Conservative, while her husband, 55, a postal worker and union representative, had always voted Labour. \u201cI used to vote Conservative, but obviously they were so terrible that I wasn\u2019t going to vote for them any more, and Labour \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t vote for Labour anyway,\u201d Maxine said. \u201cFor me, Reform were just more straight talking, say it how it is, whereas I always find Conservative or Labour, they just you what you want to hear. But you just know that when they get in, they just don\u2019t do what they say.\u201d David, nodding, added: \u201cI don\u2019t trust [Keir] Starmer, so that\u2019s why I voted for Reform.\u201d Lack of faith in politics is a running theme among the voters the Guardian interviewed; the vast majority said they would not vote for any party. But of those who would vote, Reform UK supporters were easy to find. It is unsurprising, then, that the party is making loud noises in Wales \u2013 declaring earlier this month it was \u201cleading in Wales\u201d and was now the \u201cofficial opposition\u201d to Labour in the Senedd, which is due to hold elections in May 2026. This confidence comes after the party\u2019s Welsh conference in Newport on 8 November, at which time a number of polls suggested encouraging results for the party . The south Wales valleys are home to numerous post-industrial towns that were hit by the decline of the coal industry; similar to other targets in South Yorkshire that the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has also revealed to be in his sights. So if they are to deliver on these forecasts, who do they need to convince and what do they need to campaign on? Olivia Jones, 32, a paramedic who lives in Cwmbran, engages with politics mostly on social media, particularly Instagram. \u201cLots of friends of mine repost reels of different things about the Reform party,\u201d she said, explaining she would consider voting for them. \u201cJust want to vote for someone different,\u201d she said. \u201cI find Nigel Farage speaks more sense to me than a lot of the others.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot to do with the borders. People coming into the country should be vetted properly and [abide] by the right laws. Reform stand strongly on that.\u201d Immigration is an issue frequently mentioned by voters in the town, but not exclusively; many are frustrated with the state of public services, as well as a general apathy and distrust with capital-centric politics, be that London or Cardiff; and many cite the perceived charisma of Farage as a major appeal. Ian Stevenson, 45, who is originally from Birmingham but now lives in Abergavenny, said: \u201cWhat have Labour done? They\u2019ve taken money off everybody and everything is going up in price \u2013 I just think they\u2019re ruining everything.\u201d Stevenson said he liked Farage and viewed him as an honest person and was attracted by the party\u2019s perceived harder line on immigration. \u201cImmigration is the biggest issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe illegal immigrants and everyone coming in and all the money that\u2019s been spent on them and being taken away from everybody else.\u201d Stevenson, who works in security, said there had been an increase in foreign nationals in Abergavenny, and claimed a rise in assaults in the town of 14,000 people were being committed by such incomers. The Guardian has found no evidence for these claims. \u201cThe only houses in Abergavenny are being given to [foreign nationals],\u201d he said. \u201cPeople that have been waiting for houses all their lives, waiting like in the line, but they [foreign nationals] are coming in and they\u2019re being given the best houses.\u201d The Guardian was again unable to find evidence of these claims. A \u201ctown of sanctuary\u201d has been set up in Abergavenny to better facilitate refugees in the town. According to the group\u2019s website, there are now seven families from Syria and four from Afghanistan. The frustration with Labour controlling the Senedd for 25 years is palpable among many of the voters interviewed. Marilyn Bevan, 65, a carer from Abertillery who has previously voted Labour and never Conservative, said: \u201cLabour doesn\u2019t do anything for where I live.\u201d She cited antisocial behaviour, housing and potholes. \u201cThey\u2019re taking the winter fuel allowance off the pensioners \u2013 I\u2019ll be a pensioner next month. The government now, they give to the rich and penalise working-class people.\u201d On Reform, she said: \u201cI do listen to their views and what they say they would do, I probably would next time give them a chance. \u201cFarage seems to be personable, and has a good sort of character. He seems to be genuine. A lot of them say one thing and don\u2019t carry it out \u2013 he seems to be on most people\u2019s wavelengths.\u201d Bevan said the antisocial behaviour in her town included the use of e-scooters, open drug use and the relentless barking of dogs. \u201cThey know they can get away with it,\u201d Bevan said. \u201cOur concerns are ignored.

Pearson, who was a diesel fitter and worked with lorries before retiring, expressed discontent with public services, citing his wife\u2019s nine-hour wait for an ambulance when she had pneumonia as an example. A poll by Survation, commissioned by Reform UK, put the party at 20% in a Senedd election \u2013 ahead of the Conservatives at 17%, but behind Labour at 30%. A separate unaffiliated poll by Opinium, which was based on Westminster voting intentions, suggested 26% of voters in Wales would vote Reform compared with 24% who would vote Labour, but this was based on a weighted sample of just 86 people from Wales out of 2,116 surveyed.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that HarperCollins had reached an agreement with Microsoft to allow some of its titles to be used to train AI models, with the permission of authors. \u201cOur goal is to empower authors\u201d, a representative from Spines told the Guardian. \u201cWithout Spines, an aspiring author usually approaches a publishing agency when 99% of authors are refused, as they are not celebrities or connected to the right people. \u201cThose disappointed authors can turn to vanity publishing and pay between $10,000 and $50,000 for a single book, or go the route of self-publishing which requires their expertise in each task such as designing the cover, marketing the book and on and on. This process can take between 6 and 18 months. Using technology, Spines streamlines the process of publishing a book, allowing the authors to focus on what they do best: write great stories.\u201d Spines is \u201clevelling the playing field for any person who aspires to be an author to get published within less than three weeks and at a fraction of the cost. Our goal is to help 1 million authors to publish their books using technology,\u201d the representative added. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 November 2024 to include a response from Spines that was received after publication. A reference to the company raising $16m in \u201cseed funding\u201d was corrected; that sum was raised in a subsequent funding round. The subheading of an earlier version said books would be \u201cedited\u201d with the help of AI; Spines\u2019 software offers options to revise the style and length of a manuscript using AI, but the company told the Guardian that \u201cif an author would like to undergo an editing process with Spines, it would be done solely by a human editor\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Public health officials in California detected bird flu in a sample of raw milk this month. The virus first spread to dairy cattle in the US in March. The discovery comes amid an increasingly heated public debate about the merits and drawbacks of raw milk. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist and Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of health and human services (HHS), is a proponent of raw milk and has claimed that as HHS secretary, he will support farmers who sell it. At the same time, public health experts have continued to advise against drinking raw milk, which is more likely to contain an array of harmful bacteria. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What is raw milk and why are people talking about it? Raw milk comes straight from the cow (or sheep or goat) and has not been pasteurized. Developed by Louis Pasteur at the end of the 19th century to help kill harmful bacteria in wine, pasteurization is the process of heating liquids in order to eliminate harmful pathogens and make them safe to drink. Raw milk has been a popular topic in social media wellness circles for some time. Take one TikTok video posted in 2023 by a supplement company called Heart and Soil. In it, three young people toss a gallon of (presumably raw) milk to each other, take a deep swig, and say things like, \u201cRaw milk is generally misunderstood by most people,\u201d and \u201cUnfortunately, most of the milk you find in grocery stores is pasteurized.\u201d In another, Paul Saladino, a popular fitness influencer also known as Carnivore MD, shirtlessly sings the supposed praises of raw milk, saying, \u201cThis is nothing like that pasteurized, homogenized milk you get in the store, guys.\u201d In these videos, the word \u201cpasteurized\u201d is uttered with a sneer that suggests it\u2019s a dangerous byproduct of humankind\u2019s gluttonous perversions, the way you might say \u201cmicroplastics\u201d or \u201cMountain Dew Code Red\u201d. This negativity seems to tap into the anxiety many consumers feel about ultra-processed foods. We regularly hear that the modern grocery store is a repository of food-like substances, and that one must practice constant vigilance to avoid them. But pasteurization does not reduce milk\u2019s nutritional value to that of a soda. Is raw milk safe to drink? Food safety experts are \u201cabsolutely horrified\u201d by the growing raw milk trend, says Dr Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cPasteurizing milk is one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century,\u201d Nestle says. \u201cDrinking cow\u2019s milk used to kill babies.\u201d Nestle adds that she thinks the embrace of raw milk goes beyond an anxiety about ultra-processed foods \u2013 which pasteurized milk, she underscores, is not. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the whole anti-authoritarian, anti-science, anti-expertise waves that we\u2019re seeing in this country right now.\u201d Raw milk\u2019s adherents claim it has more vitamins and minerals than pasteurized milk. The CDC disputes this, saying \u201cscientists do not have any evidence that shows a nutritional benefit from raw milk,\u201d and that \u201craw milk can carry harmful germs, such as campylobacter, cryptosporidium, E coli, listeria, brucella, and salmonella\u201d. These germs can lead to food poisoning and symptoms such as diarrhea, stomach cramping, vomiting, fever, headaches and body aches. A popular rejoinder from raw milk fans is that humans were drinking untreated milk for centuries before Pasteur came along.

      "body": "<p>It started in my mid-30s: The Great Slipping Away. Gradually, and then suddenly, the friends I had in New York started to disappear. Some moved out of the city. Others moved into different phases of their lives: they became laser-focused on their careers and had no spare time. Or they had kids, and hanging out became harder.</p> <p>Then I became one of the people who had kids and moved out of the city and <em>all </em>my local friends slipped away. A couple of years ago I moved to Philadelphia, a city where my wife and I only vaguely knew a grand total of two people. We were drawn to Philly by its affordability but we underestimated just how difficult it is to build a new community from scratch. As an introverted freelancer who doesn\u2019t have colleagues I see every day (even if just over Zoom), I certainly didn\u2019t anticipate how much effort I would have to make if I didn\u2019t want to become a complete hermit.</p> <p>This is the point where if I was really strategic and angling for a self-help book deal, I\u2019d tell you I had figured out a brilliant technique to make new friends when you\u2019re over 40. Perhaps I would borrow from the bestselling book The Secret and say all you need to do is <em>manifest </em>those new friends and they will magically appear. Or if you do enough cold plunges \u2013 which are very hot with the wellness crowd \u2013 the endorphins you release will turn you into an extrovert.</p> <p>Alas, there isn\u2019t any secret to making new friends as an adult. Having kids and a dog definitely helps you meet people, and beyond the playground and park, the formula for making new friends is pretty obvious. First, consistently go somewhere where you will see the same people \u2013 a gym or a book club, for example. Then talk to those people. After repeating these steps enough times, you will eventually make some new friends.</p> <p>That\u2019s the theory, anyway. Putting it into practice can prove more difficult. When I first moved to Philadelphia I did step one of the Friendship Formula and joined a gym. But unless you are obnoxiously extroverted it\u2019s difficult to strike up conversation with someone during most gym activities. In the end, I ended up talking to strangers only twice. The first was in the steam room when a woman, quite unprompted, started telling me all about mitochondria. The second was when I was naked and panicking in the locker room because I couldn\u2019t find my clothes. Screeching \u201cI can\u2019t find my clothes\u201d at strangers is not exactly a good way to win friends and influence people.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t say this was the only reason I eventually left that gym, but it was certainly a contributing factor. Still, it worked out, because I ended up somewhere else that offered squash lessons. I took one on a whim and, to my surprise, became obsessed. It is an incredibly addictive sport \u2013 indeed, Prince Philip <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1359713/Queen-news-heartbreak-Royal-Family-Prince-Charles-birth-Prince-Philip-snub-latest-vn\">even missed King Charles\u2019s birth</a> (which took more than 30 hours) because he was playing squash with his private secretary. Although, to be fair, that\u2019s probably not the only reason he missed the birth. Anyway, I don\u2019t have a private secretary to play with, so I have developed a creepy new habit of hanging around the squash courts and forcing my phone number on anyone I meet who is about my level. I don\u2019t suddenly have a new pack of best friends for ever (yet), but I definitely have a much better social life and have become far happier.</p> <p>If there is some magic secret to making new friends, it\u2019s probably this: enthusiasm is everything. If you find something you are genuinely excited about then it\u2019s much easier to find a community. Forcing yourself to try new things is also key. I\u2019ve never thought of myself as sporty and if you had told me a year ago that I\u2019d be watching squash videos in my spare time, I would have scoffed. But now I love it. Even though \u201clove\u201d is still my final score in a lot of games.</p> <p>\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Others moved into different phases of their lives: they became laser-focused on their careers and had no spare time. Or they had kids, and hanging out became harder. Then I became one of the people who had kids and moved out of the city and all my local friends slipped away. A couple of years ago I moved to Philadelphia, a city where my wife and I only vaguely knew a grand total of two people. We were drawn to Philly by its affordability but we underestimated just how difficult it is to build a new community from scratch. As an introverted freelancer who doesn\u2019t have colleagues I see every day (even if just over Zoom), I certainly didn\u2019t anticipate how much effort I would have to make if I didn\u2019t want to become a complete hermit. This is the point where if I was really strategic and angling for a self-help book deal, I\u2019d tell you I had figured out a brilliant technique to make new friends when you\u2019re over 40. Perhaps I would borrow from the bestselling book The Secret and say all you need to do is manifest those new friends and they will magically appear. Or if you do enough cold plunges \u2013 which are very hot with the wellness crowd \u2013 the endorphins you release will turn you into an extrovert. Alas, there isn\u2019t any secret to making new friends as an adult. Having kids and a dog definitely helps you meet people, and beyond the playground and park, the formula for making new friends is pretty obvious. First, consistently go somewhere where you will see the same people \u2013 a gym or a book club, for example. Then talk to those people. After repeating these steps enough times, you will eventually make some new friends. That\u2019s the theory, anyway. Putting it into practice can prove more difficult. When I first moved to Philadelphia I did step one of the Friendship Formula and joined a gym. But unless you are obnoxiously extroverted it\u2019s difficult to strike up conversation with someone during most gym activities. In the end, I ended up talking to strangers only twice. The first was in the steam room when a woman, quite unprompted, started telling me all about mitochondria. The second was when I was naked and panicking in the locker room because I couldn\u2019t find my clothes. Screeching \u201cI can\u2019t find my clothes\u201d at strangers is not exactly a good way to win friends and influence people. I wouldn\u2019t say this was the only reason I eventually left that gym, but it was certainly a contributing factor. Still, it worked out, because I ended up somewhere else that offered squash lessons. I took one on a whim and, to my surprise, became obsessed. It is an incredibly addictive sport \u2013 indeed, Prince Philip even missed King Charles\u2019s birth (which took more than 30 hours) because he was playing squash with his private secretary. Although, to be fair, that\u2019s probably not the only reason he missed the birth. Anyway, I don\u2019t have a private secretary to play with, so I have developed a creepy new habit of hanging around the squash courts and forcing my phone number on anyone I meet who is about my level. I don\u2019t suddenly have a new pack of best friends for ever (yet), but I definitely have a much better social life and have become far happier. If there is some magic secret to making new friends, it\u2019s probably this: enthusiasm is everything. If you find something you are genuinely excited about then it\u2019s much easier to find a community. Forcing yourself to try new things is also key. I\u2019ve never thought of myself as sporty and if you had told me a year ago that I\u2019d be watching squash videos in my spare time, I would have scoffed. But now I love it. Even though \u201clove\u201d is still my final score in a lot of games. \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>In the first weeks of the pandemic, Maryam Tafakory set herself the task of watching 417 films made in post-revolution Iran. She soon found something curious: the recurring use of bags. Objects such as bags are often deployed by film-makers as substitutes for actual physical contact between a man and a woman, in a country where such depictions of intimacy are prohibited.</p> <p>Focusing on films spanning nearly three decades, the UK-based artist built on research she originally began three years earlier for her PhD, to create several films and video essays. The first is Irani Bag, which uses a clip from a 1992 Iranian production, The Song of Tehran and features a couple seen from behind each holding a strap from the same bag, instead of taking each other\u2019s hands. \u201cLearning to touch without touching,\u201d says a text inserted alongside split-screen videos in the 2020 work. In another clip, a bag is used to separate two actors sat on the back of a motorbike.</p>    <p>\u201cI grew up with this archive,\u201d says Tafakory, who has just won the 2024 <a href=\"https://filmlondon.org.uk/flamin/the-jarman-award\">Film London Jarman award</a> and its \u00a310,000 prize. \u201cThese are films I both fell in love with and felt betrayed by. Irani Bag uses a simple prop, bags, to suggest that censorship often does the opposite of what it intends. It\u2019s in the prohibition of touch that words, objects and glances conspire; they become mediators, skin prosthetics \u2013 and sensual. They remind us that touch is never erased, but fetishised.\u201d</p> <p>Tafakory, whose work mixes cinema and live performance, created a series that she calls \u201ca rage against the archive\u201d. Using techniques including mirroring, inversion and superimposition, she creates layered compositions and collages replete with sonic textures from archival sound, as well as on-screen texts.</p> <p>Irani Bag was followed in 2022 by Nazarbazi, focusing on images of women \u201cwhose bodies have been obscured and victimised\u201d, then by Mast-del, a blend of fiction and non-fiction that uses both original and found footage. It is about a forbidden relationship between two women, a subject that can never get censors\u2019 approval in Tafakory\u2019s homeland.</p> <p>Born and raised in Iran, Tafakory\u2019s upbringing coincided with a relative opening-up of Iranian cinema, when the number of newspapers appearing in stands also significantly increased. Iranian cinema, she says, \u201cis glorified in the west for its allegorical resistance, while at home it faces criticism for its complicity with state repression, acceptance of censorship, and normalisation of gendered violence\u201d.</p>    <p>She goes on: \u201cI wanted to make something that doesn\u2019t fall into this reductive binary. I\u2019m not interested in clarifying cinematic codes for non-Iranians. My films resist the oversimplifications often found in western misreadings of Iranian cinema.\u201d</p> <p>Tafakory\u2019s latest work, Razeh-Del<em>,</em> tells the story of Iran\u2019s first women\u2019s newspaper, Zan (Woman), which was published briefly from 1998 to 1999. Two schoolgirls send a letter to the newspaper, \u201cthe synopsis for an impossible film\u201d, in an echo of the illicit love story in Mast-del.</p> <p>Razeh-Del is dominated by saturated hues of amethyst, crimson and amber, interrupted by snippets of fleeting newspaper clips and texts primarily taken from the newspaper\u2019s readers\u2019 comments column. The film highlights the erasure of women from both the cinema and the press. \u201cThe court\u2019s verdict against Zan is fair,\u201d comments one reader, \u201cyou deserve harsher condemnation.\u201d </p>    <p>Tafakory, who deploys \u201can overdose of words\u201d in the work\u2019s four parallel story lines, says many reader comments targeted the very title of the newspaper, as well as \u201cits appearance, ink colours and fonts\u201d.</p> <p>Tafakory is revisiting the archive \u201cto write on to them the stories they never told us, and talk about what has always been buried in plain sight. I want these images to confess. Misogyny and the absence of queer narratives are inseparable from the identity of post-revolution Iranian cinema.\u201d</p> <p>For her generation, cinema seemed \u201can escape from the police at home, the ones at school, the ones on the streets\u201d. Even in the dark of a theatre room, \u201cthere were watchmen who would come with a torch\u201d. She realised later in life that cinema \u201cwas often an escape to a deeper form of repression\u201d.</p> <p>Tafakory dropped out of her university in Iran in 2007, then did the same when she went to Southampton University to study computer science. She later secured her master\u2019s in fine art at Oxford before doing a PhD at Kingston University.</p> <p>During our hour-long interview, which took place just before the Jarman winner was announced, Tafakory came across as meticulous, particularly with words. \u201cI would prefer to be with a pen and paper,\u201d she says, explaining why she rarely does interviews. She walks a tightrope both in her work and the interview. Irani Bag, in its title, contains a subtle reference to a popular Iranian TV series named The English Bag. Aired in 1999, it\u2019s about British interference in the Iranian politics of the pre-revolution era.</p>    <p>She remains critical of how Iran is portrayed in the west. \u201cThe stories and images of Iranian women have long been co-opted and manipulated to serve a western agenda,\u201d she says, especially \u201cwhen they align with their aim to widen the conflict in the Middle East.\u201d</p> <p>In a reference to the Woman, Life, Freedom movement, Tafakory feels compelled to give people this reminder: \u201cIranian women\u2019s resistance neither began nor ended in 2022. Woman, Life, Freedom changed something that cannot be unchanged. We have already imagined a freedom that cinema never dared to.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Films by all six of this year\u2019s Jarman award nominees will be screened on 30 November and 1 December <a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/events/jarman-award-touring-screening-programme-2024/\">at the Whitechapel Gallery, London</a><em>.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the first weeks of the pandemic, Maryam Tafakory set herself the task of watching 417 films made in post-revolution Iran. She soon found something curious: the recurring use of bags. Objects such as bags are often deployed by film-makers as substitutes for actual physical contact between a man and a woman, in a country where such depictions of intimacy are prohibited. Focusing on films spanning nearly three decades, the UK-based artist built on research she originally began three years earlier for her PhD, to create several films and video essays. The first is Irani Bag, which uses a clip from a 1992 Iranian production, The Song of Tehran and features a couple seen from behind each holding a strap from the same bag, instead of taking each other\u2019s hands. \u201cLearning to touch without touching,\u201d says a text inserted alongside split-screen videos in the 2020 work. In another clip, a bag is used to separate two actors sat on the back of a motorbike. \u201cI grew up with this archive,\u201d says Tafakory, who has just won the 2024 Film London Jarman award and its \u00a310,000 prize. \u201cThese are films I both fell in love with and felt betrayed by. Irani Bag uses a simple prop, bags, to suggest that censorship often does the opposite of what it intends. It\u2019s in the prohibition of touch that words, objects and glances conspire; they become mediators, skin prosthetics \u2013 and sensual. They remind us that touch is never erased, but fetishised.\u201d Tafakory, whose work mixes cinema and live performance, created a series that she calls \u201ca rage against the archive\u201d. Using techniques including mirroring, inversion and superimposition, she creates layered compositions and collages replete with sonic textures from archival sound, as well as on-screen texts. Irani Bag was followed in 2022 by Nazarbazi, focusing on images of women \u201cwhose bodies have been obscured and victimised\u201d, then by Mast-del, a blend of fiction and non-fiction that uses both original and found footage. It is about a forbidden relationship between two women, a subject that can never get censors\u2019 approval in Tafakory\u2019s homeland. Born and raised in Iran, Tafakory\u2019s upbringing coincided with a relative opening-up of Iranian cinema, when the number of newspapers appearing in stands also significantly increased. Iranian cinema, she says, \u201cis glorified in the west for its allegorical resistance, while at home it faces criticism for its complicity with state repression, acceptance of censorship, and normalisation of gendered violence\u201d. She goes on: \u201cI wanted to make something that doesn\u2019t fall into this reductive binary. I\u2019m not interested in clarifying cinematic codes for non-Iranians. My films resist the oversimplifications often found in western misreadings of Iranian cinema.\u201d Tafakory\u2019s latest work, Razeh-Del, tells the story of Iran\u2019s first women\u2019s newspaper, Zan (Woman), which was published briefly from 1998 to 1999. Two schoolgirls send a letter to the newspaper, \u201cthe synopsis for an impossible film\u201d, in an echo of the illicit love story in Mast-del. Razeh-Del is dominated by saturated hues of amethyst, crimson and amber, interrupted by snippets of fleeting newspaper clips and texts primarily taken from the newspaper\u2019s readers\u2019 comments column. The film highlights the erasure of women from both the cinema and the press. \u201cThe court\u2019s verdict against Zan is fair,\u201d comments one reader, \u201cyou deserve harsher condemnation.\u201d Tafakory, who deploys \u201can overdose of words\u201d in the work\u2019s four parallel story lines, says many reader comments targeted the very title of the newspaper, as well as \u201cits appearance, ink colours and fonts\u201d. Tafakory is revisiting the archive \u201cto write on to them the stories they never told us, and talk about what has always been buried in plain sight. I want these images to confess. Misogyny and the absence of queer narratives are inseparable from the identity of post-revolution Iranian cinema.\u201d For her generation, cinema seemed \u201can escape from the police at home, the ones at school, the ones on the streets\u201d. Even in the dark of a theatre room, \u201cthere were watchmen who would come with a torch\u201d. She realised later in life that cinema \u201cwas often an escape to a deeper form of repression\u201d. Tafakory dropped out of her university in Iran in 2007, then did the same when she went to Southampton University to study computer science. She later secured her master\u2019s in fine art at Oxford before doing a PhD at Kingston University. During our hour-long interview, which took place just before the Jarman winner was announced, Tafakory came across as meticulous, particularly with words. \u201cI would prefer to be with a pen and paper,\u201d she says, explaining why she rarely does interviews. She walks a tightrope both in her work and the interview. Irani Bag, in its title, contains a subtle reference to a popular Iranian TV series named The English Bag. Aired in 1999, it\u2019s about British interference in the Iranian politics of the pre-revolution era. She remains critical of how Iran is portrayed in the west. \u201cThe stories and images of Iranian women have long been co-opted and manipulated to serve a western agenda,\u201d she says, especially \u201cwhen they align with their aim to widen the conflict in the Middle East.\u201d In a reference to the Woman, Life, Freedom movement, Tafakory feels compelled to give people this reminder: \u201cIranian women\u2019s resistance neither began nor ended in 2022. Woman, Life, Freedom changed something that cannot be unchanged. We have already imagined a freedom that cinema never dared to.\u201d \u2022 Films by all six of this year\u2019s Jarman award nominees will be screened on 30 November and 1 December at the Whitechapel Gallery, London.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>LADS, IT\u2019S FOOTBALL DAILY</strong></h2> <p>Previously described as \u201cschoolyard stuff, mate\u201d by Ange Postecoglou, the first recorded use of the term \u2018Spursy\u2019 is unknown but is believed to date back approximately 11 years. The dictionary \u2013 well, <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Spursy\">Urban Dictionary</a> \u2013 has plenty of entries describing the soft underbelly and lack of backbone that has been the hallmark of Tottenham teams going back far longer than a decade. Students of its etymology believe it may have its origins in the three-word pre-match \u201cLads, it\u2019s Tottenham\u201d address to his Manchester United players by Sir Alex Ferguson before a meeting between the two sides at Old Trafford at some point during the 12 years Roy Keane played for the club.</p> <p>It was the Irishman who first drew public attention to the sneeringly dismissive exhortation in one of his autobiographies, as a nod to his former manager\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d appreciation that little more needed to be said for a game against opposition so uniquely famous in English football for their ability to inexplicably capitulate that the adjective used to describe their apparently never-ending cycle of wildly vacillating performances is actually named after them. On and on it goes to this day, with Spurs pulling one of their finest performances of the Premier League era out of the bag against the reigning champions, having previously contrived to lose what pretty much everyone presumed to be a home gimme against Ipswich Town. Buoyed with confidence, they will go into their next top-flight game fully expecting to win at home in a game they will almost certainly lose because \u201cLads, it\u2019s Tottenham\u201d and that\u2019s what Tottenham do.</p> <p>In the 15 years that have elapsed since Juande Ramos, the last man to mastermind a trophy win for the club who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/13/juande-ramos-tottenham-hotspur-dnipro\">unceremoniously bounced out</a> of White Hart Lane, Tottenham have had eight full-time managers, each of whom has tried to insert something resembling a backbone into this ever-evolving but always fragile squad of consistently underachieving show-ponies with questionable big-game temperament. And to a man and in various different ways, each one of Harry Redknapp, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Tim Sherwood (was that a dream?), Mauricio Pochettino, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, Antonio Cont\u00e9 and Postecoglou have failed. But while Big Ange has bought himself more time to find some way of eliminating the flimsiness for which Tottenham has long been a byword from his squad, results this season already suggest he is unlikely to succeed.</p> <p>Between them, Ipswich and Crystal Palace have won two games this season, with both those victories coming against a Spurs team that has won nine and lost 10 of their past 20 league games. In three different competitions over the past 30 days, Tottenham have beaten Manchester City twice, come out second best in a five-goal thriller in Turkey and lost against two of the bottom three sides in the Premier League. \u201cWhen you hear fans and neutrals talk about Tottenham, they often say, \u2018Soft, weak \u2026 bottle it, Spursy \u2013 all that rubbish\u2019, I think the last couple of weeks shows we might be going in a slightly different direction,\u201d mused James Maddison, last September after he and his teammates had achieved a battling win against Sheffield United and not lost a north London derby. All that rubbish? Before Saturday\u2019s home defeat at the hands of Fulham \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/shock-for-tottenham-as-guglielmo-vicario-has-surgery-on-fractured-ankle\">this definitely won\u2019t help</a> \u2013 the good ship Spursyness appears to be firmly back on course.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join John Brewin for live Bigger Cup coverage of Manchester City 5-0 Feyenoord at 8pm GMT, while Niall McVeigh will be on clockwatch duty at the same time with goal updates from the day\u2019s other matches.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Olaf Janssen will be the first coach in professional football to be mic\u2019d up on 8 December.

      "bodyText": "LADS, IT\u2019S FOOTBALL DAILY Previously described as \u201cschoolyard stuff, mate\u201d by Ange Postecoglou, the first recorded use of the term \u2018Spursy\u2019 is unknown but is believed to date back approximately 11 years. The dictionary \u2013 well, Urban Dictionary \u2013 has plenty of entries describing the soft underbelly and lack of backbone that has been the hallmark of Tottenham teams going back far longer than a decade. Students of its etymology believe it may have its origins in the three-word pre-match \u201cLads, it\u2019s Tottenham\u201d address to his Manchester United players by Sir Alex Ferguson before a meeting between the two sides at Old Trafford at some point during the 12 years Roy Keane played for the club. It was the Irishman who first drew public attention to the sneeringly dismissive exhortation in one of his autobiographies, as a nod to his former manager\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d appreciation that little more needed to be said for a game against opposition so uniquely famous in English football for their ability to inexplicably capitulate that the adjective used to describe their apparently never-ending cycle of wildly vacillating performances is actually named after them. On and on it goes to this day, with Spurs pulling one of their finest performances of the Premier League era out of the bag against the reigning champions, having previously contrived to lose what pretty much everyone presumed to be a home gimme against Ipswich Town. Buoyed with confidence, they will go into their next top-flight game fully expecting to win at home in a game they will almost certainly lose because \u201cLads, it\u2019s Tottenham\u201d and that\u2019s what Tottenham do. In the 15 years that have elapsed since Juande Ramos, the last man to mastermind a trophy win for the club who was unceremoniously bounced out of White Hart Lane, Tottenham have had eight full-time managers, each of whom has tried to insert something resembling a backbone into this ever-evolving but always fragile squad of consistently underachieving show-ponies with questionable big-game temperament. And to a man and in various different ways, each one of Harry Redknapp, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Tim Sherwood (was that a dream?), Mauricio Pochettino, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, Antonio Cont\u00e9 and Postecoglou have failed. But while Big Ange has bought himself more time to find some way of eliminating the flimsiness for which Tottenham has long been a byword from his squad, results this season already suggest he is unlikely to succeed. Between them, Ipswich and Crystal Palace have won two games this season, with both those victories coming against a Spurs team that has won nine and lost 10 of their past 20 league games. In three different competitions over the past 30 days, Tottenham have beaten Manchester City twice, come out second best in a five-goal thriller in Turkey and lost against two of the bottom three sides in the Premier League. \u201cWhen you hear fans and neutrals talk about Tottenham, they often say, \u2018Soft, weak \u2026 bottle it, Spursy \u2013 all that rubbish\u2019, I think the last couple of weeks shows we might be going in a slightly different direction,\u201d mused James Maddison, last September after he and his teammates had achieved a battling win against Sheffield United and not lost a north London derby. All that rubbish? Before Saturday\u2019s home defeat at the hands of Fulham \u2013 and this definitely won\u2019t help \u2013 the good ship Spursyness appears to be firmly back on course.

If there\u2019s one thing that a multi-billion-pound industry like the Premier League desperately needs, it\u2019s the ability to get the government-subsidised labour of people who \u2018will lose their benefits if they refuse to take up opportunities\u2019. And note, of course, that opportunities means \u2018work or training\u2019. Or, as we used to call it in the olden days, \u2018general dogsbody, making tea and photocopying\u2019\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Manchester City becoming \u2018Spursy\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Football Daily letters)? Please! City invented that concept. Does no one remember \u2018typical City\u2019? We have always been able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory\u201d \u2013 Pat Condreay. Firstly, kudos to Spurs\u2019 Guglielmo Vicario for keeping a clean sheet against City despite playing an hour on a broken ankle. Now that he\u2019s going to be recuperating from surgery for a wee while, will he be living Vicario-usly through Fraser Forster? Sod it, I\u2019m not even a little bit sorry\u201d \u2013 Derek McGee. When spelling out a phrase, such as \u2018fair market value\u2019, followed by its abbreviation in brackets (FMV), it is common practice to then use said abbreviation in any further use if the phrase. In your article on the Premier League v Manchester City (Friday\u2019s Football Daily) you failed to follow this protocol, and spelled out \u2018fair market value\u2019 in the subsequent paragraph, thus wasting a number of key strokes. And I\u2019ve wasted something like 465 writing this email\u201d \u2013 John Ellen. Send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today\u2019s letter o\u2019 the day winner is \u2026 Derek McGee, who lands their very own piece of Football Weekly merch. Terms and conditions for our competitions can be viewed here.

Titled Amy Sherald: American Sublime, the show collects nearly 50 of her works across the major sweep of her career since 2007, including the aforementioned portraits of Obama and Taylor. The show also features newly commissioned work that Sherald is debuting \u2013 these include the opening triptych Ecclesia (The Meeting of Inheritance and Horizons), as well as the closer Trans Forming Liberty in which Sherald poses a trans woman as the Statue of Liberty.</p> <p>For Sherald, this show marks the realization of a longstanding goal. She said in a video interview that she recalled hoping that she would have her first major museum show at either the SFMOMA or the Whitney in New York \u2013 the exact two places where American Sublime will be seen. \u201cI wrote in one of my many journals that I wanted my first museum show to be at the SFMOMA or the Whitney,\u201d she said. \u201cI started making work for the Whitney 10 years ago \u2013 I would just tell myself: \u2018This painting right here is going to go into the Whitney.\u2019 And lo and behold, now it will.\u201d</p>    <p>The exhibition curator, Sarah Roberts, said the connecting thread of Sherald\u2019s many years of creativity was to represent the lives of everyday Black Americans. \u201cHer central premise is to insert Black stories into the stories of American art,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cStories that haven\u2019t been told in art history, but that also haven\u2019t been told in popular media, popular culture. Just everyday stories of Black people being themselves and going about their lives.\u201d</p> <p>To that end, Sherald chose to frame Breonna Taylor as a prototypical American \u201cgirl next door\u201d, dressing her in a flowing light blue dress and situating her against a calming blue background. The portrait, which appeared on the cover of the August 2020 issue of Vanity Fair (visitors to the exhibit can browse a copy of the magazine situated near the painting), is less about Taylor as an icon than who she was on a personal level. In preparing for this work, Sherald assiduously studied Taylor\u2019s social media presence and connected with her family and boyfriend in order to develop a deep sense of who she was.</p> <p>The use of social media is crucial to Sherald\u2019s method of creating, in part because she is immunocompromised, having received a heart transplant in December 2012 at the age of 39. Since that time, and particularly in light of the Covid pandemic, the internet has become central to her creative practice. \u201cBetween having to increase my productivity and Covid \u2013 being an immune-suppressed person with a heart transplant \u2013 I couldn\u2019t really go out into spaces and be where you would find subjects,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to find different ways to find people, and it turned out social media was the easiest way to do that.\u201d</p>    <p>With the exceptions of the portraits of Obama and Taylor, Sherald typically creates imagined narratives for her subjects, taking inspiration from visual media like TikTok and Instagram, and carefully dressing and arranging her models before painting them. Her goal is to populate the art world with images of Black individuals. \u201cI wanted to think very strategically about what kind of voice I would have in the art world,\u201d Sherald said. \u201cI spent a year just trying to figure out what that would be. I developed this idea that, when I look at art history, for the most part I don\u2019t see portraits of people that look like me. So it started there.\u201d</p> <p>Sherald\u2019s precision shines through in her paintings, as each of her subjects is meticulously dressed, their outfits offering deep indications of their personality, social situation, and the larger narratives that they are a part of. Across the years of her creative output, she had made countless variations on the theme of the Black portrait, imagining new futures for the Black community. Seeing all of these paintings together is a remarkable experience, one that Sherald really relishes. \u201cSometimes I joke around and say: \u2018I\u2019m creating this army.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wait to be in a space where all of these paintings could be together and be in discourse with each other all at once and create this landscape of figures. It\u2019s super exciting.\u201d</p>    <p>The show\u2019s title comes in part from the poetry book of the same name by the poet Elizabeth Alexander, a Pulitzer finalist in 2005. Sherald characterized the volume as one that took on the absence of Black people from landscapes, a concern that is dear to her own artistic practice. Beyond evoking that title, Sherald also said the title American Sublime pointed to the larger project of highlighting Black resilience against a social order that has largely been oppressive in nature for the group. \u201cSublimity in Black life can be seen in our ability to persist and thrive despite historical and ongoing systemic oppression,\u201d she stated. \u201cOur experience are marked by moments of transcendence and joy \u2013 beauty amid struggle, and that is the sublime.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to engaging profoundly with the struggle for a world in which Black people can thrive, American Sublime also strikes notes in support of the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community. The large-scale 2022 piece For Love, and for Country greets visitors as they make their way into the show\u2019s first gallery \u2013 Sherald reimagines Alfred Eisenstaedt\u2019s famous 1945 photograph V-J Day in Times Square, in which a triumphant sailor returning from duty in Europe bends a woman back to kiss her in the heart of Manhattan. Here, it is two Black male sailors kissing \u2013 a nod both to the many Black soldiers whose contributions to the second world war were not recognized, as well as to the struggles for civil rights of the queer community.</p>    <p>\u201cAmy has thought a lot about her role as an artist and the need for representation, and she has long been a champion of LGBTQ+ rights,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cThis work is thinking about who gets depicted as being American. She was painting this work in 2020 and 2021, when all these laws were being passed, when there was a lot of hate and violence against the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition is closed out by the equally huge painting Trans Forming Liberty, which Sherald was inspired to produce after witnessing the transition of a transgender friend. \u201cThe platform I have is an important one,\u201d she said, \u201cknowing this painting will be in a museum that is pushing us to understand our place in society and what\u2019s valuable. When I think about America, I think about transgender people \u2013 I wanted trans people to be a part of the conversation that I\u2019m having.\u201d</p> <p>For the piece, Sherald worked with a trans model named Arewa, originally meaning to paint her in an entirely different way than as the Statue of Liberty. But as the model took on different dresses and poses, Sherald was immediately intrigued when she adopted a posture like that of Lady Liberty. She asked her assistant to quickly grab a roll of paper towels, which she instructed Arewa to hold aloft like a torch, and they made a photo of the scene for later. \u201cIt ended up being the one that felt so right for this moment, \u201cshe said. \u201cEspecially after the election of Donald Trump \u2013 it\u2019s a community that is so vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Amy Sherald: American Sublime is a masterful exhibition that should be seen \u2013 either on its west coast run at the SFMOMA or when it makes its way to the Whitney in the spring of 2025. It is a testament to both capturing the lived experience of Black people in the US and and to imagining better futures for them. \u201cThis work is about wanting to create narratives and recognizing the power of storytelling,\u201d said Sherald. \u201cI wanted to harness that to create something that could be useful and beautiful \u2013 fantastical and free and frolicky.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Amy Sherald: American Sublime is now on show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art until 9 March 2025 and will open at the Whitney in New York City on 9 April 2025</p></li> </ul>",

Farmers have said this will make it difficult for them to run their businesses in an environmentally friendly way.</p> <p>The grants offer funding for specific environmental measures on farms such as tree-planting and maintenance, badger gates so the animals can get through fences without causing damage and wildlife boxes for creatures to nest in.</p> <p>Lake district cattle farmer Andrea Meanwell said: \u201cWe have made changes to our grazing, management and breeds to plan for the agricultural transition but this is all very challenging.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Stanley, head of sustainable farming at the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust\u2019s Allerton Project, added: \u201cWhat a situation; the government changes the entire social contract with farmers to make them deliver for the environment, then cuts the funding off when farmers rise to the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>Government sources said the funding had been halted due to budget constraints.</p> <p>This comes as the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2024/nov/21/starmer-and-the-farmers-revolt-politics-weekly-uk\">faces protest</a> from farmers over changes to inheritance tax that would lead to those who inherit the family farm paying a 20% levy on the value of the business above \u00a31m. As farm income is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/14/farm-income-england-2023-extreme-weather-subsidy-cuts\">low and falling</a>, particularly compared with the value of land, farmers have argued the repayments will be impossible to make.</p> <p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, met the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Tom Bradshaw, on Monday to discuss changes to the tax regime to make it fairer to elderly farmers, including changing the rules over gifts so farm owners over a certain age do not have to live for seven years after they pass it down to their children.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Defra confirmed the capital grants scheme review: \u201cWe will simplify and rationalise our grant funding, ensuring that grants are targeted towards those who need them most and where they can deliver the most benefit for food security and nature.\u201d</p> <p>The news comes after Rachel Reeves\u2019s cuts to farming subsidies were larger than expected. Data from the Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC) shows cuts to government payments have fallen far more sharply than expected. After Brexit, ministers pledged to slowly phase out the land area-based payments that the EU gave out under the common agricultural policy. This was to allow farmers to transition to a new system of being paid for action on nature \u2013 such as planting hedgerows and looking after the soil \u2013 without a huge financial shock and potentially going bust.</p> <p>However, the chancellor announced a cut of 79% to these payments. Farmers were expecting a more tapered cut: the AIC data shows that, at the top end of the scale, a farmer receiving \u00a362,000 last year was expecting \u00a338,000 this year but would now be getting \u00a37,200. For farmers on tight margins, this change could wipe out profits.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Grants promised to farmers in England for planting hedges and cleaning up waterways have been frozen by the government. The capital grants scheme, which was opened by the government to allow farmers to invest in infrastructure such as slurry storage so animal excrement does not go into rivers, has been abruptly paused. Farmers have said this will make it difficult for them to run their businesses in an environmentally friendly way. The grants offer funding for specific environmental measures on farms such as tree-planting and maintenance, badger gates so the animals can get through fences without causing damage and wildlife boxes for creatures to nest in. Lake district cattle farmer Andrea Meanwell said: \u201cWe have made changes to our grazing, management and breeds to plan for the agricultural transition but this is all very challenging.\u201d Joe Stanley, head of sustainable farming at the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust\u2019s Allerton Project, added: \u201cWhat a situation; the government changes the entire social contract with farmers to make them deliver for the environment, then cuts the funding off when farmers rise to the challenge.\u201d Government sources said the funding had been halted due to budget constraints. This comes as the government faces protest from farmers over changes to inheritance tax that would lead to those who inherit the family farm paying a 20% levy on the value of the business above \u00a31m. As farm income is low and falling, particularly compared with the value of land, farmers have argued the repayments will be impossible to make. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, met the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Tom Bradshaw, on Monday to discuss changes to the tax regime to make it fairer to elderly farmers, including changing the rules over gifts so farm owners over a certain age do not have to live for seven years after they pass it down to their children. A spokesperson for Defra confirmed the capital grants scheme review: \u201cWe will simplify and rationalise our grant funding, ensuring that grants are targeted towards those who need them most and where they can deliver the most benefit for food security and nature.\u201d The news comes after Rachel Reeves\u2019s cuts to farming subsidies were larger than expected. Data from the Agricultural Industries Confederation (AIC) shows cuts to government payments have fallen far more sharply than expected. After Brexit, ministers pledged to slowly phase out the land area-based payments that the EU gave out under the common agricultural policy. This was to allow farmers to transition to a new system of being paid for action on nature \u2013 such as planting hedgerows and looking after the soil \u2013 without a huge financial shock and potentially going bust. However, the chancellor announced a cut of 79% to these payments. Farmers were expecting a more tapered cut: the AIC data shows that, at the top end of the scale, a farmer receiving \u00a362,000 last year was expecting \u00a338,000 this year but would now be getting \u00a37,200. For farmers on tight margins, this change could wipe out profits.",

When I arrive at the city\u2019s Amaya theatre, it is striking how closely the set resembles that at London\u2019s Duchess theatre, where the play recently toasted its 10th birthday. On the left of the stage is a portrait of a king charles spaniel and the malfunctioning mantelpiece of Haversham Manor, where the mystery takes place. On the right is a precarious platform that will provide a cliffhanging set piece of physical comedy. The curtain goes up in a couple of hours so I have time to perch on the set\u2019s chaise longue to chat with actor Adri\u00e0 Olay and resident director V\u00edctor Conde.</p>    <p>Olay plays Chris, the budding impresario and overweening yet underwhelming director of The Murder at Haversham Manor, who also has the plum role of an inspector. \u201cAudiences enjoy watching someone in power encounter problems,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an element of thinking, \u2018I could do a better job than that.

He likens it to The Lion King \u2013 \u201ca title that will survive\u201d. It brings a particular schadenfreude for theatre industry folk. \u201cI have friends \u2013 actors and directors \u2013 who have seen it several times,\u201d Conde says. \u201cEverything that you\u2019re afraid of happening on stage happens here.\u201d</p> <p>But the play has also entered the political lexicon as a shorthand for crises in the ruling class. \u201cIt was in the news as a headline,\u201d explains Conde, referring to when the Spanish PM, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/25/why-spain-prime-minister-pedro-sanchez-considering-resigning\">considered resigning</a> amid corruption allegations against his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez. A piece in <a href=\"https://www.elespanol.com/opinion/carta-del-director/20240707/begona-gomez-funcion-sale-mal/868613131_20.html\">El Espa\u00f1ol</a> depicted S\u00e1nchez and G\u00f3mez as characters in the comedy, wearing its signature costumes and sharing the chaise longue: him in smoking jacket and her in red evening dress.</p> <p>In the UK, too, the play\u2019s gaffes and collective dysfunction have chimed with our own news headlines. Take Theresa May\u2019s 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/04/the-cough-the-p45-the-falling-f-theresa-mays-speech-calamity\">party conference speech</a> when she lost her voice and the letters began to drop off her backdrop\u2019s slogan, like the collapsing title on the play\u2019s poster. It was likened to \u201cthe speech that goes wrong\u201d in the press, and the ways in which the amateur actors tie themselves in knots evokes other mishaps from the \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d years. The actors are sometimes shown to have no understanding of their lines and are just parroting what they\u2019ve been told to. Getting the job done, making it to the final curtain, is the best they can hope for. But some are blithely confident about fooling the public. \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t notice \u2013 I improvised!\u201d bellows one.</p>    <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived in a time and place in politics that we never expected we could be in,\u201d says Conde, who adds that if he had seen some of today\u2019s news back in the 1980s he would have assumed it was a comedy. If audiences laugh at the chaos of The Play That Goes Wrong, he says, it is partly because its depiction of dysfunctional leadership is so familiar.</p> <p>For Marcos C\u00e1mara, the play\u2019s Spanish producer, this comedy is a universal story \u201cabout how you overcome adversity\u201d. Spain has shown a huge appetite for Agatha Christie thrillers and other murder mysteries, but he says that when he first put it on: \u201cEverybody thought we were crazy! It was something super British \u2013 they thought people wouldn\u2019t understand it.\u201d Successful Spanish productions tend to use one or two big name actors, he adds, but The Play That Goes Wrong proves \u201cyou don\u2019t need a star. You need a very good play and the correct marketing. Everybody understands what to expect from the title.\u201d</p>    <p>Another significant factor in its success is that the whole family can come, says C\u00e1mara. Conde agrees: \u201cGrandparents come with the children. I\u2019ve seen families take up 10 seats.\u201d He draws a comparison to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/12/some-mothers-do-ave-em-joe-pasquale-frank-spencer-michael-crawford\">Michael Crawford</a>\u2019s style of humour (\u201cThe voice and the poses, all very subtle\u201d) as well as Peter Shaffer\u2019s farce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/11/miss-julie-black-comedy-review-strindberg-shaffer-sublime\">Black Comedy</a> (\u201cThat kind of elegance, but at the same time so ridiculous\u201d). The choreography of the slapstick sequences takes up a lot of rehearsal time. When the play celebrated 10 years at the Duchess, one of Mischief\u2019s actor-writers, Jonathan Sayer, gave a speech with some eyebrow-raising statistics, including that \u201c106 actors have been struck by objects 125,000 times\u201d. That takes a lot of practice. \u201cIf the actors don\u2019t end up exhausted, something\u2019s gone wrong,\u201d says Conde.</p> <p>The physicality of the comedy is key to the play\u2019s global appeal, says Jessica Hall, Mischief\u2019s licensing manager. She joined the team in 2018 when interest from international producers was taking off. The company has grown with \u201cunbelievable speed\u201d, and The Play That Goes Wrong has been put on in more than 50 countries. Many are \u201creplica\u201d productions using familiar costumes and props, as in Madrid. Replicating musical productions is common but for plays it is quite unusual, says Hall. Normally a script would be licensed and a new company \u201cwould get on and do their own thing\u201d. But Mischief\u2019s specific stage design \u201cis integral to how the play works\u201d, so international theatres that opt for a replica version are given a \u201cshow bible\u201d with set specifications and other details to ensure the precision-engineered comedy comes off.</p> <p>Unlike some musical replicas, Hall adds, \u201cwe don\u2019t require the producers to engage the original creative team\u201d \u2013 which can be a costly and time-consuming process. \u201cWe want Mischief to be accessible. We provide as much support as we can remotely, and if they want to engage one of our original team, they can \u2013 but they don\u2019t have to.\u201d This approach means smaller theatres can afford to replicate a hit West End production.</p>    <p>The play\u2019s Madrid home has around 750 seats (London\u2019s Duchess has two-thirds that number). Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia, where it has run for three years, has an even larger audience. Its stage, too, is considerably vaster, but due to the dimensions of a replica production, some of it goes unused. In Riga, the comedy is in repertory along with Peter Pan Goes Wrong, and some of the acting ensemble alternate their humorous roles with parts in straight plays such as Tom Stoppard\u2019s Leopoldstadt. Dailes\u2019s artistic director, Viesturs Kairi\u0161s, has programmed many British dramas at the theatre. Latvians love our country house mysteries, he says, so a parody of a whodunnit is particularly appealing.</p> <p>He likens the original script by Sayer, Henry Lewis and Henry Shields (who all met at Lamda) to a piece of perfect machinery. Observing from backstage during a performance, \u201cyou can see that mechanism and how the whole show functions. It\u2019s like a Swiss watch.\u201d The show is performed with English surtitles and its Latvian title could be roughly translated as \u201cthe play that goes into the butter\u201d. A theatre company from Ukraine were brought to Latvia to learn the play and put on a free performance there for an audience of Ukrainians in exile; the company, <a href=\"https://drama-comedy.kiev.ua/en/\">Left Bank</a>, now stage it in Kyiv.</p> <p>Kairi\u0161s says that British humour is seen as the gold standard in Europe, a view shared by the team in Madrid. The French version of the play, named Les Faux British, won a prestigious Moli\u00e8re award for best comedy and the state broadcaster France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions called it \u201chilarious British humour\u201d with a \u201cvery Monty Python tone\u201d. C\u00e1mara, whose company has also staged Matilda and Billy Elliot in Spain, lauds the groundbreaking theatre he has seen on visits to England, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/20/we-were-a-little-naive-staging-cabaret-in-the-60s-and-now\">Rebecca Frecknall\u2019s Cabaret</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/oct/12/sunset-boulevard-review-nicole-scherzinger-jamie-lloyd-savoy-theatre\">Jamie Lloyd\u2019s Sunset Boulevard</a>. For him, the joke in The Play That Goes Wrong isn\u2019t about any particularly British ineptitude. \u201cFor us, you\u2019re super serious people with a very high standard of theatre. That\u2019s what makes it so funny.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Play That Goes Wrong is at the <a href=\"https://theduchesstheatre.co.uk/\">Duchess theatre, London</a>; <a href=\"https://www.lafuncionquesalemal.es/\">Amaya theatre, Madrid</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.dailesteatris.lv/en/performances/2021-2022/the-play-that-goes-wrong\">Dailes theatre, Riga</a>, among other international venues.

Unlike some musical replicas, Hall adds, \u201cwe don\u2019t require the producers to engage the original creative team\u201d \u2013 which can be a costly and time-consuming process. \u201cWe want Mischief to be accessible. We provide as much support as we can remotely, and if they want to engage one of our original team, they can \u2013 but they don\u2019t have to.\u201d This approach means smaller theatres can afford to replicate a hit West End production. The play\u2019s Madrid home has around 750 seats (London\u2019s Duchess has two-thirds that number). Dailes theatre in Riga, Latvia, where it has run for three years, has an even larger audience. Its stage, too, is considerably vaster, but due to the dimensions of a replica production, some of it goes unused. In Riga, the comedy is in repertory along with Peter Pan Goes Wrong, and some of the acting ensemble alternate their humorous roles with parts in straight plays such as Tom Stoppard\u2019s Leopoldstadt. Dailes\u2019s artistic director, Viesturs Kairi\u0161s, has programmed many British dramas at the theatre. Latvians love our country house mysteries, he says, so a parody of a whodunnit is particularly appealing. He likens the original script by Sayer, Henry Lewis and Henry Shields (who all met at Lamda) to a piece of perfect machinery. Observing from backstage during a performance, \u201cyou can see that mechanism and how the whole show functions. It\u2019s like a Swiss watch.\u201d The show is performed with English surtitles and its Latvian title could be roughly translated as \u201cthe play that goes into the butter\u201d. A theatre company from Ukraine were brought to Latvia to learn the play and put on a free performance there for an audience of Ukrainians in exile; the company, Left Bank, now stage it in Kyiv. Kairi\u0161s says that British humour is seen as the gold standard in Europe, a view shared by the team in Madrid. The French version of the play, named Les Faux British, won a prestigious Moli\u00e8re award for best comedy and the state broadcaster France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions called it \u201chilarious British humour\u201d with a \u201cvery Monty Python tone\u201d. C\u00e1mara, whose company has also staged Matilda and Billy Elliot in Spain, lauds the groundbreaking theatre he has seen on visits to England, citing Rebecca Frecknall\u2019s Cabaret and Jamie Lloyd\u2019s Sunset Boulevard. For him, the joke in The Play That Goes Wrong isn\u2019t about any particularly British ineptitude. \u201cFor us, you\u2019re super serious people with a very high standard of theatre. That\u2019s what makes it so funny.\u201d The Play That Goes Wrong is at the Duchess theatre, London; Amaya theatre, Madrid; and Dailes theatre, Riga, among other international venues.

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin said it is preparing retaliatory measures after Ukraine twice fired US-made Atacms missiles into Russia in the last three days. Moscow said both strikes targeted air defence positions in the Kursk region and claimed on both occasions either one or two missiles reached their targets, while most were shot down. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte underscored the need \u201cto go further to change the trajectory of the conflict\u201d in Ukraine. While in Athens, Grecce, on a diplomatic visit, the new Nato leader said it was vital alliance members delivered on commitments made at the alliance\u2019s July summit in the US. Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat that it accused of espionage and summoned London\u2019s ambassador to the foreign ministry in Moscow. According to the FSB, Russia\u2019s security service, the British diplomat replaced one of six diplomats expelled in August, also on espionage charges. It said the diplomat provided false information on his documents and carried out espionage and sabotage activities. Russian forces staged their largest ever drone attack on Ukraine overnight, cutting power to much of the western city of Ternopil and damaging residential buildings in Kyiv region, Ukraine\u2019s officials said. The EU is proposing to sanction several Chinese technology firms for aiding Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, according to draft documents seen by the Guardian. The EU is targeting seven companies from China and Hong Kong, as well as firms based in Russia, Serbia, Iran, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, for \u201csupporting Russia\u2019s military industrial complex\u201d. The UK government recently supplied Ukraine with dozens more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, sources have told Bloomberg. The deliveries were not publicly announced and took place several weeks ago, according to the report. Lt Gen Alexander Sanchik has reportedly been appointed acting commander of Russia\u2019s so-called \u201csouth\u201d group of forces, one of the large army units involved in Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. Russian forces captured the village of Kopanky in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region, the Interfax news agency cited Russia\u2019s defence ministry as saying. Russia confirmed it has detained a British man it captured fighting for Ukraine in Kyiv\u2019s offensive into Russia\u2019s western Kursk region. A court in the region said it had on Monday ordered James Scott Rhys Anderson be remanded in custody, alleging he had \u201cparticipated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region\u201d. Officials in Ukraine are preparing for Donald Trump becoming US president in January. Trump\u2019s election victory has accelerated preparations for talks between Kyiv and Moscow after nearly three years of war. He has repeatedly said he could end the war \u201cin a day\u201d, without detailing how. He has also characterised US military assistance to Ukraine as a drain on American resources. My colleagues Shaun Walker, Helena Smith and Dan Sabbagh report: Both sides are seeking to position themselves before the return of Trump, who has claimed he will be able to bring a resolution to the conflict in \u201c24 hours\u201d, while giving few details of how he would go about it. Allies of Ukraine are also in heated discussions about how best to keep supporting Kyiv amid a possible change in US policy. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, who met Trump in Florida over the weekend, said on Tuesday that Nato allies needed to do more to help Kyiv. \u201cOur support for Ukraine has kept them in the fight, but we need to go further to change the trajectory of the conflict,\u201d he said during a visit to Athens. Highlighting the importance of strengthening the bloc\u2019s \u201cdeterrence and defence\u201d, Rutte said it was also critical that investment and production in the arms industry was boosted. Russia\u2019s firing last week of an experimental hypersonic intermediate-range missile into Ukraine is evidence of its \u201creckless and escalatory behaviour\u201d, G7 foreign ministers said in a joint statement on Tuesday. They also condemned \u201cin the strongest possible terms Russia\u2019s irresponsible and threatening nuclear rhetoric as well as its posture of strategic intimidation\u201d, adding that \u201csupport for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence will remain unwavering\u201d. Last week, Russia fired a new ballistic missile (called Oreshnik) at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, prompting Volodymyr Zelenskyy to urge world leaders to give a \u201cserious response\u201d so that Vladimir Putin \u201cfeels the real consequences of his actions\u201d. The new missile was experimental and Russia likely possessed only a handful of them, officials said. The Pentagon said the missile was fired with a conventional warhead but that Moscow could modify it if it wanted. Germany is drawing up a list of bunkers that could provide emergency shelter for civilians, the interior ministry has said, at a time of rising tensions with Russia. The list would include underground train stations and car parks as well as state buildings and private properties, a ministry spokesperson said. A digital directory of bunkers and emergency shelters will be drawn up so people can find them quickly using a planned phone app. People would also be encouraged to create protective shelters in their homes by converting basements and garages, the spokesperson told a press briefing. He declined to give a timetable, saying it was a big project that would take some time, involving the Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance and other authorities. The country of 84 million people has 579 bunkers, mostly from the second world war and the cold war era, which can provide shelter for 480,000 people, down from about 2,000 bunkers previously. The spokesperson said the key points of the plan were agreed at a conference of senior officials in June and a special group was looking into it. You can read the full story here: Soldiers of the state border guard service of Ukraine destroyed a Russian Orlan-10 drone in the Odesa region earlier, the service reported in a Telegram post. The Ukrainian defence ministry has said an interdepartmental commission is to investigate the supply of faulty mortar shells given to Ukrainian forces following reports of them misfiring. The Kyiv Independent has this report: The statement comes following complaints and videos shared on social media that show the mortar shells not exploding or failing to hit their targets. The ministry said it had withdrawn the batches of ammunition in question and would instead provide Ukrainian forces with imported shells. The Dzerkalo Tyzhnia news outlet reported in its investigation that this concerns 100,000 shells that would last for six months of front-line use, causing delays before the imported shells arrive. Artillery and mortar shells are crucial items on the front as Ukraine already struggles to match up with the better-stocked Russian forces. According to Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, the supply of the shells in question was a result of a deal between the defence ministry and the strategic industries ministry to purchase ammunition from a domestic producer and thus decrease dependence on foreign supplies. There is some more detail on the Kremlin\u2019s claim that Ukraine launched US-made Atacms into Russia twice in the past three days (see earlier post). Russia defence ministry said both strikes targeted its forces\u2019 positions in the Kursk region. The first one took place on 23 November, and two out of five missiles launched at a Russian S-400 air defence system hit the target, damaging its radar system. In the second attack, on 25 November, eight missiles were aimed at the Kursk-Vostochny airport, which also hosts a military airbase. One missile reached the target, wounding two soldiers, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe ministry... is in control of the situation, and retaliatory measures are being prepared,\u201d it said. Germany will deliver two more Iris-T air defence systems to Ukraine before the end of the year to aid in its self-defence, the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has announced. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Germany has offered over \u20ac37bn ($38.85bn, \u00a330.89bn) in support, said Baerbock, which is meant not only to protect Ukraine, \u201cbut also for our own protection and our peace.\u201d Norway has agreed to raise its planned fiscal support for Ukraine next year to 30 billion crowns ($2.7bn) from 27 billion crowns this year, the country\u2019s prime minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said, reversing an earlier proposal to cut the spending. The minority centre-left government had last month proposed allocating just 15 billion crowns to Ukraine in 2025, triggering criticism from opposition parties. There has been no contact between Donald Trump or his team and Vladimir Putin since the US election, according to a senior Kremlin aide. Putin has publicly congratulated Trump on defeating Kamala Harris and has said he is willing to talk to him. Trump told NBC on 7 November: \u201cI think we\u2019ll speak\u201d. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in comments picked up by Reuters: \u201cThere are no contacts going on with Trump\u2019s team yet, as far as I know.\u201d Trump said repeatedly during his election campaign that he could bring a swift end to the Ukraine war, but without saying how. Putin said on 7 November that what Trump had said \u201cdeserves attention, at least\u201d. The Kremlin has said it is preparing retaliatory measures after Ukraine twice fired US-made Atacms missiles into Russia in the last three days. Moscow said both strikes targeted air defence positions in the Kursk region and claimed on both occasions either one or two missiles reached their targets, while most were shot down. Helena Smith is the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has underscored the need \u201cto go further to change the trajectory of the conflict\u201d in Ukraine. Stopping over in Athens as he conducted his first regional tour of the eastern Mediterranean, the Nato leader said it was vital alliance members delivered on commitments made at Nato\u2019s July Summit in the US. \u201cOur support for Ukraine has kept them in the fight, but we need to go further to change the trajectory of the conflict,\u201d he said before holding a working lunch with the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. \u201cWe need to provide critical air defences and deliver on the commitments made at the Nato summit in Washington. The new command, the Nato command to coordinate security assistance and training [NSATU], the financial pledge of 40 billion euros in 2024, and further measures to bring Ukraine closer to Nato.\u201d Highlighting the importance of strengthening the bloc\u2019s \u201cdeterrence and defence,\u201d Rutte said it was also critical that investment and production in the arms industry was boosted. Greece, among the highest net contributors to the alliance - allocating 3 % of its GDP to defence - is also home to a growing defence industry, a reflection of the nation\u2019s historic rivalry with Nato-member Turkey and the seriousness with which it takes its role on the Alliance\u2019s \u201cvulnerable\u201d south eastern flank. On Tuesday, Mitsotakis said he and Rutte saw eye to eye on the need for higher EU defense spending. \u201cWe agreed on one of the fundamental priorities for all the allies, the need to boost our common defence, a target which requires a strong defence industry, significant investments,\u201d he said. Last month, Athens signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine with Rutte praising the country\u2019s decision to \u201chelp accelerate F-16 training for Ukrainian pilots and technicians\u201d. It was, he said, a move that would \u201cstrengthen their hands in this brutal war.\u201d \u201cAll of this is essential in an increasingly dangerous environment,\u201d the Nato chief said. He added: In pursuing its illegal war in Ukraine, Russia makes use of North Korean weapons and troops, Iranian drones and Chinese dual use goods for its defence industry. This is a dangerous expansion of the war and a challenge to global peace and security \u2026 The good news is that we have in Nato the alliance we need to defend every inch of our territory. Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat that it accused of espionage and summoned London\u2019s ambassador to the foreign ministry in Moscow. According to the FSB, Russia\u2019s security service, the British diplomat replaced one of six diplomats expelled in August, also on espionage charges. It said the diplomat provided false information on his documents and carried out espionage and sabotage activities. Russian forces staged their largest ever drone attack on Ukraine overnight, cutting power to much of the western city of Ternopil and damaging residential buildings in Kyiv region, Ukraine\u2019s officials said.

The EU is targeting seven companies from China and Hong Kong, as well as firms based in Russia, Serbia, Iran, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, for \u201csupporting Russia\u2019s military industrial complex\u201d. The UK government recently supplied Ukraine with dozens more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, sources have told Bloomberg. The deliveries were not publicly announced and took place several weeks ago, according to the report. Lt Gen Alexander Sanchik has reportedly been appointed acting commander of Russia\u2019s so-called \u201csouth\u201d group of forces, one of the large army units involved in Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. Russian forces captured the village of Kopanky in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region, the Interfax news agency cited Russia\u2019s defence ministry as saying. Russia confirmed it has detained a British man it captured fighting for Ukraine in Kyiv\u2019s offensive into Russia\u2019s western Kursk region. A court in the region said it had on Monday ordered James Scott Rhys Anderson be remanded in custody, alleging he had \u201cparticipated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region\u201d. There are reports of an overnight Russia drone attack overnight cutting power to much of Ternopil, a major city in western Ukraine. As well as damaging residential buildings in the Kyiv region, the attack damaged the power grid in Ternopil and cut power to around 70% of the region, governor Vyacheslav Nehoda said. Energy workers are gradually restoring Ternopil\u2019s electricity supply. Ternopil, about 220 km (134 miles) east of Nato-member Poland, and the surrounding region, had a population of more than a million before the war. \u201cThe consequences are bad because the facility was significantly affected and this will have impact on the power supply of the entire region for a long time,\u201d Nehoda said. We have some more information on reports that Moscow expelled a British diplomat over espionage allegations. The Tass news agency cited Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova as saying that the ministry had summoned the British ambassador. According to the FSB, Russia\u2019s security service, the British diplomat replaced one of six diplomats expelled in August, also on espionage charges. It said the diplomat appeared to have carried out \u201cintelligence and subversive work\u201d and had \u201cdeliberately provided false data when obtaining permission to enter our country, thus violating Russian law,\u201d state news agencies reported. There was no immediate comment from the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office or from the British embassy in Moscow. It comes after reports of the UK government recently supplying Ukraine with dozens more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, a move Moscow warned could escalate the conflict. Russia has expelled a British diplomat, accusing him of espionage, the Interfax news agency cited Russia\u2019s FSB security service as saying earlier today. We are not sure of who the diplomat is yet but will bring you the latest as details come to light. C\u0103lin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly independent candidate with a nationalist background, has taken a surprise lead in the first round of Romania\u2019s presidential election. As my colleague Jon Henley notes in this report, with 99.98% of votes counted, Georgescu, who has praised Vladimir Putin as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d, was on 22.9%, with the reformist Elena Lasconi, of the Save Romania Union (USR), second on 19.17%. The result, one of the biggest electoral upsets in Romania\u2019s post-communist history, triggered the swift resignation as leader of the country\u2019s centre-left, pro-EU party of prime minister Marcel Ciolacu, the pre-ballot frontrunner, who finished third on 19.15%. In Bucharest, students held a rally in University Square to protest against Georgesu\u2019s pro-Russian stance. Here is the video of the march: A Russian court has ordered the arrest of Catherine Norris Trent, a senior reporter for the France24 news channel, on a charge of crossing illegally into its western Kursk region, according to state news agency Tass. It said she had entered the region with the Ukrainian military in order to file a report. Russia has launched criminal cases against a number of Western journalists who have reported from Kursk, where Ukraine launched a shock incursion in August. The proceedings have been launched in absentia, and the orders mean the reporters would be arrested if they set foot inside Russia. The European Union is proposing to sanction several Chinese technology firms for aiding Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, according to draft documents seen by the Guardian. The EU is targeting seven companies from China and Hong Kong, as well as firms based in Russia, Serbia, Iran, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, for \u201csupporting Russia\u2019s military industrial complex\u201d. Many of the companies are believed to be supplying dual-used goods, i.e. goods with a civilian and military purpose, such as electronics and aviation parts, which have been used by Russia to attack Ukraine. The measures, which are still to be agreed by EU member states, would make up the EU\u2019s 15th round of sanctions against Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in 2022. The EU also wants to ban dozens of vessels from docking at European ports, in a bid to clamp down on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet, which is transporting oil around the world above the $60 price cap imposed by the G7 richer countries, providing a vital source of revenue for Moscow. It has also proposed adding 54 people to its sanctions list, including military personnel responsible for the devastating missile attack on the Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv in July that killed at least 44 people and injured many more. Being on the EU\u2019s sanctions list means any assets in the bloc are frozen, while individuals are also subject to a travel ban. The UK government recently supplied Ukraine with dozens more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, sources have told Bloomberg. The missiles have a range of about 250km (155 miles), similar to the US army tactical missile systems (Atacms), and have in the past been given to Kyiv by the UK and France to strike targets inside Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognised borders. Bloomberg reports: The deliveries, which were not publicly announced, took place several weeks ago and were ordered after Kyiv ran low on the long-range missiles, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing security issues. They were sent before the recent decision by the US and the UK to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles at targets inside Russia. The people declined to say exactly when they arrived or give a precise number, citing the need for operational security\u2026 Ukrainian forces fired the British Storm Shadow missiles at targets inside Russia for the first time last week, a day after launching US-made Atacms,a military facility in the western Bryansk region. The decisions by London and Washington to allow the strikes, which Kyiv had long requested, came in response to the Kremlin deploying North Korean troops to fight against Ukraine, according to officials from both governments. In response to the reports, a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit Putin. The UK\u2019s support for Ukraine is ironclad, that\u2019s why we have committed to providing \u00a33 billion in military aid for as long as it takes and have trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian military recruits.\u201d Moscow has said the use of western weapons to strike Russian territory far from the border would be a major escalation in the war. Turkey is in talks with the US to secure a Russia sanctions waiver so it can continue paying for natural gas imports, energy minister Alparslan Bayraktar said yesterday evening. \u201cThese sanctions will affect Turkey. We cannot pay, if we cannot pay we cannot buy the goods. The foreign ministry is in talks,\u201d Bayraktar told reporters in Ankara. Referring to previous waivers when Washington sanctioned Iran, he said Turkey needs something similar when it comes to Gazprombank in order for it to secure supply, Reuters reports. \u201cIf such an exemption is not granted to Turkey it will directly impact us. At this point Russia is not the target, Turkey is the direct target (of these sanctions),\u201d Bayraktar said. Turkey imports almost all its gas needs and Russia is the top supplier, providing more than 50% of its pipeline imports. Last week, the outgoing Biden administration imposed new sanctions on Russia\u2019s Gazprombank. Turkey, a Black Sea neighbour of both Russia and Ukraine, opposes western sanctions against Moscow, with which it shares important defence, energy and tourism ties. Lt Gen Alexander Sanchik has been appointed acting commander of Russia\u2019s so-called \u201csouth\u201d group of forces, the RBC news outlet cited anonymous sources as saying on Tuesday. The move follows the dismissal of the previous commander of the group, one of the large army units involved in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Here is an extract from the report: Since 2020, Sanchik has held the post of commander of the 35th combined arms army of the eastern military district. In 2023 he held the post of first deputy commander of the troops of the eastern military district. On 15 May 2024, he attended a meeting with the president as acting commander of the troops of the eastern military district. As RBC reported earlier, the former commander of the \u201csouth\u201d group of forces, Col Gen Gennady Anashkin, was removed from his post. A source of RBC in the ministry of defence reported that the decision was made as part of a planned rotation. Russian forces have captured the village of Kopanky in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region, the Interfax news agency cited Russia\u2019s defence ministry as saying on Tuesday. Kopanky is close to the administrative border with the Luhansk region. We are yet to independently verify the reports of the capture. The Russian defence ministry also said Russian forces had downed three Ukrainian drones near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine. Russia has confirmed it has detained a British man it captured fighting for Ukraine in Kyiv\u2019s offensive into Russia\u2019s western Kursk region. A court in the region said it had on Monday ordered James Scott Rhys Anderson be remanded in custody, alleging he had \u201cparticipated in armed hostilities on the territory of the Kursk region\u201d. Tass, the Russian news agency, has quoted Anderson as saying that he had served as a signalman in the British army for four years and then joined the International Legion of Ukraine, formed early on in Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. In Ukraine, Anderson reportedly served as an instructor for Ukrainian troops and was deployed to the Kursk region against his will. Tass published a video of the man saying in English that he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201chere\u201d. As we mentioned in the opening post, Russia has slowly expanded the amount of territory they control, making incremental gains, mostly in the east of Ukraine. The thrust of the gradual Russian advance has been in the Donetsk region, with Russian forces pushing towards the town of Pokrovsk, an important transport hub, and into the town of Kurakhove, a city 35km (21 miles) south of Pokrovsk. Russia has increasingly encircled territory and then hit Ukrainian forces with artillery and glide bombs, according to Russian analysts. The general staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said in its Monday update that 45 battles of varying intensity were raging along the Kurakhove part of the front line that evening. If Russia can pierce the Ukrainian defences around Kurakhove, then they will be able to push westwards towards the city of Zaporizhzhia and then towards Pokrovsk, Russian war bloggers said. Welcome to our coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine with the news that Russia has fired 188 drones into Ukraine, the highest number in a single night. Ukraine\u2019s military said on Tuesday it shot down 76 of the weapons, adding it lost track of 96 of the drones, likely due to active electronic warfare, and five drones headed towards Belarus. Kyiv came under sustained Russian drone attack, mayor Vitali Klitschko said early on Tuesday. \u201cThe UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack on the capital continues,\u201d Klitschko wrote on Telegram. \u201cAir defence forces are operating in different areas of the city. (Drones) are entering the capital from different directions.\u201d Witnesses told Reuters they heard a series of explosions in what sounded like air defence systems in operation. The Ukrainian capital, its surrounding region and the vast majority of the Ukrainian territory was under air raid alerts. In Kyiv, the air raid alarms started at around 1900 GMT. Meanwhile, a Russian overnight strike on critical infrastructure cut power to 70% of Ukraine\u2019s western Ternopil region, its governor said on national television. Vyacheslav Nehoda said damage was \u201csubstantial\u201d and it would impact the power supply in Ternopil and the surrounding region \u201cfor a long time\u201d. In other news: The British foreign secretary has said the UK is not sending troops into Ukraine, after Le Monde reported on Monday that France and the UK are \u201cnot ruling out\u201d such a move. When he was asked about the report in an interview, David Lammy said the UK\u2019s position had not changed. \u201cWe are very clear that we stand ready and continue to support the Ukrainians with training particularly, but there has been a longstanding position that we are not committing UK troops to the theatre of action,\u201d he told newspapers La Repubblica, Le Monde and Die Welt at the G7 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Italy. Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of Greater London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers say. The war is entering what some Russian and western officials say could be its most dangerous phase after Moscow\u2019s forces made some of their biggest territorial gains. \u201cRussia has set new weekly and monthly records for the size of the occupied territory in Ukraine,\u201d independent Russian news group Agentstvo said in a report. The Russian army captured almost 235 sq km (91 sq miles) in Ukraine over the past week, a weekly record for 2024, it said. Ambassadors from Ukraine and Nato\u2019s 32 members will meet on Tuesday in Brussels over Russia\u2019s firing last week of an experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile. Russia on Thursday carried out a strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro which President Vladimir Putin said was a test of its new Oreshnik missile. But, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency, expectations are low for any major results from the consultations on Tuesday afternoon at the alliance\u2019s Brussels headquarters. The most that is expected is a reiteration of Nato\u2019s earlier insistence that Moscow\u2019s deployment of the new weaponry will not \u201cdeter Nato allies from supporting Ukraine\u201d. A new Nato mission located in Wiesbaden will take over the coordination of western military aid for Ukraine in January, Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Monday. The setting up of NSATU \u2013 Nato Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine \u2013 has been months in the planning and is widely seen as an effort to safeguard the aid mechanism against interference by Donald Trump. Europeans will step up military support for Ukraine, Pistorius pledged, after talks in Berlin with his British, French, Italian and Polish counterparts. \u201cOur target must be to enable Ukraine to act out of a position of strength,\u201d Pistorius said after hosting a meeting of the five leading nations in European defence.",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s voters go to the polls on Friday 29 November, three weeks after the prime minister, Simon Harris, ended months of speculation by dissolving the coalition government before the end of its five-year term in March next year. Harris\u2019s centre-right Fine Gael is seeking an unprecedented fourth successive term in office \u2013 a prospect that looks possible despite a significant recent dip in the polls and a slight recovery in support for its opposition rival, Sinn F\u00e9in. Who are the main players and how are they polling? One of Ireland\u2019s two historic centre-right parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, has led every Irish government for the past century. At the last election, in 2020, the two longstanding rivals went into coalition together for the first time, joined by the smaller Green party. The two core partners agreed to rotate the post of prime minister, or taoiseach, midway through their term. In March, Fine Gael\u2019s leader, Leo Varadkar, resigned. Harris, known as the \u201cTikTok taoiseach\u201d for his media skills, took over, re-energising the party and overseeing a surge in the polls. Meanwhile, the popularity of the leading opposition party \u2013 the leftwing, republican Sinn F\u00e9in, which in 2020 won the popular vote and finished second in terms of seats behind Fianna F\u00e1il \u2013 has plunged over unclear immigration policies and a string of scandals. Two years ago Sinn F\u00e9in, led by Mary Lou McDonald, was on 36% in the polls in Ireland and, installed as the largest party in Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly, had high hopes of forming its first government in Dublin, paving the way for a possible referendum on Irish reunification. Polls in recent days suggest support for Fine Gael has fallen from 25% to about 20%, reflecting a series of missteps on the campaign trail, with Fianna F\u00e1il, led by the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, on 21% and Sinn F\u00e9in recovering slightly to about 20%. None of the remaining smaller parties are forecast to exceed 5% and independents and others should collect about 21% of the vote. What\u2019s the system and how does it work? Pay attention, it\u2019s complicated. After changes recommended by the electoral commission, Ireland\u2019s new D\u00e1il, or lower house of parliament, will have 174 members, known as Teachta D\u00e1la or TDs, compared with 160 last time, representing 43 constituencies (up by four).

Nearly 700 candidates, including more than 170 independents, are standing \u2013 but none of the 20 parties in the race is fielding enough to win a majority on its own, meaning another coalition government is certain. Ireland uses a proportional representation electoral system with single transferable vote, meaning voters rank their preferred candidates \u2013 as many as they like \u2013 in order, marking their first choice with a 1, their second choice with a 2 and so on. The count then takes place over several rounds, with candidates needing to reach a particular vote share depending on their constituency to be elected. If a voter\u2019s number one pick has already reached that quota or is knocked out, their vote goes to their next choice. With 20 or more candidates in some constituencies, the counting \u2013 as it did in the previous 2020 election \u2013 could well take several days. Only then can possibly months-long negotiations begin on forming a new government and the D\u00e0il elect the new taoiseach. What are the main issues and what\u2019s the likely outcome? The cost of living remains a key concern for voters and, although falling interest rates and a recent \u20ac10.5bn giveaway budget may have cushioned the pain, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il are well aware that higher prices spell danger for incumbent parties. Healthcare funding is another big issue, as well as Ireland\u2019s continuing housing crisis, with young people in particular struggling with sky-high rents and 61% of Irish respondents (against 10% EU-wide) last year citing housing as one of the country\u2019s top two problems. Immigration and asylum is another hot-button topic, with a record number of arrivals this year and growing polarisation over the issue being increasingly fuelled by far-right actors leading to, at times, violent protests. Polls show almost two-thirds want tougher controls. Also being raised on the doorstep is a less vexed question: what to do with the \u20ac14bn of Apple\u2019s tax money coming Ireland\u2019s way thanks to a ruling by the highest EU court. Some urge spending on housing and infrastructure, others on education and poverty alleviation. Regardless of the recent decline in Fine Gael\u2019s fortunes, Sinn F\u00e9in would still need to finish a long way ahead of both Fianna F\u00e1il and Harris\u2019s party to cut off their path to re-election, since both have pledged to govern together again without it. When the results do eventually finally become clear after polls close at 10pm on Friday, experts say Ireland\u2019s two main centre-right parties should be in a position to form a new coalition with the Greens, another small centre-left party or a group of independents.",

And it becomes even more complicated when the journalists are part of a belligerent society, especially if the fight enjoys wide popular support as a just war.</p> <p>On 7 October 2023, Israel was attacked by Hamas, invading from Gaza to kill, loot, rape and kidnap civilians and soldiers. The next day Hezbollah joined the fray from Lebanon. Israel fought back with a vengeance, depopulating and destroying the Gaza Strip towns and villages, killing many civilians along with Hamas militants and operatives. In September 2024, the Israel Defense Forces<strong> </strong>(IDF) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/israel-lebanon-strikes-evacuation-hezbollah\">launched a counteroffensive</a> on the northern front, delivering a crippling blow to its arch-rival Hezbollah and razing the Shia villages that served as its frontline bases.</p> <p>Overwhelmed by the enemy\u2019s surprising attack and Hamas atrocities, the Israeli Jewish public united in overwhelming support for what appeared to be an existential fight against diehard, merciless enemies. This attitude prevails well into the war\u2019s 14th month, despite the rising number of IDF casualties and the ongoing failure to achieve the \u201ctotal victory\u201d promised by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> <p>The public attitude has dictated the boundaries of news coverage in mainstream Israeli media: show no mercy to the other side. Most news outlets don\u2019t air the killing, destruction and human suffering in Gaza and Lebanon. At most, they quote international criticism of Israel\u2019s actions, framing it as antisemitic and hypocritical. Gaza and Lebanon are seen only through the lenses of embedded reporters within the invading IDF units.</p> <p>The embodiment of wartime news coverage is Danny Kushmaro, a news anchor at Channel 12, Israel\u2019s largest TV network. Joining an infantry force in Lebanon last month, a helmet-clad Kushmaro <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-tv-presenter-faces-criticism-after-blowing-building-lebanon\">blew up a house</a> in an occupied Shia village while boasting: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with the Jews.\u201d When the international criminal court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, Kushmaro<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zionistfedaus/reel/DCtbuPGtsVS/\"> reacted emotionally on primetime TV</a>, surrounded by pictures of the dead and kidnapped kids of 7 October, saying the warrants were \u201cagainst all of us, our soldiers, this people, this country\u201d. Kushmaro, and his colleagues on air, never bothered to explain the factual basis behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-benjamin-netanyahu-israel\">ICC accusations</a> of deliberate starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity, allegedly ordered by Israel\u2019s leaders.</p> <p>Israel has a military censor, and each news story about national security or intelligence must get their clearance. Censorship is a nuisance, but in wartime, the statutory constraint and filtering pales in comparison to the self-censorship of the audience. Israelis simply don\u2019t want to know.</p>    <p>Almost always alone, Haaretz has been reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/in-praise-of-haaretz\">for decades</a> on the suffering of Palestinians under Israeli occupation and on what the IDF considers the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of fighting terrorism. Time and again, the newspaper has been castigated for criticising the morality of IDF actions. Readers have cancelled their subscriptions, and politicians rallied against us. But we never budged. When you see war crimes, you must speak out while the war is raging, rather than wait until it\u2019s too late to make a difference. The 7 October war is no different: alone again, we report on the other side of the conflict, despite the difficulty of accessing sources in Gaza or Lebanon, while also embedding our reporters with the IDF like other media.</p> <p>Netanyahu has never liked our critical stance towards him and his policy of occupation and annexation, calling Haaretz and the New York Times \u201c<a href=\"https://www.australianjewishnews.com/israel%E2%80%99s-biggest-enemies-are-ny-times-haaretz/\">the greatest enemies of Israel</a>\u201d in 2012 (though <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/2012-01-19/ty-article/netanyahu-denies-calling-haaretz-and-new-york-times-israels-main-enemies/0000017f-f0c5-df98-a5ff-f3ed18e90000?utm_source=App_Share&amp;utm_medium=iOS_Native\">he later denied it</a> ). Having built his career on media manipulation, Netanyahu can\u2019t stand independent, critical voices. In the previous decade, his abuse of state power to twist media coverage, exposed by Haaretz in 2015, led Netanyahu to the dock in a still-pending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">criminal corruption trial</a>. But even after his indictment, he only changed the tactics, not the strategy, borrowing from the successful playbook of his Hungarian friend and mentor Viktor Orb\u00e1n: attack the mainstream media as hostile, have your billionaire supporters launch supportive channels, build a \u201cpoison machine\u201d to unite your base across social networks. Over time, the mainstream would shift its stance, adding the leader\u2019s mouthpieces to primetime panels, fearing the loss of viewers to the no-holds-barred Channel 14, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/ultranationalist-tv-channel-14-most-watched-news-source-israel\">Israel\u2019s Fox-on-steroids</a>.</p> <p>Netanyahu is a divisive figure, and the Israeli Jewish public, while united behind the war, is deeply split between pro- and anti-Bibists. But Netanyahu is using the external fighting to justify silencing his domestic critics. Shortly after 7 October, communications minister Shlomo Karhi, a crony of the prime minister, submitted a draft cabinet resolution to boycott any government advertising or subscription to Haaretz, citing the paper\u2019s \u201canti-Israel propaganda\u201d. Initially blocked by the justice ministry, Karhi has relaunched his plan to undercut Haaretz, using the pretext of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/24/israeli-government-orders-officials-to-boycott-left-leaning-paper-haaretz\">controversial remarks</a> by our publisher Amos Schocken.</p> <p>Last Sunday, the Haaretz boycott resolution, now sponsored by Netanyahu, passed unanimously in cabinet. For good measure, Karhi also launched a bill to privatise Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, which has acted as a thorn in the government\u2019s side, in contrast to its array of media mouthpieces. \u201cWe\u2019re elected by the public, and we can enact regime change if we want,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/likud-minister-insists-in-leaked-comments-that-government-can-enact-regime-change/\">he said</a> of his boss\u2019s deeper motive. The boycott of Haaretz lacks a legal basis, but Netanyahu couldn\u2019t care less: if it\u2019s struck down, he would launch a tirade against \u201cthe legal deep state\u201d and its undermining of his rule. And he bet right on opposition leaders who, adhering to nationalist-militaristic fervour, refrained from standing by the paper.</p> <p>But we will prevail over the recent Netanyahu assault, just as we prevailed over his predecessors\u2019 anger and shunning. Haaretz will stand by its mission to report critically on the war and its dire consequences for all sides. The truth is sometimes hard to protect, but it should never be the casualty of war.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of Haaretz</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The 7 October war is no different: alone again, we report on the other side of the conflict, despite the difficulty of accessing sources in Gaza or Lebanon, while also embedding our reporters with the IDF like other media. Netanyahu has never liked our critical stance towards him and his policy of occupation and annexation, calling Haaretz and the New York Times \u201cthe greatest enemies of Israel\u201d in 2012 (though he later denied it ). Having built his career on media manipulation, Netanyahu can\u2019t stand independent, critical voices. In the previous decade, his abuse of state power to twist media coverage, exposed by Haaretz in 2015, led Netanyahu to the dock in a still-pending criminal corruption trial. But even after his indictment, he only changed the tactics, not the strategy, borrowing from the successful playbook of his Hungarian friend and mentor Viktor Orb\u00e1n: attack the mainstream media as hostile, have your billionaire supporters launch supportive channels, build a \u201cpoison machine\u201d to unite your base across social networks. Over time, the mainstream would shift its stance, adding the leader\u2019s mouthpieces to primetime panels, fearing the loss of viewers to the no-holds-barred Channel 14, Israel\u2019s Fox-on-steroids. Netanyahu is a divisive figure, and the Israeli Jewish public, while united behind the war, is deeply split between pro- and anti-Bibists. But Netanyahu is using the external fighting to justify silencing his domestic critics. Shortly after 7 October, communications minister Shlomo Karhi, a crony of the prime minister, submitted a draft cabinet resolution to boycott any government advertising or subscription to Haaretz, citing the paper\u2019s \u201canti-Israel propaganda\u201d. Initially blocked by the justice ministry, Karhi has relaunched his plan to undercut Haaretz, using the pretext of controversial remarks by our publisher Amos Schocken. Last Sunday, the Haaretz boycott resolution, now sponsored by Netanyahu, passed unanimously in cabinet. For good measure, Karhi also launched a bill to privatise Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, which has acted as a thorn in the government\u2019s side, in contrast to its array of media mouthpieces. \u201cWe\u2019re elected by the public, and we can enact regime change if we want,\u201d he said of his boss\u2019s deeper motive. The boycott of Haaretz lacks a legal basis, but Netanyahu couldn\u2019t care less: if it\u2019s struck down, he would launch a tirade against \u201cthe legal deep state\u201d and its undermining of his rule. And he bet right on opposition leaders who, adhering to nationalist-militaristic fervour, refrained from standing by the paper. But we will prevail over the recent Netanyahu assault, just as we prevailed over his predecessors\u2019 anger and shunning. Haaretz will stand by its mission to report critically on the war and its dire consequences for all sides. The truth is sometimes hard to protect, but it should never be the casualty of war.

It did not specify the exact charges, noting only that he was accused of \u201ccommitting a set of particularly serious offences that post a danger to society\u201d.</p> <p>Russian military bloggers said Anderson was captured near the village of Plekhovo, taking part in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/ukrainian-troops-audacious-incursion-russia-kursk\">Ukraine\u2019s military offensive</a> inside Russia, which was launched in late summer. Russian forces are now on the offensive in Kursk region, attempting to win back control of the lost territory.</p> <p>In a video that surfaced over the weekend, a man in military fatigues, with his hands tied, gave his name as Anderson and said he had served in the British army between 2019 and 2023, before he was dismissed and then decided to travel to Ukraine and volunteer.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Monday he was aware of the arrest and that authorities would \u201coffer this UK national all the support we can\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/biden-has-lifted-ban-on-ukraine-using-us-weapons-to-strike-deeper-into-russia-reports\">gave Ukraine permission to strike military targets deep in Russia</a> using American-supplied Atacms missiles, in support of its Kursk offensive. Britain followed suit, allowing the use of Storm Shadow missiles in Russia.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Britain had sent \u201cdozens\u201d of Storm Shadows to Ukraine recently, the first delivery since Keir Starmer took over as prime minister in July. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on the report. \u201cWe do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit Putin,\u201d said the spokesperson, adding that Britain\u2019s support for Ukraine is \u201cironclad\u201d.</p> <p>Moscow has reacted furiously to the decision to allow strikes on targets inside Russia, with the president, Vladimir Putin, saying it amounted to a declaration of war on Russia and gave Moscow the right to strike targets in the countries that provided the weapons.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukraine had launched further strikes using Atacms on targets include an airbase in the Kursk region and an air defence battery, causing an unspecified number of casualties and damage to equipment. It was a rare admission by Moscow of Ukrainian strikes successfully hitting their targets.</p> <p>\u201cRetaliatory actions are being prepared,\u201d the ministry said in a post on Telegram, without giving further detail. The first strike using Atacms led to Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/russian-ballistic-missile-attack-ukraine-a-severe-escalation-says-zelenskyy\">using an experimental ballistic missile</a> against the city of Dnipro last week, and a response from Putin that hinted at nuclear options being on the table.</p> <p>Both sides are seeking to position themselves before the return of Trump, who has claimed he will be able to bring a resolution to the conflict in \u201c24 hours\u201d, while giving few details of how he would go about it.</p> <p>Allies of Ukraine are also in heated discussions about how best to keep supporting Kyiv amid a possible change in US policy. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, who met Trump in Florida over the weekend, said on Tuesday that Nato allies needed to do more to help Kyiv. \u201cOur support for Ukraine has kept them in the fight, but we need to go further to change the trajectory of the conflict,\u201d he said during a visit to Athens.</p> <p>Highlighting the importance of strengthening the bloc\u2019s \u201cdeterrence and defence\u201d, Rutte said it was also critical that investment and production in the arms industry was boosted.</p> <p>\u201cIn pursuing its illegal war in Ukraine, Russia makes use of North Korean weapons and troops, Iranian drones and Chinese dual-use goods for its defence industry. This is a dangerous expansion of the war and a challenge to global peace and security,\u201d he said.</p>",

The governor of the western Ternopil region, Vyacheslav Nehoda, said on television that about 70% of the region was without power. \u201cThe consequences are bad because the facility was significantly affected and this will have impact on the power supply of the entire region for a long time,\u201d he said. Several buildings were damaged around Kyiv, but there were no casualties reported. Also on Tuesday, a court in the Russian city of Kursk confirmed that a British citizen had been captured and arrested by Russian authorities, the first official confirmation of news that broke over the weekend when interrogation videos appeared on Russian Telegram channels. The court ordered that James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, be held in custody on allegations he had \u201cparticipated in armed hostilities on the territory of Kursk region\u201d. It did not specify the exact charges, noting only that he was accused of \u201ccommitting a set of particularly serious offences that post a danger to society\u201d. Russian military bloggers said Anderson was captured near the village of Plekhovo, taking part in Ukraine\u2019s military offensive inside Russia, which was launched in late summer. Russian forces are now on the offensive in Kursk region, attempting to win back control of the lost territory. In a video that surfaced over the weekend, a man in military fatigues, with his hands tied, gave his name as Anderson and said he had served in the British army between 2019 and 2023, before he was dismissed and then decided to travel to Ukraine and volunteer. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, said on Monday he was aware of the arrest and that authorities would \u201coffer this UK national all the support we can\u201d. Earlier this month, the US gave Ukraine permission to strike military targets deep in Russia using American-supplied Atacms missiles, in support of its Kursk offensive. Britain followed suit, allowing the use of Storm Shadow missiles in Russia. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Britain had sent \u201cdozens\u201d of Storm Shadows to Ukraine recently, the first delivery since Keir Starmer took over as prime minister in July. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on the report. \u201cWe do not comment on operational detail, to do so would only benefit Putin,\u201d said the spokesperson, adding that Britain\u2019s support for Ukraine is \u201cironclad\u201d. Moscow has reacted furiously to the decision to allow strikes on targets inside Russia, with the president, Vladimir Putin, saying it amounted to a declaration of war on Russia and gave Moscow the right to strike targets in the countries that provided the weapons. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said Ukraine had launched further strikes using Atacms on targets include an airbase in the Kursk region and an air defence battery, causing an unspecified number of casualties and damage to equipment. It was a rare admission by Moscow of Ukrainian strikes successfully hitting their targets. \u201cRetaliatory actions are being prepared,\u201d the ministry said in a post on Telegram, without giving further detail. The first strike using Atacms led to Russia using an experimental ballistic missile against the city of Dnipro last week, and a response from Putin that hinted at nuclear options being on the table. Both sides are seeking to position themselves before the return of Trump, who has claimed he will be able to bring a resolution to the conflict in \u201c24 hours\u201d, while giving few details of how he would go about it. Allies of Ukraine are also in heated discussions about how best to keep supporting Kyiv amid a possible change in US policy. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, who met Trump in Florida over the weekend, said on Tuesday that Nato allies needed to do more to help Kyiv. \u201cOur support for Ukraine has kept them in the fight, but we need to go further to change the trajectory of the conflict,\u201d he said during a visit to Athens. Highlighting the importance of strengthening the bloc\u2019s \u201cdeterrence and defence\u201d, Rutte said it was also critical that investment and production in the arms industry was boosted. \u201cIn pursuing its illegal war in Ukraine, Russia makes use of North Korean weapons and troops, Iranian drones and Chinese dual-use goods for its defence industry. This is a dangerous expansion of the war and a challenge to global peace and security,\u201d he said.",

Free trade agreements (FTAs) are not safe</strong></p> <p>Canada and Mexico are part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which was negotiated by Trump himself. It is clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/nov/26/dollar-gains-stocks-drop-trump-tariff-threats-business-live-news?page=with:block-67459c0e8f08849211a44e81#block-67459c0e8f08849211a44e81\">even countries with existing agreements</a> with the US can be subject to tariffs.</p> <p><strong>2. Right after the Treasury Secretary announcement</strong></p> <p>Tariffs are being announced just a few hours after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/scott-bessent-trump-treasury\">nomination of Scott Bessent</a> as Treasury Secretary. This is pushback to the argument that tariffs are taking a backseat to the Trump agenda.</p> <p><strong>3. The tariffs cover 40% of total US trade</strong></p> <p>While only limited to three countries, the impact is economically large at it applies to America\u2019s three largest trading partners after the Euro-area.</p> <p><strong>4. Presidential authority, for now</strong></p> <p>It is explicitly mentioned that executive authority will be used to impose these tariffs rather than the legislative route. We suspect that the most likely avenue will the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA).</p> <p><strong>5. Tactical and transactional, for now</strong></p> <p>The announcement is only targeted at three countries and leaves the prospect of tariff removal open. There is no mention of tariffs as a strategic tool to deal with trade imbalances or as a revenue-raiser.</p> <p>The optimistic take is that this means that some of the most extreme scenarios under universal tariffs will not happen. The pessimistic interpretation (which we favour) is that this is an opening salvo and the targeted focus on immigration and drugs is required to trigger broad-based executive authority under the IEEPA.</p> <p><strong>6. Watch the China legislation in Congress</strong></p> <p>Just last week a new bill was submitted to the Senate removing permanent trade relations with China and targeting 50%-100% tariffs. There is already a similar bill in the US House of Representatives. For us, whether the tariff discussion turns strategic via legislation is a big outstanding question to be resolved.</p> <p><strong>7. Beware complex supply chains</strong></p> <p>EUR/USD is reacting with relief that no mention of European trade was made. But note for example that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/nov/26/dollar-gains-stocks-drop-trump-tariff-threats-business-live-news?page=with:block-67458a0f8f08849211a44ddd#block-67458a0f8f08849211a44ddd\">German car manufacturers </a>have huge production capacity in Mexico that is then on-sold to the US. Also note the complex inter-play of Chinese and Mexico trade which makes the negative impact of tariffs on Mexico even bigger.</p> <p><strong>8. Canada most under-priced</strong></p> <p>The Canadian dollar has had the largest risk-adjusted weakening move since the tariffs were announced. Canada is the most vulnerable developed market country to extra tariffs but also the least under-priced in terms of risks.</p> <p><strong>9. The softer the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of more tariffs</strong></p> <p>The equity market reaction has so far been very benign, we would argue likely on the back of the transactional interpretation. That US domestic small-caps have been leading the recent market rally also helps reduce the impact.</p> <p>The first Trump administration showed that the more benign the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of further escalation.</p> <p><strong>10. Truth Social is the new avenue for announcements</strong></p> <p>During the first Trump administration, it was Twitter. Market participants need to be watching the President\u2019s new social media platform now.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T13:48:05.891Z\">at 1.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6745cce08f085f8174d9058b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T13:33:02.869Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Exclusive: Two-thirds of Americans think Trump's tariffs will mean higher prices</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/trump-tariffs-prices-harris-poll\">according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> declared on Monday evening that he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on China, if they did not stop what he claimed was illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling.</p> <p>But although he has called tariffs the most \u201cbeautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, about 69% of Americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices, according to the poll.</p> <p>The majority of Democrats (79%), independents (68%) and Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US.

      "bodyText": "Stocks in some European and Asian markets took a hit as investors digested the ramifications of Donald Trump\u2019s vow to slap a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on goods coming from China. Shares in companies with signifcant operational links to the nations in Trump\u2019s line of fire were the hardest hit, such as automotive firms and alcohol producers. While in general markets in Europe and Asia were hit over fears that Trump could target more countries and spark a potential global trade war. The announcement, made on Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform, saw the dollar jump 1.5% against the Mexican Peso, 1% against the Canadian dollar and hit a four-month high against the Chinese Yuan. Economists at IMG have estimated that if the full cost of the tariffs are passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,4000 more per capital annually for goods. An exclusive poll for the Guardian found that consumers agree, with two-thirds of Americans polled saying that they think Trump\u2019s tariffs will mean higher prices. John Roberts, the boss of British online electrical goods seller AO.com, has said that if the tariffs on Chinese goods are implemented it could mean lower prices on electricals in the UK. \u201cFundamentally if less product is being made in China and shipped to the US then they will want to find another home for that output which might reduce prices for us,\u201d Roberts said. Meanwhile, optimism amongst British retailers has hit a two-year low off the back of expectations of gloomy Christmas sales, and the prospect of the increase in Employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions next April, according to the latest quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). And, the British government is expected to stick to headline targets for increasing electric car sales each year, but will consider adding extra loopholes to help carmakers, after a barrage of lobbying by the car industry. Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson on Tuesday announced that the government will bring forward the consultation on the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate which will look at changes to the rules which impose fines of up to \u00a315,000 per petrol or diesel vehicle sold above a quota. Carmakers have privately warned that they will miss the targets, forcing them to stump up millions of pounds to buy \u201ccredits\u201d from rivals, or else pay the fines. Wall Street has opened with a mixed reaction from investors to Donald Trump\u2019s announcement to put a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on Chinese imports. The Dow Jones was down 0.29% at the opening bell with biotech company Amgen (11.3%), retailer Best Buy (7.9%) and General Motors (6.6%) among the biggest fallers in early trading. The tech stock heavy Nasdaq opened up 0.28%, while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose 0.21%, as investors started to weigh the US president-elect\u2019s plan to impose the new tariffs on his first day in the White House on 20 January. The British government is expected to stick to headline targets for increasing electric car sales each year, but will consider adding extra loopholes to help carmakers, after a barrage of lobbying by the car industry. Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson on Tuesday announced that the government will bring forward the consultation on the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate which will look at changes to the rules which impose fines of up to \u00a315,000 per petrol or diesel vehicle sold above a quota. Carmakers have privately warned that they will miss the targets, forcing them to stump up millions of pounds to buy \u201ccredits\u201d from rivals, or else pay the fines. Business Jonathan Reynolds is expected to tell car companies that the government is listening to their concerns, at a dinner this evening hosted by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The government is likely to stick firmly to its goal of phasing out new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030, and all hybrids by 2035, according to a person with knowledge of internal discussions. The person said the government is also very likely to stick to headline targets which mandate that sales of electric cars must account for 22% of new sales in 2024 for each manufacturer, rising to 28% next year and 80% by 2030, despite reports they could change. However, the government will consider changes to \u201cflexibilities\u201d that effectively allow carmakers to reduce the number of electric cars that they need to sell. Those loopholes include the ability to \u201cover-comply\u201d in later years to make up for a slow start in the coming two or three years, and lowering the average emissions of the fossil fuel cars they sell. The \u201cfast-track\u201d consultation is expected to launch before Christmas, before reporting back in the first few months in 2025 - faster than most policy consultations of that type. It is also expected to include details of which hybrid cars can continue to be sold after 2030. The expected changes to the ZEV mandate would come despite opposition from charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners, who argue that delays will hit investment and imperil emissions targets. Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK, a pro-battery car campaign group, said: The ZEV mandate is world-leading legislation that will put the UK firmly on the map with green tech investors and send a clear signal that the country means business when it comes to the global energy transition. Clean air and sustainable employment are surely the legacy we all want, and the existing zero emissions mechanisms is critical. Ten takeaways from Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs announcement Deutsche Bank has published ten conclusions, ramifications and observations following Trump\u2019s social media posts about the impending imposition of a 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese imports, that he intends to make policy when he formally enters the White House on 20 January. 1. Free trade agreements (FTAs) are not safe Canada and Mexico are part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which was negotiated by Trump himself. It is clear that even countries with existing agreements with the US can be subject to tariffs. 2. Right after the Treasury Secretary announcement Tariffs are being announced just a few hours after the nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. This is pushback to the argument that tariffs are taking a backseat to the Trump agenda. 3. The tariffs cover 40% of total US trade While only limited to three countries, the impact is economically large at it applies to America\u2019s three largest trading partners after the Euro-area. 4. Presidential authority, for now It is explicitly mentioned that executive authority will be used to impose these tariffs rather than the legislative route. We suspect that the most likely avenue will the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). 5. Tactical and transactional, for now The announcement is only targeted at three countries and leaves the prospect of tariff removal open. There is no mention of tariffs as a strategic tool to deal with trade imbalances or as a revenue-raiser. The optimistic take is that this means that some of the most extreme scenarios under universal tariffs will not happen. The pessimistic interpretation (which we favour) is that this is an opening salvo and the targeted focus on immigration and drugs is required to trigger broad-based executive authority under the IEEPA. 6. Watch the China legislation in Congress Just last week a new bill was submitted to the Senate removing permanent trade relations with China and targeting 50%-100% tariffs. There is already a similar bill in the US House of Representatives. For us, whether the tariff discussion turns strategic via legislation is a big outstanding question to be resolved. 7. Beware complex supply chains EUR/USD is reacting with relief that no mention of European trade was made. But note for example that German car manufacturers have huge production capacity in Mexico that is then on-sold to the US. Also note the complex inter-play of Chinese and Mexico trade which makes the negative impact of tariffs on Mexico even bigger. 8. Canada most under-priced The Canadian dollar has had the largest risk-adjusted weakening move since the tariffs were announced. Canada is the most vulnerable developed market country to extra tariffs but also the least under-priced in terms of risks. 9. The softer the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of more tariffs The equity market reaction has so far been very benign, we would argue likely on the back of the transactional interpretation. That US domestic small-caps have been leading the recent market rally also helps reduce the impact. The first Trump administration showed that the more benign the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of further escalation. 10. Truth Social is the new avenue for announcements During the first Trump administration, it was Twitter. Market participants need to be watching the President\u2019s new social media platform now. Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. Trump declared on Monday evening that he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on China, if they did not stop what he claimed was illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling. But although he has called tariffs the most \u201cbeautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, about 69% of Americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices, according to the poll. The majority of Democrats (79%), independents (68%) and Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US. Nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford. The poll chimes with reseaarch by ING published on Tuesday which predicts that the US president-elect\u2019s 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China, could cost US consumers $2,400 a year. Optimism amongst British retailers has fallen to a two-year low, according to industry body the CBI. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that its quarterly survey of retailer sentiment has fallen to its lowest level since Novermber 2022, when consumers were hit by surging energy prices and markets reacted to former prime minister Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget. Retailers are expecting a gloomy Christmas forecasting annual sales growth to deteriorate, with volumes set to remain below seasonal norms. Firms also expect to scale back investment over the next 12 months, in part due to cost increases due to the increase in Employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions announced in last month\u2019s budget which come into force from April. Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI, said: The last time retailers felt this gloomy was back in November 2022, at the peak of the inflation shock. The stark rise in Employers\u2019 National Insurance next year will hit retailers hard. And the planned increase in business rates for higher-value properties will add significant operational costs for distribution centres. The chief executive of the UK water regulator has defended allowing the privatisation of water companies in the 1980s, despite criticism of their financial performance and environmental track record. David Black, the chief executive of Ofwat, defended the regulator\u2019s record at a select committee on Tuesday following criticism it allowed water companies to load up on unsutainable amounts of debt, while failing to invest in infrastruture and continuing to spill sewage into rivers and seas. Asked by committee chair, the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael whether these issues show the privatisation model has failed, Black said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t agree - it shows the need for strong regulation of the sector. It\u2019s very clear the sector needs to change. That said it\u2019s important to bear in mind the sector has raised over \u00a3240bn since privatisation and there has been significant reduction in leakage and there\u2019s more to do. Customer bills since privatisation have increased but we have saved billions of pounds for customers at each price review.\u201d He added that \u201cwe can point to real successes in the model since privatisation.\u201d The water companies in England were privatised in 1989 and since then they have come under fire for presiding over leakages of tap water, sewage spills and a lack of reservoirs being built meaning the country is at risk of running out of water. The Labour government is currently running a review into the privatised model. Carmichael asked if the situation with Thames Water, the largest water company in England, which has been at risk of collapse due to its high levels of debt, illustrates an issue with the privatised model. Black said: \u201cThames Water very clearly have issues with their financial structures and we have taken action to make sure customers don\u2019t bear the consequences. With privatisation we were always very clear that we might see companies fail, that\u2019s why we have the special administration regime, we were always very clear it wasn\u2019t Ofwat\u2019s role to stop companies going bust it is our role to ensure customers are protected when they are unable to meet their obligations but the fact is the sector has raised finance.\u201d John Roberts, the boss of British online electrical goods seller AO.com, said it was too early to tell if Donald Trump\u2019s administration would follow through with its threat to slap more tariffs on Chinese goods, but such a move could mean lower prices on electricals in the UK. \u201cFundamentally if less product is being made in China and shipped to the US then they will want to find another home for that output which might reduce prices for us,\u201d Roberts said. But he cautioned: \u201cWe are a long way from it happening and tariffs biting and the follow through so I personally wouldn\u2019t read too much into [Trump\u2019s threats].\u201d \u201cDonald is a deal maker and he is laying the ground for negotiation and he is not going to lay the ground by saying I am not going to put any tariffs. This is his opening gambit and it was always going to be sensational.\u201d Roberts made the comments as he warned that UK chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 budget would push up prices for UK consumers because it meant more cost for business. AO said direct and indirect costs would rise \u00a38m, including higher payments for self-employed drivers as well as higher national insurance contributions and the minimum wage rises for employees. \u201cI\u2019m no economist, I\u2019m a washer flogger from Bolton, but if you dramatically increase all the costs then prices will go up as night follows day. They have to.\u201d He said he was concerned as \u201cinflation hurts the people that can afford it the least the most.\u201d The US president-elect\u2019s social media post announcing 25% import tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, when he takes power in January has sent global stockmarkets into a spin. Research by ING has estimated that if the costs of the new tariffs are fully passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,400 more per capita annually for goods. The report says that also taking into account potential labour shortages due to Trump\u2019s plans to crackdown on immigration \u2013 with a vow to stage the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d \u2013 there could be a 1% increase in inflation in the US. James Knightley, ING chief international economist for the US, said: \u201cPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised to implement sweeping new tariffs aimed at protecting American industries, promoting domestic manufacturing, and reducing reliance on foreign imports. \u201cHowever, tariffs imposed during the first Trump term \u2013 and continued and extended under Biden \u2013 did not achieve all of the promised outcomes. Furthermore, our research shows that if the new tariffs are fully passed on, they could increase inflation and cost American consumers up to $2,400 per capita annually. The report points to policies implemented under the first Trump administration, such as a 20% tariff on all imported large residential washing machines introduced in 2018, which resulted in the retail cost climbing 12%. Unlike Halfords, which reported a \u00a323m hit from tax rises in the budget this morning, Compass Group, Europe\u2019s biggest catering company, talks about the \u201copportunity rather than threats\u201d this brings to its business. Dominic Blakemore, the Compass chief executive, told analysts and investors that the \u201ccost and complexity\u201d of the increase in national insurance contributions for employers will pile pressure on many UK companies, and may prompt them to outsource catering to save money. \u201cThe NIC rate increase increases cost for everyone. We see an opportunity in first-time outsourcing.\u201d He argues that Compass, given its size and presence in other countries, can manage those cost rises more efficiently. The company employs 55,000 people in the UK, and 580,000 globally. His comments came as the catering group reported a 10% rise in revenues to $42bn in the year to 30 September, while underlying profit before tax rose to $2.7bn from $2.4bn. Robert Habeck, Germany\u2019s economy minister, has said that Donald Trump\u2019s announcements about tariffs on products from China, Mexico and Canada should be taken seriously. A number of analysts have said that markets should view the US president-elect\u2019s proposed tariffs more positively, given he has threatened a hike of as much as 60% on Chinese imports if the country doesn\u2019t agree with his policies. However, Habeck said that Europe and Germany need to seek urgent talks with the US to head off a potential trade war and stand united. European markets and listed companies operating in sectors including automotive and alcohol are a \u201csea of red\u201d this morning as investors react to the impact of Trump\u2019s announcements, and the possibility other countries could be targeted with tariffs next. Shares in European brewers have been hit by Donald Trump\u2019s threats to introduce aa 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada Trump, who posted the policy announcement on his social media site Truth Social, has also said that Chinese imports will be hit with a 10% tariff when he officially takes over at the White House on 20 January. Budweiser and Stella Artois maker AB Inbev and Heineken, which both have operations in Mexico, fell 2.3% and 2.2% respectively. Guinness maker Diageo, which also has operations in Mexico, was the biggest faller down 2.5%. Meanwhile, Campari fell 2.3%, Remy Cointreau slid almost 2%, Pernod Ricard fell 1.7% and Carlsberg dropped by just over 1%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said that European stocks are a \u201csea of red\u201d this morning following Trump\u2019s policy-by-social media announcement. She pointed out that London\u2019s FTSE 100 has proved to be the most resilient of the European markets as the UK is \u201cexpected to be shielded from the worst of Trump\u2019s tariff plans\u201d. Mohit Kumar, in the global economics team at Jefferies, sees the move by Trump as an \u201copening move for negotiations\u201d given he has threatened that tariffs on Chinese imports could go up to 60%. Our view remains that tariffs will eventually not end up as bad as feared, but we will see increased uncertainty over the coming months. Waking up to check the tweets for any policy announcements could become the norm. Tariffs will further support the view of US over rest of the world from an investment perspective. Halfords could raise prices for car servicing and repair to help it cope with a \u00a323m cost increase after the autumn budget, and called for more business support from the government. The cycling and motoring retailer, which has more than 12,000 employees, reported on Tuesday that the budget measures add \u00a323m of direct labour costs, of which \u00a39m was already included in its planning assumptions. Fears of a potential global trade war has fuelled a sell-off of European automotive stocks. Shares in Stellantis, the owner of brands including Fiat, Chrysler, Peugeot and Vauxhall, have been hit the hardest falling almost 6% in early trading. Germany\u2019s Volkswagen fell 2.7%, Mercedes-Benz tumbled 2.2%, BMW dropped 2.4%, and luxury brand Porsche fell 2.3%. Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services, said that markets will have to \u201creattune\u201d to Trump\u2019s \u201cfrequently erratic\u201d approach to policymaking. Trump\u2019s promise overnight to implement tariffs immediately on taking office in January were no great surprise, though the fact that he is taking initial aim at Mexico and Canada as much as China may have surprised some, though it is in line with his narrative during the election. Still it serves as a reminder that markets will have to reattune themselves to his frequently erratic approach to policymaking, and his likely hefty reliance on executive orders where possible to circumvent the legislature. European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading as investors worry about the ramifications of Trump\u2019s international tariff threats, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.5%. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks in London fell by 0.3% in early trading, while Germany\u2019s DAX fell 0.5%. In France, the CAC 40 share index dropped 0.8% Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING, published a note saying that Europe will not be \u201cbreathing a sigh of relief\u201d despite not being targeted by Trump in his first round of tariffs. That Europe was not mentioned in Trump\u2019s first tariff post could perhaps be welcome news on the continent. Yet local policymakers will remain fearful that it will just be a matter of time before Trump turns his attention to the European auto sector or tariffs more broadly. In any case, the threat of further tariffs on China shows the direction of travel on world trade, which is bearish for the euro. Copper prices have fallen, weighed down by a stronger US dollar and US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to levy more tariffs on Chinese products. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.6% at $8,990.50 per metric ton by 7am, while the most-traded January copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) closed down 0.3% to 73,740 yuan ($10,162.48) a ton, Reuters reported. Investor Bill Ackman said that markets should be up as Trump is using the threat of tariffs as a weapon to achieve wider US economic goals. \u201cTo be clear, according to Trump the 25% tariffs will not be implemented, or if implemented will be removed, once Mexico and Canada stop the flow of illegal immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cIn other words, @realDonaldTrump is going to use tariffs as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America, fulfilling his America first policy. This is a great way for Trump to effect foreign policy changes even before he takes office.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Donald Trump has kicked-off his long feared plan for new tariffs sending shockwaves through the markets. The US dollar rose and shares dipped after Donald Trump said he will impose additional tariffs on products coming into the US from China, Mexico and Canada. Posting on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said that when he becomes president on January 20th he will \u201csign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.\u201d The levy on products from Mexico and Canada \u2013 and 10% on Chinese imports \u2013 saw the dollar rise almost 2% against the Mexican peso and hit a four and a half year high against the Canadian dollar. The US currency also rose to its highest level since July against China\u2019s yuan as markets reacted to Trump\u2019s comments. Most Asian equities declined with share benchmarks in Japan, Australia and South Korea all dropping. The news on tariffs reversed a 0.6% fall in the dollar index on Monday, following Trump\u2019s nomination of hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, an appointment investors took as a sign that the president-elect\u2019s policies may be moderated. Stephen Innes, managing partner, SPI Asset Manager, said: In a striking return to hardline policies, President-elect Trump has dramatically escalated tensions with a brash promise to impose a sweeping 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico the moment he reassumes office. This bold declaration shatters any lingering hopes that the new Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, might usher in an era of moderation. Initially hailed as a beacon of stability, Bessent\u2019s influence now seems overshadowed by a resurgence of Trump\u2019s uncompromising \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine, which starkly excludes even the closest of allies from its protective embrace.

Seven people are still missing. The Red Sea governor, Amr Hanafi, said the yacht, called Sea Story, had been struck by high waves on Monday and sank in less than 7 minutes. The 34-metre boat was carrying 30 tourists from several countries and 14 crew when it sent a distress signal at 5.30am local time (3.30am GMT) on Monday, according to the governorate\u2019s Facebook page.

Weather forecasters had previously released warnings of rough waters and high winds. Of the 44 people onboard, 13 were Egyptians, including some crew, and 31 were foreign nationals from the US, Germany, UK, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, China, Slovakia, Spain and Ireland. More than two dozen people were rescued on Monday from the vessel south of the coastal town of Marsa Alam, some of them being airlifted to receive medical treatment.

      "bodyText": "Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, will phase out several diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in its workplaces, as far-right conservatives continue take aim at such programs. Among several sweeping changes, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a means to improve diversity when making offers to suppliers, several outlets reported. \u201cOur purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We\u2019ve been on a journey and know we aren\u2019t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\u201d the company said in a statement to the Guardian. Walmart will no longer offer DEI trainings through the Racial Equity Institute, a consultant firm specializing in improving corporate diversity and equity, the Washington Post reported. The company will also not be renewing a racial equity center that it established through a five-year commitment to \u201caddress the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems\u201d, according to Walmart\u2019s website. The multinational corporation will also be removing LGBTQ+ merchandise from its stores, CNBC reported. The decision to discontinue DEI efforts at Walmart was first announced by the conservative pundit Robby Starbuck, who continued to attack DEI efforts as apart of an ongoing campaign. Starbuck claimed: \u201cWalmart is ending their woke policies,\u201d in a post to X. \u201cLast week I told execs at [Walmart] that I was doing a story on wokeness there. Instead we had productive conversations to find solutions,\u201d Starbuck said, before listing several of the DEI initiatives Walmart is ending. Walmart, which employs approximately 1.6 million US workers, is only the latest company to end its DEI programs in recent months. Lowe\u2019s, Harley-Davidson and Ford Motor Company have all scaled back their DEI programming. DEI programs have long been under scrutiny, but conservatives have escalated attacks on such initiatives following Donald Trump\u2019s win during the 2024 US presidential election. Corporate companies have also continued to rollback their diversity initiatives since the US supreme court ended affirmative action for university admissions in June 2023, a major blow to inclusion efforts.",

Marsh said a jury inquest would be required as Tamzin died while in \u201cstate detention\u201d. The coroner adjourned the inquest to 5 November next year, when a pre-inquest review will be held.

The capital\u2019s transport operator has published a new enforcement policy to tackle the growing problem of dumped bikes cluttering walkways throughout the capital, which will include fines of \u00a350 for each bike found blocking a walkway. The policy will cover TfL land, which includes areas such as station forecourts and bus garages, as well as along pavements on its red route road network, which makes up just 5% of all roads in the capital but carries up to 30% of the city\u2019s traffic. TfL has said the enforcement action will be \u201cproportionate\u201d but will range from warnings, to fixed-penalty notices, to the removal of vehicles, to prosecution. Fixed-penalty notices of \u00a350 for illegally parked bikes that block pavements will be issued directly to companies, with these rising to \u00a3100 if not paid within 14 days. It comes as the number of dockless bikes in the capital has soared in recent years, since Obike launched the first scheme in 2017. While official numbers have not been published, the city\u2019s two biggest operators, Lime and Forest, run about 30,000 and 15,000 bikes respectively. TfL said dockless e-bikes were an important part of London\u2019s transport network but problematic parking was leading to safety issues, particularly for elderly and disabled people, and this was being exacerbated by the recent increase in fleet sizes. It said there had been a particular growth in fleets in the past 12 months. The use of dockless e-bikes has soared globally in recent years, and Lime, the world\u2019s biggest operator, runs schemes in 230 cities around the world since launching in 2017. A number of UK cities now run dockless schemes, including Oxford, Manchester and Swansea. Oxfordshire city council created a code of conduct in 2017 for companies operating in Oxford to try to reduce the incidents of vehicles blocking walkways. Westminster city council launched a scheme last year to set up docking stations for bikes across the borough, with operators being fined if riders did not use them. Other boroughs such as Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham, and the City of London have created similar schemes. Alongside the new enforcement policy, TfL has announced that it aims to spend \u00a31m for boroughs to create 7,500 parking spaces for dockless e-bikes. It has also called on the government to bring in legislation that would give transport bodies more powers to regulate and manage dockless services. Caroline Seton, the co-founder and chief legal officer at Forest, said: \u201cSadly not everyone in the dockless bike industry has lived up to the standards we\u2019ve set, which is why we believe it is time for the government to take action and give TfL the powers needs to enforce high standards across the industry.\u201d Clive Wood, from the charity Guide Dogs, said: \u201cWe have heard from many vision impaired people in London that they have to try to navigate around inconsiderately parked rental e-scooter and e-bikes on a regular basis. \u201cI hope operators will work with TfL to ensure the updated policy makes a difference.\u201d",

The report by KPMG found that new private residential construction spending per capita is at its lowest level since 1987-88, as renovation spending surged from 34.2% of total residential construction spend in 2018-19 to 40% in 2023-24. \u201cFor every nail hammered and brick laid in residential construction, 40% of it is going into renovating a pre-existing home,\u201d said Terry Rawnsley, an urban economist at KPMG. \u201cThis indicates that there is not enough money and resources being attracted to expanding the housing stock. \u201cMore straightforward planning processes and lower risks for builders make renovating existing homes a favoured option over adding multiple homes on the same block.\u201d New private residential construction also includes demolishing a detached property and replacing it with a single new home, known as a one-for-one replacement. Almost 10% of new private residential construction spending is on one-for-one replacements, KPMG found, with Victoria having the highest rate at 12.6% of new residential construction, followed by Western Aaustralia at 9.1%, and New South Wales at 8.7%.

Between 2012 and 2019, new housing spending increased by 58%. But the departure of international workers and students in 2020-21 during the pandemic led to a per-capita investment spike of $1.9m per capita. Two years later, the per-capita investment has declined by almost 50%, sinking to $113,000 in 2023-24 as population growth surged and investment flatlined, the analysis found. Covid also had an impact on renovation spend, according to the analysis. As new housing investment increased between 2012 and 2020, alterations and additions investment declined and reached its lowest share of 33.5% in 2017-18. But this investment rebounded significantly in recent years \u2013 a trend further amplified since 2020 as those driven by remote work and lifestyle changes opted for larger and better homes. An analysis of NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia found that the local government area with the greatest spend on renovations was Brisbane, followed by Sydney\u2019s northern beaches and Boroondara in Melbourne\u2019s east.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has quickly tapped big donors and political allies for top posts to roll back environmental and health regulations, cut taxes and government spending in ways that will benefit key backers, say government watchdogs. Armed with blueprints to expand presidential power in aggressive ways and backed by a bevy of billionaire donors and ultra loyalists who helped him win, the president-elect\u2019s transactional style of awarding powerful posts to backers such as X owner Elon Musk, or allies of others such as fracking mogul Harold Hamm, is seen as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, and will likely boost their bottom lines, say critics. \u201cTrump has taken the cliche that \u2018all politics is local\u2019 and turned it into \u2018all politics is about personal payback\u2019,\u201d said former Federal Election Commission general counsel Larry Noble. \u201cThe naked transactional nature and potentially dangerous conflicts of interests reflected in Trump\u2019s ongoing paybacks are unprecedented in modern times.\u201d Among the super-rich donors helping shape the president-elect\u2019s administration, no one seems to loom larger than Musk, who gave some $200m to a pro-Trump Super Pac. Musk has become a ubiquitous adviser to Trump who tapped him to co-chair an outside federal advisory panel on \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d, an effort fraught with conflicts given the billions of dollars in government contracts that Musk\u2019s companies now boast. Dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Musk has suggested his goal is finding $2tn in spending and regulatory cuts which critics say could benefit his company SpaceX, Tesla and other Musk companies. The panel\u2019s provenance stems from Musk, the world\u2019s richest man with a fortune of about $260bn, who touted the idea to Trump in August during a two-hour chat they had on Musk\u2019s X, which served as a major Trump booster while pushing misinformation. Similarly, fossil-fuel tycoons such as Hamm, a multi-billionaire who leads the fracking giant Continental Resources and donated some $4m to help Trump win while raising millions more from industry friends, are sitting pretty as Trump eyes rollbacks in climate change measures and protecting the environment. To boost oil and gas interests, Trump has named North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, an industry ally and Hamm friend, to lead the interior department and a new national energy council, positions widely expected to spur more drilling, even though oil and gas output has reached record levels during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Overall, oil and gas interests coughed up more than $75m to help Trump win after he repeatedly said he was all for \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d policies; and at a Mar-a-Lago dinner last spring Trump exhorted some 20 industry leaders including Hamm to raise $1bn for his campaign. Further, the burgeoning crypto industry that Trump aggressively courted and whose leaders helped underwrite his campaign with millions of dollars, is poised to reap major regulatory and financial benefits. Trump pledged at a bitcoin conference in July to make America the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world\u201d, and told industry moguls they were \u201cgeniuses\u201d, despite proclaiming in 2021 that bitcoin was a \u201cscam\u201d. To butter up the bitcoin leaders, Trump promised to oust Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, who the industry has viewed as an overly tough regulator for cracking down on some cryptocurrency frauds, and \u201cappoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future\u201d. Lighter SEC regulation could personally benefit a new venture of Trump and his sons Don Jr and Eric. Trump announced on X in mid-September that they were launching a cryptocurrency firm, World Liberty Financial, with help from an old Trump friend Steve Witkoff. The New York Times reported further that \u201ctwo little-known crypto entrepreneurs with no experience in running a high-profile business\u201d were also involved.

Another federal effort, the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) that will underwrite 32GW of new projects, will also run out by then.</p> <p>\u201cThe review will provide a comprehensive assessment of what the market will need next, once the current CIS tenders end in 2027, to ensure that investment pipeline remains strong,\u201d Bowen said.</p> <p>Joining Nelson on the panel will be: Paula Conboy, a former chair of the Australian Energy Regulator; Ava Hancock, an official who helped design NSW\u2019s energy roadmap; and Phil Hirschhorn, a petroleum engineer who has worked with Boston Consulting Group.</p> <p>It is understood the choice of the panel backed by Bowen\u2019s department surprised observers expecting an organisation such as the Productivity Commission to conduct the review. The announcement\u2019s timing (about 10 days before 2024\u2019s final meeting of state and federal ministers) also caught some officials on the hop.</p> <p>Dylan McConnell, an energy specialist at the University of NSW, said the first five years after 2030 were likely to be critical.

      "bodyText": "The Albanese government has launched a review of how the main power grid can accelerate the take-up of renewables when existing support ends. It ruled out examining the imposition of a carbon price on the nation\u2019s biggest polluting sector. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, on Tuesday revealed the review\u2019s terms of reference and its four-person panel, chaired by energy veteran Tim Nelson. It will report back by the end of 2025 \u2013 well after the next federal election. The review\u2019s announcement came on a day electricity supplies were strained in New South Wales as a heatwave elevated demand and wholesale power prices. Conditions were likely to remain \u201ctight\u201d for days but supplies should remain sufficient, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The panel will examine settings for the national electricity market (Nem) to ensure it aids investment in clean energy generation backed up by storage after the renewable energy target expires in 2030. Another federal effort, the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) that will underwrite 32GW of new projects, will also run out by then. \u201cThe review will provide a comprehensive assessment of what the market will need next, once the current CIS tenders end in 2027, to ensure that investment pipeline remains strong,\u201d Bowen said. Joining Nelson on the panel will be: Paula Conboy, a former chair of the Australian Energy Regulator; Ava Hancock, an official who helped design NSW\u2019s energy roadmap; and Phil Hirschhorn, a petroleum engineer who has worked with Boston Consulting Group. It is understood the choice of the panel backed by Bowen\u2019s department surprised observers expecting an organisation such as the Productivity Commission to conduct the review. The announcement\u2019s timing (about 10 days before 2024\u2019s final meeting of state and federal ministers) also caught some officials on the hop. Dylan McConnell, an energy specialist at the University of NSW, said the first five years after 2030 were likely to be critical. That\u2019s when many of the remaining coal-fired power stations are scheduled to shut. In recent years, there had also been a \u201chodgepodge of schemes\u201d outside the Nem itself, McConnell said. The mechanisms include the South Australian government\u2019s recent plans for an extra firming scheme and NSW\u2019s long-duration storage tenders. \u201cThese are all pointing to the current market design not working or being allowed to work,\u201d he said, adding that cooperative federalism had fragmented. Tony Wood, a senior energy analyst who co-authored a Grattan Institute report earlier this year on the post-2030 grid, said he hoped energy ministers would support the review and its ultimate findings. \u201cIf the ministers aren\u2019t on board, we have a problem from the very beginning,\u201d Wood said, noting lack of unanimity had blocked a previous effort by the former energy security board to introduce a capacity mechanism involving gas. \u201cWhat it\u2019s really about is how do you get investment in the stuff that\u2019s not going to be used very often \u2026 when the wind isn\u2019t blowing, the sun isn\u2019t shining and batteries don\u2019t do it,\u201d Wood said. The Grattan report called for a market structure designed for a post-coal market and greater integration of all forms of distributed energy resources, including households\u2019 rooftop solar and batteries. It also recommended the reintroduction of a carbon price \u2013 axed by the Abbott government \u2013 to guide investments decisions. But the review\u2019s terms of reference explicitly exclude a carbon price. \u201cThe expert panel will not consider options that involve implementation of carbon trading schemes, carbon markets or that entail governments supporting new fossil fuel generation,\u201d the government said. Rewiring Australia, a group advocating the electrification of the economy using renewables, said the review should put \u201cconsumers on the same footing as institutional investors and big energy companies\u201d, its executive director, Dan Cass, said. \u201cOver the next 20 years, everyday Australians will invest up to eight times more in energy technologies including [electric vehicles] than big institutional investors,\u201d Cass said. \u201cThey must be front and centre of this transition.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For Claire Dinhut, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-condiment-book-9781526669780/\">The Condiment Book</a>, it\u2019s all about staying within the confines of the traditional Thanksgiving menu, but giving each dish some extra zhoosh. The sides are the obvious choice for this: \u201cMy family is from Los Angeles,\u201d Dinhut says, \u201cbut they\u2019re also half Greek, so our creamed spinach, for example, is always spanakopita-style creamed spinach with feta and dill.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Dinhut also goes by the moniker of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/condimentclaire/\">Condiment Claire</a>, she also leans on a variety of jars and bottles to perk things up: sure, dijon mustard will bring \u201cbrightness and a bit of texture\u201d to mashed potatoes, but why not kick things up a gear and use smoky dijon? \u201cToast chilli flakes, then combine with mustard [or mayo] to get that extra depth; that also works a charm as a dip for green beans.\u201d</p> <p>Dijon is also a friend to sprouts, Dinhut says: \u201cWe go for a slaw at Thanksgiving, with dijon, apple cider vinegar, fresh herbs and salt, to contrast that hearty mash.\u201d Red-wine vinegar, meanwhile, features in Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s family favourite, braised red cabbage: \u201cToss the cabbage with vinegar and salt, then sweat onions in butter in a large casserole pan until tender,\u201d says the chef/patron of <a href=\"https://www.the-emory.co.uk/restaurants-bars/abc-kitchens/\">ABC Kitchens</a> in London. Add the cabbage mix, press down, then pour in some red wine and top with sliced apple (pink lady, for preference). Cover and cook until almost dry. Carrots are another Thanksgiving must, though Dinhut breaks from tradition by roasting hers with maple syrup and pumpkin spice blend ( cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves).</p> <p>We\u2019re also thankful for stuffing, which, in the US, involves adding nuts, dried fruit or veg to chopped up bread. Tim Anderson, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hokkaido-9781784885984/\">Hokkaido</a>, recommends using cooked wild rice, cranberries and chestnuts, or crumbling in some sausage: \u201cA good, coarse Italian fennel sausage is best, but it\u2019s really up to you,\u201d he says. Vongerichten, meanwhile, turns his stuffing (ground turkey, diced foie gras, chestnuts, mushrooms, sourdough) into patties for what he calls \u201cFrench-American stuffing\u201d. And let\u2019s not forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/23/yotam-ottolenghi-thanksgiving-roast-spiced-duck-and-stuffing-biscuits-recipes\">Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s stuffing biscuits</a>, where onion, garlic, rosemary, sage and celery salt are sauteed in melted butter before honey is added and the whole lot is then folded through buttermilk biscuit dough.</p> <p>\u201cThanksgiving dinner can be so rich and monotonous,\u201d Anderson says, which is why he keeps his cranberry sauce punchy, cooking the frozen fruit with marmalade, <a href=\"https://kinnie.com/\">Kinnie</a> (a Maltese fizzy orange drink), fresh ginger and chilli. It\u2019s also a serious business at Dinhut\u2019s, where there are always three types on offer: \u201cTraditional, a variation with orange juice and peel, and one with jalape\u00f1os.\u201d The latter couldn\u2019t be simpler, either: just cook fresh or frozen cranberries with the usual suspects (although Dinhut ups the sugar to \u201cget that sweet/spicy balance\u201d) and a couple of chopped jalape\u00f1os.</p> <p>The final word, as ever, goes to the bird: \u201cThis might be controversial,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cbut to make a great Thanksgiving turkey, you\u2019ve got to disassemble it and cook all the parts separately.\u201d Remove and salt the skin, then roast until crisp (\u201cThat can be done a day before and reheated\u201d), brine the crown, then roast under foil or steam gently; confit the wings and legs in a mix of butter, duck fat, walnut oil, rosemary, sage and garlic; and use the surplus carcass to make a stock for gravy. After all, make-ahead is always the name of the Thanksgiving game.</p> <ul> <li><p>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href=\"mailto:feast@theguardian.com\">feast@theguardian.com</a></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "For Claire Dinhut, author of The Condiment Book, it\u2019s all about staying within the confines of the traditional Thanksgiving menu, but giving each dish some extra zhoosh. The sides are the obvious choice for this: \u201cMy family is from Los Angeles,\u201d Dinhut says, \u201cbut they\u2019re also half Greek, so our creamed spinach, for example, is always spanakopita-style creamed spinach with feta and dill.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Dinhut also goes by the moniker of Condiment Claire, she also leans on a variety of jars and bottles to perk things up: sure, dijon mustard will bring \u201cbrightness and a bit of texture\u201d to mashed potatoes, but why not kick things up a gear and use smoky dijon? \u201cToast chilli flakes, then combine with mustard [or mayo] to get that extra depth; that also works a charm as a dip for green beans.\u201d Dijon is also a friend to sprouts, Dinhut says: \u201cWe go for a slaw at Thanksgiving, with dijon, apple cider vinegar, fresh herbs and salt, to contrast that hearty mash.\u201d Red-wine vinegar, meanwhile, features in Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s family favourite, braised red cabbage: \u201cToss the cabbage with vinegar and salt, then sweat onions in butter in a large casserole pan until tender,\u201d says the chef/patron of ABC Kitchens in London. Add the cabbage mix, press down, then pour in some red wine and top with sliced apple (pink lady, for preference). Cover and cook until almost dry. Carrots are another Thanksgiving must, though Dinhut breaks from tradition by roasting hers with maple syrup and pumpkin spice blend ( cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves). We\u2019re also thankful for stuffing, which, in the US, involves adding nuts, dried fruit or veg to chopped up bread. Tim Anderson, author of Hokkaido, recommends using cooked wild rice, cranberries and chestnuts, or crumbling in some sausage: \u201cA good, coarse Italian fennel sausage is best, but it\u2019s really up to you,\u201d he says. Vongerichten, meanwhile, turns his stuffing (ground turkey, diced foie gras, chestnuts, mushrooms, sourdough) into patties for what he calls \u201cFrench-American stuffing\u201d. And let\u2019s not forget Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s stuffing biscuits, where onion, garlic, rosemary, sage and celery salt are sauteed in melted butter before honey is added and the whole lot is then folded through buttermilk biscuit dough. \u201cThanksgiving dinner can be so rich and monotonous,\u201d Anderson says, which is why he keeps his cranberry sauce punchy, cooking the frozen fruit with marmalade, Kinnie (a Maltese fizzy orange drink), fresh ginger and chilli. It\u2019s also a serious business at Dinhut\u2019s, where there are always three types on offer: \u201cTraditional, a variation with orange juice and peel, and one with jalape\u00f1os.\u201d The latter couldn\u2019t be simpler, either: just cook fresh or frozen cranberries with the usual suspects (although Dinhut ups the sugar to \u201cget that sweet/spicy balance\u201d) and a couple of chopped jalape\u00f1os. The final word, as ever, goes to the bird: \u201cThis might be controversial,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cbut to make a great Thanksgiving turkey, you\u2019ve got to disassemble it and cook all the parts separately.\u201d Remove and salt the skin, then roast until crisp (\u201cThat can be done a day before and reheated\u201d), brine the crown, then roast under foil or steam gently; confit the wings and legs in a mix of butter, duck fat, walnut oil, rosemary, sage and garlic; and use the surplus carcass to make a stock for gravy. After all, make-ahead is always the name of the Thanksgiving game. Got a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>It was a brazen act of extreme literary vandalism that desecrated one of the world\u2019s most valuable books. But it also allowed a family of Holocaust survivors to forge a new life in Australia.</p> <p>The extraordinary tale was uncovered by the author and journalist Michael Visontay while researching his family history during Covid lockdown and has now been published as a book, Noble Fragments.</p> <p>It tells how 100 years ago a New York bookseller pulled apart a Gutenberg Bible \u2013 one of only 45 then thought to exist \u2013 and sold the individual pages for a fortune.</p>    <p>\u201cIt was the holy grail of rare books,\u201d Visontay says.</p> <p>\u201cNoble fragments was a fancy term to cover up the fact that what was done was literary sacrilege.</p> <p>\u201cTo break up any book is offensive to most people, but to break up a Gutenberg Bible, that was a crime against history.\u201d</p> <p>Visontay\u2019s discovery began with a mystery surrounding the second of his grandfather\u2019s three wives, a woman the family appeared to have erased from existence. There were no photos of Olga, no indication of where she was buried, and an unspoken family rule that she was never to be discussed or acknowledged.</p> <p>Yet rummaging through old papers after the death of his mother five years ago, Visontay came across Olga\u2019s name in what appeared to be a legal document demanding money.</p> <p>Also mentioned in the document was a name Visontay had never heard before: Gabriel Wells.</p> <p>A simple Google search set the writer on an entirely new trajectory of his research.</p> <p>Visontay discovered online a 1946 obituary for Wells, who, he learned, had been one of the most influential antiquarian book dealers in the US in the first half of the 20th century.</p> <h2>A brilliant and inconceivable act</h2> <p>Wells, born Gabriel Weisz, had abandoned his wife and home country of Hungary and resettled in Boston in 1894. The \u201cgilded age\u201d, as it was later to be called, was a time when rare books were becoming a coveted commodity. By the time the \u201cGatsby\u201d era of wealth emerged in the 1920s, money from oil and the railroads boom meant nouveau riche families needed to fill their sprawling mansions with the hallmarks of wealth and good breeding; art for their walls and books for the shelves in their vast libraries.</p>    <p>Wells rubbed shoulders with Rothschilds and Vanderbilts. He famously paid US$200,000 (about $3.6m in today\u2019s money) for the right to print a limited run of Mark Twain\u2019s definitive writings, and lost the world\u2019s most expensive copy of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, encrusted with more than 1,000 precious gems, while transporting it from Britain to the US on the Titanic\u2019s maiden voyage.</p> <p>But Wells\u2019s most noted achievement was his acquisition of a Gutenberg Bible in the early 1920s and, in a brilliant and inconceivable act of entrepreneurship/vandalism, broke it up and sold the individual pages, as well as some complete books of the Bible. Wells claimed the \u201cnoble fragments\u201d \u2013 the term he used to market the individual leaves \u2013 was a victory for egalitarianism, like the 15th-century book itself that heralded the dawn of secular literacy and mass printing. For the equivalent of about US$1,500 in today\u2019s money, anyone could own a piece of the world\u2019s most valuable book.</p>    <p>The connoisseurs<strong> </strong>were outraged. The press were fascinated. The public were captivated. The pages sold like hot cakes.</p> <p>\u201cWells justified his actions by saying the book was already missing too many pages to sell it as a complete Bible,\u201d Visontay says.</p> <p>\u201cBut this was just not true. A number of the other Gutenbergs were missing more leaves than his one. So really it was a marketing ploy \u2013 break it up and maximise the returns.\u201d</p> <h2>Tragedy and family turmoil</h2> <p>With one piece of the puzzle solved, Visontay\u2019s next challenge was to find out how this literary vandal came to be entangled in his family.</p> <p>Like Wells, the Weiszmann family were Hungarian Jews, living in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s, a village about 100km from Budapest, where the family owned the local delicatessen. When Germany invaded Hungary in 1944, Pali and Sara Weiszmann, Visontay\u2019s grandparents, and his father, Ivan, then 14, were rounded up and transported to concentration camps \u2013 Pali to Mauthausen in Austria, Ivan and his mother to Auschwitz in Poland.</p> <p>Sara perished, but her husband and son survived, reuniting in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s at the war\u2019s end.</p> <p>The traumatised family picked up the remnants of their lives. Their home had been destroyed during the war, but the deli was still standing. Father and son reopened the business and rented rooms in a house owned by a woman who had also lost her spouse in the Holocaust, Olga Illovfsky.</p>    <p>Within a year Olga Illovfsky had become Olga Weiszmann, Pali\u2019s second wife, much to the anguish of the teenaged Ivan.</p> <p>\u201cPali told his son that he was lonely \u2026 but it was a very devastating piece of news for my father, because he\u2019d been in the concentration camp with his mother,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cHe had lost her, and then there was just two of them, and then when my grandfather announced that he was marrying Olga, well, Ivan blamed her for reconfiguring the family and he felt left out.\u201d</p>    <p>With Hungary under communist rule, the Weiszmanns, now using the surname Visontai, watched as their delicatessen was confiscated for the second time. They decided to flee, planning their relocation to the US from a migrant camp in Italy. Ivan\u2019s visa was accepted, but Pali\u2019s and Olga\u2019s were not.

      "bodyText": "It was a brazen act of extreme literary vandalism that desecrated one of the world\u2019s most valuable books. But it also allowed a family of Holocaust survivors to forge a new life in Australia. The extraordinary tale was uncovered by the author and journalist Michael Visontay while researching his family history during Covid lockdown and has now been published as a book, Noble Fragments. It tells how 100 years ago a New York bookseller pulled apart a Gutenberg Bible \u2013 one of only 45 then thought to exist \u2013 and sold the individual pages for a fortune. \u201cIt was the holy grail of rare books,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cNoble fragments was a fancy term to cover up the fact that what was done was literary sacrilege. \u201cTo break up any book is offensive to most people, but to break up a Gutenberg Bible, that was a crime against history.\u201d Visontay\u2019s discovery began with a mystery surrounding the second of his grandfather\u2019s three wives, a woman the family appeared to have erased from existence. There were no photos of Olga, no indication of where she was buried, and an unspoken family rule that she was never to be discussed or acknowledged. Yet rummaging through old papers after the death of his mother five years ago, Visontay came across Olga\u2019s name in what appeared to be a legal document demanding money. Also mentioned in the document was a name Visontay had never heard before: Gabriel Wells. A simple Google search set the writer on an entirely new trajectory of his research. Visontay discovered online a 1946 obituary for Wells, who, he learned, had been one of the most influential antiquarian book dealers in the US in the first half of the 20th century. A brilliant and inconceivable act Wells, born Gabriel Weisz, had abandoned his wife and home country of Hungary and resettled in Boston in 1894. The \u201cgilded age\u201d, as it was later to be called, was a time when rare books were becoming a coveted commodity. By the time the \u201cGatsby\u201d era of wealth emerged in the 1920s, money from oil and the railroads boom meant nouveau riche families needed to fill their sprawling mansions with the hallmarks of wealth and good breeding; art for their walls and books for the shelves in their vast libraries. Wells rubbed shoulders with Rothschilds and Vanderbilts. He famously paid US$200,000 (about $3.6m in today\u2019s money) for the right to print a limited run of Mark Twain\u2019s definitive writings, and lost the world\u2019s most expensive copy of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, encrusted with more than 1,000 precious gems, while transporting it from Britain to the US on the Titanic\u2019s maiden voyage. But Wells\u2019s most noted achievement was his acquisition of a Gutenberg Bible in the early 1920s and, in a brilliant and inconceivable act of entrepreneurship/vandalism, broke it up and sold the individual pages, as well as some complete books of the Bible. Wells claimed the \u201cnoble fragments\u201d \u2013 the term he used to market the individual leaves \u2013 was a victory for egalitarianism, like the 15th-century book itself that heralded the dawn of secular literacy and mass printing. For the equivalent of about US$1,500 in today\u2019s money, anyone could own a piece of the world\u2019s most valuable book. The connoisseurs were outraged. The press were fascinated. The public were captivated. The pages sold like hot cakes. \u201cWells justified his actions by saying the book was already missing too many pages to sell it as a complete Bible,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cBut this was just not true. A number of the other Gutenbergs were missing more leaves than his one. So really it was a marketing ploy \u2013 break it up and maximise the returns.\u201d Tragedy and family turmoil With one piece of the puzzle solved, Visontay\u2019s next challenge was to find out how this literary vandal came to be entangled in his family. Like Wells, the Weiszmann family were Hungarian Jews, living in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s, a village about 100km from Budapest, where the family owned the local delicatessen. When Germany invaded Hungary in 1944, Pali and Sara Weiszmann, Visontay\u2019s grandparents, and his father, Ivan, then 14, were rounded up and transported to concentration camps \u2013 Pali to Mauthausen in Austria, Ivan and his mother to Auschwitz in Poland. Sara perished, but her husband and son survived, reuniting in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s at the war\u2019s end. The traumatised family picked up the remnants of their lives. Their home had been destroyed during the war, but the deli was still standing. Father and son reopened the business and rented rooms in a house owned by a woman who had also lost her spouse in the Holocaust, Olga Illovfsky. Within a year Olga Illovfsky had become Olga Weiszmann, Pali\u2019s second wife, much to the anguish of the teenaged Ivan. \u201cPali told his son that he was lonely \u2026 but it was a very devastating piece of news for my father, because he\u2019d been in the concentration camp with his mother,\u201d Visontay says. \u201cHe had lost her, and then there was just two of them, and then when my grandfather announced that he was marrying Olga, well, Ivan blamed her for reconfiguring the family and he felt left out.\u201d With Hungary under communist rule, the Weiszmanns, now using the surname Visontai, watched as their delicatessen was confiscated for the second time. They decided to flee, planning their relocation to the US from a migrant camp in Italy. Ivan\u2019s visa was accepted, but Pali\u2019s and Olga\u2019s were not. The family settled on Australia instead. In 1952 they arrived in Sydney, and before long were running a thriving business in the only field of endeavour Pali had ever known. The iconic Minerva deli in Sydney\u2019s bohemian Kings Cross of the 1950s sold exotic continental smallgoods most Australians had never heard of before the war. Locals and the growing Hungarian diaspora in Sydney came as much for the atmosphere and the camaraderie as the salamis and the goulash. The delicatessen thrived and so did the Visontai, now Visontay, family. The Gutenberg legacy So how did a family devastated by the Holocaust and financially ruined by the communists prosper so quickly in Australia? Some time between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, Olga, already married to Pali, inherited a small fortune from a childless uncle she had barely known \u2013 Gabriel Wells. A portion of the fortune Wells amassed through his desecration of the world\u2019s most valuable Bible had bankrolled a traumatised Jewish family\u2019s flight from Hungary and provided the foundation for a new life on the other side of the world. \u201cGabriel Wells breaking up this Bible had set off a chain of events that gave my family a rebirth, a second lease of life,\u201d Visontay says. Less than a year after the Minerva deli opened, Olga died suddenly from a stroke. Cousins who had co-inherited the Wells fortune sent a letter of demand to the Visontays in Sydney, seeking the return of Olga\u2019s inheritance to their families. Overwhelmed by the legal might of the challenge, Pali and Ivan decided not to fight the case. It would take them the next five years to get their small business back to where it had begun, and Olga\u2019s name \u2013 and the part she played in the family\u2019s newfound safety and prosperity \u2013 was expunged. There is a paradoxical footnote to the Gabriel Wells side of the saga. Yes, the rogue antiquarian built his wealth from an act of literary vandalism. But the noble fragments scandal enabled a number of institutions and universities to acquire pages missing from their own editions of the Gutenberg Bible, including some Wells donated to the New York Public Library. It is believed about 180 copies of the book were printed and first made available in 1455. Today there are 48 in existence \u2013 only 20 remain wholly intact. Visontay has so far established the location of 120 \u201cnoble fragments\u201d sold by his relative a century ago, including 11 that made their way to Australia. \u2022 Noble Fragments by Michael Visontay is published by Scribe. It will be available in the UK from 16 January, and the US from 4 March. The author will be in conversation with Caroline Baum at Sydney\u2019s Gleebooks on Wednesday 27 November at 6pm.",

While over half the deaths (46%) in the study period were people aged 35-54 years, over 1 in 10 (or 1,500 in total) were people aged 25-34 and 1 in 100 (160 total) were children under 14. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Suicide and accidental poisoning were the leading causes of death, accounting for between one-quarter to one-third of all deaths each year. In 2021-22, people who had accessed homelessness services in their final year accounted for one in six accidental poisoning deaths and one in 20 suicides nationwide. It comes after a Guardian Australia investigation of more than 600 homelessness deaths showed they were dying, on average, 30 years prematurely, at an average age of 44. The AIHW study of the 10-year period showed the average age of death was 46, much younger than clients who were experiencing homelessness but not connected with services, who had an average age of 54 at death, and far below the national average of 83.

Earlier this year, the Guardian used an analysis of hidden death reports to state and territory coroners, a review of 10 years\u2019 worth of publicly available inquest findings, and interviews with dozens of homeless Australians, victims\u2019 families, frontline support workers and researchers to show that many homelessness deaths were both preventable and inextricably linked to the critical undersupply of housing and support services. The investigation revealed that suicide and overdose \u2013 described as \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d \u2013 are major drivers of deaths among those experiencing homelessness. Such deaths accounted for one-fifth and one-third of deaths respectively between January 2010 and December 2020.

Guardian Australia has confirmed a gambling syndicate paid $1,000 to desperate men for their ID documents, which were used to create multiple bank and betting accounts in their names. Cash was deposited into these bank accounts and gambled with at least nine bookmakers. Those deceived have expressed frustration at syndicates that go to \u201cextreme and sophisticated lengths to avoid detection\u201d and called on the federal government to introduce tougher laws and for regulators to clamp down on them. A spokesperson for the federal attorney general\u2019s department said \u201cbusinesses that fail to put appropriate policies and procedures in place to know who their customers are (\u2026) may be breaching their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations\u201d. \u201cAustrac can take a range of enforcement action against businesses which do not meet their obligations, including significant civil penalties,\u201d the spokesperson said.

The Australian Banking Association, which represents some of the deceived banks, has also urged the government to do more to tackle this issue. \u201cWhere banks become aware of mule accounts they are required to report them to Austrac,\u201d an ABA spokesperson said. \u201cThe ABA would support stricter laws around money muling, including laws relating to solicitation of using an account as a money mule.\u201d A spokesperson for the Northern Territory government, which regulates many of the bookmakers deceived by the syndicate, said \u201cwagering operators generally use a third-party verification agency\u201d. \u201cThe commission has been made aware of the practice referred to in the article, and understands that wagering operators are continuing to take steps to try to address the issue,\u201d the spokesperson said. Many of the gambling syndicates operating in other people\u2019s names insist they have not broken any laws. But the former Australian federal police financial investigator and lawyer Tam McLaughlin told the ABC there was \u201ca strong chance\u201d they had. \u201cYou are not allowed to receive a designated service, which includes placing a bet, without being the person whose name the account is held in,\u201d said McLaughlin, who is now a partner at fraud and corruption firm Duxton Hill. \u2022 In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858. The National Debt Helpline is at 1800 007 007. In the UK, support for problem gambling can be found via the NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic on 020 7381 7722, or GamCare on 0808 8020 133.

Just over a third (36%) of companies in the FTSE 100 have women in executive director roles, even though almost three-quarters (74%) of firms have met the target of having 40% of women on their boards. \u201cThrough their own tenacity, drive and experiences some women do make it to the top positions, but once they get to the C-Suite [the highest-ranking executive level] they often find themselves unsupported and in a hostile, macho environment,\u201d said Vinnicombe, adding that issues needed to be addressed to bring \u201csignificant and meaningful changes in the numbers of women executive directors\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "After an upset in the first of three crunch votes that could lead to Romania veering towards a more anti-EU, pro-Russian stance, the EU and Nato member state returns to the polls on Sunday for a parliamentary ballot followed, on 8 December, by a presidential runoff. The votes will be closely watched not least in Brussels, which does not want another disruptive, sovereignist influence in the region alongside Hungary and Slovakia, and among western allies, which Bucharest has reliably backed against Moscow. Romania shares a 400-mile border with Ukraine and is considered to play a key strategic role, hosting a big Nato military base, donating a Patriot air defence battery and providing a vital transit route for millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain. Who is running for president and who might win? The race to replace the outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis, produced an early shock when both pre-election frontrunners, including the centre-left prime minister, were knocked out in the first round, which was won by a little-known far right, Russia-friendly independent. C\u0103lin Georgescu, 62, an ultranationalist who has praised Vladimir Putin as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d and was polling at 5% just before the vote, finished first on 22.9%, with Elena Lasconi, of the liberal-progressive Save Romania Union (USR), second on 19.2%. The prime minister, Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democrats (PSD), and Nicolae Ciuc\u0103, of the centre-right National Liberal party (PNL) \u2013 both members of the outgoing coalition government \u2013 were beaten, as was George Simion of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR). Georgescu, a sustainable development and toxic waste expert who once worked for the UN and won prizes for pro-European engagement, has more recently criticised the EU, claimed Nato would never help Romania and called for an end to the war in Ukraine. He has also denied the existence of Covid-19, declared that Jesus Christ is \u201cthe only true science\u201d, described two second world war-era Romanian fascists as \u201cnational heroes\u201d and explained that Romania is not up to foreign affairs and should rely on \u201cRussian wisdom\u201d. Up against Georgescu, whose under-the-radar campaign was boosted by a hugely effective TikTok campaign that experts have said could indicate Russian interference, is Lasconi, a well-known former war reporter and TV news presenter. Since entering politics the USR leader has twice been elected mayor of a small town. She is socially conservative \u2013 she voted against same-sex marriage \u2013 but is pro-EU and believes in boosting defence spending, helping Ukraine and fighting Russian influence. As the first round results showed, polls are unreliable in Romania. The PNL has called on its voters to back Lasconi and few analysts think Georgescu can win in a country that has avoided populist nationalism since rejecting communism in 1989 \u2013 but surprises happen. What\u2019s likely to happen in the parliamentary poll? The main question is whether the first-round presidential result will have a knock-on effect on the parliamentary ballot, with voters confirming their anti-establishment sentiment \u2013 or taking fright and heading back to mainstream parties. Ciolacu will lead the centre-left PSD into the elections but has announced he will stand down as party leader afterwards. The centre-right PNL, meanwhile, ended its alliance with the social democrats in October and has pledged not to enter a future coalition with them. Ciolacu, for his part, has ruled out any kind of alliance with the far-right AUR, and Lasconi\u2019s USR will not work with the PSD. Latest polling averages (for what they\u2019re worth) suggest PSD is on course to win with about 30% of the vote, followed by Simion\u2019s AUR on about 21%, Lasconi\u2019s USR on 17% and PNL on about 14%. If those projections are anything like accurate, the PSD and PNL would (assuming they can overcome their differences) still need the support of a smaller third party, potentially the UDMR that represents Romania\u2019s Hungarian minority, to secure a parliamentary majority. But even though he has no party, Georgescu\u2019s victory could give far-right parties an electoral boost and make a new coalition hard to form, with AUR and another far-right party, the MEP Diana \u0218o\u0219oac\u0103\u2019s SOS Romania, potentially on course to win a third or more of parliamentary seats. Retaining control of parliament would be important for Romania\u2019s mainstream and pro-western forces to serve as a counterbalance to Georgescu if he does become president. What are the issues and how does the system work? Romania\u2019s voters are angry. First among their concerns is the high cost of living: the Black Sea country has the EU\u2019s biggest share of people at risk of poverty, as well as the bloc\u2019s highest inflation rate and largest budget deficit, at 8% of economic outlook. The country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and ailing health service are equally big issues.

The oldest officially verified man ever was Jiroemon Kimura from Japan, who lived to the age of 116 years 54 days and died in 2013.</p> <p>The world\u2019s oldest living woman, and oldest living person, is Japan\u2019s 116-year-old Tomiko Itooka.</p> <p>When he was asked this year asked how the world had changed over his lifetime, Tinniswood laughed and said: \u201cIt\u2019s no better in my opinion, or hardly any better, than it was then. Probably in some places it is, but in other places it\u2019s worse.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has gone smaller because of modern travel, principally caused by the aeroplane.

He was asked many times what the secret was to his startlingly long life. \u201cJust luck,\u201d he told Guinness World Records earlier this year. \u201cYou either live long or you live short, and you can\u2019t do much about it.\u201d But it was also a life of moderation. \u201cIf you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you\u2019re going to suffer eventually,\u201d he said. Tinniswood kept up with the news every day and managed his own finances. The only diet he ever followed, he said, was eating fish and chips every Friday but he also conceded he just ate \u201cwhat they give me\u201d. Tinniswood had lived at the Hollies rest home in Southport since just before his 100th birthday. In a statement, his family paid tribute to a man, they said, who had many fine qualities. \u201cHe was intelligent, decisive, brave, calm in any crisis, talented at maths and a great conversationalist,\u201d they said. \u201cHis last day was surrounded by music and love. \u201cJohn always liked to say thank you. So on his behalf, thanks to all those who cared for him over the years, including his carers at the Hollies care home, his GPs, district nurses, occupational therapist and other NHS staff.\u201d Tinniswood was born and brought up in Liverpool, meeting his wife, Blodwen, at a dance in the city and marrying her in 1942, which he later recalled as one of his fondest memories. During the war he served in the Royal Army Pay Corps, responsible for administering finances, organising food supplies and locating stranded soldiers. He was the world\u2019s oldest surviving male veteran of the second world war. He went on to work as an accountant for Shell and BP before retiring in 1972. Tinniswood and his wife were married for 44 years before Blodwen died in 1986. He is survived by his daughter Susan, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Tinniswood was a record holder but not the record holder. The oldest officially verified man ever was Jiroemon Kimura from Japan, who lived to the age of 116 years 54 days and died in 2013. The world\u2019s oldest living woman, and oldest living person, is Japan\u2019s 116-year-old Tomiko Itooka. When he was asked this year asked how the world had changed over his lifetime, Tinniswood laughed and said: \u201cIt\u2019s no better in my opinion, or hardly any better, than it was then. Probably in some places it is, but in other places it\u2019s worse. \u201cThe world has gone smaller because of modern travel, principally caused by the aeroplane. But since then, I can\u2019t think of anything else that\u2019s made the world much different. That\u2019s only my opinion. Otherwise, it\u2019s about the same.\u201d His advice for younger generations was: \u201cAlways do the best you can, whether you\u2019re learning something or whether you\u2019re teaching someone.\u201d",

Finally, an answer to what would happen if Maga had sex with the People\u2019s Vote. I assume we don\u2019t use the phrase \u201cbastard offspring\u201d any longer, but in this case I\u2019ll be making an exception. To see the obnoxious essence of not one but two excruciating political movements hook up and push out a screaming signature-baby is not a pretty sight. I have immediately launched a petition to forcibly sterilise all political movements.</p> <p>To recap, this is the petition started by a Shropshire publican after he\u2019d Googled \u201chow to change the prime minister\u201d and it told him to start a petition. Not a great ad for Google\u2019s search accuracy, let\u2019s face it, but I guess we already knew that was ageing like an unsealed bag-in-box of Phillip Schofield wine. Anyway, the resultant petition has now garnered two and a half million digital signatures, probably many more by the time you read this, and been pushed by public figures ranging from Elon Musk to Michael Caine. Fine. The <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jaws_the_revenge\">Jaws film</a> where the shark genuinely follows the Brody family all the way to the Bahamas is no longer the stupidest thing Michael\u2019s done.</p> <p>We\u2019ll come to the perfectly reasonable complaints about the way Keir Starmer\u2019s government has been doing business shortly \u2013 and to the degree to which it has brought this on itself. But first, I think we do have to consider the unfortunate fact that the UK has once again caught the eye of the man soon to be found affixing stickers reading \u201cElon\u2019s room \u2013 keep out!!!!!!!\u201d on the door of the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House.</p> <p>The Space X/Tesla/United States of America boss keeps pushing the petition on his X platform, with one word prompts like \u201cInteresting\u201d or \u201cWow\u201d. I mean, not really? Big wows, more like. And it\u2019s hard to believe Elon\u2019s attempts to play dumbly impressed. He must know that in the UK and beyond, you can basically Petition McPetitionface any old poll thanks to platforms like his. But if he doesn\u2019t, can someone trick Vice-President Moobs McMoobsface into agreeing that this campaign to re-run a vote we honestly had 10 minutes ago should be called \u201cThe People\u2019s Vote\u201d? I can see Elon gullibly liking the phrasing \u2013 even though it\u2019s a title which has <em>always</em> implied that yeah, you do realise some alleged \u201cpeople\u201d already voted, but the result was something you didn\u2019t like, so were they ever even people at all? Time for the actual humans to vote.</p> <p>Regrettably, Musk hasn\u2019t limited himself to wading into merely one aspect of British affairs, also opting to repost a picture of far-right Tommy Robinson self-swaddling in a prison-issue blanket, with Elon inquiring: \u201cWhy is he in prison for 18 months?\u201d Oh. Normally I would respond to a particularly obtuse online inquiry with a cordial: \u201cDo you have the internet? If so, you could Google it!\u201d But given Elon owns part of the internet, there must be something that keeps him from carrying out this basic task \u2013 possibly a growing distrust of Google\u2019s search accuracy.</p> <p>In which case, happy to oblige. Robinson is in prison for contempt of court, because he wouldn\u2019t stop repeating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/28/tommy-robinson-admits-contempt-of-court-over-false-claims-about-refugee\">false claims about a refugee teenager</a>. And it\u2019s not even the first time he\u2019s been in prison for contempt of court. <a href=\"https://theweek.com/93916/why-tommy-robinson-is-going-to-prison-and-why-the-uk-media-were-silent\">He went before</a> for trying to collapse a grooming trial, which would have put multiple female victims through the horror of having to testify twice. It\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t give a toss about the women, repeatedly indulges in behaviour that in effect makes him their groomers\u2019 and rapists\u2019 friend, and does the entire thing for clicks \u2013 and the ready cash that follows. As a man who recently caught a space rocket with some chopsticks, Elon should surely be the person to grasp that the Robinson grift is not exactly rocket science.</p> <p>Anyway, back to this petition. About 487 leaps down the food chain, Elon is ably supported by Richard Tice, the mid-90s knitwear catalogue model beta-ed out of the Reform leadership by Nigel Farage. Tice is another one that seems to have gone full crybaby about a vote result. Richard once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/brexit-conservatives-tory-conference-fringe-events-leave-means-leave\">called the People\u2019s Vote campaign</a> a \u201closers\u2019 vote\u201d, but is now pushing daily for the petition to become \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TiceRichard/status/1860571856178155716\">the biggest petition ever</a>\u201d in the UK. Can he have it both ways? Can the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/31/jan-6-rioter-qanon-release-jacob-chansley\">QAnon shaman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/23/anti-brexit-protester-steve-bray-vows-to-continue-despite-planned-crackdown\">Steve Bray</a> make a spiritual baby? I wouldn\u2019t have thought so, but the internet is once again refusing to be constrained by facts. As indeed is Richard.</p> <p>However. Having said all that, what did Labour expect? We live in chaotic times where conventions and norms are disintegrating by the day. As many, many people said at the time, Labour not being straight with the electorate about money during the election campaign always threatened to go tits up sooner rather than later. Making silly obfuscations about \u201copening up the books\u201d was warned against by everyone from the heights of the Institute for Fiscal Studies to the depths of this column. Promising revolution via trivial cuts to taxes or services was always putting Starmer\u2019s would-be administration on a hiding to nothing. So here we all are. If populism is claiming there are simple answers to complex problems, then Labour\u2019s manifesto at the recent general election was squarely populist. And if you don\u2019t treat the people like adults, you can hardly complain when they go in for juvenile petitions.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p>A Year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.

      "bodyText": "Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat for alleged spying as tensions between London and Moscow rose after Ukraine\u2019s recent use of British weapons to strike deeper into Russia. The FSB, Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, announced on Tuesday that it had acted on documents accusing a British diplomat of engaging in \u201creconnaissance and subversive activities that threaten the country\u2019s security\u201d. The FSB claimed that the British diplomat \u201cintentionally provided false information when applying for entry into Russia, thereby violating Russian law\u201d. Russian media reported that the diplomat had been given a two-week deadline to leave the country. According to the FSB, the British diplomat, whose photo was splashed across Russian TV news bulletins, was a replacement for one of six UK diplomats expelled in August, also over accusations of espionage. The British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said at the time that the accusations were baseless. The Russian foreign ministry said that it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Nigel Casey. There was no immediate comment from the FCDO. Relations between Britain and Russia plunged to a new low last week after Britain agreed to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles on targets inside Russia. The green light came days after Joe Biden, the US president, agreed to do the same for the similar American long-range Atacms weapon. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, which UK and US officials warned was a significant escalation of the near three-year conflict. Kyiv has since used Storm Shadow missiles to strike a command headquarters in the village of Maryno in the Kursk region. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Britain had sent dozens more of the missiles to Ukraine several weeks ago. Last week, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intensified the already fraught standoff with the west by launching an experimental ballistic missile at a military target in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. He also said that Moscow \u201chad the right\u201d to strike western countries that provided Kyiv with weapons used against Russian targets. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the UK and Russia have periodically engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats, reflecting strained relations. In May, Britain expelled a senior Russian defence attache, accusing them of operating as an undeclared military intelligence officer. In retaliation, Moscow ordered the British defence attache to leave Russia.",

Even for a leadership group that likes a punt, this feels their biggest yet. Bowlers can burst through with little by way of their back catalogue; bolters elevated on the basis of raw ingredients. England have had a few in their recent past, like Shoaib Bashir \u2013 first-class bowling average of 67 when called up \u2013 or Rehan Ahmed, a five-fer on Test debut aged 18. Pat Cummins is one Australian example, with nine Shield wickets at 46 when he first pulled on his baggy green in 2011. But batters are usually expected to have tasted three figures in a first-class game before they get the nod, with Mike Gatting the last England player not to have done so before his debut on a tour of Pakistan in 1978, aged 20. It was not a resounding success, lbw for five shouldering arms to a googly and lbw for six to a full toss.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Donald Trump has said he will sign an immediate executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on China. Trump said the tariffs would remain in place until the US\u2019s two neighbors clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and people crossing the border illegally. While on the campaign trail in October, Trump called the word tariff \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, and made clear his intentions to reduce US companies\u2019 use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost. The plans were attacked as a regressive move that will hit the poorest hardest. \u201cA tariff is basically a sales tax, raising the price of almost everything you buy,\u201d said Robert Reich, a secretary of labor under Bill Clinton. How much trade will this affect? Canada, Mexico and China account for about 40% of the goods the US imports each year, according to official statistics. Beijing said \u201cnobody will win in a trade war\u201d. What\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s love of tariffs? Bill Ackman, the chief executive of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, said Trump is going to use tariffs as a foreign policy \u201cweapon\u201d to \u201cachieve economic and political outcomes\u201d. Prosecutors drop election interference and documents cases against Trump Special counsel prosecutors dismissed the two federal criminal cases against Donald Trump in separate court filings on Monday, as they bowed to the reality that they would not be completed or proceed to trial before Trump returns to the presidency next year. Trump\u2019s election victory ended the criminal cases against him \u2013 over his retention of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 because of a justice department policy that prohibits taking criminal action against a sitting president. What does this tell us about Trump\u2019s legal strategy? Just how successfully Trump managed to navigate the justice system with an audacious play of using a presidential campaign and the political calendar to sidestep deeply perilous charges. Israeli cabinet to decide on ceasefire deal with Lebanon Israel\u2019s security cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday to decide on a ceasefire agreement with Lebanon after more than a year of fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah. Under the deal being considered, the Israel Defense Forces would reportedly withdraw from southern Lebanon, Hezbollah would pull its heavy weapons north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the Israeli border, and the Lebanese army would move in to provide security in the border zone alongside an existing UN peacekeeping force, during an initial 60-day transition phase. Hezbollah has not been a direct party to the talks, in which the Lebanese government has given assurances that the militia would abide by the terms of the deal. Meanwhile, Israel carried out intensive airstrikes on Monday. The IDF said it had struck 25 command centres in Lebanon associated with Hezbollah\u2019s executive council, including in southern Beirut. Why might Netanyahu agree a ceasefire? His government is under domestic political pressure to agree a deal that would allow about 60,000 Israelis from the border region to return home, after spending a year in displacement camps. Here\u2019s how the war ramped up recently: In October, Israel launched a ground invasion and accelerated bombing across Lebanon. The campaign has killed about 3,500 Lebanese people, striking into the heart of Beirut, as well as killing much of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership. In other news \u2026 Russia fired the highest number of drones into Ukraine over a single night since the 2022 invasion began, with Ukrainian forces saying they shot down about 76 of 188 drones. Three bodies were found after a capsized tourist boat sank off Egypt\u2019s Red Sea coast, but 13 people are still missing. At least five police and paramilitary personnel have been killed and dozens of people injured in Pakistan, as thousands of supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan marched on parliament. Macy\u2019s said one employee hid up to $154m in expenses over three years, delaying its important quarterly earnings report. Stat of the day: Samoa faced deadly measles outbreak killing at least 83 and hospitalising 1,867 after RFK Jr visit A few months before a deadly measles outbreak in 2019, Robert F Kennedy Jr travelled to Samoa and met anti-vaccine figures, contributing to what health experts claim was a \u201csignificant disinformation campaign\u201d. Samoa has a population of under 200,000 but many died and thousands were treated in hospital amid low vaccination rates. Don\u2019t miss this: How an Indigenous man was made the public face of an atrocity In 2004, 29 people were killed by members of the Cinta Larga tribe in Brazil\u2019s Amazon basin. The story shocked the country \u2013 but the truth is still being fought over. Alex Cuadros spent years of immersive reporting to understand what happened. Climate check: UK braces for more flooding after Storm Bert overwhelms towns More UK flooding is likely this week after Storm Bert brought torrential rain over the weekend, the environment secretary said. Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, because warmer air can hold more water vapour.

      "body": "<p>Google is in trouble. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/21/google-sell-chrome-us-court-filing-demand-competition-laws\">my colleague Dan Milmo reported</a>, the US Department of Justice \u201chas proposed a far-reaching overhaul of Google\u2019s structure and business practices, including the sale of its Chrome browser, in a bid to end its monopoly on internet search\u201d. The move follows a major court ruling last August in which a federal judge determined that Google had violated antitrust laws and held an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/google-loses-antitrust-lawsuit\">illegal monopoly over search services</a>. The justice department\u2019s suggestion is blunt: \u201cGoogle must divest Chrome.\u201d As for Android, the DoJ proposes two potential remedies: divest or submit to government oversight.</p> <p>Both demands present seismic challenges to Google\u2019s multiform, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/29/alphabet-google-earnings-report\">money-printing</a> advertising business and would be a worst-case scenario for the company. </p> <p>In an aggressively defensive <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/\">blog post</a>, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, Kent Walker, called the justice department\u2019s proposals \u201cstaggering\u201d, \u201cextreme\u201d, and \u201cunprecedented government overreach\u201d. Walker can\u2019t have an easy job right now. The company plans to file its own proposals next month and appeal its original loss in court. Still, Walker\u2019s tone was, at times, almost comically histrionic: \u201cAs just one example, DoJ\u2019s proposal would literally require us to install not one but two separate choice screens before you could access Google search on a Pixel phone you bought.\u201d Not one, but <em>two separate choice screens??!!</em></p> <p>The justice department\u2019s says its goal is to increase competition. Its attorneys wrote in a court filing: \u201cA remedy for Google\u2019s unlawful monopolization must simultaneously (1) unfetter these markets from Google\u2019s exclusionary conduct; (2) pry them open to competition; (3) deny Google the fruits of its statutory violations; and (4) prevent Google from monopolizing these and related markets in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Google search is the cornerstone of the company\u2019s lucrative ad business; Chrome is the second stone. It is the most popular browser in the world, boasting a market share of almost two-thirds of people using the internet. It is an absolute vacuum of browsing data and a key gateway to Google search and therefore ads shown via Google search. Its ads business precedes everything else the company does in profit and importance, ergo Chrome is the second-most vital part of Google. The ads business suffers a dire blow without Chrome, and Google shrinks. That is the justice department\u2019s goal. Google argues that divestiture would hurt US leadership in the tech industry; the justice department argues Google\u2019s monopolistic conduct hurts US leadership in the tech industry.</p> <p>Google may also be forced to sell off Android, the most popular smartphone operating system. Android is likewise a conduit for data used to sell ads. The sale of Android would also be an enormous hit to Google\u2019s business. The more interesting outcome in regard to Android would be the submission of the operating system to government oversight. What design decisions would a government committee make? It\u2019d be fascinating to see the aesthetic qualities of a government-administered smartphone operating system. <em>Two </em>separate choice screens? Sweet suffering Jesus!</p> <p>Without Chrome, Google would also lose the extremely valuable youth market. The tech giant\u2019s Chromebooks are a low-cost item for schools that distribute laptops to students. Those laptops use Chrome OS, an operating system designed for web browsing and web-based tasks. Children introduced to one company\u2019s products become accustomed to using them, and may seek out that company\u2019s products as an adult. Apple has stated that training school-age users on its products can nurture a major pipeline of new customers.</p> <p>Defaults are powerful, whether they appear as devices in schools or the search engine that appears in your browser\u2019s address bar. Even if Google succeeds in appealing the forced divestment of Chrome, it seems likely that the company will be compelled to end its at-least-$20bn deal with Apple to maintain its search engine as the default in the Safari browser. Google\u2019s only concession, it seems from Walker\u2019s blog post, is to say it would be fine with changes, perhaps even complete cancellations, to those agreements. Walker writes that the justice department could have proposed remedies related to \u201csearch distribution agreements\u201d \u2013 Google\u2019s contracts with Firefox and the like. If even Google\u2019s chief legal officer is saying that he would have preferred changes to those agreements, it is reasonable to infer that he would have accepted those changes. The browser agreements are not long for this world. You, the product\u2019s user, may find yourself tasked with choosing a default search engine for your iPhone\u2019s browser. I would recommend trying something other than Google, perhaps the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo, just for fun. You can always switch back. Google will still be there, waiting for you.</p> <h2>Reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/08/the-best-apple-iphones-in-2024-tested-reviewed-and-ranked\">The best iPhones in 2024: Apple smartphones tested, reviewed and ranked</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/21/apple-watch-series-10-review-thinner-lighter-and-basically-the-same\">Apple Watch Series 10: thinner, lighter and basically the same | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Elon \u2018First Buddy\u2019 Musk and his sidekick debut, Doge</h2>    <p>Several weeks ago, \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d Elon Musk and failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were formally appointed as the heads of the new Department of Government Efficiency. Doge, as Musk insists the department be called, is not part of the US government, but he has given it a gray checkmark on Twitter/X, denoting that it is a \u201cgovernment or multilateral organization account\u201d. Musk and Ramaswamy are, in effect, advisers to Trump. The House oversight committee is creating a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/comer-create-doge-subcommittee-chaired-marjorie-taylor-greene-work-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy\">subcommittee</a> to work with them. It is mildly funny that a bureau dedicated to paring down bureaucracy requires two heads (and an assist of Marjorie Taylor Greene in the House).</p> <p>In an essay in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020?mod=opinion_trendingnow_article_pos1\">the Wall Street Journal</a>, they lay out their vision for the nongovernmental government agency. They plan to work mostly by executive action, by Trump decree, forecasting that the conservative supreme court will agree with his moves. They talk vaguely of efficiencies at a high level \u2013 abstracted from specifics as much as possible. For instance: \u201cA drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\u201d These are big words for: \u201cWe are going to roll back laws so we can conduct big layoffs. That will lower the government\u2019s costs and increase how much each individual employee works.\u201d</p> <p>In the same style as Trump, they enumerate their enemies in the form of a cost-cutting list: the media, international cooperation (America first, after all), and liberals. They cite \u201c$535 million a year to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; $1.5billion for grants to international organizations to nearly $300 million to progressive groups like Planned Parenthood\u201d as examples of what they would cut. In the same breath, they say firing huge swathes of federal employees will not be political retaliation but instead will constitute only apolitical \u201creductions in force\u201d. They also promise to require all employees to be in the office five days per week.</p> <p>Musk has tried his damnedest to make Doge seem cutting-edge, but nothing, absolutely nothing, is less punk or sexy than federal spending policy.</p> <p>He\u2019ll need his gift for galvanizing if he\u2019s to pull of Doge\u2019s multibillion-dollar goals. The previous week, the world\u2019s richest man asked for applications from \u201chigh-IQ revolutionaries\u201d to his new endeavor. The perks? Long hours, \u201ctedious work\u201d (Elon\u2019s own words) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/14/elon-musk-trump\">no pay</a>.</p> <p>Musk and his sidekick\u2019s understanding of government appears limited in their public statements, which is perhaps the point of their appointments but is also an obvious hindrance. He and Ramaswamy would like to cut all government programs that no longer have active congressional authorization. This idea makes basic logical sense. Yet, as one observer on X pointed out, such an action would ax healthcare for all US military veterans. The authorization for the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Act expired in 1998. Doing so would undoubtedly be an enormous political mistake and highly unlikely to get approved, even if it did save taxpayers some $120bn.</p> <p>Musk has been named Trump\u2019s \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering what his approach to cost-cutting has been in the past, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/16/technology/elon-musk-cost-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.aU4.sDi0.mkotHNeLM34g&amp;smid=url-share\">the New York Times</a> has compiled a list of expenses he\u2019s slashed at his menagerie of companies. Short version: His tactics worked well at SpaceX, less so at Tesla. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket costs $550m, whereas Nasa has projected the same spacecraft would cost the agency $4bn to build. At Tesla, Musk refused to use more expensive radar sensors for his cars\u2019 full self-driving mode, opting instead for cameras. The US is now investigating the autonomous driving software\u2019s role in a slew of fatal crashes.</p> <h2>Opt out: how to stop tech companies spying on your phone</h2>    <p>***<br><strong>Use encrypted messaging apps</strong></p> <p><em>Examples: Signal, Apple iMessage, WhatsA</em><em>pp, </em><em>Google Messages</em><em>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Apple iMessage</strong>: This is also end-to-end encrypted when you\u2019re talking to other people with iPhones and if you have advanced data protection turned on.

Walker can\u2019t have an easy job right now. The company plans to file its own proposals next month and appeal its original loss in court. Still, Walker\u2019s tone was, at times, almost comically histrionic: \u201cAs just one example, DoJ\u2019s proposal would literally require us to install not one but two separate choice screens before you could access Google search on a Pixel phone you bought.\u201d Not one, but two separate choice screens??!! The justice department\u2019s says its goal is to increase competition. Its attorneys wrote in a court filing: \u201cA remedy for Google\u2019s unlawful monopolization must simultaneously (1) unfetter these markets from Google\u2019s exclusionary conduct; (2) pry them open to competition; (3) deny Google the fruits of its statutory violations; and (4) prevent Google from monopolizing these and related markets in the future.\u201d Google search is the cornerstone of the company\u2019s lucrative ad business; Chrome is the second stone. It is the most popular browser in the world, boasting a market share of almost two-thirds of people using the internet. It is an absolute vacuum of browsing data and a key gateway to Google search and therefore ads shown via Google search. Its ads business precedes everything else the company does in profit and importance, ergo Chrome is the second-most vital part of Google. The ads business suffers a dire blow without Chrome, and Google shrinks. That is the justice department\u2019s goal. Google argues that divestiture would hurt US leadership in the tech industry; the justice department argues Google\u2019s monopolistic conduct hurts US leadership in the tech industry. Google may also be forced to sell off Android, the most popular smartphone operating system. Android is likewise a conduit for data used to sell ads. The sale of Android would also be an enormous hit to Google\u2019s business. The more interesting outcome in regard to Android would be the submission of the operating system to government oversight. What design decisions would a government committee make? It\u2019d be fascinating to see the aesthetic qualities of a government-administered smartphone operating system. Two separate choice screens? Sweet suffering Jesus! Without Chrome, Google would also lose the extremely valuable youth market. The tech giant\u2019s Chromebooks are a low-cost item for schools that distribute laptops to students. Those laptops use Chrome OS, an operating system designed for web browsing and web-based tasks. Children introduced to one company\u2019s products become accustomed to using them, and may seek out that company\u2019s products as an adult. Apple has stated that training school-age users on its products can nurture a major pipeline of new customers. Defaults are powerful, whether they appear as devices in schools or the search engine that appears in your browser\u2019s address bar. Even if Google succeeds in appealing the forced divestment of Chrome, it seems likely that the company will be compelled to end its at-least-$20bn deal with Apple to maintain its search engine as the default in the Safari browser. Google\u2019s only concession, it seems from Walker\u2019s blog post, is to say it would be fine with changes, perhaps even complete cancellations, to those agreements. Walker writes that the justice department could have proposed remedies related to \u201csearch distribution agreements\u201d \u2013 Google\u2019s contracts with Firefox and the like. If even Google\u2019s chief legal officer is saying that he would have preferred changes to those agreements, it is reasonable to infer that he would have accepted those changes. The browser agreements are not long for this world. You, the product\u2019s user, may find yourself tasked with choosing a default search engine for your iPhone\u2019s browser. I would recommend trying something other than Google, perhaps the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo, just for fun. You can always switch back. Google will still be there, waiting for you. Reviews The best iPhones in 2024: Apple smartphones tested, reviewed and ranked Apple Watch Series 10: thinner, lighter and basically the same | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Elon \u2018First Buddy\u2019 Musk and his sidekick debut, Doge Several weeks ago, \u201cFirst Buddy\u201d Elon Musk and failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy were formally appointed as the heads of the new Department of Government Efficiency. Doge, as Musk insists the department be called, is not part of the US government, but he has given it a gray checkmark on Twitter/X, denoting that it is a \u201cgovernment or multilateral organization account\u201d. Musk and Ramaswamy are, in effect, advisers to Trump. The House oversight committee is creating a subcommittee to work with them. It is mildly funny that a bureau dedicated to paring down bureaucracy requires two heads (and an assist of Marjorie Taylor Greene in the House). In an essay in the Wall Street Journal, they lay out their vision for the nongovernmental government agency. They plan to work mostly by executive action, by Trump decree, forecasting that the conservative supreme court will agree with his moves. They talk vaguely of efficiencies at a high level \u2013 abstracted from specifics as much as possible. For instance: \u201cA drastic reduction in federal regulations provides sound industrial logic for mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\u201d These are big words for: \u201cWe are going to roll back laws so we can conduct big layoffs. That will lower the government\u2019s costs and increase how much each individual employee works.\u201d In the same style as Trump, they enumerate their enemies in the form of a cost-cutting list: the media, international cooperation (America first, after all), and liberals. They cite \u201c$535 million a year to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; $1.5billion for grants to international organizations to nearly $300 million to progressive groups like Planned Parenthood\u201d as examples of what they would cut. In the same breath, they say firing huge swathes of federal employees will not be political retaliation but instead will constitute only apolitical \u201creductions in force\u201d. They also promise to require all employees to be in the office five days per week. Musk has tried his damnedest to make Doge seem cutting-edge, but nothing, absolutely nothing, is less punk or sexy than federal spending policy. He\u2019ll need his gift for galvanizing if he\u2019s to pull of Doge\u2019s multibillion-dollar goals. The previous week, the world\u2019s richest man asked for applications from \u201chigh-IQ revolutionaries\u201d to his new endeavor. The perks? Long hours, \u201ctedious work\u201d (Elon\u2019s own words) and no pay. Musk and his sidekick\u2019s understanding of government appears limited in their public statements, which is perhaps the point of their appointments but is also an obvious hindrance. He and Ramaswamy would like to cut all government programs that no longer have active congressional authorization. This idea makes basic logical sense. Yet, as one observer on X pointed out, such an action would ax healthcare for all US military veterans. The authorization for the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Act expired in 1998. Doing so would undoubtedly be an enormous political mistake and highly unlikely to get approved, even if it did save taxpayers some $120bn. Musk has been named Trump\u2019s \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d. If you\u2019re wondering what his approach to cost-cutting has been in the past, the New York Times has compiled a list of expenses he\u2019s slashed at his menagerie of companies. Short version: His tactics worked well at SpaceX, less so at Tesla. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket costs $550m, whereas Nasa has projected the same spacecraft would cost the agency $4bn to build. At Tesla, Musk refused to use more expensive radar sensors for his cars\u2019 full self-driving mode, opting instead for cameras. The US is now investigating the autonomous driving software\u2019s role in a slew of fatal crashes.

      "bodyText": "British consumers face paying more for car repairs and new kitchen kit after retailers Halfords and AO.com warned on Tuesday that the autumn budget had increased their costs. Halfords, the cycling and motoring retailer, which has more than 12,000 employees, reported that the budget measures would add \u00a323m of direct labour costs, of which \u00a39m was already included in its planning assumptions. Meanwhile, John Roberts, the chief executive of the online electrical goods specialist AO World, said his direct labour costs would rise by \u00a34m because of changes to national insurance contributions and the minimum wage, and there would be a further \u00a34m from indirect labour costs such as payments to self-employed delivery drivers and agency workers. \u201cI\u2019m no economist, I\u2019m a washer flogger from Bolton, but if you dramatically increase all the costs then prices will go up, as night follows day. They have to,\u201d Roberts said. He said he was concerned as \u201cinflation hurts the people that can afford it the least the most.\u201d Graham Stapleton, the chief executive of Halfords, said: \u201cThe cost implications from the recent UK budget are particularly acute for a specialist retailer that provides expert advice and assistance to customers, face to face.\u201d He urged the government to consider other ways of supporting businesses, including the acceleration of apprenticeship levy reform, which would help the company to upskill existing staff and offset some of the cost rises. Halfords said it would find it easier to pass on increased costs to customers in its \u201cmore needs-based Autocentres servicing business, where pricing power is greater\u201d, although it was also considering other ways to keep costs down. The effect of the budget on consumer behaviour was unclear, the company said. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, defended her \u00a340bn of tax rises at the CBI business group\u2019s annual conference on Monday, saying there were \u201cno alternatives\u201d. Businesses bore the brunt of the measures, with increases to employer national insurance contributions and a rise in the national minimum wage from April. Halfords reported revenues of \u00a3864.8m for the six months to 27 September, down 0.1% at outlets open at least a year. It made a profit before tax of \u00a317.8m, down 23% from a year earlier. Sentiment among retailers about their business situation over the next three months has fallen at the fastest pace for two years this month, according to the CBI\u2019s latest quarterly Distributive Trades Survey. The poll found that retail sales volumes have fallen \u201cmoderately\u201d in the year to November, with retailers judging sales to be \u201cpoor\u201d for the time of year. \u201cRetailers continue to report disappointing sales, though trading conditions have shown some improvement since the middle of the year. Yet the last time retailers felt this gloomy was back in November 2022, at the peak of the inflation shock. This makes the sharp decline in sentiment this month all the more telling,\u201d said Ben Jones, the lead economist at the CBI. \u201cThe stark rise in employers\u2019 national Insurance next year will hit retailers hard. And the planned increase in business rates for higher-value properties will add significant operational costs for distribution centres,\u201d Jones added.",

Nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford.</p> <p>The Harris poll raises questions about the popularity of one of Trump\u2019s key economic policy platforms.

Trump said in October, when talking about tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring the companies back. We\u2019re going to lower taxes for companies that are going to make their products in the USA and we\u2019re going to protect those companies with strong tariffs.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, who played a key role in Trump\u2019s campaign, will be the cabinet member carrying out Trump\u2019s tariff plans as commerce secretary. While Lutnick has been supportive of Trump\u2019s tariff talk on the campaign trail, he told CNBC in October that tariffs should not be put on goods that the United States does not already produce.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re running for office, you make broad statements so people understand you. Tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use,\u201d Lutnick <a href=\"https://x.com/CollinRugg/status/1846319557025452533\">said</a> at the time.</p> <p>Economists largely disagree with Trump\u2019s argument that tariffs will mean a significant uptick in domestic manufacturing. Companies will likely simply pass increased costs onto customers.</p> <p>Americans seem to think so too. Over three-quarters (76%) of those polled said they believe companies will pass along the price of tariffs to consumers. Tariffs could cost American households an additional <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2024/trumps-bigger-tariff-proposals-would-cost-typical-american-household-over\">$2,600 a year</a>, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p> <p>Multiple executives have already said tariffs will mean higher prices. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, John David Rainey, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/walmart-says-new-trump-tariffs-could-raise-prices.html\">said</a> \u201cthere probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers\u201d with tariffs. Lowe\u2019s CFO, Brandon Sink, has said that tariffs \u201ccertainly would add product costs\u201d.</p> <p>Price increases from tariffs would affect American households already battered from the decades-high inflation that was seen in 2022.

      "bodyText": "Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. Trump declared on Monday evening that he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on China, if they did not stop what he claimed was illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling. But although he has called tariffs the most \u201cbeautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, about 69% of Americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices, according to the poll. The majority of Democrats (79%), independents (68%) and Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US. Nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford. The Harris poll raises questions about the popularity of one of Trump\u2019s key economic policy platforms. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump called for a broad 20% tariff on all foreign imports and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. \u201cYou see these empty, old, beautiful steel mills and factories that are empty and falling down. Trump said in October, when talking about tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring the companies back. We\u2019re going to lower taxes for companies that are going to make their products in the USA and we\u2019re going to protect those companies with strong tariffs.\u201d Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, who played a key role in Trump\u2019s campaign, will be the cabinet member carrying out Trump\u2019s tariff plans as commerce secretary. While Lutnick has been supportive of Trump\u2019s tariff talk on the campaign trail, he told CNBC in October that tariffs should not be put on goods that the United States does not already produce. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running for office, you make broad statements so people understand you. Tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use,\u201d Lutnick said at the time. Economists largely disagree with Trump\u2019s argument that tariffs will mean a significant uptick in domestic manufacturing. Companies will likely simply pass increased costs onto customers. Americans seem to think so too. Over three-quarters (76%) of those polled said they believe companies will pass along the price of tariffs to consumers. Tariffs could cost American households an additional $2,600 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Multiple executives have already said tariffs will mean higher prices. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said \u201cthere probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers\u201d with tariffs. Lowe\u2019s CFO, Brandon Sink, has said that tariffs \u201ccertainly would add product costs\u201d. Price increases from tariffs would affect American households already battered from the decades-high inflation that was seen in 2022. Though the rate of inflation has gone down significantly, prices remain high. Only 35% of Americans in the poll said they feel comfortable with their earnings and savings. \u201cTariffs look great at a campaign rally, but not in the grocery store or in the dealer showroom,\u201d said John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll. \u201cPassing tariffs along in the form of higher prices will be highly unpopular and likely to dampen consumption.\u201d Nearly half of Americans (44%) told Harris that they are planning purchases ahead of Trump entering office, in case he ends up implementing tariffs, and two-thirds (62%) said they feel they have to adjust their 2025 financial plans for potential tariffs.

This means cattle graze selectively, picking out the green shoots and quickly degrading the pasture. Such setups can require numerous hectares for every animal.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this has been deforested \u2013 and look how few cattle there are,\u201d says Justiniano. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of crime against nature.\u201d</p> <p>In this type of management, land produces less pasture within five years and degrades<strong> </strong>within 10, says Justiniano.

Boorsma says the goal of the new alliance is to increase that to 100,000 hectares in the next two years, which is a start \u2013 but there is still a long way to go in Bolivia, where ranching takes up 10m hectares.</p> <p>Rol\u00f3n Roth says this reflects a lack of institutions to spread agricultural best practices. Bolivia has no equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.embrapa.br/en/international\">Embrapa</a> in Brazil or <a href=\"https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta/quehacemos\">INTA</a> in Argentina. </p>    <p>Justiniano and Boorsma suggest that if more ranchers were aware of the benefits of regenerative practices, they would adopt them. \u201cWe are trying to do what the government does not,\u201d Justiniano says, criticising the state\u2019s failure to advocate for best practices.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jica.go.jp/Resource/bolivia/espanol/office/others/c8h0vm0000f8w9ww-att/publication_03.pdf\">A study by the Santa Cruz chamber of exporters</a> found that 58% of small producers reported using best practices, as did 70% of big producers.

Boorsma says the goal of the new alliance is to increase that to 100,000 hectares in the next two years, which is a start \u2013 but there is still a long way to go in Bolivia, where ranching takes up 10m hectares. Rol\u00f3n Roth says this reflects a lack of institutions to spread agricultural best practices. Bolivia has no equivalent of Embrapa in Brazil or INTA in Argentina. Justiniano and Boorsma suggest that if more ranchers were aware of the benefits of regenerative practices, they would adopt them. \u201cWe are trying to do what the government does not,\u201d Justiniano says, criticising the state\u2019s failure to advocate for best practices. A study by the Santa Cruz chamber of exporters found that 58% of small producers reported using best practices, as did 70% of big producers. However, only 35% thought they were key to profitability. Another study in the Chiquitan\u00eda estimated that only 20% of local ranching combined industry best practices with the resources to implement them, intensifying ranching rather than expanding. In a country where forest land is cheap and abundant, deforesting boosts its value, so ranching is used as an affordable way to occupy the land, with little regard for optimal management. Organisations such as the Conservation Strategy Fund, Foundation for the Conservation of the Chiquitano Forest and Consorcio Regional de Experimentaci\u00f3n Agropecuaria, have promoted structural changes that disincentivise the conversion of forest to farmland in Bolivia, cutting off the supply of cheap land. \u201cCheap land keeps the model going,\u201d he says. \u201cMany people think there is still lots of forest in Bolivia, that we can keep doing it this way for another 20 or 30 years \u2013 but there isn\u2019t.\u201d",

Rivers suffer from water company sewage pollution and agricultural pollution, and the results show river water quality is distinctly worse than that of coastal bathing sites. The results come after sewage pollution into rivers by water companies reached record levels last year. This year, 16 river areas were designated as bathing water sites out 27 new areas, which meant they were tested for harmful bacteria, E coli and intestinal enterococci.

The Wharfe was the first river to be given bathing water status four years ago and despite years of action from campaigners, water quality is still poor. Becky Malby of the campaign group Ilkley Clean River said there was now hope that the water quality would improve at the location. \u201cIlkley is on the cusp of securing an improved water system that will ensure our river is fit for people and wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year Yorkshire Water put in a huge new sewer to divert sewage from the bathing site to the sewage works.

Wolvercote Mill Stream in Oxford, which was designated as a bathing water site in April 2022, has been classified as poor overall as it had high levels of E coli and intestinal enterococci. Wallingford Beach on the Thames was newly designated this year and also received a poor rating due to spikes of bacteria in two of the 19 water samples taken. The charity Thames21 is calling for more urgent action. Claire Robertson, the Oxford rivers project officer for the charity, said: \u201cWe want to see much clearer targets and plans from the Environment Agency as to how they are going to improve the water quality at Wolvercote and Wallingford, and in the Thames in general.\u201d If sites are consistently given poor ratings for five years, they are dedesignated \u2013 a rule that removes the incentive for water companies to clean up the water, Robertson said.

Despite the surveillance cameras in the area, no one has ever been held accountable for destroying the tribute to victims of one of Brazil\u2019s most horrific cases of police violence. \u201cThey destroyed them because the authorities and people in Rio believe that the massacre was necessary to \u2018clean\u2019 society of the undesirables,\u201d she said. At about 11pm on 23 July 1993, eight young people aged between 11 and 19 who were sleeping on the pavement outside the church were killed by three police officers and a former officer in what became known as the Candel\u00e1ria massacre.

Rio\u2019s police have gained notoriety as one of the most violent forces in the world, responsible for killing thousands of young Brazilians over recent years \u2013 of whom the vast majority have been Black. The anthropologist and former national security chief Luiz Eduardo Soares says that Rio\u2019s current military police force has inherited \u201ca 200-year tradition of behaviour and values stemming from its origins in hunting down enslaved people and protecting the elites\u201d. Despite the outcry triggered by the Candel\u00e1ria massacre Soares believes there has been no change in the mindset, structure, or training of the police to prevent something similar from happening again. And massacres by law enforcement agents have never stopped occurring in Rio. Just over a month after Candel\u00e1ria, police killed 21 people in Vig\u00e1rio Geral, in Rio\u2019s North Zone.

He initiated improvements in areas such as equal opportunities, environmental protection and recycling, and led the establishment of local community councils with control over their own budgets. Dave\u2019s experience in transport led him to become a director, from 1989 to 1994, of the charity Dial-A-Ride, a pan-London body now known as Transport for All. He was also a vice-chair of Transport for London (2000-08) and chair of London Buses (2000-01). An advocate of land value taxation, he was founder in 1983 of the Labour Land Campaign, of which he was also president until 2015. Dave stepped down as a Hounslow councillor in 1994 and 10 years later, disillusioned with the Labour party, switched his allegiance to the Green party. Work wise, after a period of unemployment he became a minicab driver and later a shopkeeper before retiring. He is survived by his wife, Heather (nee Allman), a fellow Hounslow councillor whom he married in 1973, their daughters Emma and Chantel, and four grandchildren, Moi Lanne, Bethany, Megan and Pao.",

A genuine, collaborative, inclusive and successful labour law reform in Saudi Arabia will be akin to driving \u2018water from the hill to the valley\u2019.\u201d Fifa is due to confirm the host of the 2034 World Cup on 11 December at a virtual congress of its 211 member nations. Saudi Arabia will be the only name on the ballot but a growing number of voices have called on Fifa to think again before taking a vote. This week two US senators wrote to Infantino pleading with him to \u201cseek out a host country with a record of upholding human rights\u201d. That intervention followed a report from senior lawyers, including former Fifa governance experts, warning of the human rights risks of taking the tournament to Saudi, and there have been further complaints from NGOs and trade unions in Europe. Now the expressions of concern have extended to Africa. Fifa and the Saudi ministry of human resources and social development have been approached for comment.",

A failure of this magnitude demands soul-searching and brutal re-assessment of prior assumptions and strategies. The work of defending and ultimately taking back the country starts now, and a sober assessment of the election results makes clear that 2024 marks the requiem for the widely held but thinly supported view that it makes more sense to invest in persuasion over the power-building program of getting out the vote.

So, as a practical matter, is anything stopping Trump? Yes, and here\u2019s a hint of what it is: on Friday, Trump picked Scott Bessent to serve as US secretary of the treasury. Bessent is the man Elon Musk derided only a week ago as the \u201cbusiness-as-usual choice\u201d for treasury secretary, in contrast to Howard Lutnick, whom Musk said would \u201cactually enact change\u201d. Musk\u2019s view of \u201cchange\u201d is to blow a place up, which was what Musk did when he bought Twitter. Over the last two weeks, Musk has convinced Trump to appoint bomb-throwers Robert F Kennedy Jr to health and human services and Pete Hegseth to defense and to put Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of cutting $2tn from the federal budget. But Bessent is the opposite of a bomb-thrower. He\u2019s a billionaire hedge fund manager, founder of the investment firm Key Square Capital Management, and a protege of the Maga arch-villain George Soros. (He\u2019s also gay, which the Maga base may not like, either.) Why did Trump appoint the \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d Bessent to be treasury secretary? Because the treasury secretary is the most important economic job in the US government. Trump has never understood much about economics, but he knows two things: that high interest rates can throttle an economy (and bring down a president\u2019s party) and that high stock prices are good (at least for Trump and his investor class). Trump doesn\u2019t want to do anything that will cause bond traders to raise long-term interest rates out of fear of future inflation and he wants stock traders to be so optimistic about corporate profits they raise share prices. So he has appointed a treasury secretary who will reassure the bond and stock markets. Stock and bond markets constitute the only real constraint on Trump \u2013 the only things whose power he\u2019s afraid of. But wait. What about Trump\u2019s plan to raise tariffs? He has floated a blanket tariff of 10% to 20% on nearly all imports, 25% on imports from Mexico, and 60% or more on Chinese goods. Tariffs of this size would increase consumer prices and fuel inflation \u2013 driving interest rates upward. (The cost of tariffs are borne by American businesses and households, rather than foreign companies.) Tariffs could also invite retaliation from foreign governments and thereby dry up export markets for American-based corporations \u2013 in which case the stock market would tank. (The last time America raised tariffs on all imports \u2013 Herbert Hoover\u2019s and congressmen Smoot and Hawley\u2019s Tariff Act of 1930 \u2013 the Great Depression worsened.) In short, tariffs will rattle stock and bond markets, doing the exact opposite of what Trump wants. So Trump has appointed a treasury secretary who will soothe Wall Street\u2019s nerves \u2013 not just because Bessent is a Wall Street billionaire who speaks its language but also because Wall Street doesn\u2019t really believe Bessent wants higher tariffs. Bessent has described Trump\u2019s plan for blanket tariffs as a \u201cmaximalist\u201d negotiating strategy \u2013 suggesting Trump\u2019s whole tariff proposal is a strategic bluff. Wall Street apparently thinks tariffs won\u2019t rise much when other countries respond to the bluff with what Trump sees as concessions. Instead, Wall Street expects Bessent to be spending his energies seeking lower taxes, especially for big corporations and wealthy Americans, and helping Musk and Ramaswamy cut spending and roll back regulations. It\u2019s a sad commentary on the state of American democracy when the main constraint on the madman soon to occupy the Oval Office is Wall Street.

      "body": "<p>The international criminal court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges\">issuance</a> of arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, and former defense minister Yoav Gallant is an important step toward justice for the Palestinian people, who too often have known only injustice. The court allows charges to move forward for war crimes and crimes against humanity focused mainly on the Israeli strategy of starving the civilians of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> and depriving them of medical and other necessities. The arrest warrants will make the world much smaller for these senior Israeli officials.</p> <p>The Israeli government had advanced two principal arguments in the hope of avoiding the warrants, both of which the court rejected. First, Israel contended in essence that Palestine was not enough of a state to join the court and confer jurisdiction for crimes committed on its territory. The court reaffirmed a prior ruling finding that Palestine\u2019s status as a non-member observer state of the United Nations general assembly enabled it to ratify treaties such as the ICC\u2019s Rome statute.</p> <p>The Israeli government also invoked what is known as the \u201cprinciple of complementarity\u201d, the rule that the court must defer to good-faith national efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes. But the court rightly noted that there is no such Israeli effort \u2013 no announced investigation into the starvation and deprivation strategy, no formal request to the prosecutor to defer his case for this (non-existent) national effort.</p> <p>The Israeli government responded to the court\u2019s ruling with the usual <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/herzog-pans-icc-decision-as-a-dark-day-for-justice-and-humanity/\">diversionary vitriol</a>. It ran through a litany of excuses \u2013 the need to liberate the hostages held by Hamas, Hamas\u2019s use of human shields, Israel\u2019s democracy, Israel\u2019s right of self-defense, the ICC\u2019s supposed bias and <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/11/21/the-arrest-warrant-for-netanyahu-will-have-big-consequences\">antisemitism</a> \u2013 all utter irrelevancies.</p> <p>Such beside-the-point \u201cdefenses\u201d would be laughed out of court were Netanyahu or Gallant ever to stand trial. The charges they face are not about whether Israel should be fighting Hamas but <em>how</em> it is waging that war. Nothing justifies pursuing a war-crime strategy.</p> <p>If Netanyahu or Gallant think they have a serious defense, they should voluntarily show up in The Hague and assert their intention to mount it. That is not so far-fetched. It is what the Kenyan president <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29530638\">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> did. In light of his voluntary appearance, the court never imprisoned him but allowed him to continue serving as president while he contested the charges.</p> <p>But Netanyahu and Gallant have no defense. The obstruction of humanitarian aid to Gaza has been <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/07/18/crimes-of-war-in-gaza-kenneth-roth/\">widely documented</a> and is readily apparent in the suffering of the Palestinian civilians of Gaza. Suddenly, 124 nations of the world \u2013 the countries that have joined the court \u2013 are off limits if these Israeli officials want to avoid arrest. Even Germany, a reflexive defender of the Israeli government because of its Nazi past but also a strong upholder of the rule of law and a central <a href=\"https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/politics/international-criminal-court-and-germany#:~:text=What%20role%20does%20Germany%20play,behalf%20of%20the%20German%20government.\">architect</a> of the court, will be obliged to signal that these accused war criminals are unwelcome.</p> <p>Israeli generals must now think twice about proceeding with the bombing and starving of Palestinian civilians. These charges are clearly only a first round. Karim Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor, probably chose to await the court\u2019s ruling on the Israeli challenges before issuing additional charges. Khan has already <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-war/article/icc-prosecutor-uk-didnt-blitz-the-ira-israel-needs-that-restraint-0sxjbvl2g\">signaled</a> that his next target may be Israel\u2019s repeated dropping of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/100000009208814/israel-gaza-bomb-civilians.html\">massive 2,000-pound bombs</a> in heavily populated Gaza \u2013 clearly <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/07/18/crimes-of-war-in-gaza-kenneth-roth/\">indiscriminate and disproportionate</a> attacks.</p> <p>For Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine, Khan has already begun to work his way down the chain of command, from <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and\">Putin</a> to <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-sergei-kuzhugetovich-shoigu-and\">four Russian commanders</a>, for the crime of attacking <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-sergei-ivanovich-kobylash-and\">electrical infrastructure</a>. If Israeli generals don\u2019t want to be added to the court\u2019s docket, they had better start resisting illegal orders from the top.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The answer to the ICC charges should not be to attack the court but to end the conduct that has forced it to act</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The arrest warrants are also a reminder to governments that continue to arm the Israeli military as it commits war crimes in Gaza. The former Liberian president Charles Taylor is serving <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/charles-taylor-sentenced-to-50-years-for-war-crimes/\">a 50-year</a> sentence in a British prison for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/26/world/africa/netherlands-taylor-sentencing/index.html\">aiding and abetting</a> war crimes by providing arms to an abusive rebel force in Sierra Leone. Do British, German or American officials want to face similar charges?</p> <p>Those charges could already have been issued, but I suspect that Khan has proceeded with political prudence, not wishing to take on senior western leaders when there is so much else on his plate. But it is not difficult to imagine one scenario that might lift that self-restraint.</p> <p>Donald Trump during his first term outrageously <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/14/us-sanctions-international-criminal-court\">imposed sanctions</a> on the prior ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies for merely opening an investigation in Palestine that might lead to charges against Israeli officials as well as one in Afghanistan that might have implicated the George W Bush-era torturers there. The Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/ending-sanctions-and-visa-restrictions-against-personnel-of-the-international-criminal-court/\">lifted</a> those sanctions.</p> <p>Already the new US Senate majority leader, John Thune, has threatened to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/thune-threatens-international-criminal-court-sanctions-doesnt-drop-netanyahu-warrant-arrest\">revive</a> similar sanctions. If Trump again succumbs to such an effort to manipulate an independent institution of justice, I would not anticipate restraint on the part of Khan.</p> <p>Trump might pretend to slough off accusations of aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes in Gaza, but he does not have the power to pardon ICC charges. Suddenly he would face the same travel restraints as Netanyahu and Gallant \u2013 not so much that the handcuffs would be placed on him as he landed in Brussels, S\u00e3o Paulo, Johannesburg or Tokyo, but that he would be quietly told not to come.</p> <p>It is time to move beyond the reflexive attacks on the ICC by Israel\u2019s defenders and to re-examine what is really at stake. As Khan has <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-kc-issuance-arrest-warrants-situation-state-palestine\">noted</a>, we should be thinking foremost of the victims. The answer to the ICC charges should not be to attack the court but to end the conduct that has forced it to act. That is the best response for Palestinian civilians and for people worldwide \u2013 in Sudan, Myanmar, Ukraine and a host of other countries where abusive commanders have taken heart from America\u2019s inexcusable defense of Israeli war crimes in Gaza.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://x.com/KenRoth\">Kenneth Roth</a>, executive director of Human Rights Watch from 1993 to 2022, is a visiting professor at Princeton\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs</p></li> </ul>",

The Israeli government also invoked what is known as the \u201cprinciple of complementarity\u201d, the rule that the court must defer to good-faith national efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes. But the court rightly noted that there is no such Israeli effort \u2013 no announced investigation into the starvation and deprivation strategy, no formal request to the prosecutor to defer his case for this (non-existent) national effort. The Israeli government responded to the court\u2019s ruling with the usual diversionary vitriol. It ran through a litany of excuses \u2013 the need to liberate the hostages held by Hamas, Hamas\u2019s use of human shields, Israel\u2019s democracy, Israel\u2019s right of self-defense, the ICC\u2019s supposed bias and antisemitism \u2013 all utter irrelevancies. Such beside-the-point \u201cdefenses\u201d would be laughed out of court were Netanyahu or Gallant ever to stand trial. The charges they face are not about whether Israel should be fighting Hamas but how it is waging that war. Nothing justifies pursuing a war-crime strategy. If Netanyahu or Gallant think they have a serious defense, they should voluntarily show up in The Hague and assert their intention to mount it. That is not so far-fetched. It is what the Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta did. In light of his voluntary appearance, the court never imprisoned him but allowed him to continue serving as president while he contested the charges. But Netanyahu and Gallant have no defense. The obstruction of humanitarian aid to Gaza has been widely documented and is readily apparent in the suffering of the Palestinian civilians of Gaza. Suddenly, 124 nations of the world \u2013 the countries that have joined the court \u2013 are off limits if these Israeli officials want to avoid arrest. Even Germany, a reflexive defender of the Israeli government because of its Nazi past but also a strong upholder of the rule of law and a central architect of the court, will be obliged to signal that these accused war criminals are unwelcome. Israeli generals must now think twice about proceeding with the bombing and starving of Palestinian civilians. These charges are clearly only a first round. Karim Khan, the ICC chief prosecutor, probably chose to await the court\u2019s ruling on the Israeli challenges before issuing additional charges. Khan has already signaled that his next target may be Israel\u2019s repeated dropping of massive 2,000-pound bombs in heavily populated Gaza \u2013 clearly indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. For Russia\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine, Khan has already begun to work his way down the chain of command, from Putin to four Russian commanders, for the crime of attacking electrical infrastructure. If Israeli generals don\u2019t want to be added to the court\u2019s docket, they had better start resisting illegal orders from the top. The arrest warrants are also a reminder to governments that continue to arm the Israeli military as it commits war crimes in Gaza. The former Liberian president Charles Taylor is serving a 50-year sentence in a British prison for aiding and abetting war crimes by providing arms to an abusive rebel force in Sierra Leone. Do British, German or American officials want to face similar charges? Those charges could already have been issued, but I suspect that Khan has proceeded with political prudence, not wishing to take on senior western leaders when there is so much else on his plate. But it is not difficult to imagine one scenario that might lift that self-restraint. Donald Trump during his first term outrageously imposed sanctions on the prior ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and one of her deputies for merely opening an investigation in Palestine that might lead to charges against Israeli officials as well as one in Afghanistan that might have implicated the George W Bush-era torturers there. The Biden administration lifted those sanctions. Already the new US Senate majority leader, John Thune, has threatened to revive similar sanctions. If Trump again succumbs to such an effort to manipulate an independent institution of justice, I would not anticipate restraint on the part of Khan. Trump might pretend to slough off accusations of aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes in Gaza, but he does not have the power to pardon ICC charges. Suddenly he would face the same travel restraints as Netanyahu and Gallant \u2013 not so much that the handcuffs would be placed on him as he landed in Brussels, S\u00e3o Paulo, Johannesburg or Tokyo, but that he would be quietly told not to come. It is time to move beyond the reflexive attacks on the ICC by Israel\u2019s defenders and to re-examine what is really at stake. As Khan has noted, we should be thinking foremost of the victims. The answer to the ICC charges should not be to attack the court but to end the conduct that has forced it to act. That is the best response for Palestinian civilians and for people worldwide \u2013 in Sudan, Myanmar, Ukraine and a host of other countries where abusive commanders have taken heart from America\u2019s inexcusable defense of Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

      "body": "<p>Amanda Jones\u2019s story is awful \u2013 and important. A school librarian for 23 years in her home town of Watson, southern Louisiana, she has watched with concern in recent years as a movement of book-banning swept across the US. According to the American Library Association, \u201cbook challenges\u201d in public libraries almost doubled from 729 in 2021 to 1,269 in 2022.</p> <p>In July 2022, when Jones heard about a public meeting that would discuss \u201cbook content\u201d in local libraries, she went along. A board member said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d about some \u201cinappropriate\u201d material in the local library\u2019s children and young adult sections. In response, Jones gave a measured speech, explaining her belief that \u201cwhile book challenges are often done with the best intentions, and in the name of age appropriateness, they often target marginalised communities\u201d and \u201cbooks on sexual health and reproduction\u201d. She went on to detail the \u201cFirst Amendment right to borrow, read, view, and listen to library resources\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI said nothing earth-shattering,\u201d Jones writes in her memoir. But within days her life had been upended because of two posts on social media.

      "bodyText": "Amanda Jones\u2019s story is awful \u2013 and important. A school librarian for 23 years in her home town of Watson, southern Louisiana, she has watched with concern in recent years as a movement of book-banning swept across the US. According to the American Library Association, \u201cbook challenges\u201d in public libraries almost doubled from 729 in 2021 to 1,269 in 2022. In July 2022, when Jones heard about a public meeting that would discuss \u201cbook content\u201d in local libraries, she went along. A board member said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d about some \u201cinappropriate\u201d material in the local library\u2019s children and young adult sections. In response, Jones gave a measured speech, explaining her belief that \u201cwhile book challenges are often done with the best intentions, and in the name of age appropriateness, they often target marginalised communities\u201d and \u201cbooks on sexual health and reproduction\u201d. She went on to detail the \u201cFirst Amendment right to borrow, read, view, and listen to library resources\u201d. \u201cI said nothing earth-shattering,\u201d Jones writes in her memoir. But within days her life had been upended because of two posts on social media. The first was by the Facebook page of Citizens for a New Louisiana, a far-right group whom Jones knew had worked to defund a library in nearby Lafayette and whose executive director was a man named Michael Lunsford. It accused Jones of \u201cfighting so hard to keep sexually erotic and pornographic materials in the kids\u2019 section\u201d. The second Facebook post was made by local man Ryan Thames, who wrote that Jones advocated \u201cteaching anal sex to 11-year-olds\u201d. The posts were shared widely by local people, including many Jones knew. \u201cOne parent in particular whose child I had helped with getting services for a learning disability was especially vicious,\u201d she writes, devastatingly. Later, she received a death threat. Over the course of the next year, Jones, who is in her mid-40s, lost a lot of weight, experienced hair loss and took medical leave from work.

The paediatric nurse from Carmarthenshire is proud to be Bake Off\u2019s first ever Welsh finalist. Georgie attributes her love of food to her days spent learning classical cookery from her nonna Rosa. She\u2019s a keen gardener, forager and obsessive crockery collector who whips up feasts in her enviable farmhouse kitchen for her husband and three children.

Little did Nick suspect that he\u2019d enter a few years later and go all the way. Christiaan\u2019s food combines his eye for modern design with his passion for gardening, resulting in floral scents, citrus notes and polished presentation. He works for a leading fashion brand, which shows in his breathtakingly stylish bakes.</p> <p><strong>Bake Off journey\u2122:</strong> Christiaan has become known as the tent\u2019s \u201cnearly man\u201d. He\u2019s been runner-up in the technical challenge on three occasions but never won. He\u2019d also never won star baker until last week\u2019s semi-final. This dark horse snuck up on the rails but has hit form at the right time. </p> <p><strong>Best moment:</strong> His Finding Home puppet theatre showstopper in biscuit week.

Anyway, never mind those \u2013 the best show is yet to come. There\u2019s only one performance but I\u2019ve managed to get tickets because I know one of the cast. In fact, I look forward to helping them rehearse their lines at home.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s almost festive show time in schools. Over the coming weeks, in classrooms around the country, antlers will be whittled from cardboard, paper headwear snipped out and glittered, scripts divvied up and learned. But next month\u2019s winter performance is bittersweet for me. This is my youngest daughter\u2019s final year at primary school. It will be the last time I perch on a much too small chair with all the other proud parents and carers for a show that, past experience has taught me, may well have funnier jokes and catchier songs than some of the 150-odd shows I see each year as the Guardian\u2019s Stage editor.</p> <p>You\u2019ll never find an audience more emotionally invested and just generally up for it. The shows are often watched by a multi-generational audience akin to panto. This is theatre at its livest: the cast are knackered at the end of the longest term yet many are buzzing for their big moment. It\u2019s not every school day that you get to make jokes about the head teacher. Lines are forgotten, jettisoned, improvised and nudged along by vigilant staff members. Each year I\u2019m in awe of how much work goes into it all, especially the script, considering teachers are so overburdened.</p> <p>Year six is when pupils take the national curriculum tests known as Sats \u2013 a source of considerable anxiety for many. I was heartened to read how education secretary Bridget Phillipson, in a speech about declining attendances and the \u201ctunnel vision\u201d of focusing on academic success, championed the need for pupils \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/nov/06/phillipson-to-ask-schools-to-end-exam-tunnel-vision-and-look-to-wellbeing\">to feel like they belong in school</a>\u201d. When a class puts on their festive show, the pride is all around \u2013 it is particularly affecting to see children themselves buoyant about their collective performance in front of families.</p>    <p>I remember the year that a Christmas concert was done in the playground not the school hall, due to Covid restrictions, and how the pandemic changed so many children\u2019s feelings towards the building that is a second home for them. The lockdowns led many children to start primary school with delayed communication skills and emotional difficulties. Drama and music can play a vital role in improving both \u2013 you see it from year to year in these school performances, as different children find their feet.</p> <p>After data was <a href=\"https://www.culturallearningalliance.org.uk/cla-report-card-published/\">released</a> showing an overall decline of 42% in the number of arts GCSE entries, I spoke to theatre leaders in June about the erosion and devaluation of the arts in state schools. The director Nicholas Hytner said that theatres themselves had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jun/14/absolute-outrage-arts-in-state-schools-must-be-a-priority-for-next-government-say-theatre-leaders\">filling the gap</a> left by \u201cthe disappearance of creative and performing arts education in state schools\u201d. There was an expansion in theatres\u2019 education and outreach work when Hytner ran the National Theatre from 2003 to 2015 and he expressed regret that the industry had not managed to secure direct funding from the Department for Education for it. Theatres are still slowly recovering from the impact of the pandemic; it has left their vital education work looking vulnerable.</p> <p>Earlier this month, dozens of figures from the theatre industry <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/your-views/national-theatres-tours-to-schools-must-not-be-cut-this-week-in-your-views\">wrote to the Stage</a> to express \u201cprofound concern\u201d at the 100% cut that has been made to the National Theatre\u2019s Primary Schools Touring theatre programme. Its signatories included writer and director Jude Christian, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/29/hamlet-review-an-emotional-rollercoaster-for-young-audiences-dorfman-national-theatre\">superb hour-long version of Hamlet</a> was performed in schools last year as part of the programme and watched by more than 7,700 young people. Cutting the programme, stated the letter, would be \u201cdeeply damaging to working-class communities, disappearing transformative experiences for young people in their formative years, who might be inspired to become artists themselves\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/nov/05/20-best-christmas-shows-in-the-uk\">Deck the stalls! 20 of the UK\u2019s best festive theatre shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kate Varah, co-chief executive of the National Theatre, responded by citing funding restraints and highlighting some of its other initiatives, such as digital learning, primary school trips to its Christmas show Ballet Shoes and a project \u201cto explore building creativity across the curriculum\u201d. But the only schools touring show highlighted by Varah\u2019s letter was a dystopian drama by the firecracker duo of playwright Ross Willis and director Ned Bennett.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s your favourite play of the year? I\u2019d probably go for Somebody Jones\u2019s How I Learned to Swim, though I was also bowled over by James Macdonald\u2019s revelatory revival of Waiting for Godot and had a soft spot for The Comeuppance by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. Anyway, never mind those \u2013 the best show is yet to come. There\u2019s only one performance but I\u2019ve managed to get tickets because I know one of the cast. In fact, I look forward to helping them rehearse their lines at home. Yes, it\u2019s almost festive show time in schools. Over the coming weeks, in classrooms around the country, antlers will be whittled from cardboard, paper headwear snipped out and glittered, scripts divvied up and learned. But next month\u2019s winter performance is bittersweet for me. This is my youngest daughter\u2019s final year at primary school. It will be the last time I perch on a much too small chair with all the other proud parents and carers for a show that, past experience has taught me, may well have funnier jokes and catchier songs than some of the 150-odd shows I see each year as the Guardian\u2019s Stage editor. You\u2019ll never find an audience more emotionally invested and just generally up for it. The shows are often watched by a multi-generational audience akin to panto. This is theatre at its livest: the cast are knackered at the end of the longest term yet many are buzzing for their big moment. It\u2019s not every school day that you get to make jokes about the head teacher. Lines are forgotten, jettisoned, improvised and nudged along by vigilant staff members. Each year I\u2019m in awe of how much work goes into it all, especially the script, considering teachers are so overburdened. Year six is when pupils take the national curriculum tests known as Sats \u2013 a source of considerable anxiety for many. I was heartened to read how education secretary Bridget Phillipson, in a speech about declining attendances and the \u201ctunnel vision\u201d of focusing on academic success, championed the need for pupils \u201cto feel like they belong in school\u201d. When a class puts on their festive show, the pride is all around \u2013 it is particularly affecting to see children themselves buoyant about their collective performance in front of families. I remember the year that a Christmas concert was done in the playground not the school hall, due to Covid restrictions, and how the pandemic changed so many children\u2019s feelings towards the building that is a second home for them. The lockdowns led many children to start primary school with delayed communication skills and emotional difficulties. Drama and music can play a vital role in improving both \u2013 you see it from year to year in these school performances, as different children find their feet. After data was released showing an overall decline of 42% in the number of arts GCSE entries, I spoke to theatre leaders in June about the erosion and devaluation of the arts in state schools. The director Nicholas Hytner said that theatres themselves had been filling the gap left by \u201cthe disappearance of creative and performing arts education in state schools\u201d. There was an expansion in theatres\u2019 education and outreach work when Hytner ran the National Theatre from 2003 to 2015 and he expressed regret that the industry had not managed to secure direct funding from the Department for Education for it. Theatres are still slowly recovering from the impact of the pandemic; it has left their vital education work looking vulnerable. Earlier this month, dozens of figures from the theatre industry wrote to the Stage to express \u201cprofound concern\u201d at the 100% cut that has been made to the National Theatre\u2019s Primary Schools Touring theatre programme. Its signatories included writer and director Jude Christian, whose superb hour-long version of Hamlet was performed in schools last year as part of the programme and watched by more than 7,700 young people. Cutting the programme, stated the letter, would be \u201cdeeply damaging to working-class communities, disappearing transformative experiences for young people in their formative years, who might be inspired to become artists themselves\u201d. Kate Varah, co-chief executive of the National Theatre, responded by citing funding restraints and highlighting some of its other initiatives, such as digital learning, primary school trips to its Christmas show Ballet Shoes and a project \u201cto explore building creativity across the curriculum\u201d. But the only schools touring show highlighted by Varah\u2019s letter was a dystopian drama by the firecracker duo of playwright Ross Willis and director Ned Bennett. It\u2019s called The LeftBehinds and I can\u2019t wait to see it but the audience will be secondary school students. That now looks like an unfortunately ironic title. Consider how many primary students are left behind, missing out on professional live theatre that is seen not on a trip to an unfamiliar and perhaps imposing institution but on their home ground of school. The National is not the only theatre committed to education and many others will continue to tour work to school halls this Christmas and beyond.

Some of the polarised options are that batters absolutely love it and bowlers might not be quite so keen, but that in some ways speaks of the need to do it.\u201d The ECB had already agreed with the 18 counties this year that 2025 would be a year of consolidation. It was seen as impractical to make any major changes to the men\u2019s game at the same time as working on new county partnership agreements, the completion of major match allocation up until 2031 and the sale of the Hundred teams, all at the same time as working on the new women\u2019s structure. That revamped women\u2019s structure \u2013 335 county matches across Tiers 1-3 and including seven flagship finals days, more days at county headquarters and more games under lights \u2013 will align with the men\u2019s game for the first time, with the white-ball sponsors Vitality and Metro Bank sponsoring the men\u2019s and women\u2019s versions of their competition. The Championship also has a new sponsor in the insurance company brokers Rothesay. However, 2025 will offer only a temporary moment of reflection: talks are under way with the professional game committee about 2026 and beyond. And world cricket keeps whirring, with the Pakistan Super League due to clash with the English season in 2025 and a new ECB no objection certificate (NOC) policy due this week.",

The move appears to mean that Trump\u2019s team will continue to skirt FBI vetting and may not receive classified briefings until Trump is sworn in on 20 January and unilaterally grant sweeping security clearances across the administration. Trump\u2019s team has regarded the FBI background check process with contempt for months, a product of their deep distrust of the bureau ever since officials turned over transition records to the Russia investigation during the first Trump presidency, the people said. But delaying FBI vetting could also bring ancillary PR benefits for the Trump team if some political appointees run into problems during a background check, which could upend their Senate confirmation process, or if they struggle to obtain security clearances once in the White House. The putative process for obtaining a clearance in the first Trump administration involved the White House\u2019s personnel security office relying on an FBI background check to decide whether to grant one.

Trump\u2019s team have long viewed the process with suspicion, arguing that it was pointless to have government employees have the ability to recommend against granting a security clearance given Trump has the power, as president, to ultimately give clearances to whomever he likes. Trump himself has repeatedly railed against the FBI of being part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy to undermine his agenda. During the first Trump presidency, multiple advisers faced delays and hurdles in obtaining top level clearances, including Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn and the controversial former Trump White House national security aide Sebastian Gorka. Kushner, who played a number of roles in the first administration and was involved in drawing up a Middle East peace plan, received his clearance only after Trump personally intervened and ordered it, according to a memo written by then White House chief of staff John Kelly.

      "body": "<p>Walking through Leyton, in east London, you could easily miss Claremont Road. It is hardly a road at all, but a stubby little sidestreet between terrace houses that ends abruptly in a brick wall. But when it comes to the history of direct action, this could be one of the most significant sites in England. Thirty years ago, in November 1994, the scene here was very different: 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into a significantly larger Claremont Road and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in \u2013 some of them literally \u2013 against efforts to evict them.</p> <p>The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out. In retrospect, the \u201cBattle of Claremont Road\u201d, as it came to be known, was an almost unbelievable event. \u201cI talk about the three C\u2019s that underpin this type of activism: creativity, courage and cheek,\u201d says campaigner Camilla Berens, who was there. \u201cIt set the template for the next 20 or 30 years of how to do responsible disruption.\u201d</p> <p>The reason for the battle, and the reason Claremont Road is now so short, lies behind that brick wall at its end: what is now the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s, to connect east London to the north-east, but nothing happened for decades. In the interim, many of the condemned homes were vacated by residents and reoccupied by squatters and artists. (As a student, I squatted on Claremont Road for three years. I left in summer 1993.)</p>    <p>By the 1990s, the Conservative government was determined to make good on Margaret Thatcher\u2019s promise to carry out \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roads_for_Prosperity\">the biggest road-building programme since the Romans</a>\u201d. Resistance from locals and environmental groups was growing, though, against schemes such as the M3 extension at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyford_Down#Protests\">Twyford Down</a> in Hampshire (which went ahead), and the proposed east London river crossing through Oxleas Wood, in south-east London (which did not).</p> <p>\u201cThe M11 link road was effectively the Cinderella of the three,\u201d says veteran cycling campaigner Roger Geffen. Unlike Twyford Down and Oxleas Wood, the M11 scheme went through a poor urban neighbourhood, rather than an area of natural beauty, \u201cbut in a way, that\u2019s what made it interesting,\u201d he says. It was destroying the environment by uprooting trees and prioritising cars, but it was also destroying a community. This was the era of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/20/we-went-from-naive-hippyish-protesters-to-hardcore-anarchists-the-criminal-justice-bill-protests-30-years-on\">Criminal Justice Act</a>, targeting illegal raves, squatters and Travellers, which also passed in November 1994. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/gallery/2015/mar/28/poll-tax-riots-revisited-in-pictures\">poll tax riots of 1990</a> had been another landmark. The Claremont Road protests were a \u201ca joined-up mix of social and environmental motivations\u201d.</p> <p>At the time, Geffen had just moved to London. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a green brain cell in my head,\u201d he says, but he had just taken up cycling. Weaving through the traffic-clogged streets, he says, he realised: \u201cWhat I was doing wasn\u2019t crazy. I was overtaking a lot of people in little boxes, and that was far crazier than what I was doing.\u201d He joined the London Cycling Campaign, which led him into anti-car activism.</p> <p>By the early 90s, the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route of the M11 link road. In 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing. \u201cWe realised that we needed to make a big focus of it,\u201d says Geffen.</p>    <p>\u201cOne of the first things we did was to barricade it and set up street furniture,\u201d says John Drury, then a PhD student studying collective action. The street became something of a countercultural tourist attraction, with colourful murals and outdoor sculptures made of junk and a public cafe. Doug (not his real name), then an unemployed activist, says: \u201cThere was a real buzz, and it had a lot of energy, and everyone was really friendly, so I just started sticking around.\u201d</p> <p>As the inevitable showdown approached, preparations became more rushed. \u201cWe had to just throw everything at it,\u201d says Geffen. Some protesters built wooden observation towers on top of their houses. \u201cSo we thought, OK, what happens if we build an absolutely huge tower?\u201d This became \u201cDolly\u201d, a scaffolding structure 30 metres (100ft) high, rising out of the rooftops. It was named after Dolly Watson, a 92-year-old former actor who had lived on Claremont Road her entire life, and was among the last of the residents to leave. She once told a reporter: \u201cThey\u2019re not dirty hippy squatters, they\u2019re the grandchildren I never had.\u201d</p> <p>Other ad-hoc battlements appeared: treehouses, connected to the houses across the street by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made out of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete. Some activists built underground bunkers in which to seal themselves \u2013 \u201cvery elaborate womb-like structures that involved lots of layers of mattresses, foam, metal and furniture,\u201d Doug recalls. The idea was that whatever tool the police or bailiffs tried to use to get them out \u201cwould get gummed up\u201d. The upper floors of several houses beneath the tower were knocked together to create a \u201crat run\u201d, and the stairs up to them were removed, to make it harder for the police to reach the protesters. </p> <p>Volunteers had been monitoring police compounds for signs of activity. The callout came on 27 November. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s the one, it\u2019s the big eviction. Claremont is going to be taken,\u2019\u201d recalls Berens, a journalist who reported on the events for the Guardian. \u201cI think the whole of alternative London turned up. There was a massive party the night before.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, 28 November, an estimated 500 protesters were ready, remembers Neil Goodwin, who edited his colleague\u2019s Mayyasa Al-Malazi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5i5ZDBcsN0&amp;t=3890s\">footage of the siege</a>: \u201cThe rooftops were packed; every bunker, every treehouse, on the nets, the landings, the walkways, up the tower \u2013 everyone was in situ.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe police turned up in the early afternoon,\u201d recalls Mark Green (not his real name), another participant. \u201cThere were hundreds of them and they swarmed into the street in stormtrooper gear with batons raised. They were expecting a full-on riot. Instead they just found a bunch of hippies and local residents sitting around.\u201d A sound system on the tower cranked up the Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation.</p>    <p>Things didn\u2019t go as planned for the police. \u201cThey thought they were going to start by tackling the houses, and then they realised people had locked on to the road itself,\u201d says Julia Guest, then an aspiring photographer. Activists had drilled holes into the asphalt, into which they had sunk lock-on bolts, which were covered over with sheets of metal with holes in them. The activists \u201clay down with their arms through the holes and locked their wrists on with handcuffs.\u201d </p> <p>The police and bailiffs brought in mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, ladders, hammers and crowbars; and every occupant made themselves as difficult as possible to remove. \u201cI was in the loft at number 42, which I\u2019d covered in corrugated iron and filled with tyres,\u201d says Goodwin. \u201cThey had to prise us open, like a sardine tin.\u201d</p> <p>When the bailiffs eventually broke through that evening, Goodwin attached himself to part of the scaffolding tower with a bicycle D-lock, the keys of which he had chucked into a pile of tyres. \u201cThe bailiff pokes his head in, shines his torch around and goes: \u2018OK, we\u2019ll do this tomorrow.\u2019 So they left, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I\u2019m gonna be sitting here all night.\u2019 So I said to people: \u2018Could you see if you can find some D-lock keys?\u2019\u201d Luckily, they were just teetering over the edge of a gap in the floorboards.</p> <p>Everyone remembers being cold and hungry, especially the first night. Few people had warm clothes, let alone sleeping bags. \u201cAfter it got dark, someone led me down through a loft to warm up a bit,\u201d says Green. \u201cWe then went through a hole in a wall and exited through a wardrobe, which was surreal, into a room where people were watching themselves on the news on an old black-and-white portable TV.\u201d</p> <p>By the second day, about half the protesters had been evicted. But, says Geffen: \u201cThe police were puzzled that people who they thought they\u2019d evicted kept reappearing. Eventually, they got a metal detector out.\u201d They discovered the activists had built a tunnel out of oil drums, running underneath the back gardens and into one of the houses on the next road. Supplies and people had been going back and forth the whole time. \u201cWhen they found the tunnel, everyone on the tower and all the roofs just laughed at them.\u201d</p> <p> The longer the protest went on, \u201cthe more brutal the police and bailiffs became\u201d, says Berens. Green says he saw people shoved, grabbed and falling from heights (though no one was seriously injured). \u201cIt definitely felt like there was a political element to it.\u201d</p> <p>The protesters \u201chad a very strong commitment to non-violence\u201d, says Geffen. \u201cWe needed to be acting in accordance with the values that we wanted to speak for. If we\u2019re talking about environmental sustainability and sharing this Earth, and working in community, then violence doesn\u2019t form part of that.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the second day, there was only one protester left: Doug. \u201cI kept moving,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you live on a scaffolding tower for a few days, you can get quite good at swinging around. And they didn\u2019t really want to chase me around in a game of cat and mouse.\u201d Doug\u2019s persistence extended the protest by another full day. The police even brought in a \u201chostage negotiator\u201d to try to coax him down. \u201cHe pretended he was my dad, and was just concerned for my welfare.\u201d Doug was not swayed. \u201cI grabbed some rope, a saw and a few planks of wood, and I used them to make myself what was basically a coffin, which I slept in.\u201d The police finally got to him the next morning.</p>    <p>In the end, the police spent more than \u00a31m evicting the protesters. The M11 link road still got built, of course. Nobody believed the campaign would stop it. \u201cBut what it did do,\u201d says Drury, \u201cwas it turned the roads programme into a political thing. So, we won the moral argument, even if we didn\u2019t win that battle.\u201d</p> <p>When Labour came into power in 1997, it cut the major road schemes inherited from the Tories from 150 to 37, and pledged to focus on public transport. It felt like a victory for the anti-car campaigners, but it did not last.

      "bodyText": "Walking through Leyton, in east London, you could easily miss Claremont Road. It is hardly a road at all, but a stubby little sidestreet between terrace houses that ends abruptly in a brick wall. But when it comes to the history of direct action, this could be one of the most significant sites in England. Thirty years ago, in November 1994, the scene here was very different: 700 police officers and bailiffs in riot gear marched into a significantly larger Claremont Road and waged battle against about 500 activists, who were dug in \u2013 some of them literally \u2013 against efforts to evict them. The activists occupied rooftop towers, treehouses, underground bunkers and even secret tunnels. It took three days to get them all out. In retrospect, the \u201cBattle of Claremont Road\u201d, as it came to be known, was an almost unbelievable event. \u201cI talk about the three C\u2019s that underpin this type of activism: creativity, courage and cheek,\u201d says campaigner Camilla Berens, who was there. \u201cIt set the template for the next 20 or 30 years of how to do responsible disruption.\u201d The reason for the battle, and the reason Claremont Road is now so short, lies behind that brick wall at its end: what is now the six-lane A12, also known as the M11 link road. The road had been planned since the 1960s, to connect east London to the north-east, but nothing happened for decades. In the interim, many of the condemned homes were vacated by residents and reoccupied by squatters and artists. (As a student, I squatted on Claremont Road for three years. I left in summer 1993.) By the 1990s, the Conservative government was determined to make good on Margaret Thatcher\u2019s promise to carry out \u201cthe biggest road-building programme since the Romans\u201d. Resistance from locals and environmental groups was growing, though, against schemes such as the M3 extension at Twyford Down in Hampshire (which went ahead), and the proposed east London river crossing through Oxleas Wood, in south-east London (which did not). \u201cThe M11 link road was effectively the Cinderella of the three,\u201d says veteran cycling campaigner Roger Geffen. Unlike Twyford Down and Oxleas Wood, the M11 scheme went through a poor urban neighbourhood, rather than an area of natural beauty, \u201cbut in a way, that\u2019s what made it interesting,\u201d he says. It was destroying the environment by uprooting trees and prioritising cars, but it was also destroying a community. This was the era of the Criminal Justice Act, targeting illegal raves, squatters and Travellers, which also passed in November 1994. The poll tax riots of 1990 had been another landmark. The Claremont Road protests were a \u201ca joined-up mix of social and environmental motivations\u201d. At the time, Geffen had just moved to London. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a green brain cell in my head,\u201d he says, but he had just taken up cycling. Weaving through the traffic-clogged streets, he says, he realised: \u201cWhat I was doing wasn\u2019t crazy. I was overtaking a lot of people in little boxes, and that was far crazier than what I was doing.\u201d He joined the London Cycling Campaign, which led him into anti-car activism. By the early 90s, the Department for Transport had begun repossessing and demolishing houses along the route of the M11 link road. In 1994, Claremont Road was the last street standing. \u201cWe realised that we needed to make a big focus of it,\u201d says Geffen. \u201cOne of the first things we did was to barricade it and set up street furniture,\u201d says John Drury, then a PhD student studying collective action. The street became something of a countercultural tourist attraction, with colourful murals and outdoor sculptures made of junk and a public cafe. Doug (not his real name), then an unemployed activist, says: \u201cThere was a real buzz, and it had a lot of energy, and everyone was really friendly, so I just started sticking around.\u201d As the inevitable showdown approached, preparations became more rushed. \u201cWe had to just throw everything at it,\u201d says Geffen. Some protesters built wooden observation towers on top of their houses. \u201cSo we thought, OK, what happens if we build an absolutely huge tower?\u201d This became \u201cDolly\u201d, a scaffolding structure 30 metres (100ft) high, rising out of the rooftops. It was named after Dolly Watson, a 92-year-old former actor who had lived on Claremont Road her entire life, and was among the last of the residents to leave. She once told a reporter: \u201cThey\u2019re not dirty hippy squatters, they\u2019re the grandchildren I never had.\u201d Other ad-hoc battlements appeared: treehouses, connected to the houses across the street by webs of netting and walkways; roadblocks made out of cars and shopping trolleys filled with concrete. Some activists built underground bunkers in which to seal themselves \u2013 \u201cvery elaborate womb-like structures that involved lots of layers of mattresses, foam, metal and furniture,\u201d Doug recalls. The idea was that whatever tool the police or bailiffs tried to use to get them out \u201cwould get gummed up\u201d. The upper floors of several houses beneath the tower were knocked together to create a \u201crat run\u201d, and the stairs up to them were removed, to make it harder for the police to reach the protesters. Volunteers had been monitoring police compounds for signs of activity. The callout came on 27 November. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s the one, it\u2019s the big eviction. Claremont is going to be taken,\u2019\u201d recalls Berens, a journalist who reported on the events for the Guardian. \u201cI think the whole of alternative London turned up. There was a massive party the night before.\u201d The next morning, 28 November, an estimated 500 protesters were ready, remembers Neil Goodwin, who edited his colleague\u2019s Mayyasa Al-Malazi\u2019s footage of the siege: \u201cThe rooftops were packed; every bunker, every treehouse, on the nets, the landings, the walkways, up the tower \u2013 everyone was in situ.\u201d \u201cThe police turned up in the early afternoon,\u201d recalls Mark Green (not his real name), another participant. \u201cThere were hundreds of them and they swarmed into the street in stormtrooper gear with batons raised. They were expecting a full-on riot. Instead they just found a bunch of hippies and local residents sitting around.\u201d A sound system on the tower cranked up the Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation. Things didn\u2019t go as planned for the police. \u201cThey thought they were going to start by tackling the houses, and then they realised people had locked on to the road itself,\u201d says Julia Guest, then an aspiring photographer. Activists had drilled holes into the asphalt, into which they had sunk lock-on bolts, which were covered over with sheets of metal with holes in them. The activists \u201clay down with their arms through the holes and locked their wrists on with handcuffs.\u201d The police and bailiffs brought in mechanical diggers, cherrypickers, ladders, hammers and crowbars; and every occupant made themselves as difficult as possible to remove. \u201cI was in the loft at number 42, which I\u2019d covered in corrugated iron and filled with tyres,\u201d says Goodwin. \u201cThey had to prise us open, like a sardine tin.\u201d When the bailiffs eventually broke through that evening, Goodwin attached himself to part of the scaffolding tower with a bicycle D-lock, the keys of which he had chucked into a pile of tyres. \u201cThe bailiff pokes his head in, shines his torch around and goes: \u2018OK, we\u2019ll do this tomorrow.\u2019 So they left, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I\u2019m gonna be sitting here all night.\u2019 So I said to people: \u2018Could you see if you can find some D-lock keys?\u2019\u201d Luckily, they were just teetering over the edge of a gap in the floorboards. Everyone remembers being cold and hungry, especially the first night. Few people had warm clothes, let alone sleeping bags. \u201cAfter it got dark, someone led me down through a loft to warm up a bit,\u201d says Green. \u201cWe then went through a hole in a wall and exited through a wardrobe, which was surreal, into a room where people were watching themselves on the news on an old black-and-white portable TV.\u201d By the second day, about half the protesters had been evicted. But, says Geffen: \u201cThe police were puzzled that people who they thought they\u2019d evicted kept reappearing. Eventually, they got a metal detector out.\u201d They discovered the activists had built a tunnel out of oil drums, running underneath the back gardens and into one of the houses on the next road. Supplies and people had been going back and forth the whole time. \u201cWhen they found the tunnel, everyone on the tower and all the roofs just laughed at them.\u201d The longer the protest went on, \u201cthe more brutal the police and bailiffs became\u201d, says Berens. Green says he saw people shoved, grabbed and falling from heights (though no one was seriously injured). \u201cIt definitely felt like there was a political element to it.\u201d The protesters \u201chad a very strong commitment to non-violence\u201d, says Geffen. \u201cWe needed to be acting in accordance with the values that we wanted to speak for. If we\u2019re talking about environmental sustainability and sharing this Earth, and working in community, then violence doesn\u2019t form part of that.\u201d By the end of the second day, there was only one protester left: Doug. \u201cI kept moving,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you live on a scaffolding tower for a few days, you can get quite good at swinging around. And they didn\u2019t really want to chase me around in a game of cat and mouse.\u201d Doug\u2019s persistence extended the protest by another full day. The police even brought in a \u201chostage negotiator\u201d to try to coax him down. \u201cHe pretended he was my dad, and was just concerned for my welfare.\u201d Doug was not swayed. \u201cI grabbed some rope, a saw and a few planks of wood, and I used them to make myself what was basically a coffin, which I slept in.\u201d The police finally got to him the next morning. In the end, the police spent more than \u00a31m evicting the protesters. The M11 link road still got built, of course. Nobody believed the campaign would stop it. \u201cBut what it did do,\u201d says Drury, \u201cwas it turned the roads programme into a political thing. So, we won the moral argument, even if we didn\u2019t win that battle.\u201d When Labour came into power in 1997, it cut the major road schemes inherited from the Tories from 150 to 37, and pledged to focus on public transport. It felt like a victory for the anti-car campaigners, but it did not last. By 2000, New Labour was committing at least \u00a330bn to building and improving roads, and forecasting that another 2,500 miles of road would need to be built. Several of the Claremont Road activists went straight on to form Reclaim the Streets in 1995, which performed guerrilla anti-car actions \u2013 such as blocking off public roads to hold impromptu \u201cstreet parties\u201d \u2013 across the UK and worldwide. It also paved the way for subsequent campaigns such as Plane Stupid, the Climate Action Camps, Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil. The protest changed the lives of many of those who took part. \u201cThat was the day that I crossed the line,\u201d says Berens. \u201cBefore that, I was a journalist looking in and reporting on it, but because it was such an impressive campaign, and the people were so amazing, I became a committed activist.\u201d \u201cIt impacted me quite profoundly,\u201d says Guest. She became a documentary film-maker focusing on human rights in Israel, Palestine and Iraq. Paul Morozzo, one of the key organisers alongside Geffen, is now a campaigner at Greenpeace. Drury is a professor of social psychology at Sussex university. Doug is a lawyer dealing with civic issues. Green went on to design the famous Extinction Symbol, as used by Extinction Rebellion. He is less nostalgic about the event: \u201cI found the overall experience cold, dirty and depressing,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t like to describe it as a \u201cbattle\u201d. \u201cThat suggests an exchange of violence, whereas it was just a group of people passively occupying an area, with the only violence coming from the police.\u201d But like a battle, the event took its toll. As well as committed activists, the area and the protest attracted many people with drug and mental health problems, not to mention locals who were either uprooted or forced to live on the edge of a six-lane road. \u201cI naively hoped it would be a spark for a wider and longer-lasting societal change,\u201d says Green. \u201cInstead, things have just got much worse since then than we could ever have imagined.\u201d Geffen received an MBE for services to cycling in 2015, and now heads Low Traffic Future. \u201cWhat I\u2019m now doing is still basically the same cause,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 1990s, transport, roads, cars were the central issue for the environmental movement, then we lost a lot of that momentum.

His series character Ernest Cunningham \u2013 not a detective, just a regular guy who keeps solving murders \u2013 starts by thanking the \u201cliterary god [who] had the foresight to drop a corpse at my feet at Christmas time\u201d, and then reminds \u201cthe cynics out there\u201d that even the likes of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle \u201caren\u2019t immune to a little yuletide cash grab\u201d. Duly warned, there\u2019s lots to enjoy: Ernest is called to Katoomba, a small town in Australia\u2019s Blue Mountains, by his ex-wife Erin, who has been arrested for the murder of her new partner, Lyle. Only problem is, he\u2019s got to keep it secret from his fiancee, Juliette, who won\u2019t be delighted to learn he\u2019s at Erin\u2019s beck and call. Once Ernest is up in Katoomba, attending a magic show (it does make sense in the context of this particular murder), you guessed it: more bodies start to stack up. This is light and fun, if you don\u2019t mind the archly knowing air of it all; the sort of thing to pop in the stocking of your fellow mystery fan on Christmas Day. Which I\u2019m sure is exactly what Stevenson intended.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-peacock-and-the-sparrow-9781835011058/\">The Peacock and the Sparrow</a></strong> (No Exit Press) by IS Berry, a former CIA officer, tells us the story of almost-past-it American spy Shane Collins, who is on the verge of being forcibly retired from his mission in Bahrain. As Collins drinks heavily, meets sources and deals with the fallout from a series of bombings, revolution threatens, and he starts to fall for a beautiful local artist, Almaisa. I\u2019m sure all the tradecraft aspects of this novel are spot-on, and Collins is a believable and vibrant rendition of a spy.

      "bodyText": "Mathilde \u201clikes dogs, but she hates children. Especially girls.\u201d Mathilde \u201crefuses to work with small-calibre firearms, which, she firmly believes, are good only for bourgeois soap operas and adultery\u201d. Mathilde is also 63, a small, stout hero of the French Resistance (it\u2019s 1985, so there are still a fair few of them around) \u2013 and a much-in-demand contract killer. No one suspects her. But, after she wipes out her latest target on Paris\u2019s Avenue Foch with \u201cthe sort of gun that could stop a stampeding elephant in its tracks\u201d, the readers of Pierre Lemaitre\u2019s truly delicious Going to the Dogs (Mountain Leopard Press) start to realise that her mind isn\u2019t quite what it was. And a contract killer who can\u2019t remember if the name she has written on a piece of paper is her next target or her new cleaner isn\u2019t the safest person to have around. Brilliantly translated by Frank Wynne, this book is a sort of French take on Richard Osman, if Osman were a lot darker and kept on bumping off characters you\u2019d been made to care about. Deft, funny, sharp, and very French \u2013 Lemaitre\u2019s detective muses that \u201cthere is a certain poetry to the rain falling on the Seine\u201d \u2013 it is an absolute delight. Will Dean returns to his series detective, deaf journalist Tuva Moodyson, in his latest outing, Ice Town (Hodder &amp; Stoughton), a locked-town mystery in which the bodies of local people keep turning up in Esseberg, an atmospherically creepy location in Sweden\u2019s remote centre that can only be reached through a tunnel that closes at night. \u201cThere is a special kind of murk that accompanies snow and extreme chill up here. A unique variety of silence.\u201d Tuva is drawn to the case because a deaf teenager from Esseberg has gone missing with no money. \u201cHe\u2019s out there and people are screaming his name trying to help him and he can\u2019t hear them,\u201d says his desperate grandmother. As the deaths mount, residents start to leave, the tension grows, and Tuva tries to make inroads into this strange and closed community. \u201cLess than a thousand people. Everyone in everyone else\u2019s business. I think half the town\u2019s been on the verge of a killing spree for decades,\u201d an outsider tells her. I\u2019m not sure I totally bought the payoff, which felt a little preposterous after such a great buildup, but our hero takes it all in her stride and is as compelling as ever. Overall, Ice Town is a thrilling, chilling read for a wintry evening. Benjamin Stevenson is unashamedly tapping into the demand for festive mysteries with his latest novel, Everyone This Christmas Has a Secret (Michael Joseph). His series character Ernest Cunningham \u2013 not a detective, just a regular guy who keeps solving murders \u2013 starts by thanking the \u201cliterary god [who] had the foresight to drop a corpse at my feet at Christmas time\u201d, and then reminds \u201cthe cynics out there\u201d that even the likes of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle \u201caren\u2019t immune to a little yuletide cash grab\u201d. Duly warned, there\u2019s lots to enjoy: Ernest is called to Katoomba, a small town in Australia\u2019s Blue Mountains, by his ex-wife Erin, who has been arrested for the murder of her new partner, Lyle. Only problem is, he\u2019s got to keep it secret from his fiancee, Juliette, who won\u2019t be delighted to learn he\u2019s at Erin\u2019s beck and call. Once Ernest is up in Katoomba, attending a magic show (it does make sense in the context of this particular murder), you guessed it: more bodies start to stack up. This is light and fun, if you don\u2019t mind the archly knowing air of it all; the sort of thing to pop in the stocking of your fellow mystery fan on Christmas Day. Which I\u2019m sure is exactly what Stevenson intended. The Peacock and the Sparrow (No Exit Press) by IS Berry, a former CIA officer, tells us the story of almost-past-it American spy Shane Collins, who is on the verge of being forcibly retired from his mission in Bahrain. As Collins drinks heavily, meets sources and deals with the fallout from a series of bombings, revolution threatens, and he starts to fall for a beautiful local artist, Almaisa. I\u2019m sure all the tradecraft aspects of this novel are spot-on, and Collins is a believable and vibrant rendition of a spy. The problem is, he\u2019s so unpleasant to spend time with \u2013 \u201cShe had none of the triviality or false femininity of American women; neither did she have the humourless affectation of European women,\u201d he thinks of Almaisa \u2013 that his company starts to wear after a while. Still, this debut comes garlanded with awards \u2013 the 2024 Edgar for best first novel, the International Thriller Writers Award for best first novel, numerous prize shortlistings \u2013 so others clearly aren\u2019t bothered. It\u2019s gritty, it\u2019s realistic (I assume); I just couldn\u2019t quite care enough about Collins\u2019s travails to make me love it.

      "bodyText": "With 10 days between the early end of the Perth Test and the start of Adelaide, this is the Australian cricket supporter witching hour. They can cope with a close loss to an opponent doing something special: nobody was burning effigies in the streets of Greenslopes earlier this year when Shamar Joseph on one foot bowled West Indies to a sizzling Gabba win. But it\u2019s very different after a beating like the one that India just handed out, when an Australian team that was storming the field after two sessions failed to fire a shot for the next seven. Now, those supporters are angry. They\u2019re swarming talkback lines, writing to papers, voicing disdain in pubs. They can\u2019t stand a team looking incompetent, they want to know what will be done to avoid that happening again. And they have a lot of time on their hands, with no Test player due to face or bowl a ball at any other level in the interim, while a Sheffield Shield round plays out with plenty of potential replacements on display. For Andrew McDonald and Pat Cummins, as coach-captain axis of the Australian team for three years and counting, the approach has always been about cool and composure. Their mantra has been to avoid overreacting to performances, whether good or bad. Nobody is unstoppable, nobody is terrible. Even after his team took two hammerings in India last year, ending with a collective neurological fritz while batting in Dehli, Cummins was calm as a lilo afternoon. Australia went on to win the third Test of the series and draw the fourth. Their approach is probably right. It\u2019s probably the most sustainable.

At the time of the uprising, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the mafia, which considered the roughly monthly police raids on its LGBTQ+ clientele to be a mere cost of doing business. But it was not business as usual on 28 June 1969, as the raid that occurred that night led to a pitched battle between patrons and police that spilled over for a total of six days of chaos.

McDarrah was telling a story that was so deep and important and full of emotion. You see that effervesce and almost relief that you would march in the streets and show yourself and be proud of it.\u201d</p> <p>Kushner sees the civil unrest of the 70s as colliding with the Aids crisis of the 80s, creating an ongoing climate of uncertainty. The show scatters reminders of the toll that HIV took on the queer community by noting how so many of those who were pictured by McDarrah ultimately ended up succumbing to the disease. McDarrah also documents the massive Aids memorial quilt, which would ultimately end up dominating the National Mall in Washington DC in October 1987 during the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, and returning in larger and larger formats in 1992 and 1996.</p> <p>There are also riches here from before the formal era of the LGBTQ+ civil rights struggle.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s win-win, says a Chinese businesswoman talking to a group of Ethiopian farmers protesting against the forced sale of their land to make way for new factories. She tells the farmers that their government will compensate them with new land \u2013 but months later, half of them are still waiting. This quiet, sobering documentary explores the complexities of Chinese influence in Africa through the lives of three hard-working women. There\u2019s Chinese factory boss Motto; Ethiopian worker Beti, who sews jeans with the \u201cMade in Ethiopia\u201d label; and Workinesh, a farmer and mother of five. Motto, the businesswoman, is excruciating to watch. At a meeting with European fashion companies, she shamelessly upsells her industrial park. The factories have become a tourist hotspot! \u201cWe are considering selling tickets!\u201d she says, giggling frantically. The new factories will add another 30,000 to the manufacturing jobs that China is generating in Ethiopia, a country with a young population in need of work (half are under 18).

China is a major producer of precursor chemicals that are acquired by drug cartels, including in Mexico, to manufacture fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid.</p> <p>\u201cI have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail \u2026 Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.\u201d</p> <p>In response, China warned: \u201cNo one will win a trade war\u201d.</p> <p>Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said China had taken steps to combat drug trafficking after an agreement was reached last year between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against narcotics,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAll these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality.\u201d</p> <p>Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, released a statement on Monday evening saying that the country placed the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US. Trump and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke on Monday night about trade and border security, Reuters reported, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with the situation.</p> <p>Freeland\u2019s statement did not mention the tariffs directly. It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border Protection \u201cwork together every single day to disrupt the scourge of fentanyl coming from China and other countries\u201d.</p> <p>Bill Ackman, the chief executive of the New York-based hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, <a href=\"https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1861198845574815947\">said on X</a>: \u201cDonald Trump is going to use tariffs as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America, fulfilling his America first policy. This is a great way for Trump to effect foreign policy changes even before he takes office.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/nov/26/dollar-gains-stocks-drop-trump-tariff-threats-business-live-news\">The dollar rose to its highest level since July against China\u2019s yuan</a>, as markets reacted to Trump\u2019s comments. It increased by almost 2% against the Mexican peso and hit a four-and-a-half-year high against the Canadian dollar. Most Asian stock markets declined, as did European shares in early trading.</p> <p>The mood among German exporters improved slightly this month, despite the threat of new US tariffs. The Ifo economic institute\u2019s indicator for export expectations rose to minus 5.9 points in November from minus 6.5 points in October, the first increase in six months.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies are unsettled but are still waiting to see which trade policy Trump will ultimately implement,\u201d said Klaus Wohlrabe, the head of Ifo surveys. \u201cIn addition, the dollar has appreciated strongly since the election, which may benefit exporters.\u201d</p> <p>While on the campaign trail in October, Trump described tariff as \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, and made clear his intentions to reduce US companies\u2019 use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost. He campaigned on pledges to raise tariffs to 60% for all goods imported from China and to 20% for those brought in for the rest of the world. The policy, he said, would strengthen the US\u2019s international trade position and boost US job growth.</p> <p>A tariff is a tax placed on goods when they cross national borders.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has said that he will sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products coming in to the United States from Mexico and Canada, and additional tariffs on China, once he becomes US president again. \u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump said the tariffs would remain in place until the two countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and people crossing the border illegally. In a follow-up post, Trump announced that the US \u201cwill be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America\u201d. He said that the reason for the additional tariff was China\u2019s failure to curb the number of drugs entering the US. China is a major producer of precursor chemicals that are acquired by drug cartels, including in Mexico, to manufacture fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid. \u201cI have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail \u2026 Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.\u201d In response, China warned: \u201cNo one will win a trade war\u201d. Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said China had taken steps to combat drug trafficking after an agreement was reached last year between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. \u201cThe Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against narcotics,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAll these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality.\u201d Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, released a statement on Monday evening saying that the country placed the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US. Trump and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke on Monday night about trade and border security, Reuters reported, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with the situation. Freeland\u2019s statement did not mention the tariffs directly. It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border Protection \u201cwork together every single day to disrupt the scourge of fentanyl coming from China and other countries\u201d. Bill Ackman, the chief executive of the New York-based hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, said on X: \u201cDonald Trump is going to use tariffs as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America, fulfilling his America first policy. This is a great way for Trump to effect foreign policy changes even before he takes office.\u201d The dollar rose to its highest level since July against China\u2019s yuan, as markets reacted to Trump\u2019s comments. It increased by almost 2% against the Mexican peso and hit a four-and-a-half-year high against the Canadian dollar. Most Asian stock markets declined, as did European shares in early trading. The mood among German exporters improved slightly this month, despite the threat of new US tariffs. The Ifo economic institute\u2019s indicator for export expectations rose to minus 5.9 points in November from minus 6.5 points in October, the first increase in six months. \u201cCompanies are unsettled but are still waiting to see which trade policy Trump will ultimately implement,\u201d said Klaus Wohlrabe, the head of Ifo surveys. \u201cIn addition, the dollar has appreciated strongly since the election, which may benefit exporters.\u201d While on the campaign trail in October, Trump described tariff as \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, and made clear his intentions to reduce US companies\u2019 use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost. He campaigned on pledges to raise tariffs to 60% for all goods imported from China and to 20% for those brought in for the rest of the world. The policy, he said, would strengthen the US\u2019s international trade position and boost US job growth. A tariff is a tax placed on goods when they cross national borders. Import tariffs such as those proposed by Trump can have the effect of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition while also generating tax revenue for the government. But economists widely consider them an inefficient tool that typically leave consumers and taxpayers bearing the brunt of higher costs. Countries generally levy retaliatory tariffs of their own in response to tariffs such as those Trump is proposing, which can spark a trade war \u2013 as happened between the US and China during Trump\u2019s first presidency. \u201cA tariff is basically a sales tax, raising the price of almost everything you buy. It\u2019s also regressive \u2013 taking a higher percentage out of the paychecks of working people than out of the wealthy,\u201d Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, posted on social media. The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan Washington DC-based research organization, estimates that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would cost the typical US household more than $2,600 (\u00a32,100) a year. Trump\u2019s proposal comes just days after he picked the hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to be his treasury secretary \u2013 a move many Wall Street executives believe signalled a willingness to moderate his approach to tariffs. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Trump wants to remind markets who is in control, after nominating Scott Bessent as treasury secretary \u2013 a man markets expected to cool Trump\u2019s potency,\u201d Matt Simpson, a senior market analyst for City Index told Reuters. While the 10% tariff pledge is lower than his previous threats against China, analysts said it was probably an opening gambit, especially with the Chinese economy in a much more vulnerable position than during the previous trade war waged between the two countries given the country\u2019s prolonged property downturn, debt risks and weak domestic demand. William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the move was classic Trump: \u201cthreaten, and then negotiate\u201d. Tahra Jirari, the director of economic analysis at the US trade group Chamber of Progress, has reacted to Trump\u2019s tariffs, pointing out that they will lead to higher prices for consumers. \u201cTrump vows 25% tariff on ALL Mexico/Canada imports if elected. This means higher prices for Americans. Tariffs = taxes that YOU pay at the store. Cars, food, electronics \u2013 all cost more. Even your grocery bill would jump. Companies can\u2019t absorb 25% \u2013 it hits your wallet,\u201d she wrote in a social media post. The proposed tariffs may also signal Trump\u2019s plans for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which he renegotiated during his first term, and forebode a future trade war. \u201cWhile the USMCA agreement is technically only up for renegotiation in 2026, Trump is likely trying to kickstart the renewal process early with Canada and Mexico through today\u2019s tariff announcements,\u201d said Alex Loo, a foreign exchange and macro strategist at TD Securities. \u201cMexico and Canada remain heavily dependent on the US market so their ability to walk away from President-elect Trump\u2019s threats remains limited,\u201d Wendy Cutler, a vice-president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and former US trade official, told AFP. More than 83% of exports from Mexico went to the US last year, and 75% of Canadian exports go to the country.",

And yet the spectacle itself runs \u2013 to a large extent \u2013 on the energy and cash and banter of guys dressed as traffic cones ordering four-pint pitchers. In a way darts is sport slathered in so many layers of irony that it is essentially indistinguishable from sincerity, a cultural phenomenon that exists at the crowded intersection of the deeply trivial and the deathly serious. Nobody expresses this tension better than the newest and brightest star of the sport. Luke Littler has reached that level of fame where you must begin to sense your own presence, the way the energy of a room changes when you walk into it, the way the gaze is instinctively drawn towards you. The Premier League and Grand Slam champion, new world No 4 and second favourite for BBC Sports Personality of the Year enters with a huge entourage, takes a seat in the secluded corner booth where he will fulfil his media duties, which has been specially stripped of sponsor livery. Yes, Littler cannot be filmed in front of gambling branding because he is still only 17. All year people have been asking him how he copes with the attention and scrutiny, how he doesn\u2019t go mad from it all. But then, what does he really have to compare it with? Littler is the first darts player in the history of the sport never to have been anything else: never to have had a proper job, or even much of a plan for life. Of course he is flesh and blood, like anyone else. But on the stage, he does a better job than anyone else of hiding it. His blossoming rivalry with Humphries has all the makings of greatness: the two outstanding players in the world, still discovering their outer limits, still trying to stay ahead of a chasing pack more than capable of dethroning them. The winner\u2019s cheque for the first PDC world championship in 1994 was \u00a364,000. At this tournament, each nine-dart leg will see a random spectator from the crowd handed a cheque for \u00a360,000. For those following this journey even from a safe distance, let alone for those riding the train, the pace of change still feels a little surreal, verging on disorienting. Is this trivial or is this serious? Perhaps, when you have enough eyes on you, the distinction no longer matters.",

Steve Reed said the impact \u201cshould be less severe\u201d than it was on Sunday and Monday morning, as communities in England and Wales start a massive clean-up after the widespread flooding. A former chair of the Environment Agency, Emma Howard Boyd, has said not enough money was spent on maintenance of existing flood defences and recommended a focus on tackling \u201csurface water\u201d flooding. A severe flood warning is still in place for the River Nene at Billing Aquadrome and nearby business parks in Northamptonshire, while 132 flood warnings remain in place across England and six in Wales. The Met Office weather forecast shows an area of low pressure moving into southern parts of the UK on Tuesday night into Wednesday, bringing heavy rain for some. Mike Silverstone, the deputy chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \u201cOn Tuesday night we\u2019ll see outbreaks of rain spreading north-eastwards, which could be heavy at times. \u201cWe\u2019re expected this to be heaviest across the south [and] south-east of England, although subtle changes over the next 24 hours will have an impact on how this develops. There could also be strong winds for a time, and it\u2019s possible this will require a weather warning.\u201d Hundreds of homes were flooded, roads were turned into rivers and winds of more than 80mph were recorded across parts of the UK. People in some affected areas have said they do not believe the chaos will be cleared by Christmas. Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe. This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe as a result. Howard Boyd told Radio 4 that during her time at the Environment Agency \u201cone of the areas that we struggled with getting more money to \u2026 was on the maintenance of our flood defences\u201d. \u201cThe ongoing maintenance is so important to making sure that the existing infrastructure that we\u2019ve got is fit for purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother area that we really need to be aware of \u2026 with warmer, wetter winters, we need to be ready for surface water flooding, and this is roughly accountable for 60% of our flooding, and needs a very different response to the flood defences that we see up and down the country.\u201d Reed told the House of Commons on Monday evening that an estimated 107 properties have flooded across England. He added: \u201cFurther flooding is sadly likely over the next few days as water levels rise in slower flowing rivers such as the Severn and the Ouse. \u201cThe Environment Agency anticipates that any impacts should be less severe than we have seen in recent days.\u201d A man in his 80s died after his car entered water at a ford in Colne, Lancashire, on Saturday, while a body was found in the search for Brian Perry, 75, who went missing while walking his dog near the Afon Conwy River in north Wales on the same day.",

      "bodyText": "A third Australian also fell ill after a suspected mass methanol poisoning in Laos that has claimed six lives, Guardian Australia has confirmed. Melburnians Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both 19, died in hospital in Thailand after the tragedy, which also claimed the lives of people from Denmark, the UK and the US. Guardian Australia can reveal that a third Australian, a dual national, also fell ill as part of the suspected poisoning. It is understood they are in a stable condition and being supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat). Dfat said in a statement that it was \u201ccontinuing to provide consular assistance to the families of two Australians who have tragically passed away in Thailand. \u201cOur thoughts are with the families at this deeply distressing time. \u201cAustralian officials in Laos and Thailand are working closely with local authorities. Investigations are underway and we are offering any assistance we can provide.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Guardian Australia understands the bodies of the Melbourne women could be returned in the coming days. \u201cThey were best friends in the best days of their lives,\u201d the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told parliament on Monday. \u201cThere is no crueller arithmetic than adding up the years not lived, the potential not fulfilled, the dreams not lived or that might have been,\u201d he said. Jones and Bowles were on holiday in Laos when they became ill along with a dozen other tourists in the popular town of Vang Vieng. They failed to check out at the Nana backpacker hostel on 13 November after going to the Jaidee bar. The pair were evacuated to Thailand and died in separate Bangkok hospitals after their parents raced to be by their bedsides. Jones\u2019s father said his daughter was on the trip of a lifetime and wanted to explore the world to meet new friends. \u201cHer life had just begun,\u201d Mark Jones told reporters in Bangkok on Saturday. \u201cShe was a young woman that had a lust for life. \u201cWe\u2019ll forever miss our beautiful girl and hope her loss of life has not been in vain.\u201d Thai authorities have confirmed Jones died of \u201cbrain swelling due to high levels of methanol found in her system\u201d. On behalf of both Australian families, Jones urged the Laos government to investigate the incident to the \u201cfullest extent\u201d to avoid it happening again. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the passing of our daughter \u2026 not lead to change to protect others,\u201d he said. Local media in Laos have reported eight people were detained over the deaths of the American man and two Danish women in Van Vieng, but there was no mention of the two Australians or the British woman who also died of suspected methanol poisoning. The men detained were identified as hotel staff and management. The Australian federal police have offered to help the Laos investigation into the deaths. \u2013 With AAP",

      "bodyText": "The Victorian Greens are confident they can hold on to the inner-Melbourne seat of Prahran despite new allegations against their former MP, Sam Hibbins, as Labor opts to sit out the byelection. Guardian Australia understands Labor\u2019s administrative committee will meet on Tuesday evening, where it is expected they will decide not to field a candidate in the byelection, which was triggered by Hibbins\u2019 resignation at the weekend. A senior Labor source argued the party have not won the seat since 2006, and to surpass either the Greens or Liberals in first-preference votes would require a costly campaign of up to $500,000, which it cannot justify in the lead up to the 2026 state election. They said the funds would be better spent on four or five target seats at that poll. Another Labor source said the byelection would be a distraction for the government and a \u201cbig risk\u201d if the party performed poorly, as it would contribute to the narrative they are losing ground. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email It is not the first time Labor has sat out a poll \u2013 it missed the Warrandyte byelection in 2023 and the Narracan supplementary election in 2022, both of which are Liberal-held seats. But it is likely to displease the local rank and file, who had argued the party would have performed well in the area given its recent string of housing announcements. A Labor source also described the decision as \u201cweak\u201d as it looked like the party was \u201crunning scared\u201d. The electorate, which covers Prahran, South Yarra and Windsor, has previously been held by both major parties before Hibbins won it in 2014 in a three-way contest that took the Victorian Electoral Commission more than a week to declare. Since then, Hibbins had increased his margin to 12% against the Liberals, but the Greens have recently performed worse than expected at local government elections and in last month\u2019s Queensland state poll. Hibbins\u2019 controversial departure will also likely hurt the minor party. It came just three weeks after he quit the Greens due to a \u201cconsensual relationship\u201d with a staff member on his team, which was a breach of the party\u2019s rules. On Monday, new allegations emerged, with the ABC reporting claims by a woman that Hibbins attempted to kiss her while she was interning in his office as a university student in 2016. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, Hibbins said he \u201cabsolutely dispute[s] the sequence and detail of the events\u201d alleged. The ABC report alleged university interns were barred from working in the member for Prahran\u2019s office as early as 2016 when a complaint about inappropriate behaviour was made to the department of parliamentary services (DPS). Both La Trobe University and DPS have confirmed to Guardian Australia they had received a complaint from a student, who was interning with Hibbins as part of her studies. The former student alleged to the ABC that Hibbins had tried to kiss her after a community event. In a statement provided to the Guardian and the ABC, Hibbins said when the matter was brought to his attention in 2018 he \u201ctook it very seriously\u201d and \u201cacknowledged the person\u2019s concern\u201d. \u201cI believed the issue was a misinterpretation, so I immediately offered to provide an apology to the person involved in the parliamentary internship program. As a further act of remedy, I said I would not participate further in that particular program,\u201d he said. The Victorian Greens leader, Ellen Sandell, on Tuesday said the party was made aware by Hibbins in 2018 that he had voluntarily removed himself from the intern program due to a complaint. \u201cClearly he has misrepresented the facts. We were not aware of all the details that were in that ABC report,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe made inquiries and we were told by DPS that the matter was resolved to the full satisfaction of the person involved, but they wanted strict confidentiality, which we respected.\u201d Sandell said she expected the party would still hang on to the seat and would preselect a candidate in coming days. \u201cWe expect several excellent local candidates will put their hands up to run for the Greens in Prahran, and be a great local representative for their community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people of Prahran want someone who will take on the old parties on the issues that are important, such as cost of living, housing and climate action, and the Greens will be putting up an excellent local candidate who will work hard on these issues\u201d. The Victorian Liberals said they would also run but were yet to select a candidate, though a source said there was \u201cstrong interest\u201d among local female members in the area.",

If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure.</p> \n  <p>The Greens decided to ask the Senate to discharge the bill after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election.</p> \n  <p>The Greens had hoped to secure the numbers to remove the bill and put pressure on the Coalition on a sensitive issue which the major parties usually consider a matter of conscience.</p> \n  <p>But the opposition leadership pushed back, arguing it would set a bad precedent to use a majority vote to discharge a private senators\u2019 bill \u2013 and implying it could happen to others.</p> \n  <p>The opposition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, said he \u201cwould not and will not ever vote for this bill or any measures that restrict women\u2019s reproductive rights\u201d. But he said removing it would impede private senators\u2019 rights and was a precedent that could be used against other bills.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSenators in particular should reflect on the precedent this motion sets that could see other bills discharged just because a majority opposed them,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cGiven this bill has been on the notice paper for almost two years, the decision of the Greens to pursue this at this time is clearly about politics, not the substantive issue.\u201d<br>The motion was lost, 30 votes to 28, with 18 senators not present.</p> \n  <p>ACT independent senator David Pocock, two One Nation senators, former Liberal turned independent Gerard Rennick, United Australia party senator Ralph Babet and Tasmanian independents Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrrell joined the Coalition in opposing the motion. Pocock and Tyrrell both spoke in the chamber, saying they opposed the bill itself but supported the principle of allowing a private senators\u2019 bill to remain and be debated.</p> \n  <p>Larissa Waters suggested the Coalition\u2019s move in defeating the motion contradicted Dutton\u2019s edict to his partyroom.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBy threatening crossbenchers with retaliation if they supported a Greens move to protect women\u2019s rights, the Liberals \u2026 kept an anti-abortion bill on the Senate notice paper,\u201d Waters told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Liberal game-playing has confirmed that Mr Dutton does not want to talk about abortion because it would reveal that his party wants to restrict women\u2019s rights to make decisions about their own bodies.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T06:42:11.872Z\">at 6.42am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674567be8f08849211a44cf0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jordyn-beazley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-26T06:16:52.974Z\">6.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW to refund $5.5m in Covid fines</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The NSW government will refund $5.5m worth of fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney.</p> \n  <p>More than 23,000 penalty notices will be withdrawn and the refunds will include any total or partial payments on the fines.</p> \n  <p>The government committed to withdraw and refund the fines after a legal campaign by the Redfern Legal Centre (RLC) and Maurice Blackburn who asserted that the fines were improperly issued and invalid.

He will conclude:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Australians can continue to expect a Coalition government will be singularly focussed on home ownership. We are the only party that still believes in the Australian Dream, which is why the individual, not the institution, is the centre of our focus. We are the only party fighting for the Dream because home ownership has always been a Liberal value and something Labor has never signed up to.

Here are the main stories: TikTok warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a \u201clicence to be online\u201d because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The Human Rights Commission said the social media ban should not pass in current form. At least three Nationals publicly voiced their concerns over the social media ban bill, including Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and Bridget McKenzie \u2013 as well as Liberal MP Garth Hamilton. Opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, later said the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. Australia-China relationship are in \u201cvery good shape after \u201cimmense improvement\u201d, Chines ambassador Xiao Qian said. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, said findings of missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiry are \u201chorrific\u201d. The sports minister, Anika Wells, said changes to gamblings advertising could affect Australian sport on world stage. An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, announced new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that were introduced to parliament today. Labor\u2019s housing bill passed the senate this afternoon, coming after the Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather ,said his party had \u201cpushed as hard as we can\u201d on housing. The NSW government will refund $5.5m in fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. Queenslanders gathered outside parliament to protest LNP\u2019s treaty stance. Sydney and Melbourne house prices to keep falling but rate cut will cause bounce, report predicts. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O\u2019Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. Leading economists have predicted a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year. Christian lobby welcomes anti-abortion bill stay The Australian Christian Lobby has hailed the failure of a Greens motion aimed at discharging a private senators\u2019 anti-abortion bill as \u201ca victory for the democratic process\u201d. The Greens Senate leader, Larissa Water, wanted the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The ACL CEO, Michelle Pearse, welcomed the Coalition and seven crossbenchers voting down the bill: \u201cThe ACL was pleased to see senators afford this Bill an opportunity for proper consideration and debate rather than shutting down the democratic process. We must allow this Bill to go to a proper vote.\u201d The Greens motion to discharge the bill followed the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, telling Coalition MPs recently that they should not seek to restart public debate on abortion ahead of next year\u2019s federal election. NSW avoids power supply issues but still faces \u2018tight\u2019 days Without jinxing things, NSW has so far avoided any blackouts as temperatures climb in eastern Australia. Sydney\u2019s top temperature was kept to a bearable 28.2C while about 50km to the west, Penrith reached 39.7C to mark the Sydney basin\u2019s warmest maximum for Tuesday. Penrith and a few other outer suburbs can expect a similar top on Wednesday at 39C, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts. The CBD, though, will be a bit hotter than today, heading form 34C \u2013 which would be the hottest there since late February. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, wholesale power prices may yet hit their ceiling of $17,500 a megawatt-hour (compared to more typical prices of $125/MWh) later on Tuesday as an indication of a \u201ctight\u201d or strained market. And tomorrow evening there will be more of the same, with a sign that an administered price cap of $600/MWh may kick in too: Aemo has been busy issuing its so-called lack of reserve alerts for NSW and Queensland in the past couple of days. They are intended to highlight when it wants more capacity brought on to ensure \u201cthe lights stay on\u201d. The market does tend to respond (hence the absence of blackouts) but the fact Aemo is issuing them from lengthy periods for NSW for parts of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (before they get cancelled) point to the lingering impacts of the heatwave on the grid. And there are storms to look forward to, too. Bubble tea franchise Chatime fined $132,840 for underpaying workers The Fair Work Ombudsman has fined bubble tea franchise Chatime and its managing director $132,840 for the underpayments of more than $160,000 to vulnerable employees at 19 stores across Sydney and Melbourne. Earlier today, the federal circuit and family court imposed a $120,960 penalty against Chatime Australia, and a fine of $11,880 against Chatime Australia managing director, Chen \u201cCharlley\u201d Zhao, for his involvement in some of the underpayments. The court found that between August and December 2016, Chatime Australia paid employees at stores it directly operated flat rates as low as $7.59 to $24.30 an hour and adopted a practice of not paying Fast Food Industry Award entitlements such as loadings and penalty rates. As a result, 152 employees, including 41 junior workers aged below 21 and 95 visa holders, were underpaid a total amount of $162,533. Many of the visa holders were international students. The underpaid staff worked at 10 Chatime outlets across Sydney in Bondi Junction, Chatswood, Wetherill Park and the CBD; and nine Chatime outlets across Melbourne, in Dandenong, Doncaster, Glen Waverley, Cheltenham and the CBD. In his judgment, Judge Nicholas Manousaridis rejected Chatime Australia\u2019s submission that the contraventions should not fall into the category of being either \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d, and found that the matter involved a large number of employees who were underpaid basic Award entitlements. \u201cPenalties should be set to signal to persons who manage companies that they will be met with substantial penalties if, through their neglect, they permit companies they manage to contravene terms of an award or any other industrial laws or instruments that might apply.\u201d An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Greens indicated earlier on Tuesday that the motion would be deferred until February but the party\u2019s Senate leader, Larissa Waters, suddenly brought on the vote on Tuesday afternoon. Waters was asking the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The Greens decided to ask the Senate to discharge the bill after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election. The Greens had hoped to secure the numbers to remove the bill and put pressure on the Coalition on a sensitive issue which the major parties usually consider a matter of conscience. But the opposition leadership pushed back, arguing it would set a bad precedent to use a majority vote to discharge a private senators\u2019 bill \u2013 and implying it could happen to others. The opposition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, said he \u201cwould not and will not ever vote for this bill or any measures that restrict women\u2019s reproductive rights\u201d. But he said removing it would impede private senators\u2019 rights and was a precedent that could be used against other bills. \u201cSenators in particular should reflect on the precedent this motion sets that could see other bills discharged just because a majority opposed them,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cGiven this bill has been on the notice paper for almost two years, the decision of the Greens to pursue this at this time is clearly about politics, not the substantive issue.\u201d The motion was lost, 30 votes to 28, with 18 senators not present. ACT independent senator David Pocock, two One Nation senators, former Liberal turned independent Gerard Rennick, United Australia party senator Ralph Babet and Tasmanian independents Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrrell joined the Coalition in opposing the motion. Pocock and Tyrrell both spoke in the chamber, saying they opposed the bill itself but supported the principle of allowing a private senators\u2019 bill to remain and be debated. Larissa Waters suggested the Coalition\u2019s move in defeating the motion contradicted Dutton\u2019s edict to his partyroom. \u201cBy threatening crossbenchers with retaliation if they supported a Greens move to protect women\u2019s rights, the Liberals \u2026 kept an anti-abortion bill on the Senate notice paper,\u201d Waters told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Liberal game-playing has confirmed that Mr Dutton does not want to talk about abortion because it would reveal that his party wants to restrict women\u2019s rights to make decisions about their own bodies.\u201d The NSW government will refund $5.5m worth of fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. More than 23,000 penalty notices will be withdrawn and the refunds will include any total or partial payments on the fines. The government committed to withdraw and refund the fines after a legal campaign by the Redfern Legal Centre (RLC) and Maurice Blackburn who asserted that the fines were improperly issued and invalid. Maurice Blackburn valued the more than 23,000 fines, some of which had not been repaid, at approximately $15m. In a statement, from RLC and Maurice Blackburn, they said the announcement came after Maurice Blakcburn notified the government it would file a class action if Revenue NSW did not withdraw and refund the fines. The RLC said the fines, which were typically worth $1,000 to $5,000, were disproportionately issued to socioeconomically disadvantaged people living in western and south-western Sydney. RLC found that among those fined were Indigenous children, children with cognitive impairments, and children experiencing homelessness. In 2022, the NSW government withdrew 33,000 fines related to Covid-19 health measures after it lost a legal challenge by RLC. The court found the fines were invalid because they did not include sufficient information about the offence. On Tuesday, the department of customer service said the remaining 23,000 fines also lacked details \u201cwhich may render them technically deficient and place their validity in doubt\u201d. Samantha Lee, supervising solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre, said: This outcome is the result of a significant and lengthy effort by Redfern Legal Centre, a team of dedicated counsel and Maurice Blackburn. The impact of Covid fines on marginalised communities and on children \u2013 was disproportionate, unreasonable, and unjust. \u2018Nitazenes are extremely potent\u2019: two opioid overdoses in NSW Two people in NSW have been hospitalised with severe opioid overdoses, prompting health authorities to warn about the dangers of synthetic opioids in fake oxycodone. The two people suffered overdoses after taking what they believed to be oxycodone tablets described as yellow unmarked round tablets, sold as OxyContin 40 mg. However, NSW health says they contained nitazenes \u2013 extremely potent synthetic opioids which are more likely to stop breathing than other opioids. NSW Poisons Information Centre medical director, Dr Darren Roberts, said these drugs can be hundreds of times more potent than oxycodone and can cause severe overdose or death. He said: \u201cNitazenes are extremely potent and can vary widely in their strength.\u201d \u201cAs they are illicit and unregulated, there is no way of knowing what type of nitazene is present or what dosage is being taken. The strength and contents can vary widely, even within the same batch.\u201d NSW Health said nitazenes have been detected in vapes and in fake tablets, such as benzodiazepines, and in drugs thought to be heroin or MDMA. Roberts said it was strongly recommended that anyone who uses illicit drugs carry naloxone. Nitazenes can last longer in the body than oxycodone, heroin and naloxone, meaning higher and repeated doses of naloxone may be required as well as hospital treatment. Teens need better protection from sex offenders: report Teenagers working alongside adults in Australia need to be better protected from sex offenders, a report says. The report into retailers has outlined a plan it hopes will ensure teens are not exposed to workplace predators across the country, AAP reports. The \u2018\u2018Safety Not Guaranteed\u2019 report by the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and non-for-profit McKell Institute has recommended law changes to better protect children. The report found more than 500,000 children aged 17 and under were working across Australia mostly in retail but the majority were not adequately protected by law. It said only South Australia provided proper safeguards, after the state government passed laws in March banning child sex offenders from working with kids. The report has recommended other states and territories follow suit. It has called for legislation to be amended to ban accused and convicted sex offenders from working alongside children. The report also called for bail conditions to be tightened for convicted or accused sex offenders and reforms made to offender registries. The report said requirements for adults working alongside children were not strict in Australia. \u201cMost Australians would be surprised to learn that there are few requirements for adults working alongside children to get \u2018working with children\u2019 checks,\u201d it said. \u201cThis has led to incidences where adults charged, or even convicted, with child sex offences are working alongside children in retail, fast food and hospitality settings.\u201d The report recommended that adults across the nation working alongside children be required to access the checks, in which they are screened for suitability. All states and territories should also ensure eligibility for \u201cworking with children\u201d checks be expanded so that businesses voluntarily seeking them do so without a cost increase to workers. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day\u2019s news. Many thanks for joining me on today\u2019s blog \u2013 we\u2019re nearly at the halfway point of this final sitting week, with two more jam-packed days ahead. But there\u2019s still more to come this evening, so I\u2019ll handover to Mostafa Rachwani to continue bringing you the latest. Take care. Explainer on Victorian government\u2019s overhauled anti-vilification laws Earlier today, Benita Kolovos brought us news the Victorian government had unveiled long-awaited legislation to overhaul the state\u2019s anti-vilification laws. How will they change, and who will they protect? You can read her full explainer below: Gormon says Deloitte outlook \u2018not government\u2019s numbers\u2019 Patrick Gorman was also asked to weigh in on the latest economic outlook from Deloitte \u2013 predicting a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year (see our earlier post). He answered that it\u2019s \u201cnot the government\u2019s numbers\u201d: We understand that people will try and get the jump or guess what the numbers might be or in Deloitte\u2019s case, modelling, but they are not our numbers. Gorman was asked whether the government has given up on increasing the tax rate on higher balanced superannuation accounts \u2013 as was promised a couple of budgets ago? Gorman said he couldn\u2019t \u201ctell you what decision the Senate will make over the next couple of days\u201d. I wish I could. I wish we did not have a system where the opposition parties try to run things down until the last minute or the last hours of the Senate, but that is the system we have and we will see that play out on Wednesday and Thursday. But would you make it a number one item of debate on Wednesday morning? Gorman said \u201cit remains part of our budget plan\u201d but \u201cwe recognise the Australian people have given us a Senate that sometimes uses to prioritise things in different ways, and we have to work within that democratic system\u201d. Labor MP welcomes passage of Help to Buy bill through senate The assistant minister to the PM, Patrick Gorman, is speaking with the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing about the Greens\u2019 concession to help Labor pass its housing bill. Asked if there were more deals to be cut, with a raft of legislation yet to make it through the Senate, he argued that these bills \u201cstand on their own merits\u201d. Of course people are frustrated that it took the Greens in particular so long, so much political gameplay, so many interviews with yourself and others about how they were here and in there and all over the place, finally it is done. As Paul Karp reports, the Help to Buy scheme \u2013 which passed the senate this afternoon \u2013 allows the government to contribute 30% of the purchase price of a home or 40% for a new build for those who earn under the income thresholds of $90,000 for a single applicant, or $120,000 for a couple. The government share reduces the cost for the homebuyer, although it must be paid back upon sale. Temperatures climb towards 40C in parts of Sydney as power supplies remain tight Parts of Sydney have touched the 39C level forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology while sea breezes are so far keeping the CBD and other parts of the city\u2019s east about 10C cooler. Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, chose to give a media conference at Canberra airport just before 2pm (AEST), to reassure the public that electricity suppliers were sufficient. Aemo had acted early to bring on generation capacity that was \u201cpotentially available\u201d and to restore transmission lines, he said. (The latter was mostly to ensure NSW can import a lot of electricity.) Authorities were working to ensure generation remained adequate over the coming days, he said. As it happened, Aemo had issued another lack of reserve level 3 forecast at about noon (AEDT), implying that there was the possibility of \u201cinterruptible loads\u201d now for Thursday at about 3.30pm (AEDT). As with previous LOR3 alerts, the market answered Aemo\u2019s call, and the alert was cancelled at 1.54pm (AEDT) just as Westerman was wrapping up his slightly chaotic media conference (as some questioners phoned in questions he struggled to hear). Still, expect conditions to remain \u201ctight\u201d and hopefully no more of those ageing power units will conk out over the next couple of days. Nationals MP continues to voice concern over social media age ban Nationals MP Keith Pitt has been speaking to Sky News about his concerns regarding Labor\u2019s under-16 social media ban bill. Yesterday, he became the latest to voice hesitation about the bill, joining his colleague Matt Canavan, the Greens and other Senate crossbenchers in alarm at the speed by which the bill is likely to be passed this week. Speaking just now, Pitt told the program: If you can\u2019t actually fine anyone for not taking action [until 2026], then what difference will it make to take a few weeks to look at this in detail \u2013 this is one of the rare occasions I agree with my colleagues in the Senate where this is something that should be looked at more \u2026 My job as a backbencher is to make sure that people are doing this right. It\u2019s not simply to trundle along and agree with everything that\u2019s put before me. His main argument was that teenagers will be able to work around the ban \u2013 along with wanting more time to scrutinise the legislation. Analysis on government\u2019s under-16s social media ban bill In case you missed it amid question time this afternoon, Josh Taylor has written a fantastic piece of analysis on the under-16s social media ban bill \u2013 asking why Labor is so intent on rushing it through? You can have a read of that below: Watch: China\u2019s ambassador to Australia urges closer military ties Earlier today, China\u2019s ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian spoke to reporters in Canberra and suggested Australia should do more to improve military ties with the People\u2019s Liberation Army. We covered his remarks earlier in the blog, and you can now watch some of his remarks below, thanks to our video team: Going back to the under-16s social media ban, opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, says the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. We\u2019ve asked Michelle Rowland\u2019s office for comment but haven\u2019t heard back yet. Coleman told the House of Representatives that the changes would be \u201csignificant improvements\u201d to the bill. Firstly, the legislation will include a specific provision that nothing allows a social media to compel the provision of digital ID or government issued identity documents, such as passports, or drivers licenses. This is an important addition and further strengthens the privacy provisions in the legislation. Coleman said the second amendment was a clear power for the minister to specify steps which are not needed to be taken by social media companies to comply with the legislation \u2013 that is, the minister would be able to tell big tech what not to do in enforcing the age limit. With the use of identification documents now ruled out, supporters of the bill say platforms may look to biometric forms of age assurance, such as facial scanning, to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Coleman said: While the eSafety Commissioner will be responsible for formulating guidelines on what constitutes reasonable steps under the bill, the minister may direct that specific actions are not required in order for the platform to satisfy that reasonable steps test. This is also an important addition, as it allows the Minister to ensure that enforcement of the legislation is always appropriate and proportionate. With that, question time has wrapped up in the House of Representatives. Domestic violence payments The independent MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney, is asking about the crisis payment for women leaving domestic violence \u2013 she said conditions exclude half the women who apply, and the payment is only available if a woman can show she fits the \u201cnarrow criteria\u201d within seven days of leaving. Will the government review the conditions? The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, responded: While legislation requires that that person has seven days from the traumatic event to lodge a claim for crisis payment, there\u2019s flexibility to support people in this circumstance. Services Australia provides an additional 14 days after contact to lodge a claim if they have experienced family and domestic violence. Notwithstanding that, we know as a government too often perpetrators of family domestic violence can exploit and manipulate government systems to control, harass, or threaten a current or former partner. Rishworth said the government would continue to look at the systems \u201cacross the board\u201d on this. Liberal MP Henry Pike has asked another question along the lines of \u2013 how can Australians afford another three years of Labor? (The opposition has been finishing most of their questions with this line today). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded like he did with previous questions \u2013 by listing cost-of-living measures the government is taking, and criticising the opposition for voting against them. Because if things are free, apparently \u2013 according to the Liberal party philosophy \u2013 they\u2019re not valued, which explains why you don\u2019t support Medicare, and never have, why you don\u2019t support public schools, and why you continue to just say what your against and not put anything forward constructively that will help. Just after Jim Chalmers wrapped up answering a dixer, the MP for Herbert Phillip Thompson was sent out under 94a. What is standing order 94a? You can have a read of this explainer for more information. Private health system accountability Independent MP Sophie Scamps has asked whether the government will support the call from the AMA for a private health system authority? She said her community is served by the only public-private partnership hospital in NSW, which recently terminated the contracts of private health insurers they believe are failing to adequately reimburse patients. The health minister, Mark Butler, said the sector had \u201csuffered a price shock from Covid\u201d amid other factors, \u201cwhich impacts the business model of many hospitals and other things as well\u201d. As a result, I asked the secretary of the department to conduct a health check on this sector \u2013 insurers, private hospital operators, [and] the AMA and patient groups were part of that. It was very constructive. I\u2019ve published a version of that health check and asked the secretary to keep that forum going. It [will] discuss short-term options for reform of this sector soon, as well as long-term ideas that include the AMA idea, which they\u2019ve been touting really for some time now, a different regulatory system. Question on food insecurity Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked the PM about growing rates of food insecurity. The minister for social services, Amanda Rishworth, answered by listing measures the government has taken, and said: We will keep looking at all the ways that we can support people with cost of living, whether there\u2019s that\u2019s through emergency relief, food relief but importantly, through the cost-of-living measures, including tax cuts to every single taxpayer \u2013 something those opposite were never going to do. PM says opposition\u2019s figures on insolvency are wrong The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked about the rate of business insolvencies. Anthony Albanese said the figures put forward by Ley \u2013 that more than 25,000 businesses have gone bust since Labor took office \u2013 are wrong. The minutes of the RBA\u2019s monetary policy meeting [on] 24 September, said this \u2013 \u201cThe cumulative level of insolvencies was still below the pre-pandemic trend\u201d. Who was in government pre-pandemic? \u2026 Those opposite. Labor \u2018looking more like Whitlam government every day\u2019: Dutton The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was up next to ask how Australian families and businesses \u201ccan possibly afford another three years of Labor\u201d. He pointed to changes to the Future Fund, and said the Albanese government is \u201clooking more like the Whitlam government every day\u201d. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded echoed earlier sentiments about the state of the economy when his government came to office, and the measures they have taken since. The fact is that the measures that we have introduced have all been opposed by those opposite \u2026 The difference between us and them is that they acknowledge people are under pressure, but want it to be worse. Albanese posed another question: how would any Australian have been better off under those opposite? They have no positive plans whatsoever, just reckless arrogance in their approach to the pressures that Australians are under. \u2018They\u2019re not\u2019: Chris Bowen on why climate emissions are higher Greens MP Stephen Bates was next up to ask a question, asking the PM why climate emissions are higher under his government than when Scott Morrison went to office? The minister for climate change, Chris Bowen, responded that \u201cthey\u2019re not\u201d. That will be evident this week when we release the annual climate change statement, which is world\u2019s best practice when it comes to accountability. Bowen also took aim at the opposition, saying: A government actually setting a clear policy agenda from the beginning, set by the Climate Change Act, supported by the safeguards reforms, supported by the new vehicle efficiency standards, supported by our capacity investment scheme, all of which has been done by this government \u2013 all of which has been opposed by the opposition, who want to stop all that while they wait for their nuclear fantasy to become a reality. Shadow treasurer asks question on latest Deloitte outlook The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question on the economy, pointing to the latest Deloitte outlook and changes to the Future Fund. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded by criticising the opposition\u2019s economic track record: We have a plan for getting wages up. Increases, three of them, for people on the minimum wage. Remember back to the election campaign, Mr Speaker, when I took out that $1 coin and argued that a $1 coin, a $1 increase per hour \u2026 was something that we would support if the Fair Work Commission chose to do so. And those opposite said it would wreck the economy, the sky would fall in if that occurred. While taking a dixer on housing, the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, noted that Labor\u2019s Help to Buy legislation had passed the Senate this afternoon. She said the government appreciates the support of those who voted in favour of the bill, \u201cincluding the Australian Greens\u201d. I\u2019ve had a little bit of constructive criticism to offer the Greens in recent days, speaker, but let\u2019s all agree, speaker, that at least the Greens are showing a modicum of interest in housing policy in this country. O\u2019Neil said she had made \u201ca number of attempts\u201d to brief the shadow housing minister on \u201cthe policy offerings we\u2019ve brought before this parliament\u201d. It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t find the time to come to the briefings, speaker. He won\u2019t even respond to our requests for a discussion. After a condolence motion for former Liberal minister John Hodges, question time has begun in the House of Representatives. First up is the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, asking about the latest financial outlook (from a Deloitte report, see earlier post). The prime minister said the government came to office \u201cwith a number of challenges that we were facing\u201d \u2013 economic uncertainty, inflation and energy prices. He then listed a number of measures the government is taking, saying \u201cthey were all opposed by those opposite\u201d. So certainly things, if they had\u2019ve had their way, this reckless and arrogant opposition, things would have been worse. Just circling back to some comments Michael Sukkar made at the National Press Club, when asked if the Coalition would repeal Help to Buy if elected to government \u2013 noting this has just passed the senate. Sukkar backed repeal, and said: They\u2019re terrible policies which is why we are in many respects, we\u2019re unsurprised but dismayed that the Greens are now supporting it. On Build to Rent - the Greens have sold out ... they\u2019ll vote with Labor to give preferential tax treatment to foreign corporates to own housing stock in this country for build to rent developments. We don\u2019t think that the most beneficial tax arrangements for housing in this country should be the province of foreign fund managers ...As for the shared equity scheme, the fiddling while Rome burns, quite frankly, these schemes have been rejected by Australians and at a cost of $5.5bn - I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. Greens defer bid to dump Senate anti-abortion bill A Greens motion urging the Senate to discharge a controversial anti-abortion bill is being deferred until February, as the party focuses on negotiations with the government on a raft of stalled legislation in the final parliamentary week. Last week, Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters notified the Senate that she would move a motion today seeking to have the bill discharged. But Guardian Australia has been told the Greens have now opted to defer the motion until the parliament\u2019s next sitting. The Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic that would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. It has been on the Senate notice paper for two years. But after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election, the Greens want the Senate to formally vote to remove the bill \u2013 something that would probably expose a split in the Coalition and possibly also Labor senators on what has traditionally been a conscience issue in the major parties. As expected, Labor\u2019s housing bill has passed the Senate this afternoon, about 20 minutes ago. This comes after the Greens backed down on its concessions yesterday, and said it would help pass the legislation: Question time about to begin Question time is beginning in the House of Representatives in about five minutes. Grab a coffee, and get ready \u2013 we\u2019ll bring you all the key moments here on the blog. Cash says Dreyfus\u2019 actions raise questions about independence of INSLM office Continuing from our last post, the shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash has told Guardian Australia that Mark Dreyfus\u2019 actions raised questions about the independence of the INSLM office: The Attorney-General has extremely serious questions to answer. Mr Blight has confirmed that this alleged \u201cambiguity\u201d was raised by the attorney\u2019s office, and at one point was raised by the Attorney himself. To be clear, the \u201cambiguity\u201d in question was a direct criticism of Mr Dreyfus. What did the Attorney think would happen? Does he seriously expect Australians to believe that he spoke to Mr Blight, pointed out the ambiguity, but expected nothing to happen? The Attorney needs to explain how this is a proper use of his power as Attorney-General. Mr Blight\u2019s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC, who wrote the report, has been crystal clear that his report didn\u2019t need \u201cclarification\u201d. What Attorney Dreyfus has done through his conduct is call into question whether our independent national security legislation monitor is truly independent. He needs to explain himself immediately. Opposition demands attorney general explain private talks with security watchdog The opposition is demanding the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, explain a private discussion he had with Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) Jake Blight before Blight published a clarification to an old annual report that had criticised Dreyfus. As reported by Guardian Australia, Blight has confirmed that Dreyfus and one of his advisers separately raised concerns with him about what they argued was \u201cambiguity\u201d in the watchdog agency\u2019s 2022-23 annual report, which was produced by Blight\u2019s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC. Blight has said he was neither asked nor directed to publish a clarification but that he decided to do so of his own accord. The clarification appeared in the 2023-24 annual report, published last month. Donaldson\u2019s annual report contained criticisms of the federal government for failing to produce evidence in 2020 that was material to a court application by convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika opposing being subjected to a continuing detention order after his 20-year jail term ended in 2020. Donaldson discovered the evidence and made its existence public in 2022, prompting Benbrika to make another application \u2013 which ultimately succeeded. Donaldson\u2019s annual report criticised the Department of Home Affairs for not providing the evidence to either Benbrika or the court in 2020 and the current attorney general, who inherited responsibility for the case after the 2022 federal election, for the fact that it was then only provided in full after a court order. It did not specifically mention the minister who had been responsible for home affairs at the time the evidence was first withheld, Peter Dutton. Donaldson said Dreyfus\u2019s staff had raised \u201cambiguity\u201d concerns with him before he finished his term as INSLM last year and that he had refused to change the report. We\u2019ll bring you more on this in a moment. Greens won\u2019t join race to \u2018demonise migrants\u2019 At the National Press Club, Max Chandler-Mather said the Greens wouldn\u2019t participate in a \u201crace to the bottom on who can demonise migrants more\u201d, between the Liberals and Labor. Why is it every time there\u2019s a crisis, that the rich and powerful in the major parties \u2013 backed by their big corporate donors \u2013 facilitate a debate in a race to the bottom in going after migrants? The Greens will not participate in that. We just won\u2019t. The real solution to this is taking on those big corporations who are getting away with paying no tax, taking on those property investors and phasing out those tax handouts and getting back to a more fair and equitable system\u2026 He and Michael Sukkar just made their closing remarks, and the debate has wrapped up. Guardian asks Greens about their track record on housing supply Our own Paul Karp has asked about the Greens and Liberals track record on supply, and what commitment could they both give that at every level \u2013 federal, state and local \u2013 that their parties will be part of the solution and break their addiction to nimby votes? Max Chandler-Mather answered first, and said: I have been asked personally one time about what I thought about a social housing development in my electorate, and I wrote a letter supporting it. When we have written submissions on developments, our primary criticism is that a portion of that development is not being provided as social or affordable housing. Michael Sukkar responded next, and turned the lens on Labor instead: I would challenge you in one aspect \u2013 don\u2019t give Labor state governments a leave pass for belatedly now trying to come up with solutions to a problem they created. He said many Australians living in the suburbs are very happy with some form of density, but \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be demonised for wanting to retain the essential character of the communities that they live in.\u201d Max Chandler-Mather was asked why he hasn\u2019t bought a home yet, and is still a renter, despite his earnings as an MP? He said he had a small, single-income family and gives up about $50,000 from his annual salary to fund a free meal program in his electorate: Because of that, giving up that money, and being on a single income and in an inner-city electorate with a very, very high median house price, it is actually sort of difficult at the moment to buy a house there. I want to be clear, though, I am not the one doing it tough \u2013 but I\u2019m answering your question. Chandler-Mather says he doesn\u2019t want to be a minister, prefers the crossbench Back at the National Press Club, the Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said he wouldn\u2019t be defending Labor\u2019s housing legislation \u2013 \u201cand it is disappointing that the Labor housing minister isn\u2019t here to defend them\u201d. We\u2019re not like the Liberals. We\u2019re not just going to destroy, cut and block, and destroy any hope of actually fixing this housing crisis. We are trying to build public consensus for a large-scale action on this housing crisis. It has been our goal for the last few years, and indeed, for the entirety of the existence of the Greens. And I think that we\u2019ve got some of the way there. Chandler-Mather was asked whether he would want to be a minister in a future minority government \u2013 noting Nick McKim was a minister in a Labor-Greens agreement in Tasmania. He responded: I think that personally, I would prefer to be on the crossbench and deciding on good pieces of legislation and pushing further after the next election. Dutton boosts Coalition MPs in final partyroom address Peter Dutton has told Coalition MPs that the Liberal and National parties are finishing the political year strongly, using his address to the final joint parties meeting for 2024 to rev them up ahead of an election year. Reminding them to focus on their electorates \u2013 citing the work of long-serving retiring MPs as an example \u2013 Dutton criticised the government\u2019s priorities. The government is faltering and taking decisions that are making it even, even harder for families people believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction, but they also understand that if you get the economics right, you support families, and if you focus on what matters, that the country can get back on track. But you can only imagine what would happen under the chaos of a Greens Labor coalition. His deputy, Sussan Ley, urged MPs to maintain the \u201cunity and discipline\u201d over the summer, and determination to get things done, that they had shown in the past. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared that the next few days \u201cindeed, the next few months\u201d would determine the election result and when people\u2019s credit card bills came rolling in around February, they should be reminded the pressure they felt was homegrown and \u201cit wasn\u2019t Vladimir Putin who created that problem\u201d. The meeting was dominated by a lengthy debate on the government\u2019s legislation to introduce a minimum age for social media use. The electoral reform bill, which the Coalition is supporting, was not discussed. Shadow housing minister says Liberals \u2018unashamedly oppose\u2019 Labor\u2019s housing measures A reporter asked Michael Sukkar if the Coalition would repeal the Help to Buy and Help to Rent bills? He argued \u201cthese schemes have been rejected by Australians\u201d, and said: I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. You don\u2019t give any credit to the Labor party for coming up with new ideas \u2013 just like the housing minister couldn\u2019t show up today to explain herself and the Labor party position. They have no ideas, no new policies \u2026 and that\u2019s why we unashamedly oppose both of those measures, and will not do what the Greens have done, which is go back on all of the arguments and critiques [they made]. Sukkar and Chandler-Mather on how they would address labour shortage A reporter asked both Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Mather how they plan to address the labour shortage \u2013 with the former wanting to slash migration, and the latter wanting to build a large amount of public housing. Chandler-Mather pointed to the Greens\u2019 push for a government-owned developer, which he said would signal to the construction industry how many homes need to be built. You can plan how many construction workers we need in that area and that area. The federal government used to employ architects and town planners and project managers in a genuine federal Housing Department, which is what we\u2019re planning to establish. And Sukkar, responding to the question, said \u201cthe truth is that we need to rebalance our migration program\u201d. Yes, we need less migrants, fewer migration from the rorted levels we\u2019re at. By no means is the Coalition suggesting that we won\u2019t have a healthy migration program, but it won\u2019t be the reckless migration we\u2019ve seen in recent years. Sukkar said \u201cyou don\u2019t improve housing in this country by bringing in more yoga or fitness instructors\u201d and argued that in this financial year alone only nine bricklayers were brought in. Shadow housing minister: \u2018We\u2019ll build more homes than Labor\u2019 Labor has said that it has a target to build 1.2m new homes by the end of the decade \u2013 will the Coalition recommit to this goal if re-elected? At the National Press Club, shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar said that \u201cwe\u2019ll build more homes than Labor\u201d. It\u2019s almost industry consensus now that not only will Labor not meet their 1.2m homes \u2026 they won\u2019t get close, they\u2019ll miss it by more than 400,000 homes. Around 800,000 homes is what the industry expects will be built based on the current trajectory, and may I add, that trajectory is still getting worse. So it could even be worse than 800,000. Some Coalition members may vote against the under-16s social media ban when it is voted on in parliament, with some 20 opposition members debating the online legislation in a marathon partyroom meeting this morning. The opposition \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d backed the bill, according to a party room spokesperson, but it\u2019s understood a small handful spoke against it. Guardian Australia revealed recently that Matt Canavan and Keith Pitt, the Queensland Nationals members, had strong reservations about privacy elements of the bill. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, spoke strongly for the bill, praising the campaigning of communications spokesperson David Coleman for pushing the issue as far as it has gone. The party room spokesperson said Dutton had negotiated \u201cconcessions\u201d on the legislation, including an amendment to the legislation that would ensure there is no compulsion for people to hand over any form of government ID to social media platforms to verify their age. That\u2019s understood to include drivers licenses and passports. About 19 Coalition members spoke in favour of the bill, but \u201ctwo or three\u201d spoke against it. At least one told the meeting they would vote against the legislation, while two others reserved their right to potentially vote against it. Chandler-Mather criticises Liberals for focus on migration amid housing debate Max Chandler-Mather has accused the Liberals of bringing up migration in the housing debate to \u201cdistract\u201d from the fact the \u201creal winners\u201d are large property investors and the banks. He told the National Press Club: Of course the Liberals bring up migrants. Of course they do, because it is such a useful tool for them to distract from the fact that the real winners out of the housing crisis \u2013 the ones really hurting people right now \u2013 are the large property investors and the bank, and the property industry who benefit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. The Liberals were in power for nine years. What did they do? Give tax handouts to property investors, build less public housing than any government in Australian history since World War II, help to screw over renters. It is genuinely remarkable that the Liberals won\u2019t take any responsibility for this housing crisis. It hardly gives me any confidence that they are going to be able to fix it. Shadow housing minister accuses Labor and Greens of being in a coalition The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has weighed in on the Greens\u2019 capitulation to help pass Labor\u2019s Help to Buy legislation, and said: The theatre of the Greens and Labor fighting in the parliament really betrays the truth, which is Labor and the Greens are in an unholy alliance \u2013 a Coalition. On housing, the government has repeatedly accused the Greens of working with the Coalition and Peter Dutton. Max Chandler-Mather addresses housing debate at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has wrapped up his opening remarks, and now the Greens\u2019 Max Chandler-Mather is up. He has told the National Press Club that \u201cthe barrier to fixing this housing crisis is not economic, it\u2019s not technical \u2013 it\u2019s political\u201d. He argued Australia\u2019s political system \u201chas been corrupted by the power of the banking and property industry\u201d, and said Labor and the Liberals \u201cpursue policies that either push up house prices or give more money to property developers.\u201d Chandler-Mather said today\u2019s housing crisis can be linked to two changes in the 1990s \u2013 cuts to funding for public housing, and the introduction of capital gains tax by John Howard. Over the next 10 years, the Australian government will give property investors $176bn in tax handouts in the form of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. The housing crisis we find ourselves in right now is enormous but we can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. He is outlining measures the Greens would push for, including: Phasing out tax handouts such as negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, and using the money to create a government-owned property developer Develop new national tenancy standards, including long-term caps on rent increases A national renter\u2019s protection authority to enforce the tenancy standards and issue fines to those who break the law Housing debate begins at National Press Club At the National Press Club in Canberra, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens\u2019 housing and homelessness spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, are about to begin a debate. Club director Andrew Probyn told the crowd that the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, was also asked to appear but declined. Paul Karp flagged some details of what Sukkar will say, which you can read earlier in the blog here. We\u2019ll bring you the key takeaways as the debate gets under way. Electricity strains \u2018manageable\u2019 but risks remain as mercury soars, Aemo says As we flagged last week, the arrival of sustained days of heat for eastern Australia (especially around Sydney) had authorities scrambling to make sure electricity supplies would suffice. The Australian Energy Market Operator has followed its usual procedure of sending out alerts and seeking a market response. What was unusual was the series of so-called level 3 lack of reserve notes for NSW, which implied the potential for blackouts if generators didn\u2019t respond. (Cue some scary headlines.) Anyway, Aemo has issued a statement lately stating that \u201cbased on current forecast conditions\u201d, they reckon reserves \u201care manageable\u201d in NSW today despite the mercury climbing. (Parts of western Sydney are nudging 35C just now.) Still, Aemo doesn\u2019t want to imply complacency: [Ongoing] heatwave conditions combined with significant generation outages in NSW tomorrow and Thursday remain a risk. Additional measures may be necessary if supply forecasts worsen due to unexpected generation or transmission outages, or if demand rises beyond current expectations. Nobody is being asked to reduce consumption \u2013 but for the sake of the planet (and our pockets) \u2013 why waste energy? Meanwhile, for Queensland \u201ccurrently reserves are forecast to be manageable for tomorrow and Thursday\u201d. Shorten said he thinks federal election is \u2018winnable\u2019 for Labor Bill Shorten also spoke about this morning\u2019s caucus meeting, which will be his last \u2013 as he retired from politics next year to take up the role of vice chancellor at the University of Canberra. He told Sky News he has attended about 400 in his 17 years in politics. You know, they have on the wall pictures of all the former leaders. And I said, the only way that someone gets to have their picture on the wall is because of the faces in the room. And the Labor party, what it has, when \u2026 all the chips are down, is we have to learn to stick together. Shorten said he thinks the election is \u201cwinnable\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s a contest.\u201d What we think about when we get up in the morning as the government is \u2018how do we help everyday Aussies?\u2019. I think the opposition hasn\u2019t done enough homework on their policy other than that sort of bizarre Soviet Union nuclear policy. Shorten lashes Greens over housing debacle Bill Shorten was also asked about the Greens\u2019 backdown on its housing concessions \u2013 a rent freeze and negative gearing changes \u2013 to help pass Labor\u2019s Help to Buy bill. The Greens\u2019 leader, Adam Bandt, said earlier (see post) the party would wave Labor\u2019s housing bills through and return to its fight at the next election. Speaking to Sky News, Shorten said he was pleased the bill was passed with a bit of \u201cmomentum\u201d during the last week of parliament this year. The Greens have really, in my opinion, lost the plot. They have just been oppositionalist, and they\u2019ve made the perfect the enemy of the good. I think the Greens think that, if they can sabotage Labor, then they can harvest our vote and say, \u2018we should be the only really fair dinkum people because we\u2019re so pure\u2019. He argued the Greens\u2019 \u201copposition mentality\u201d was \u201cturning people off\u201d. Shorten says path to make NDIS long-term is \u2018making sure we\u2019re paying for outcomes\u2019 The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has been speaking to Sky News about the NDIS. Speaking about art and music therapy funded through the scheme, he said \u201cwe are asking for some outcome for the dollars\u201d. The path to making the scheme long term is to make sure that we\u2019re paying for outcomes \u2026 What we want to do is focus on the participant. So this is a classic example. I like music therapy, I\u2019ve seen it work where it demonstrates \u2026 it\u2019s maintaining or improving highly disabled people\u2019s functional capability. Great, keep charging. But if it\u2019s something more as an activity, you can still charge at $68 bucks an hour, and if you\u2019re getting four people in your class doing music or doing painting, $193 bucks, which is, I think, reasonable. Queensland opposition leader makes impassioned plea to government over truth-telling inquiry The Queensland opposition leader, Steven Miles, has made an impassioned plea to the government not to cancel the state\u2019s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry. Most of the Labor frontbench attended a rally outside parliament, for the first sitting day of the new government. Miles said the government was \u201crefusing to listen\u201d by ending the inquiry. I think that is a real shame. But the commitment I make to you, though, is that if you succeed, if you get your meeting, if you change his mind, if the truth-telling inquiry continues, then there will be nothing but praise from us. We will not criticise him [Crisafulli]. In fact, we will welcome it, because the truth is more important than politics and more important than point-scoring. The shadow minister for Closing the Gap and reconciliation, Leanne Enoch, also spoke at the rally and said: There is nothing to be afraid of in telling the truth. What is there to be afraid of? The data, the history, the evidence? There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. Truth-telling has happened all over the world, all over the world. Why can\u2019t it happen here? Why can\u2019t it happen here? The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, dismissed the protests this morning: There might be 150 protesters, but 5 million Queenslanders passed a vote on the 26th of October for the government to scrap [the path to a] treaty, and we have a mandate, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. He said the government could introduce repeal legislation as early as this week. LinkedIn tells parliamentary committee it is not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use it If you\u2019re a social media platform trying to avoid having to verify the ages of your users, you might consider trying what LinkedIn has told a parliamentary committee: we\u2019re not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use us. A few people on social media noticed a couple of months ago that one of the campaigns calling for the ban for under-16s had included the LinkedIn logo among the usual suspects of social media sites as an odd addition. LinkedIn has now told the parliament that it is definitely not a site teenagers want to use as it is \u201centirely professional\u201d and \u201cnot popular with minors\u201d. Additionally, LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors. As noted above, it is entirely professionally focused, providing members the ability to connect and engage on topics relevant to the world of work. Unsurprisingly, therefore, LinkedIn does not direct or market any of its products or features toward minors \u2013 including the 16 and 17-year-olds that are technically permitted on the platform \u2013 through content, design, marketing, or advertising. Human Rights Law Centre says under-16 social media ban bill raises constitutional concerns The Australian Human Rights Law Centre has said the bill to ban social media for under-16s raises constitutional concerns. In a submission, the centre says while not having sufficient time to fully consider the potential constitutional implications, \u201con its face, the bill burdens the implied freedom of political communication protected by the Australian constitution.\u201d It imposes a blanket prohibition on those under 16 from accessing various social media platforms. In the modern era, social media platforms are one of the primary tools for political communication. It is likely to also burden the ability of all people in Australia to communicate, by potentially requiring any user of a social media platform to undertake age verification. Those over 16 may have legitimate reasons for being concerned about consenting to age verification. There are real questions about whether such a burden is proportionate to the purpose of protecting children from online harm. We would encourage the committee to seek further input regarding the constitutional validity of the Bill. The centre is one of many of the submissions to the inquiry recommending against the bill being passed in its current form. Elon Musk\u2019s X also yesterday said there were questions around the lawfulness of the bill. More information on Victorian anti-vilification bill Just circling back to the earlier news that Victorian Labor would introduce an anti-vilification bill to the state parliament today: The state attorney general Jaclyn Symes says the bill retains current exceptions in the law that protect activities done for genuine religious, academic, artistic, public interest or scientific reasons. It also protects people \u201cgenuine and legitimate religious activities, such as worshipping, practising, proselytising and teaching religion\u201d. She said: We want to make it clear that what you believe \u2026 what you what your religion stands for, is unaffected by this bill. It can\u2019t be used as a cloak for unabated abuse. But in relation to what people believe, what they talk about, what they teach. Religion is important. Your ability to practice your religion free of hate is protected in this bill. The bill also introduces a new \u201cpolitical expression\u201d defence for the criminal incitement offence, to protect political communication. Greens still negotiating with government over Nature Positive environmental legislation On the issue of legislation still stalled in the Senate, and as the clock is ticking on the end of the parliamentary year, the Greens are still negotiating with the government over its Nature Positive environmental legislation after dropping their demand that climate impact be included among the assessments for development projects. The Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, had talks with minister Tanya Plibersek yesterday but they have not yet reached a compromise. It is likely there will be further talks today as the government seeks to clear its legislative logjam. Australia and China have \u2018interdependent\u2019 economies: Chinese ambassador Back at his press conference, the Chinese ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian has described the economies of each country as \u201cinterdependent\u201d. He said: We are two big economies. We are so much \u2013 let me use the word \u2013 interdependent. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a negative word. The Chinese and Australian economies are strongly connected with each other. Our two economies are interwoven with each other. In a certain sense \u2026 we are interdependent with each other. China is the major importer from Australia, and Australia relies on China as its biggest market. And no other country can single-handedly take the place of China in this respect. And we do not see any other country can take the place of Australia. So we have confidence that, as we manage our relationship, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship. Labor has held its last caucus meeting for the parliamentary year. Anthony Albanese thanked a number of MPs and senators: Michelle Ananda-Rajah, whose seat of Higgins is being abolished but is contesting the Senate at the number 3 spot; senator Anne Urquhart, who is contesting the lower house seat of Braddon; Brian Mitchell, who stood aside to let former Tasmanian opposition leader Rebecca White run in Lyons; and Catryna Bilyk, who is retiring. Albanese noted the Greens had changed their position on Labor\u2019s housing bills, saying their party had \u201cfolded in on itself\u201d and this is \u201chopefully the first of many\u201d bills to be passed this week. He took aim at Peter Dutton, for opposing government bills to prevent privatisation of the NBN, introduce a power to cap student numbers, and extend free Tafe. The prime minister said he would leave \u201cnothing on the field\u201d when it came to ensuring Labor stayed in majority government after the next election. On the social media age ban, communications minister Michelle Rowland said it was important to know that social media companies cannot compel people to hand over their ID. She noted while it is good that opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is on board it was concerning that their party room was split. A long list of legislation was approved: on authorising surcharges charged by commonwealth entities; the Future Made in Australia production tax credits; and the migration prohibited items bill. Chinese ambassador: \u2018No reason for us to compromise our respective national interests\u2019 Does Xiao Qian have any concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s election in the US will alter or undermine the stabilised Australia-China relationship? He responded that \u201cthere is no reason for us to compromise our respective national interests for the sake of a third party.\u201d We are responsible for our own people, the Australian government is responsible for Australian people. We have common ground and this has been the foundation for a good relationship over the decades, bringing so many benefits to our two countries and peoples and there are reasons to responsibly manage our relationship bilaterally so our people can benefit. On the US, as he mentioned a moment ago, the ambassador said \u201cwe are still in a transition period \u2026 so perhaps we need to be a little patient until the new administration comes into office \u2026 to see what bilaterally we can do between China and the US\u201d. Ambassador says China respects \u2018the choice of the American people\u2019 Xiao Qian was asked about the incoming Donald Trump administration, and how this may impact trade. He said China \u201crespect[s] the choice of the American people\u201d, and the relationship between China and the US \u201cis now in transition\u201d, with Biden and Xi meting on the sidelines of Apec. Bilaterally, as ambassador in Australia, what I can say at this moment is I expect China and the United States to engage with each other to talk about each other\u2019s policies on how to manage our relationship \u2026 at the proper time for them when the new administration comes into office in January. Asked about the Australia-China relationship, Xiao Qian said \u201cwe are in a very good shape \u2013 also at a very critical period of time\u201d. We experienced a difficult time for several years until two years ago and since then we have been successfully changing that situation. The year of 2022 was a year of stabilisation. President Xi [Jinping] met with prime minister Anthony Albanese, they agreed to define the relationship \u2026 And the year of 2023 was a year of immense improvement, a lot of bilateral meetings \u2026 dialogues and consultations. That year was highlighted by prime minister Albanese\u2019s visit to China. He said that 2024 has been a year of \u201cconsolidation\u201d and \u201csymbolised a complete turnaround of the relationship\u201d. With efforts from both sides we have successfully turned around the relationship through the two years \u2026 Looking forward into the future, we are expecting \u2013 at least I am expecting \u2013 a move beyond stabilisation, moving further into development because we have so many areas that we share, contributing to the fundamental interests of our two countries. Chinese ambassador calls for Australia to support \u2018One China\u2019 policy The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has been speaking to reporters at the Chinese embassy in Canberra. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a province of China \u2026 I hope the Australian side would respect China\u2019s sovereignty and practice its commitment of the One China policy in words and deeds, and to support openly the peaceful reunification of China. Rabbi welcomes new anti-vilification laws in Victoria Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann has welcomed the laws, describing today as a \u201cgreat day for all Victorians\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you wear a kippa or a hijab, if someone vilifies you, if someone wants to go after you, your faith, your background, your belief, your sexuality, the chances are that they will be charged and go to jail or be heavily fined. We all become safer. Sadly, what we have seen on the streets the CBD and around Victoria is people feeling emboldened lately to go after minority groups to go after Jews, to go after people from the Islamic community, members of the LGBTQI+ community, people with a disability \u2013 they feel that they can get away with vilifying bigotry, racism, all types of phobias. Today the Allan government says enough is enough. He is urging other religious leaders to support the reforms, and said: There\u2019s been a little bit of chatter about the religious community. I\u2019m an orthodox rabbi. I teach the Hebrew Bible scripture. I know the different nuances within it, but I also know that as a religious person, someone with fundamental beliefs, that we are all equal in the eyes of God. We all created in the image of God, and that means honouring, respecting people, of people, religion, beliefs, sexualities and the like. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, says the bill has been years in the making, and that she\u2019s undergone significant consultation with the community over two years: These laws are for the Muslim woman who told me she was scared to get on public transport because she was wearing hijab \u2026 These laws are for the parents of Jewish kids, who are not allowed to come into the CBD anymore because they are scared that when they wearing their uniform or they have a Star of David necklace or a kippa on, because their parents are scared they attacked because of the rising antisemitism. These laws for the young man who told me, because he\u2019s queer, he has to take time out from school because he\u2019s viciously bullied because of who he is and what he looks like. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that will be introduced to parliament today. There are plenty of details in the bill, but the main element will be to expand the state\u2019s existing legal protections against vilification \u2013 which currently only cover race and religion \u2013 to cover disability, gender identity, sex and sexual orientation. It also protects people with a personal association with a person who has a protected attribute, such as being the parent of a disabled child. The bill will also create two criminal offences to be contained in the Crimes Act, to respond to serious vilification: It will be an offence to incite hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group based on their protected attribute. It will be an offence to threaten physical harm or property damage against a person or a group based on their protected attribute. They will apply when incitement or threats occur in Victoria in any context \u2013 private, public or online. Party room meetings taking place Party room meetings have been taking place this morning in Parliament House. They are held every Tuesday during sitting weeks, and with so much legislation left to address and only three sitting days left, they could prove quite important. There\u2019s an off-the-record briefing after each party room meeting, and my colleagues here in Canberra will bring us the key takeaways as we learn more. Circling back to news that the Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O\u2019Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight: O\u2019Brien is holding a press conference at state parliament after being selected as Victoria Nationals leader, saying the party would retain \u201cour laser-like focus on the interests of rural and regional Victoria going forward.\u201d Particularly at the moment when we\u2019ve got a terrible government that is very city centric and focused on the urban areas, at the expense of rural and regional Victoria. After the 2022 election, O\u2019Brien said his party should review its agreement with the Liberals. But today, he said the Coalition was strong: The Coalition remains very strong and will continue to remain very strong under my leadership. John Pesutto is doing a fantastic job in turning around the fortunes of the opposition and making sure that come 2026 that Victorians will have a strong alternative to the current terrible Labor government. And I\u2019m very pleased and very strongly committed to ensuring that that Coalition continues to ensure that we get rid of this very bad Labor government. Asked what would happen to the agreement if the Liberals decide to dump Pesutto as Liberal leader, O\u2019Brien dismissed the question as a hypothetical. He confirmed his predecessor, Peter Walsh, will step down from his shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs but said the party\u2019s position on treaty wouldn\u2019t change. O\u2019Brien said there would be a shuffle of portfolios shortly, with upper house MP Melina Bath to be elevated to shadow cabinet. It\u2019s just the first sitting day of Queensland\u2019s new Liberal National government. But as new MPs are sworn in inside the parliament building, hundreds of protestors have rallied outside. Signs demand the government abandon its plans to repeal a plan to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous Queenslanders and end an inquiry into colonialism. One sign reads: What are you afraid of? The truth? Most of the frontbench of the Labor opposition is attending, including opposition leader Steven Miles. Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Green to debate housing at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, will debate at the National Press Club today. And it might actually be a debate now the Greens have decided to pass Labor\u2019s housing bills (which the Coalition oppose). In an advance copy of Sukkar\u2019s speech, the shadow minister is long on the problems in the housing market but a bit shorter on the solutions. On the problems, he says: First home buyer loans have plummeted from 171,218 in 2020\u201321 under the Coalition to just 108,599 in 2022\u201323. Home completions dropped to 177,185 last year\u201440,000 fewer than the 216,707 under the Coalition in 2016\u201317. Approvals for new homes have also crashed, falling to 167,287 over the past year, compared to 233,247 when the Coalition was in government. Meanwhile, national median rents have skyrocketed by 23%, reaching $632 per week from $512 in May 2022. Labor\u2019s promise to build 1.2m homes over five years will never see the light of day, with industry experts predicting a shortfall of over 400,000 homes. On solutions, Sukkar promises: a \u201ca comprehensive package\u201d to tackle barriers to getting a loan to \u201cmake homeownership more achievable for all Australians\u201d; a $5bn fund for enabling infrastructure; and a freeze on changes to the national construction code. He will conclude: Australians can continue to expect a Coalition government will be singularly focussed on home ownership. We are the only party that still believes in the Australian Dream, which is why the individual, not the institution, is the centre of our focus. We are the only party fighting for the Dream because home ownership has always been a Liberal value and something Labor has never signed up to. Australians deserve action, not spin, and housing - without a doubt - will be a defining issue at the next election. \u2018Silent majority\u2019 of Australian farmers found to support renewable energy transition Seventy per cent of regional Australians in renewable energy zones support the development of renewable energy projects on local farmland, a new survey has found. The survey, conducted for lobby group Farmers for Climate Action, found that support for renewable energy developments increased to 73% for people connected to the farming industry, but was conditional on concerns around consultation, project design and decommissioning being met. Just 17% of respondents said they opposed renewable energy developments, with 8% strongly opposed. For more details on the survey, you can read our full report below: Human Rights Commission to launch its anti-racism framework today This evening, the Australian Human Rights Commission will launch what it\u2019s calling \u201cthe most comprehensive plan ever for addressing racism\u201d in Australia. The anti-racism framework will \u201cprovide a roadmap for governments, business and community organisations to eliminate racism in Australia in all its forms\u201d, it said in a statement. The framework has been developed with funding from the Australian government, and will be launched by Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman in Western Sydney this evening. University vice-chancellors face pay scrutiny The Australian is reporting that university vice-chancellors could have their pay pegged to other public servants\u2019. That would no doubt be music to the ears of struggling students and the National Tertiary Education Union, but sadly the effect of upcoming governance reforms might have been slightly overstated. In April, education ministers agreed to set up an expert governance council for universities. One of its 10 priorities is to: Demonstrate and maintain a rigorous and transparent process for developing remuneration policies and settings for senior university staff, with consideration given to comparable scale and complexity public sector entities, and ensure remuneration policies and packages are publicly reported. As far as we can tell this might mean that there is more scrutiny on pay, but as long as universities have policies, consider the relativity of pay and are transparent in the way pay is set, they are largely free to continue giving generous remuneration. Nevertheless, perhaps modest pay could catch on. After all, the Western Sydney University vice-chancellor George Williams took a 20-25% pay cut relative to his predecessor and government services minister, Bill Shorten, has asked to be paid less than $1m when he starts his new gig at the University of Canberra. Victorian gaming minister outlines changes to state\u2019s poker machine rules The Victorian gaming minister, Melissa Horne, has just run through the changes she will be introducing to parliament today to set up mandatory carded play on poker machines. Speaking outside parliament, she said $3bn was lost by Victorians every year through poker machines: But at the same time, we\u2019ve got less than 10% of the population playing poker machines. This is less people than ever before but they\u2019re losing more than ever before. And where people are losing the most money is in our lowest socio economic areas. So there\u2019s something wrong. Horne said carded play will begin with a pilot at 40 pubs and clubs across the state in the middle of next year, before it is rolled out in 2026. She says it will become mandatory across all venues by 2027. So next year, it\u2019s about doing the pilot and then evaluating the technology. Because unlike Crown casino, which is a single venue that\u2019s got the same technology, we\u2019ve got more than 500 different venues across the state, and the technology varies from machine to machine. We\u2019re making sure that we get that technology piece right so that it\u2019s easy for people to sign up to \u2013 that\u2019s really important. But it\u2019s the pilot next year then over 2026 is rolling out the card at play then this mandatory by 2027 which lines up with the new monitoring licence. The Australian Human Rights Commission has said the bill to ban under-16s from social media should not pass in its current form. The commission said while there are online harms and social media can have a negative impact, it provides opportunities for children and young people to access criticall potentially life-saving information and to share ideas and opinions. Social media also offers children and young people opportunities for inclusion and participation that are particularly important for children and young people from marginalised, vulnerable or remote communities, including children with complex needs and disability. The ban would have unintended consequences and negative human rights impacts, the commission said, not just for children and young people but the broader Australian community. Given the importance of this issue, the risks around negatively impacting children and young people\u2019s rights and the unreasonable timeframes for analysing and commenting on the bill, the bill should not be passed in its current form. SQM Research has released its annual housing update that says Sydney and Melbourne housing prices are likely to continue to record moderate price falls of between -1% and -5%. The base forecast for average national dwelling prices is expected to rise between +1% to +4%. Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin are expected to outperform the national housing market, it found, with Perth forecast to record the fastest dwelling price rises of between 14% to 19%. Meanwhile, Canberra is due to record the largest falls in dwelling prices of between -6% to -2%. SQM Research is also forecasting an interest rate cut between 0.25% and 0.50% over mid 2025 \u2013 which it says would \u201cimmediately stimulate homebuyer demand across the country [and] limit the year-on-year dwelling prices falls recorded for our two largest capital cities.\u201d Louis Christopher, the managing director of SQM Research, said: To be sure, our two largest capital cities, along with Canberra and Hobart will start 2025 off in the red. Indeed, we are currently recording dwelling price falls in each of these cities \u2026 However, once interest rate cuts do occur, we are expecting a speedy bounce in demand for Sydney and Melbourne in particular, which both are still experiencing underlying housing shortage relative to the strong population growth rates \u2026 However, if I am wrong and rate cuts do not occur in 2025, it is unlikely a recovery will occur in Sydney and Melbourne at any time next year. Previous coverage on the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women There\u2019s been a fair bit of talk this morning about the government\u2019s response to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. Our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, has covered this inquiry extensively over the past three years. In August, when the inquiry\u2019s report was handed down, she spoke with the Full Story podcast about the need for reform: And you can have a read of all our previous articles on this topic here. The sports minister, Anika Wells, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning about gambling reform. (You can read her earlier comments to ABC RN about this, here). Wells was asked why the government has acted so quickly on the under-16 social media ban, but not on gambling reform? She responded: The social media ban is about trying to protect kids as quickly as we can, and also to give parents the tools to empower them in conversations. It\u2019s a lot easier to say to your kids, \u2018The government has said that they can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re safe online, that\u2019s why you and your friends are not allowed to go on the platforms anymore.\u2019 Gambling advertising has financial impacts for professional codes, national sporting organisations, impacts to us with respect to sporting integrity on the world stage and what we do on the world stage. She was asked: doesn\u2019t gambling have just as many consequences for young people and their mental health when they get caught up in these addictions? Wells responded by pointing to action the government has already taken. NT authorities need to take domestic violence \u2018more seriously\u2019, Nampijinpa Price says The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier about the NT coroner\u2019s inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women. Asked for her reflections on what the coroner found, Price told the program: There has been a desensitisation from the coroner towards the rates of domestic and family violence that we certainly experience in the Northern Territory, and this has occurred over some time now. I also feel as though there is an attitude in \u2026 dealing with family violence and interpersonal violence in Indigenous communities that it is in some way, you know, taboo to have an open and honest conversation about the fact that we experience the high rates, so as not to demonise our men. Price argued there was a \u201cneed for our authorities and police force to tackle it more seriously\u201d, and that calls to remove police from communities wasn\u2019t helpful. I have faith in the Country Liberal party government to be able to deliver on those recommendations, and with that funding that\u2019s available. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O\u2019Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. The party met this morning to vote O\u2019Brien in as leader, with Lowan MP Emma Kealy to remain deputy leader. O\u2019Brien said in a statement following the vote: It is the greatest honour to have been elected as leader of The Nationals. For over 100 years, The Nationals have served the interests of rural and regional Victoria. That will not change. It remains our singular focus as the only party solely dedicated to serving the interests of the 25% of the population who live outside the metropolitan area. Walsh had been in the leadership role for a decade and it remains unclear whether he will stick around on the backbench. The Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather spoke with ABC RN earlier, about the party\u2019s backdown on its concessions on the Help to Buy legislation. He argued the Greens were \u201creally close\u201d to achieving its concessions around a rent freeze and negative gearing changes, and that the government \u201cwere actively considering it\u201d. It is bitterly disappointing that Labor, in the end, blinked and didn\u2019t decide to come to that policy. But I haven\u2019t lost hope, because I think we can go to the next election with those policies, and I think we can push Labor after that next election. Is this an act of electoral self-preservation? Chandler-Mather disagreed, and echoed comments from party leader Adam Bandt earlier that \u201cit comes a point where you realise you\u2019ve pushed as hard as you can.\u201d I would point out that we have now passed every single bit of Labor\u2019s housing legislation this term of parliament. We have tried to negotiate and secure good outcomes. Chandler-Mather is due to speak at the National Press Club in Canberra today, alongside shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar. TikTok has warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a \u201clicence to be online\u201d because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The company\u2019s director of public policy in Australia, Ella Woods-Joyce, pointed to comments made by the communications department in Senate estimates earlier this month confirming that \u201ceverybody will have to go through an age verification process\u201d. As the government\u2019s admissions in Budget Estimates make clear, age-restricted social media platforms will need to undertake age assurance for each and every Australian user in order to remove age-restricted users from their services. This effectively creates a mechanism whereby Australians need a \u2018licence to be online\u2019. Woods-Joyce said there are many questions about the trial of the age assurance technology, which won\u2019t be completed before the government pushes to pass the bill. Given the impact of mandating that all Australians who wish to use social media platforms be subject to such an age assurance system, we urge Parliament to consider the broader implications of legislating such an outcome without knowing any details of the system itself. We\u2019re getting more submissions to the one-day inquiry on the bill, up to 93 out of the more than 15,000 submissions now public. You can read more of the submissions below. Rishworth says Coalition opposition to social media ban \u2018all about politics\u2019 The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has taken aim at those in the opposition speaking against the under-16s social media ban. Earlier in the blog, we brought you her comments that this was a leadership test for Peter Dutton, as people in the party \u2018defy\u2019 him. Speaking at a doorstop at Parliament House, Rishworth was asked whether the government will allow amendments if the Coalition moves that passports and licenses can\u2019t be requested for ID. She responded: Of course, we want to work across the board to make sure that there is strong privacy protections in place. But quite frankly, this seems to me like this is all about politics and about negativity. Now I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. This is not the first time that Peter Dutton has said he supports something and then has decided to destroy. The Labor party is trying to build, while he has become a blocker. So I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he says he 100% supports something, wants to see it delivered, and then decides to block it and play politics with it. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, spoke to ABC News Breakfast earlier about Labor\u2019s housing legislation and said \u201cthere comes a point where you\u2019ve pushed as hard as you can\u201d. He was asked whether the Greens\u2019 backdown on its concessions around rent freezes and negative gearing was \u201chumiliating\u201d, and responded: We tried really hard to get Labor to act on soaring rent increases and unfair tax handouts that are tilting the playing field against first-home buyers, but we couldn\u2019t get there this time. Bandt argued that the Greens \u201cled the charge\u201d on the stage-three tax cuts and were \u201chopeful\u201d they could get the government to shift on key housing measures: We got close. The government was costing changes to negative gearing and they decided to back down at the last minute, and that\u2019s disappointing. But, look, there comes a point where you realise you\u2019ve pushed as hard as you can. The government\u2019s made its decision about defending the status quo. What we\u2019ll now do is wave the bills through, and take this challenge up to the next election \u2026 I\u2019m hopeful that, in the next parliament, if we keep Peter Dutton out, we can push the government to make some much-needed reforms. Albanese government announces panel members for review of national electricity market As noted in an earlier post, the electricity grid faces a couple of days of strains in New South Wales and Queensland as power demand picks up along with temperatures. (About 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plant capacity is offline for maintenance too, which isn\u2019t helping.) Anyway, the Albanese government is looking a bit over the horizon, announcing the panel members for a post-2030 review of the national electricity market (basically all of Australia save the NT and WA grids). The review will be chaired by Tim Nelson, a former AGL Energy expert. He\u2019ll be joined by Paula Conboy, a former chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Ava Hancock, who helped designs NSW\u2019s renewable energy roadmap, and Phil Hirschhorn, who was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. The terms of reference of the review will be key but the details are apparently scant on that front. The federal and state energy ministers may fill in some of the blanks when they meet (some in person, some virtually) for their final gathering of 2024 at the end of next week. The panel will examine the wholesale market settings \u201cto ensure the market promotes investment in firmed renewable energy generation and storage capacity into the 2030s and beyond\u201d, the office of energy minister Chris Bowen said. This is vital as electricity demand grows and ageing coal fired power stations exit the system. The results of the review are likely to land after next year\u2019s federal election \u2013 let\u2019s see if Bowen will lead the charge of implementing its recommendations. McCarthy calls for change in how media reports on First Nation deaths On the media\u2019s role in covering the deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, Malarndirri McCarthy said the Senate inquiry heard that \u201cFirst Nations families felt they weren\u2019t believed, felt they weren\u2019t heard, and felt that they were completely ignored\u201d. This must change. I\u2019ve certainly written to the Australian Press Council. I\u2019ll be calling on fellow senators to assist me with media across the country. There has to be a change in the culture of the media, in the reporting, in the way it\u2019s reported. Government notes \u2018large number\u2019 of recommendations from inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women Going back to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2013 which the government responded to late last night \u2013 Malarndirri McCarthy told the program the government had \u201cnoted a large number of the recommendations\u201d. What I\u2019ll continue to do is meet with those Indigenous affairs ministers, as I\u2019ve done recently, to ensure that we continue to keep working in this space. McCarthy said they had advertised for a Children\u2019s Commissioner for First Nations youth and children, and \u201cwe hope to have that up and running in January.\u201d Host Bridget Brennan said she had heard responses on two recommendations, but the government had \u201cnoted\u201d eight others \u2013 what does it mean, will the government be looking at enacting them? McCarthy responded: For example, when we look at the jurisdictions around police \u2013 well, of course that will be up to the attorney general to work at the state level with the police jurisdictions. It will be up to each of those jurisdictions to then follow through. We can\u2019t enforce it. But we can make sure we have those conversations. So it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t agree, is what I\u2019m saying. McCarthy urges NT government to act after inquest into four Indigenous deaths Yesterday, the Northern Territory government has been told it must overhaul its response to family violence to stop women and children being killed. As Nino Bucci reported, the NT coroner yesterday handed down inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women, making 35 recommendations: The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss this, and said it was an \u201cimportant moment\u201d for the NT and Australia to \u201crealise that this is a national scourge that we have across our country.\u201d She called on the NT government to \u201cimmediately\u201d release funding to address the recommendations. This is too critical. We know that, from a federal perspective, that there was a requirement to assist the family and domestic violence sector in the Northern Territory. And I urge the Northern Territory government to do that immediately. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was on ABC RN earlier to discuss the rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2013 after the government handed down its response to the Senate inquiry yesterday. McCarthy labelled the findings \u201chorrific\u201d \u2013 with Indigenous women making up 16% of Australia\u2019s murder victims, while being just 2-3% of the adult population. There is something in the system in Australia that seems to just go, \u2018that\u2019s OK\u2019, you know, but it\u2019s not OK. It\u2019s not OK \u2026 People who work in the family and domestic violence sector \u2026 break down because they feel that the system isn\u2019t changing. And I do believe that the work of this Senate inquiry has certainly brought it to the forefront for the Australian parliament, to the point where the Australian prime minister brought all the premiers and chief ministers together to say enough \u2026 at the national level. McCarthy said there would \u201calways be an expectation for more to be done\u201d, and that state and territory\u2019s will be tasked to take things back to their cabinets to work on. Sports minister on gambling ad reform: government \u2018remains committed\u2019 to all 31 recommendations Labor\u2019s plans for gambling ad reform has been delayed until next year \u2013 despite commitments made from the minister there would be a response by Christmas. Josh Butler had more on the timeline of this in yesterday\u2019s blog, here. The aged care and sports minister, Anika Wells, was asked about this on ABC RN earlier, and said the government \u201cremain[ed] committed\u201d to working through the 31 recommendations of the inquiry. Right now, we\u2019re working through 31 recommendations with all of the different stakeholders in this space \u2026 As a sport minister who always tries to be athlete-led, there are athletes who are being targeted by the rise of gambling and the proliferation of gambling advertising, not just in professional clothes now, but in the junior leagues we\u2019ve seen those stories come out. So it is something that we\u2019re working through \u2026 These are complex but important reforms, and I look forward to continuing to work on them. Wells was asked about the role lobbyists are playing in trying to stop reform \u2013 but she said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterise it that way at all.\u201d I think, and if you look at the public remarks that codes have made along this journey, they agree that something needs to be done. It\u2019s about finding something that\u2019s workable, that everybody can live with, and that won\u2019t impact the financial models \u2026 Peter V\u2019landys absolutely is one of the players in this area, but there\u2019s lots more, and we\u2019ve got to work through the nuances and concerns of all of them, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to do that. On the under-16s social media ban, we\u2019ve now got at least three Nationals \u2013 Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and now Bridget McKenzie \u2013 and Liberal MP Garth Hamilton publicly voicing concerns over the rushed nature of the bill and potential privacy or access issues for all Australians. The Coalition partyroom is meeting this morning, where the ban is expected to be a hot topic of conversation. But Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said at a brief press gallery doorstop that he was in favour of the ban broadly, and indicated most of the Coalition still backed it: I think the process is troubling, and there are issues here, but ultimately, we think that this is a proportionate approach to what is a very serious issue in the community. This is something that Peter [Dutton] has given very lengthy comments on the record about, and that is our position. The report of the lightning-quick inquiry, which only held a short three-hour hearing, will be released this afternoon. We hear there may be more than a few amendments to the bill proposed. However even critics of the bill are expecting the Coalition will ultimately back the ban. Watch this space. Hot days to strain eastern Australia\u2019s power grid for next few days The slow-moving heatwave across southern and south-eastern Australia will nudge temperatures in Sydney\u2019s west towards 40C today and tomorrow. Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs will be spared the worst, though, with sea breezes keeping the mercury to temperatures in the low 30s for the next three days. Most of eastern New South Wales will endure low- to severe-intensity heatwave conditions today. NSW\u2019s power grid faces the most strain, although Queensland too will have periods when reserves will be relatively tight. (That is, better not have any unplanned outages at the ageing coal-fired power plants ... or any generators for that matter.) The Australian Energy Market Operator this morning cancelled the latest of its so-called lack of reserve level 3 alerts (this one for Wednesday), which imply blackouts unless the market responds. (The market usually responds.) Still, wholesale power prices will near their maximum levels in NSW later today on present Aemo forecasts: A couple of nervous days ahead for our power authorities. And if you\u2019re feeling the heat, drink lots of water, find a cool place and look out for your neighbours to ensure they\u2019re doing OK too. Canavan says he is drafting amendments to under-16 social media bill Despite his pushback to the under-16s social media ban bill, Matt Canavan told ABC RN he hadn\u2019t made his mind up yet on whether he would support the legislation. I\u2019m going to obviously talk to my colleagues in the party room this morning. I am in the process of drafting a number of amendments to the bill, and I\u2019ll have more to say about that in the committee\u2019s report, which will be tabled today. I\u2019ll just keep watching and listening to the debate, but I certainly think the bill needs major changes, and regardless of the changes, I remain unimpressed with this condensed timeframe to analyse the bill. Canavan said there was \u201cwidespread support\u201d for legislation like this, and \u201cI don\u2019t think that support is going to somehow disappear over the summer break\u201d. We can I think just pause here, come back and do this properly. Canavan concerned about digital ID for age assurance: \u2018All we\u2019ve got is the minister\u2019s word\u2019 The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has said a digital ID framework would not be used for age assurance \u2013 does this response alleviate Matt Canavan\u2019s privacy concerns? Canavan argued there was nothing to stop the future use of digital identity to maintain social media accounts: So all we\u2019ve got is the minister\u2019s word, which, as I say, doesn\u2019t mean anything. She might not be the minister within a year \u2013 who knows? So why not, if the minister is is being legitimate here \u2026 why not just change the act, change the bill to rule it out? He again took aim at the rushed process, saying senators hadn\u2019t \u201cbeen able to get across some important submissions\u201d and that it would have been good to have social media companies themselves front the inquiry: We only had time yesterday to hear from their industry representative body but many colleagues of mine \u2013 including those who support the bill \u2013 are frustrated that the industry group could not answer their questions because their questions went to the particular behaviours of the likes of X or Meta \u2026 The bill doesn\u2019t even come into effect until 2026, next year. So why not take a breath, extend the inquiry [and] allow us to get across these 15,000 submissions. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan is speaking with ABC RN about the government\u2019s under-16 social media ban. He\u2019s been an outspoken critic against the bill, and told the program \u201cit\u2019s just not acceptable\u201d how rushed it has been. I completely understand the need [to address] significant harms done to young children from the overuse and abuse of social media, but given [that a bill of this kind is] unprecedented it\u2019s just not acceptable to the public. He said the hurried inquiry into the bill received 15,000 submissions and the committee would report today. It\u2019s very important to let people know this \u2026 won\u2019t just affect the use of social media for people under 16, because once you have to try and verify someone\u2019s age under 16 you\u2019re going to have to verify everyone\u2019s age to check their age. And so there\u2019s huge privacy, free speech implications of this legislation. O\u2019Neil says government doing \u2018everything we can\u2019 to ease economic pressures Asked about the latest economic outlook, Clare O\u2019Neil said she wasn\u2019t denying how tough it is for Australians, and said: You\u2019re seeing the same problems with the economies in the US and all over the world. She pointed to tax cuts and energy bill relief: I\u2019m not saying any of these things completely take the pain away, but I want people to know that government is on your side. We\u2019re doing everything we can to try to relieve those [real] pressures that you\u2019re feeling. Rent freeze and negative gearing changes \u2018dead in the water\u2019, O\u2019Neil says The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, just spoke with the Today show about Labor\u2019s housing bills \u2013 and the Greens\u2019 decision to back its Help to Buy bill after failing to win its concessions. O\u2019Neil said that the Greens\u2019 calls for a rent freeze and negative gearing changes are \u201cabsolutely dead in the water, because they were never good ideas to begin with\u201d. We have sought to be really constructive in this parliament, but it turns out you\u2019ve got to push pretty hard to get your housing initiatives through. O\u2019Neil said the bill was \u201cnot a silver bullet\u201d but it was \u201cnever meant to be\u201d, but warned people against \u201cthe snake oil salesmen in this housing debate who are pretending that there\u2019s one thing we can do to fix the whole problem\u201d. The truth is, we\u2019ve had a generations-in-the-making housing crisis in our country that\u2019s been building for more than 30 years, and it requires our government to do lots of things differently. We\u2019re trying to build many more homes in our country, we\u2019re trying to get a better deal for renters, and we\u2019re trying to get more Australians into homeownership. It\u2019s a big, complex program and it\u2019s going to take some time. But I really want your viewers at home to know that we understand that Australians are in real housing distress at the moment, and our government is stepping up and taking action. \u2018We can do better than that\u2019: Zoe Daniel on Labor\u2019s social media ban bill Zoe Daniel argued that the problem with Labor\u2019s social media is that \u201cyou\u2019re basically letting the platforms off the hook\u201d. [We need to] get the platforms to take responsibility for what is in their environment \u2013 and actually, it would make an age ban redundant if we were to put in this kind of safety by design, and a duty of care and hold the platforms accountable for what\u2019s happening in their spaces. You wouldn\u2019t actually need an age ban. Daniel said she had spoken with communications minister Michelle Rowland about the issue, and the government has flagged it would \u201cgo down the track of a duty of care eventually\u201d. The independent MP said she \u201cunderstood\u201d why the government was pursuing the age ban \u201cbecause it is a lever to pull now and it makes parents feel better\u201d, but argued it \u201cactually makes zero difference to what is happening on the platforms\u201d. The onus and the responsibility remains on the parents and the kids, and I think that we can do better than that. The independent MP Zoe Daniel was on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss her alternative to the under-16 social media ban, which she introduced as a private member\u2019s bill yesterday. Daniel said her bill would implement an overarching statutory duty of care on social media companies \u201cthat goes to safety by design \u2013 but that in and of itself is not enough\u201d. What you need to make that work is the companies to assess the risks, mitigate the risks, be transparent about how they\u2019re doing that. The bill builds in penalties so if the companies do not comply, they could be fined up to 10% of global revenue. Also, their onshore executives could be held accountable for that \u2026 and the bill also has a provision to enable users to have control over the algorithm, as exists overseas, particularly in the EU \u2026 The final provision is that when you enter a social media platform for the first time, your default privacy position is defaulted to the strongest possible settings. McKenzie cites privacy concerns over under-16s social media age ban bill Also on the program, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie weighed in on the under-16s social media ban and said \u201cwe are very concerned about digital ID laws\u201d. [There are] obviously privacy concerns, and given the government\u2019s had to pull their misinformation [and] disinformation \u2013 or their censoring the Australian public \u2013 bill from the Senate this week, we want to make sure we get strong, robust laws that don\u2019t damage the [right to] privacy and make compulsory Australians having to have digital IDs. Nationals senator Matt Canavan has also spoken out against the bill, citing privacy concerns. But yesterday, Nationals leader David Littleproud said there was \u201cconflation and confusion\u201d about the bill, and that it was \u201cdangerous to conflate\u201d it with digital ID. You can read his full comments in yesterday\u2019s blog. Amanda Rishworth was also asked about Labor\u2019s under-16 social media age ban and whether the government was rushing this. The social services minister denied this and said the government has bipartisan support \u2013 or so they thought: Well, I thought there was bipartisan support \u2026 I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, Peter Dutton said he would facilitate this important piece of legislation and support the government. And now we see our senators defying him, I guess. So this is a test for Peter Dutton about his leadership. Labor\u2019s social media age ban is likely to pass, following a rapid three-day inquiry with just one day to make submissions, and the Coalition claiming credit for having suggested it first. However, conservative opposition to the bill has been growing in the lead up to the lower house vote: Rishworth defends government economic decisions amid latest outlook The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, just spoke with the Today show where she defended the government\u2019s handling of the economy amid the latest outlook: We inherited a pretty big economic mess from the Liberal and National party when we came to government, we had inflation with a six in front of it. We inherited a policy from the Liberal party that was deliberately keeping wages low. Listing measures the government has taken, Rishworth pointed to lowering inflation, wages growth, cost of living measures and the stage three tax cuts. She went on to say: The alternative would have been if Peter Dutton was in in the prime minister chair. He\u2019s opposed every single one of these measures and we would be in a real recession right now if he had got his way on so many policy issues. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie was also on the program and argued \u201cAustralians are feeling poorer because they actually are poorer under Albanese\u201d. She took aim at government spending, and said this was why \u201cin comparable nations, our numbers are in the toilet comparatively\u201d. Queensland premier David Crisafulli begins first sitting week as premier Queensland\u2019s new premier, David Crisafulli, will be only the second member of the modern Menzies Liberal party to sit in the top chair when he begins his first sitting week today. The \u201cconservative, uniquely agrarian state\u201d has been governed by Labor or Country National premiers for all but 1,000 days since 1860 but now it\u2019s Crisafulli\u2019s turn to show he can deliver on his promises to slash crime. Read our analysis of what lies in store: Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. We\u2019re in the home stretch, with just three days left in the final sitting week of the year. You\u2019ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest \u2013 Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers, capturing all the action. Let\u2019s get into it. More on that Deloitte report from AAP: \u2018The time will come for changes to tax\u2019 The economists were hopeful inflation would keep a lid on election spending sprees, as cost-of-living support eases pain but injects money into the economy \u2013 adding to the problem it\u2019s trying to solve. The treasurer has already been managing expectations before the midyear budget update next month. In a speech, Jim Chalmers warned windfalls would be nought but a \u201csliver\u201d of upgrades clocked in the past few years. Higher commodity prices and a higher tax take from migration and bracket creep have helped the federal government deliver the first two back-to-back surpluses in almost two decades. DAE partner and report co-author Cathryn Lee said the government still deserved credit for banking most of the revenue rather than spending it, especially during a cost-of-living crunch when the community has been calling for support. Yet she said both major political parties had broadly failed to embark on the structural budget repair needed over the past two decades. The time will come for changes to tax. It must. Australia is waving goodbye to budget surpluses and returning abruptly to deficit, facing a $49bn deterioration in the bottom line in forecasts from leading economists, AAP reports. The $15.8bn surplus logged in the last financial year to Deloitte Access Economics\u2019 prediction of a $33.5bn deficit in 2024/25 would amount to largest nominal contraction in the underlying cash balance on record, outside the pandemic. The forecast would also represent a $5.2bn mark down from Treasury predictions made in the May budget. DAE partner and report co-author Stephen Smith said: Worryingly, there is little to suggest that the situation will right itself in the years to come. As well as the well-documented pressures on the public purse from an ageing population, Smith warned global developments \u2013 including China\u2019s economic slowdown and Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House \u2013 did not bode well for Australia\u2019s budget position. Should substantial tariffs be slapped on imports into the United States, including at rates of up to 60% of goods from China, Australia\u2019s budget will not be immune given its reliance on commodity prices via company tax receipts. Tensions high outside Melbourne synagogue Tensions ran high outside a synagogue in Melbourne last night as pro-Israel supporters gathered to counter a pro-Palestine protest despite the rally being cancelled, AAP reports. A number of pro-Israel demonstrators rallied outside a popular synagogue even after the planned pro-Palestine protest was formally called off at the 11th hour as organisers cited safety concerns. Despite the cancellation, there was a visible police presence near the synagogue in Caulfield North, in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, where a sea of Israeli flags far outnumbered the Palestinian flags. Specialist police encircled a small group of pro-Palestine supporters in an attempt to keep them from the larger pro-Israel group. The planned demonstration was in response to a planned talk organised by the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council that includes former Israeli justice minister Ayelet Shaked, whose visa into Australia was reportedly rejected. It also comes as Australia\u2019s Palestinian community demands answers after a dentistry student was struck by shrapnel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Here\u2019s our story: Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it will be my colleague Emily Wind to take you through the bulk of the day in Canberra and beyond. Our top story this morning surrounds Labor\u2019s resolve to force the big tech companies to enforce its proposed ban on under-16s\u2019 use of social media after the Silicon Valley heavyweights pushed back against the legislation. Meta said the bill is \u201cinconsistent and ineffective\u201d and that it should be delayed until there is more time to develop age verification technology. The big moment yesterday was the Greens\u2019 acquiescence to the government\u2019s housing bill \u2013 a harsh lesson in realpolitik handed to Adam Bandt and Max Chandler-Mather by the prime minister. Tensions were running high on the streets of a Melbourne suburb last night as pro-Israel demonstrators rallied after the threat of a pro-Palestine protest outside a synagogue. More on that soon. And more soon on a report from Deloitte that forecasts the government faces a huge budget deficit, running into the tens of billions.",

Icon\u2019s Thrill Island, for example, includes the Flow Rider, a 12-metre-long (39ft) surf simulator, that has been built to face away from the sea \u201cso your selfies will be better and your friends will see you against the actual ocean\u201d, says Tim Klauda, a vice-president at Royal Caribbean International in a promotional video for the ship. At the same time, brands such as Virgin Voyages, which launched its first ship in 2021, are unashamedly targeting customers in their 20s and 30s like Daisie Morrison and her friends. Virgin ships are all adults-only and, unusually for cruise itineraries, offer overnight stops at islands such as Ibiza. While the cruise ship industry is celebrating the growing number and diversity of its travellers, this rapid growth is already proving to be a turnoff for some. When Nick Webb, a 32-year-old design engineer based in Monmouthshire, embarked on an 11-day tour of Venice, Dubrovnik and a handful of Greek islands a few summers ago, he had hoped for a stress-free way to take in the sights. But as cruise ships like his own swelled the numbers of tourists at each port, he quickly found this mode of travel came with its own stresses. \u201cYou know those videos online of people running out to get sun loungers at 6am? It was exactly like that,\u201d he recalls. His travel agent sold the voyage as targeted towards adults, but there were still lots of children onboard, he says. \u201cThey were all in the main pool, which wasn\u2019t very big \u2026 It wasn\u2019t relaxing if you did manage to get a space on the top deck.\u201d Webb wouldn\u2019t entirely rule out going on another cruise, he says, but would only do so at an off-peak time. While he appreciated the ease of rolling out of bed at a different location each morning, he was a bit shocked by what he saw. \u201cLooking down from Santorini, there were four or five cruise ships, all spewing smog into the air. It was so busy \u2013 it was horrible.\u201d Otter has been going on cruise holidays with her two children, aged nine and 11, for the past six years. \u201cThis year my daughter did say: \u2018Mum, do you know, I think I would get bored on a land holiday,\u2019\u201d she says. It is children like her daughter who are helping to \u201cfuture proof\u201d the industry, she adds. \u201cWhen she\u2019s 15, when she\u2019s 20, when she\u2019s 30, she\u2019ll go on holidays with her friends, and she\u2019ll say to them: \u2018Let\u2019s go on a cruise.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Additonal research by Lauren McAuley.

The media mogul and pro-democracy activist was arrested in 2020 on charges related to the 2019 mass protests that rocked the city. Later that year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/17/hong-kong-police-arrest-editor-in-chief-of-apple-daily-newspaper-in-morning-raids\">he was arrested again</a>, by national security police who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/25/final-days-hong-kong-apple-daily-pressure-unbearable\">raided the newspaper he founded</a>, Apple Daily. They accused Lai of colluding with foreign forces in breach of the national security law introduced that year. Chinese officials have called him a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/05/jimmy-lai-and-the-rule-of-law-in-hong-kong\">\u201cmastermind and instigator of anti-China riots\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Lai\u2019s bail was revoked months later and he was held on remand. That rolled into a sentence for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-and-activists-jailed-up-to-14-months-for-tiananmen-vigil\">\u201cunlawful assembly\u201d convictions</a> related to the 2019 protests and Tiananmen massacre vigils. He is now serving another sentence of more than five years for a lease violation, which critics have called a trumped-up charge designed to keep the influential activist behind bars.</p> <p>He is being held in solitary confinement, where his lawyers say he sees daylight only through windows in the corridor outside his cell and is taken out once a day for an hour\u2019s exercise. The committed Catholic has not received communion while detained, which his son, Sebastien, describes as \u201cpetty\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/13/jimmy-lai-trial-hong-kong-andy-li-evidence-torture-claims\">His trial</a> resumed last week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/18/jimmy-lai-trial-hong-kong-updates-media-democracy-advocate\">multiple delays</a> and government interventions, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/11/hong-kong-passes-law-to-limit-work-of-foreign-lawyers-amid-ongoing-jimmy-lai-case\">efforts to bar a UK lawyer</a>, Timothy Owen, from representing him. He is facing a life sentence if convicted, but even a few extra years are of concern for Lai, 76. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well, unfortunately,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/23/jimmy-lai-democracy-activist-trial-hong-kong-son-sebastien-interview\">Sebastien Lai</a>, who is lobbying western governments to help release his father. \u201cHis health has gotten much worse, and he was too sick to go to court a few months ago.\u201d</p> <p>Lai is a full UK citizen who has only ever held English papers. Receiving British national (overseas) status was \u201cthe first time any state recognised him as a person\u201d, his son says.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/uk-must-fight-for-jimmy-lais-release-friend-of-jailed-hongkonger-tells-mps\">he and others say</a> the UK government\u2019s support has been \u201cridiculously\u201d lacking, far behind those of other countries such as the US, Canada and Australia, which have lobbied for him.</p> <p>\u201cIt took two years before [the UK] started asking for consular access,\u201d said Mark Sabah, the director of the London-based Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong. \u201cTwo years before they even said his name at the dispatch box.\u201d</p> <p>Sebastien Lai said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/david-lammy-human-rights-ukraine-uyghurs-china-visit-talks\">the call from Lammy</a> for Lai\u2019s release while on a visit to China last month was welcome, but he wants his father\u2019s case raised in all government engagements with Beijing.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Ryan Cornelius, the United Arab Emirates</h2>    <p>More than 16 years have passed since Ryan Cornelius, a British property developer, was arrested at Dubai airport. He is now 70, and his family is furious about the UK government\u2019s response to his case.</p> <p>Cornelius was charged in 2010 with defrauding the Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) and sentenced to 10 years in prison in the UAE.</p> <p>Two months before his release date in 2018, he was served with another 20-year sentence \u2013 based on a UAE law brought in after his initial sentencing \u2013 until $430m in alleged debt was settled. Before his detention, Cornelius, who had business projects in Bahrain, Dubai and Pakistan, had been repaying instalments on a $500m DIB loan.</p> <p>At the start of his imprisonment, he was held in solitary confinement for weeks, and he later contracted tuberculosis while in jail, which went untreated for 18 months, his family said.</p> <p>A meeting this year with the Conservative foreign secretary David Cameron, who raised Cornelius\u2019s case with UAE officials, made them hopeful for the first time of his release. But meetings with officials from the new Labour government have upset and disappointed them.</p> <p>The businessman\u2019s lawyer, Rhys Davies, said: \u201cDavid Cameron\u2019s intervention was an absolute game changer. Since the new government\u2019s come in it\u2019s gone in completely the opposite direction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheir job is to stand up for the rights of British citizens, that should be their number one priority and I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing that. Ryan should have been released earlier this year, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p> <p>Cornelius\u2019s wife, Heather, said: \u201cRyan is a human being, and his family are human beings. They need some kind of help and support and some rights in this world. If you can\u2019t get them from the British government, who can you get it from?\u201d</p> <p>His brother-in-law, Chris Pagett, said the UK had \u201cmany diplomatic instruments\u201d at its disposal, including sanctions, \u201cprecisely in order to protect British citizens from this kind of autocratic thuggery. If you are seen to be unwilling to use them, the only thing that is certain is that there will be many more Ryans, and this makes the world a far less safe place,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Foreign Office said it was supporting Cornelius, and met his family to discuss their concerns last month.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Mehran Raoof, Iran</h2>    <p>In October 2020, Mehran Raoof was arrested in Tehran. The following year, the British-Iranian trade unionist and labour rights activist was sentenced to over 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on national security-related charges.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/the-left-behind-the-dual-nationals-still-in-jail-in-iran\">For years</a> until his arrest, the former teacher from north London had divided his time between the UK and Iran, teaching English, meeting other labour and women\u2019s rights activists and helping them translate materials from and into English.</p> <p>He says he was not told of the reasons for his arrest or the charges against him at the time, and was denied legal access until the day of his trial. He was convicted of \u201cforming a group of more than two people with the purpose of disrupting national security\u201d and \u201cspreading propaganda against the system\u201d, and remains incarcerated in Iran\u2019s notorious Evin prison.</p> <p>Raoof\u2019s fellow trade union activist Satar Rahmani said Raoof had been subjected to lengthy interrogation and mental and physical harassment in jail, and was denied medical treatment for diabetes.</p> <p>He has no immediate family in Iran, and for several months his relatives were \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of his whereabouts. </p> <p>Getting information about Raoof\u2019s wellbeing in prison has been a challenge, said the Amnesty International campaigner Sena Atici. The organisation, which considers Raoof a prisoner of conscience, has called on the UK government to secure his release.</p> <p>In 2020, the Foreign Office said his family was being supported and the case would continue to be raised \u201cat the most senior levels\u201d. But Liz Truss, then foreign secretary, reportedly made no reference to him in a 2022 announcement on the release of two other Iran detainees, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori. Pressed by Raoof\u2019s MP, Jeremy Corbyn, Truss said: \u201cI must respect the individual\u2019s request of whether their case should be raised in public.\u201d</p> <p>Rahmani said no such request was made. He said the new Labour government had met Raoof\u2019s family, and Starmer had raised his case with Iran\u2019s new prime minister, Masoud Pezeshkian, including requesting a visit by a British embassy official.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have raised Mr Raoof\u2019s health and welfare concerns with the Iranian government and his welfare remains a top priority.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2>Jagtar Singh Johal, India</h2>    <p>Jagtar Singh Johal, a Sikh activist and blogger from Dumbarton in Scotland, was arrested in 2017 while attending a wedding in the Punjab.</p> <p>He is accused as a co-conspirator in the murders of three far-right Hindu leaders and the funding of the Khalistan Liberation Front. One of the charges is that he travelled to France in 2013 to hand over \u00a33,000 to a co-conspirator, knowing the money would be used to fund a series of attacks against Hindu nationalists and other religious leaders in Punjab.</p> <p>He claims that soon after his arrest he was tortured into signing confessions. Over time, further charges were added, including some as late as 2021. He is now being held at Tihar jail, Delhi.</p> <p>In November 2021, a United Nations working party said Johal, now 37, had been arrested because of his Sikh activism. In February 2023, Starmer said there was no legal basis for Johal\u2019s detention and the government must act decisively to negotiate his release. </p> <p>Jagtar Singh Johal\u2019s brother, Gurpreet Singh Johal, said Johal was a peaceful activist who had contributed to a website remembering the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple at Amritsar but was not a militant.</p> <p>Although he has appeared in court numerous times alongside other co-conspirators, nothing but stock witnesses have been produced against him, he said. One of the witnesses critical to the prosecution case has since died.</p> <p>Gurpreet Singh Johal said: \u201cMy brother should not be in prison. All he ever did was stand up for human rights, as we have said from day one. Prosecutors can\u2019t come up with any evidence against him because there isn\u2019t any.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p></p>",

Ryan Cornelius, the United Arab Emirates More than 16 years have passed since Ryan Cornelius, a British property developer, was arrested at Dubai airport. He is now 70, and his family is furious about the UK government\u2019s response to his case. Cornelius was charged in 2010 with defrauding the Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) and sentenced to 10 years in prison in the UAE. Two months before his release date in 2018, he was served with another 20-year sentence \u2013 based on a UAE law brought in after his initial sentencing \u2013 until $430m in alleged debt was settled.

If you are seen to be unwilling to use them, the only thing that is certain is that there will be many more Ryans, and this makes the world a far less safe place,\u201d he added. The Foreign Office said it was supporting Cornelius, and met his family to discuss their concerns last month. Mehran Raoof, Iran In October 2020, Mehran Raoof was arrested in Tehran. The following year, the British-Iranian trade unionist and labour rights activist was sentenced to over 10 years\u2019 imprisonment on national security-related charges. For years until his arrest, the former teacher from north London had divided his time between the UK and Iran, teaching English, meeting other labour and women\u2019s rights activists and helping them translate materials from and into English. He says he was not told of the reasons for his arrest or the charges against him at the time, and was denied legal access until the day of his trial. He was convicted of \u201cforming a group of more than two people with the purpose of disrupting national security\u201d and \u201cspreading propaganda against the system\u201d, and remains incarcerated in Iran\u2019s notorious Evin prison. Raoof\u2019s fellow trade union activist Satar Rahmani said Raoof had been subjected to lengthy interrogation and mental and physical harassment in jail, and was denied medical treatment for diabetes. He has no immediate family in Iran, and for several months his relatives were \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of his whereabouts. Getting information about Raoof\u2019s wellbeing in prison has been a challenge, said the Amnesty International campaigner Sena Atici. The organisation, which considers Raoof a prisoner of conscience, has called on the UK government to secure his release. In 2020, the Foreign Office said his family was being supported and the case would continue to be raised \u201cat the most senior levels\u201d. But Liz Truss, then foreign secretary, reportedly made no reference to him in a 2022 announcement on the release of two other Iran detainees, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori. Pressed by Raoof\u2019s MP, Jeremy Corbyn, Truss said: \u201cI must respect the individual\u2019s request of whether their case should be raised in public.\u201d Rahmani said no such request was made. He said the new Labour government had met Raoof\u2019s family, and Starmer had raised his case with Iran\u2019s new prime minister, Masoud Pezeshkian, including requesting a visit by a British embassy official. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have raised Mr Raoof\u2019s health and welfare concerns with the Iranian government and his welfare remains a top priority.\u201d Jagtar Singh Johal, India Jagtar Singh Johal, a Sikh activist and blogger from Dumbarton in Scotland, was arrested in 2017 while attending a wedding in the Punjab. He is accused as a co-conspirator in the murders of three far-right Hindu leaders and the funding of the Khalistan Liberation Front. One of the charges is that he travelled to France in 2013 to hand over \u00a33,000 to a co-conspirator, knowing the money would be used to fund a series of attacks against Hindu nationalists and other religious leaders in Punjab. He claims that soon after his arrest he was tortured into signing confessions. Over time, further charges were added, including some as late as 2021. He is now being held at Tihar jail, Delhi. In November 2021, a United Nations working party said Johal, now 37, had been arrested because of his Sikh activism. In February 2023, Starmer said there was no legal basis for Johal\u2019s detention and the government must act decisively to negotiate his release. Jagtar Singh Johal\u2019s brother, Gurpreet Singh Johal, said Johal was a peaceful activist who had contributed to a website remembering the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple at Amritsar but was not a militant. Although he has appeared in court numerous times alongside other co-conspirators, nothing but stock witnesses have been produced against him, he said. One of the witnesses critical to the prosecution case has since died. Gurpreet Singh Johal said: \u201cMy brother should not be in prison. All he ever did was stand up for human rights, as we have said from day one. Prosecutors can\u2019t come up with any evidence against him because there isn\u2019t any.\u201d",

Speaking to the Guardian on his first day in the job as executive chairman, Leighton, who has taken over from fellow retail veteran Stuart Rose, said his first priority was to \u201crestore Asda\u2019s DNA\u201d, which included improving price. The former Co-op and Royal Mail chair said he had committed three to five years of his time to Asda as \u201cit is going to take us that long to get it right\u201d. The 71-year-old said he had already visited a number of Asda stores and spoken to all store managers via video conference on Monday, with some familiar faces among the crowd. He also spoke to all the staff at Asda House, the group\u2019s Leeds headquarters, in person on Monday as he laid out three priorities \u2013 restoring the group\u2019s \u201cDNA\u201d on price and ways of working, improving availability and recruiting a new chief executive. Leighton, who intends to come up with a revival plan for the business by the end of January, said he was looking for a \u201creally good leader\u201d who may not necessarily be a retailer but who understood shoppers and managing people. He said Asda\u2019s shareholders \u2013 the private equity firm TDR Capital, the petrol forecourts entrepreneur Mohsin Issa and US supermarket group Walmart \u2013 were totally aligned with his view that the retailer \u201chas to grow\u201d and he was \u201cconfident I have the support in this\u201d from them. He said Asda had a good chain of stores but needed to address its IT issues, which developed once it moved off former owner Walmart\u2019s systems, which meant it had \u201clost significant competitive advantage\u201d. But he insisted \u201cthey are all fixable\u201d. Leighton, who left Asda in 2000 after eight years at the business, latterly as chief executive, said of his return that \u201cbizarrely it feels like I have never been away\u201d. \u201cI feel totally back home,\u201d he said.

The pull was just too much,\u201d he said. He originally left after helping revive the chain and securing a sale to Walmart for more than \u00a36bn. The group, which has 580 supermarkets and more than 500 convenience stores, risks losing its spot as the UK\u2019s third-largest grocer to a new generation of cheaper rivals led by German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl. The group has lost one percentage point of market share in the past year as sales fell, according to analysts at Kantar, despite the grocery price inflation that has helped its main rivals grow. Since the \u00a36.8bn takeover in early 2021 by Blackburn\u2019s billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital, Asda has struggled to compete on price and service. Bigger rivals Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have been gaining ground, as have Aldi and Lidl. The business has not only been hampered by a heavy debt burden resulting from the takeover deal but also the cost and difficulty of shifting on to new IT systems from former owner Walmart\u2019s tech. There have also been question marks over leadership since the exit of former chief executive Roger Burnley three years ago, with co-owner Mohsin Issa nominally in charge until September this year. Issa has now stepped back as part of a reorganisation in which his brother Zuber sold his 22.5% stake to TDR.",

Others note that amid intense pressure on police resources after a long period of cuts, they constitute a waste of time.</p> <p>A recent report by His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services was scathing about how the system is working in practice, saying that officers sometimes \u201csimply record the incident as a crime rather than consider whether it might be an NCHI or whether no further record is needed\u201d, and may be leaving personal information in reports unnecessarily. In some cases, records did not make clear whether an incident was a crime or not \u2013 and those records could be available to prospective employers.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Is this a growing problem?</p> <p>One objection that appears less well-founded is the idea that NCHIs are growing as part of a general tendency towards \u201cwokeness\u201d. There is no national figure available for NCHIs, but the Free Speech Union <a href=\"https://freespeechunion.org/police-still-wasting-time-investigating-non-crime/\">produced some figures</a> through freedom of information requests in September. It said there were 11,554 across 29 of 43 forces in England and Wales in 2022-23, and, by annualising numbers taken in a six month period \u2013 a slightly sketchy method given the propensity for one-off events to affect the numbers, but we work with what we have \u2013 11,740 the next year.</p> <p>The FSU noted that a previous FOI request covering 2014-2019 revealed that 34 police forces were recording 21,480 cases per annum. Even allowing for the additional forces, the trend appears to have been firmly in the opposite direction to what you might have presumed. Whatever examples are produced, that does not appear to be evidence of a new crisis.</p> <p><em>\u00b7 In yesterday\u2019s First Edition, we said that the $300bn pledged by developed countries at Cop29 to mitigate the impact of climate breakdown on the developing world would take the form of grants and loans. We should have noted that the Cop29 text also allows for the counting of private co-investing \u2013 and while in practice this will only be a small share of the total, it is viewed by some developing nations as a loophole.</em></p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Imagine directing <strong>Othello</strong>, a play about interracial relationships, in a society where those relationships were illegal.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. A journalist visited by police over an erroneous tweet. A barber accused of racism over a dodgy haircut. And someone in Warwickshire reported for refusing to shake hands. These are some of the examples cited in recent days in an escalating media storm over \u201cnon-crime hate incidents\u201d recorded by police. The problem, frequently laid at the door of the woke mob, is so catastrophically vexing that former Conservative MEP and Daily Telegraph columnist Daniel Hannan declared it evidence of \u201cthe bleak reality of our DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] police state\u201d. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has now said that the police should apply a \u201ccommon sense and consistent approach\u201d, an apparent nod to the criticisms of how the system works. And there are some reasonable objections to the status quo. But there are also important reasons for its existence that have very little to do with haircuts or handshakes. Today\u2019s newsletter attempts to sort the legitimate questions from the performative outrage. Here are the headlines.

The scheme is part of a suite of changes to the welfare system and out-of-work support being announced today. US politics | Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% US tariff on products from Mexico and Canada.

The Met Office defended its work, saying that the storm was \u201cwell forecast, 48 hours in advance\u201d. Regulation | Britain\u2019s financial sector watchdog is \u201cincompetent at best, dishonest at worst\u201d, according to a damning report by MPs and Lords which called for a big shake-up. An examination of the Financial Conduct Authority found \u201cvery significant shortcomings\u201d after a series of financial scandals. Health | Weight-loss drugs can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function, kidney failure and dying from kidney disease by a fifth, according to a study. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic reduced the risk of kidney failure by 16% and the worsening of kidney function by 22%, In depth: \u2018A non-crime \u2013 what the hell?\u2019 Two weeks ago, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Allison Pearson wrote a column describing a visit from police to her home on Remembrance Sunday. \u201cIt was to do with something I had posted on X (formerly Twitter) a year ago,\u201d she wrote. The officers couldn\u2019t tell her what the offending post was, but said someone had reported it as a non-crime hate incident (NCHI), Pearson claimed. \u201cA non-crime \u2013 what the hell?\u201d she wrote, complaining that their action had \u201cdefiled Remembrance Sunday\u201d. And thus a news event was given its wings. As the story has metastasized in recent days, it has turned into a wider complaint that NCHIs are an affront to freedom of speech \u2013 and an egregious waste of police time. But the general hysteria that has decorated the front pages, both in reference to Pearson\u2019s case and others, is not always based on a fair reading of the facts. Here\u2019s what you need to know to make sense of it. *** What is a non-crime hate incident? You could be forgiven for thinking, given the sudden intensity of media attention, that NCHIs are an innovation of the contemporary wokerati. In fact, they have their origins in the aftermath of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry in 1999. Before that, the then Association of Chief Police Officers defined a \u201cracial incident\u201d as \u201cany incident which includes an allegation of racial motivation made by any person\u201d. But Sir William Macpherson\u2019s report into Lawrence\u2019s murder recommended that \u2013 partly because of a view among communities of colour that the \u201cwhite\u201d version of such incidents was generally accepted by police \u2013 the term \u201cracist incident\u201d should explicitly include both crimes and non-crimes. \u201cBoth must be reported, recorded and investigated with equal commitment,\u201d Macpherson said. Since then, rules around NCHIs have been set out by the College of Policing and expanded to cover other protected characteristics like disability, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity. The College of Policing\u2019s 2014 guidance says that even when no crime has been committed, any report \u201cmust be recorded regardless of whether or not [the complainant is] the victim, and irrespective of whether there is any evidence to identify the hate element\u201d. In 2023, partly in response to a court case which found that the recording of NCHIs interfered with the right to freedom of expression, the then home secretary Suella Braverman published new guidance. It said that incidents should only be recorded when \u201cclearly motivated by intentional hostility\u201d, and that the right to free speech should be prioritised. In August this year, Labour home secretary Yvette Cooper was reported to be considering reversing that change to improve monitoring of antisemitic and Islamophobic abuse that could escalate into violence. *** Why are we talking about this now? Because of the Pearson case, basically: there have been 177 newspaper articles about NCHIs since her column was published, versus 38 in the previous six months. But the Pearson story does not appear to have been an NCHI at all. After her initial column, Essex police said that bodycam footage showed that, in fact, she was told that the complaint was of a potential criminal offence of inciting racial hatred online. Pearson\u2019s original post showed police with two people of colour holding up the flag of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, a Pakistani political party founded by Imran Khan; Pearson reposted it with the comment \u201clook at this lot smiling with the Jew haters\u201d, apparently because she confused the PTI flag with that of Hamas. She later deleted the post. Essex police have since dropped the case. There may be an argument here about where the bar should be for police investigations of hate crime \u2013 but that is not the controversy that is being aired. In any case, the peg of the Pearson column has been used for a wider excavation of examples of NCHIs perceived as overzealous. These have not always told the full story. One Sun front page proclaimed that \u201cDodgy haircut is hate crime\u201d (rather than, er, literally a non-crime); but the story eventually explains that the complainant was a Lithuanian who felt that his barber was aggressive after a discussion of the war in Ukraine because he spoke Russian. The Daily Telegraph reported that\u201cpolice recorded non-crime hate incident over handshake refusal in alleged gender row\u201d, which would seem to imply that the issue was a difference of opinion over gender politics. But Warwickshire police\u2019s record said that the victim thought that the refusal was, instead, because of their gender identity. Such cases certainly aren\u2019t crimes, and there is an entirely legitimate debate about the fact that police record them \u2013 but nor do they appear to be the pure nonsense that much of the coverage suggests. *** What are the best arguments in defence of NCHIs? The case for the recording of NCHIs begins with the idea that doing so allows officers to monitor patterns of behaviour that could indicate a wider problem brewing. Another argument is that they allow those in groups that are frequently subjected to prejudice to report incidents without having to ascertain themselves whether or not a crime has been committed. As Danny Stone, chief executive of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, wrote for ConservativeHome in 2022: Victim-led hate reporting has had significant and important positive impacts for police, and communities, in diagnosing harm, extremism, and failing integration or community-cohesion efforts \u2026 We all know that recording rules can be complex, but they should not be a concern to a victim at their time of distress.\u201d He also noted that failing to monitor a pattern of such incidents can lead to disaster. And he cited the case of Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her severely disabled daughter Francecca Hardwick in 2007 after 33 recorded incidents of contact between Pilkington and police regarding abuse from local youths. *** Why do critics object to them? Well, the name doesn\u2019t do them any favours: there is something obviously jarring about the police examining \u201cnon-crimes\u201d, even when no action is taken. In a report by the thinktank Policy Exchange published yesterday, former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Hogan-Howe said that whereas the existence of a crime should be objective, whether something is an NCHI is \u201ca subjective test based on guidance \u2013 producing inconsistent outcomes\u201d. There are also complaints that because the standard for recording NCHIs is one of \u201chostility\u201d, defined as including \u201cunfriendliness, antagonism, resentment and dislike\u201d, it can sometimes fall short of \u201chate\u201d. Others note that amid intense pressure on police resources after a long period of cuts, they constitute a waste of time. A recent report by His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services was scathing about how the system is working in practice, saying that officers sometimes \u201csimply record the incident as a crime rather than consider whether it might be an NCHI or whether no further record is needed\u201d, and may be leaving personal information in reports unnecessarily. In some cases, records did not make clear whether an incident was a crime or not \u2013 and those records could be available to prospective employers. *** Is this a growing problem? One objection that appears less well-founded is the idea that NCHIs are growing as part of a general tendency towards \u201cwokeness\u201d. There is no national figure available for NCHIs, but the Free Speech Union produced some figures through freedom of information requests in September. It said there were 11,554 across 29 of 43 forces in England and Wales in 2022-23, and, by annualising numbers taken in a six month period \u2013 a slightly sketchy method given the propensity for one-off events to affect the numbers, but we work with what we have \u2013 11,740 the next year. The FSU noted that a previous FOI request covering 2014-2019 revealed that 34 police forces were recording 21,480 cases per annum. Even allowing for the additional forces, the trend appears to have been firmly in the opposite direction to what you might have presumed. Whatever examples are produced, that does not appear to be evidence of a new crisis. \u00b7 In yesterday\u2019s First Edition, we said that the $300bn pledged by developed countries at Cop29 to mitigate the impact of climate breakdown on the developing world would take the form of grants and loans. We should have noted that the Cop29 text also allows for the counting of private co-investing \u2013 and while in practice this will only be a small share of the total, it is viewed by some developing nations as a loophole. What else we\u2019ve been reading Imagine directing Othello, a play about interracial relationships, in a society where those relationships were illegal. That was the risk Janet Suzman took when she staged a production in apartheid South Africa. As she writes: \u201cTheatre gains a whole rack of meaning if you\u2019re doing it in, let\u2019s say, forbidden circumstances.\u201d Jason Okundaye, assistant editor and writer, newsletters The final deal at Cop29 may not have been the outcome many hoped for, but climate secretary Ed Miliband wrote for the Guardian on the many positives he took from the conference \u2013 not least that \u201cBritain is back in the global climate leadership business\u201d. Charlie Lindlar, acting deputy editor, newsletters. Want to be wrestled from the clutches of smartphone addiction? There is no better remedy than art, argues Katy Hessel.

Jason As Manchester City languish in their worst form in a decade under Pep Guardiola, Jonathan Wilson notes in his newsletter (sign up here!) that no empire lasts for ever \u2013 and we might be seeing Guardiola \u201cstruggle against entropy\u201d.

Matty left law 30 years ago, but now in her 70s, wants to practise again.

Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars, its ravishing sweep is spurred along by Sam Riley as the devil-may-care vintner who becomes her new beau.

Representatives of the least developed countries (LDCs) negotiating bloc said: \u201c[We are] outraged and deeply hurt by the outcome of Cop29. Once again, the countries most responsible for the climate crisis have failed us. This is not just a failure. It\u2019s a betrayal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Only $300bn of the promised total will come directly from the budgets of developed countries and public finance institutions, such as the World Bank. The great majority of that money should be in the form of grants and low-interest loans, but loose wording means even that commitment is hedged \u2013 the cash could come from \u201ca wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral and alternative sources\u201d.</p> \n<p>The remainder of the $1.3tn will have to come largely from private sector investment in developing countries, with an unspecified amount also supposed to come from potential new levies on shipping, frequent flyers, oil and gas and other sources. The latter have yet to be agreed, however, and could be difficult to achieve in practice.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople of the global south came to these talks needing a lifeboat out of the climate crisis. But all they got was a plank of wood to cling to,\u201d said Mariana Paoli, global advocacy lead for the Christian Aid charity.</p> \n<p>Yet rich countries said the deal was as much as they could deliver. \u201cDeveloped countries have gone quite a long way to try and find a way through this, and at a time when public finances really are stretched,\u201d said Ed Miliband, the UK\u2019s energy secretary.</p> \n<p>Cop29 opened on 11 November. Five days before, Donald Trump was reelected as president of the US on a platform that gave no doubt he would resume the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, ditch climate action and \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d.</p> \n<p>Baku also marked the first time a Cop had dealt properly with finance. The only previous financial goal \u2013 for developed countries to ensure that $100bn flowed to the developing world each year by 2020 \u2013 was set in 2009, without any real discussion. Cops are normally the work of environment or foreign ministries, rather than finance departments, so parties arrived in Baku with no template for how a finance discussion should work. One veteran complained: \u201cToo many delegates have no idea how finance works \u2013 and didn\u2019t bring people who do.\u201d</p> \n<p>This lack of a blueprint for discussions led to an overreliance on the presidency, with many countries looking to Azerbaijan to lead. But Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan\u2019s environment minister, in the role of president, saw his role as convener instead. As the talks wore on into their second week, this clash of outlook became increasingly problematic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe presidency was not there, not available, at key moments,\u201d one delegate said. \u201cThey asked for pieces of work to be done by parties, then ignored them,\u201d said another. \u201cThey held meetings with no clear agenda,\u201d said a third.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/cop29-climate-finance-deal-criticised-travesty-justice-stage-managed\">Cop29 climate finance deal criticised as \u2018travesty of justice\u2019 and \u2018stage-managed\u2019</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Babayev takes a different view. He believes the developed countries made a poor decision early on, by failing to put a clear offer of finance on the table. Without a set of numbers, meaningful discussions were impossible. \u201cWe were quite frustrated that the developed countries had not put forward a number much sooner,\u201d said Michai Robertson, adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis).</p> \n<p>By the second Thursday \u2013 the penultimate day \u2013 of the talks, the situation reached a crisis. That morning, the presidency issued a draft text of an agreement \u2013 but where all the important numbers should have been, there was only an X.</p> \n<p>Countries and campaigners were scathing. Oscar Soria, a director at the Common Initiative thinktank, said: \u201cThe negotiating placeholder \u2018X\u2019 for climate finance is a testament of the ineptitude from rich nations and emerging economies that are failing to find a workable solution for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>But if the X text appeared farcical to many, what followed was even worse. Developed countries were presented with a text to which they were willing to put a number \u2013 and they put forward one that was deliberately low. The second iteration of the draft gave a number of $250bn, even though countries were widely primed to expect $300bn. The Guardian had it privately confirmed by developed countries on the eve of the talks that a tripling of the $100bn goal \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/25/cop29-deal-fails-consider-inflation-not-tripling-target-economists\">albeit not accounting for inflation</a> \u2013 was likely to be the offer.</p> \n<p>While the tactic of opening with a lowball offer might be common practice in financial negotiations from housebuying to horse-trading, at Cop it ignited fury. Climate breakdown is an existential issue for poor countries, and here they were, being played.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a slap in the face,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, a cofounder of the thinktank Power Shift Africa. \u201cNo developing country will fall for this. It\u2019s not clear what kind of trick the presidency is trying to pull. They\u2019ve already disappointed everyone, but they have now angered and offended the developing world.\u201d</p> \n<p>By midnight on Friday, the palpable tension in the negotiating rooms made it clear the ruse had backfired. At an emergency meeting at 7am on Saturday, the EU, the US, the UK, Australia and a few others sat down to take bleary-eyed stock. Countries were urged to come out with their final offers. The figure of $300bn was agreed and relayed to the presidency.</p> \n<p>From then it was clear that the talks were going to run at least all day. \u201cWe were very nervous that there would not be a deal,\u201d one presidency source said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"728bf6bb-b4f2-41fd-83c3-ddd9cad4774d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TReD05y7AXA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Protesters lined up outside the hall to tell negotiators \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Frustrated by what they saw as their needs being ignored, delegates from Aosis and the LDCs negotiating blocs walked out of a key meeting, late on Saturday afternoon. It looked as if the talks might collapse in a manner similar to Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009, which descended into mayhem at about the same stage.</p> \n<p>Frantic diplomacy now took place behind the scenes. Negotiators holed up in meeting rooms, while other delegates rushed between country offices, trying to find common ground. Plenary meetings were called, then abandoned. Rumours of new texts flew about the conference centre, and deadlines for the issue of new drafts came and went.</p> \n<p>Late on Saturday evening, Babayev took to the stage for a plenary session, to the puzzlement of observers, as it was clear there was no deal in the offing. Instead, he gavelled through a set of inconsequential measures, then left the stage. The sense of talks spiralling out of control took hold.</p> \n<p>While most of the focus was on the finance deal, one key element of Cop29 was also missing. At Cop28, countries had committed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d. That hard-won resolution, which had the support of a large majority of both developed and developing countries, was in danger at Cop29. Saudi Arabia came to the conference determined to unpick the commitment. The country played an openly obstructive role in meeting after meeting, delegates from many countries said privately. Each attempt to include the commitment, from the setting of the agenda as the Cop opened, to the negotiations late on Saturday night, was met with intransigence or even attempts at subversion.</p> \n<p>In one extraordinary development, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/23/revealed-saudi-arabia-accused-of-modifying-official-cop29-negotiating-text\">the Guardian revealed</a> that a Saudi delegate had been accused of editing a piece of text without full consultation, leading to outrage among delegates and campaigners.</p> \n<p>Nations fought Saudi Arabia to retain crucial wording that would have allowed a version \u2013 rather weaker than many had hoped, but still workable \u2013 of the commitment to transition away from fossil fuels to stay in. That text was put to one side, to the relief of supporters.</p> \n<p>By 11pm on Saturday, the signs of delegates having barely slept for days was showing. Ministers stared out of red eyes at text, officials swayed slightly as they scrolled through their smartphones in corridors, and the queues outside the remaining coffee outlets lengthened. Workers arrived to start dismantling parts of the conference centre. The stark truth was finally clear. Delegates had a choice between going home without a deal \u2013 and therefore no promise of money \u2013 and returning to the same negotiations next year, with Trump as US president. Or they could accept the offer that was on the table.</p> \n<p>Around midnight, delegates started gathering in the plenary room. Miliband could be glimpsed deep in conversation with US official Sue Biniaz. EU representatives rushed in. Aosis nations and the LDCs started to gather. Panama\u2019s Monterrey, with his distinctive hat, was chatting to fellow Latin American delegations.</p> \n<p>Babayev started to speak \u2013 and then, just as abruptly, adjourned. Delegates stayed in the hall. It was clear a deal was close, but not yet settled. </p> \n<p>India, the world\u2019s third biggest emitter and fifth biggest economy, has played an important role in many Cops, and prides itself on sticking up for the developing world \u2013 and has held up agreements at several previous Cops for this reason. Both an enthusiastic advocate of renewable energy and a heavy user of coal, it can sometimes appear stuck between fossil fuels and a clean-tech future.</p> \n<p>While China wanted a deal at Cop29, according to many insiders, India was more ambivalent. The country wanted to be able to benefit from climate finance to bolster its transition to a clean economy, but it also wanted developed countries to pay far more than had been offered.</p> \n<p>Indu Murthy, a director at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy in India, said before the final stages: \u201cIndia will most likely not want to make any compromises as India\u2019s stand and demand are valid and justifiable. This stems from the fact that India is grappling with the adverse impacts of climate change, which have implications for lives, livelihoods, and the economy. Developed countries demanding ramping up of ambition by developing countries are continuing to consume the remaining carbon budget.\u201d</p> \n<p>Throughout the Cop, India had raised no objections to the climate finance deal, according to one source. \u201cThey had every opportunity, but they went through every meeting without raising objections,\u201d said the source.</p> \n<p>As the clock ticked on, delegations from several countries tried to talk both to the Indian delegation in Baku, and on hotlines to the central government in Delhi. India\u2019s ally China made such calls; so did the United Arab Emirates, host of last year\u2019s Cop, according to several sources; and even Saudi Arabia, according to one source.</p> \n<p>India\u2019s objection was to the wording of a paragraph on multilateral development banks. The country wanted assurances over how its potential contributions to the banks would be treated in climate finance terms. Delhi would have an opt-out, the team was told. That seemed to be enough.</p> \n<p>Yalchin Rafiyev, lead negotiator for Azerbaijan, said he understood then that India was agreeing to the final deal, and it was gavelled through. \u201cThey did not object. They were requesting a statement from the floor, not an objection,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>India did not see it that way. Chandni Raini, the country\u2019s chief negotiator, afterwards accused Azerbaijan of \u201cstage managing\u201d the talks and decried the outcome as a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some insiders speculated that India was having it both ways \u2013 not preventing a deal, but registering afterwards its dislike.</p> \n<p>In the confusion that followed, just as the developed countries were beginning to celebrate having got a deal through, there was another final twist to Cop29. The part of the agreement dealing with the transition away from fossil fuels had been rejected. It was postponed until next year.</p> \n<p>Just after 5am, the extraordinary Cop29 conference ended. Almost no one was left satisfied \u2013 the developed countries lost their \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d; the developing world had a deal that was described as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and a failure.</p> \n<p>Some key decisions will have to wait for next year, when Cop30 will take place in Bel\u00e9m. Brazil was already facing one of the toughest Cops ever, as it will be the last chance for countries to come forward with new national plans on cutting emissions, in line with the 1.5C target. Now next year\u2019s conference will take place with the bitter taste of recrimination from Baku, and in the shadow of Trump\u2019s White House. \u201cPiling all of this on to Brazil is just a nightmare,\u201d said Claudio Angelo, of the Observat\u00f3rio do Clima. </p> \n<p>After all the divisions revealed over the past fortnight, the irony is that nearly every country gathered in Baku acknowledged that climate finance for the poor world was good for the whole planet. As Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, put it: \u201cThe world must pay up, or humanity will pay the price. Climate finance is not charity, it\u2019s an investment.\u201d</p>",

One veteran complained: \u201cToo many delegates have no idea how finance works \u2013 and didn\u2019t bring people who do.\u201d This lack of a blueprint for discussions led to an overreliance on the presidency, with many countries looking to Azerbaijan to lead. But Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan\u2019s environment minister, in the role of president, saw his role as convener instead. As the talks wore on into their second week, this clash of outlook became increasingly problematic. \u201cThe presidency was not there, not available, at key moments,\u201d one delegate said. \u201cThey asked for pieces of work to be done by parties, then ignored them,\u201d said another. \u201cThey held meetings with no clear agenda,\u201d said a third. Babayev takes a different view. He believes the developed countries made a poor decision early on, by failing to put a clear offer of finance on the table. Without a set of numbers, meaningful discussions were impossible. \u201cWe were quite frustrated that the developed countries had not put forward a number much sooner,\u201d said Michai Robertson, adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis). By the second Thursday \u2013 the penultimate day \u2013 of the talks, the situation reached a crisis. That morning, the presidency issued a draft text of an agreement \u2013 but where all the important numbers should have been, there was only an X. Countries and campaigners were scathing. Oscar Soria, a director at the Common Initiative thinktank, said: \u201cThe negotiating placeholder \u2018X\u2019 for climate finance is a testament of the ineptitude from rich nations and emerging economies that are failing to find a workable solution for everyone.\u201d But if the X text appeared farcical to many, what followed was even worse. Developed countries were presented with a text to which they were willing to put a number \u2013 and they put forward one that was deliberately low. The second iteration of the draft gave a number of $250bn, even though countries were widely primed to expect $300bn. The Guardian had it privately confirmed by developed countries on the eve of the talks that a tripling of the $100bn goal \u2013 albeit not accounting for inflation \u2013 was likely to be the offer. While the tactic of opening with a lowball offer might be common practice in financial negotiations from housebuying to horse-trading, at Cop it ignited fury. Climate breakdown is an existential issue for poor countries, and here they were, being played. \u201cThis is a slap in the face,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, a cofounder of the thinktank Power Shift Africa. \u201cNo developing country will fall for this. It\u2019s not clear what kind of trick the presidency is trying to pull. They\u2019ve already disappointed everyone, but they have now angered and offended the developing world.\u201d By midnight on Friday, the palpable tension in the negotiating rooms made it clear the ruse had backfired. At an emergency meeting at 7am on Saturday, the EU, the US, the UK, Australia and a few others sat down to take bleary-eyed stock. Countries were urged to come out with their final offers. The figure of $300bn was agreed and relayed to the presidency. From then it was clear that the talks were going to run at least all day. \u201cWe were very nervous that there would not be a deal,\u201d one presidency source said. Protesters lined up outside the hall to tell negotiators \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Frustrated by what they saw as their needs being ignored, delegates from Aosis and the LDCs negotiating blocs walked out of a key meeting, late on Saturday afternoon. It looked as if the talks might collapse in a manner similar to Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009, which descended into mayhem at about the same stage. Frantic diplomacy now took place behind the scenes. Negotiators holed up in meeting rooms, while other delegates rushed between country offices, trying to find common ground. Plenary meetings were called, then abandoned. Rumours of new texts flew about the conference centre, and deadlines for the issue of new drafts came and went. Late on Saturday evening, Babayev took to the stage for a plenary session, to the puzzlement of observers, as it was clear there was no deal in the offing. Instead, he gavelled through a set of inconsequential measures, then left the stage. The sense of talks spiralling out of control took hold. While most of the focus was on the finance deal, one key element of Cop29 was also missing. At Cop28, countries had committed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 to \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d. That hard-won resolution, which had the support of a large majority of both developed and developing countries, was in danger at Cop29. Saudi Arabia came to the conference determined to unpick the commitment. The country played an openly obstructive role in meeting after meeting, delegates from many countries said privately. Each attempt to include the commitment, from the setting of the agenda as the Cop opened, to the negotiations late on Saturday night, was met with intransigence or even attempts at subversion. In one extraordinary development, the Guardian revealed that a Saudi delegate had been accused of editing a piece of text without full consultation, leading to outrage among delegates and campaigners. Nations fought Saudi Arabia to retain crucial wording that would have allowed a version \u2013 rather weaker than many had hoped, but still workable \u2013 of the commitment to transition away from fossil fuels to stay in. That text was put to one side, to the relief of supporters. By 11pm on Saturday, the signs of delegates having barely slept for days was showing. Ministers stared out of red eyes at text, officials swayed slightly as they scrolled through their smartphones in corridors, and the queues outside the remaining coffee outlets lengthened. Workers arrived to start dismantling parts of the conference centre. The stark truth was finally clear. Delegates had a choice between going home without a deal \u2013 and therefore no promise of money \u2013 and returning to the same negotiations next year, with Trump as US president. Or they could accept the offer that was on the table. Around midnight, delegates started gathering in the plenary room. Miliband could be glimpsed deep in conversation with US official Sue Biniaz. EU representatives rushed in. Aosis nations and the LDCs started to gather. Panama\u2019s Monterrey, with his distinctive hat, was chatting to fellow Latin American delegations. Babayev started to speak \u2013 and then, just as abruptly, adjourned. Delegates stayed in the hall. It was clear a deal was close, but not yet settled. India, the world\u2019s third biggest emitter and fifth biggest economy, has played an important role in many Cops, and prides itself on sticking up for the developing world \u2013 and has held up agreements at several previous Cops for this reason. Both an enthusiastic advocate of renewable energy and a heavy user of coal, it can sometimes appear stuck between fossil fuels and a clean-tech future. While China wanted a deal at Cop29, according to many insiders, India was more ambivalent. The country wanted to be able to benefit from climate finance to bolster its transition to a clean economy, but it also wanted developed countries to pay far more than had been offered. Indu Murthy, a director at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy in India, said before the final stages: \u201cIndia will most likely not want to make any compromises as India\u2019s stand and demand are valid and justifiable. This stems from the fact that India is grappling with the adverse impacts of climate change, which have implications for lives, livelihoods, and the economy. Developed countries demanding ramping up of ambition by developing countries are continuing to consume the remaining carbon budget.\u201d Throughout the Cop, India had raised no objections to the climate finance deal, according to one source. \u201cThey had every opportunity, but they went through every meeting without raising objections,\u201d said the source. As the clock ticked on, delegations from several countries tried to talk both to the Indian delegation in Baku, and on hotlines to the central government in Delhi. India\u2019s ally China made such calls; so did the United Arab Emirates, host of last year\u2019s Cop, according to several sources; and even Saudi Arabia, according to one source. India\u2019s objection was to the wording of a paragraph on multilateral development banks. The country wanted assurances over how its potential contributions to the banks would be treated in climate finance terms. Delhi would have an opt-out, the team was told. That seemed to be enough. Yalchin Rafiyev, lead negotiator for Azerbaijan, said he understood then that India was agreeing to the final deal, and it was gavelled through. \u201cThey did not object. They were requesting a statement from the floor, not an objection,\u201d he said. India did not see it that way. Chandni Raini, the country\u2019s chief negotiator, afterwards accused Azerbaijan of \u201cstage managing\u201d the talks and decried the outcome as a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d. Some insiders speculated that India was having it both ways \u2013 not preventing a deal, but registering afterwards its dislike. In the confusion that followed, just as the developed countries were beginning to celebrate having got a deal through, there was another final twist to Cop29. The part of the agreement dealing with the transition away from fossil fuels had been rejected. It was postponed until next year. Just after 5am, the extraordinary Cop29 conference ended. Almost no one was left satisfied \u2013 the developed countries lost their \u201ctransition away from fossil fuels\u201d; the developing world had a deal that was described as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and a failure. Some key decisions will have to wait for next year, when Cop30 will take place in Bel\u00e9m. Brazil was already facing one of the toughest Cops ever, as it will be the last chance for countries to come forward with new national plans on cutting emissions, in line with the 1.5C target. Now next year\u2019s conference will take place with the bitter taste of recrimination from Baku, and in the shadow of Trump\u2019s White House. \u201cPiling all of this on to Brazil is just a nightmare,\u201d said Claudio Angelo, of the Observat\u00f3rio do Clima. After all the divisions revealed over the past fortnight, the irony is that nearly every country gathered in Baku acknowledged that climate finance for the poor world was good for the whole planet. As Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, put it: \u201cThe world must pay up, or humanity will pay the price. Climate finance is not charity, it\u2019s an investment.\u201d",

Murphy said tackling DFSV required a whole-of-government response. \u201cIn the last seven days we have had 1,156 calls to DV and sadly that\u2019s a 30% decrease on the week prior, so it\u2019s still a huge consumer of policing services,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are doing a remarkable amount of work but it really rests with prevention and education across the other agencies as well, such as health, housing and territory families.\u201d On Tuesday, the national commissioner for DFSV, Micaela Cronin, told ABC radio the inquest was \u201cvery unusual\u201d in that the coroner was \u201cholding everyone to account\u201d. The coroner was \u201cusing every lever in her power to ensure changes are made\u201d, Cronin said. She said that there had been eight further DFSV deaths of women and one sistergirl in the NT since the beginning of June, four of them from Katherine. \u201cIf we\u2019d seen that many women die in a small country town, relatively speaking, anywhere else in the country, we would see national outrage \u2013 quite rightly so. We don\u2019t see that in the Northern Territory,\u201d she said. The federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, said the NT has received $180m in federal funding to government and the Aboriginal community-controlled sector. \u201cAnd we want them to spend the money where it\u2019s needed. I\u2019ve certainly been speaking to the women\u2019s shelters, the family and domestic violence sector. I know they need that funding and I would urge the Northern Territory government to actually spend where it\u2019s required, to assist those sectors,\u201d McCarthy said. The NT government said that they are carefully reviewing the coroner\u2019s recommendations. The Country Liberal party says it has committed $180m over five years to respond to domestic and family violence and is allocating money where it is most needed.",

      "bodyText": "The Victorian government has unveiled long-awaited legislation to overhaul the state\u2019s anti-vilification laws, the culmination of more than five years of work. The justice legislation amendment (anti-vilification and social cohesion) bill 2024 was introduced to parliament on Tuesday and will be debated in the new year. Jacinta Allan said the bill \u2013 which expands on protection against racial and religious vilification \u2013 would cover a broad range of personal attributes including sexuality and disability. \u201cIt will keep us safe from vilification and hate in public, on our streets, in our workplaces, in the corridors of universities \u2013 everywhere we go to participate in this great community of Victoria as equals,\u201d the premier said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cIt will also help keep us united against that American-style division that is starting to creep more and more into our community, into our dialogue, into our society, by cracking down on those who try and whip up hatred.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about the bill. How did this come about? The push to strengthen the laws began with the former upper house MP Fiona Patten, who introduced her own bill in 2019. She argued that existing laws were inadequate, especially in addressing online abuse and violence targeting women, the LGBTIQ+ community and people with disabilities. Labor referred the bill to a parliamentary inquiry. In 2021 this recommended broadening the laws to cover these groups and strengthening penalties for vilification, finding there had been only two prosecutions in the 20 years since the laws took effect. The government began an extensive consultation process. \u201cI\u2019ve spent almost two years in consultation with those that are experiencing some of the worst features that can appear in the community,\u201d said the attorney general, Jaclyn Symes. \u201cIt has cemented in me an obligation to act.\u201d She said the laws were designed to protect people who took part in the consultation process, including a Muslim woman afraid to use public transport, Jewish children fearing antisemitism and a queer schoolboy facing severe bullying. What are the bill\u2019s key elements? The legislation will broaden existing legal protection against racial and religious vilification to include disability, gender identity, sex and sexual orientation. Labor says this will protect drag performers (under gender identity) and include people with mental illness or HIV/Aids (under disability). The bill also extends protection to those with a \u201cpersonal association\u201d to someone with a protected attribute, such as the parent of a disabled child. \u201cThat means that all Victorians will now be protected against vilification and hate,\u201d Allan said. What are the penalties? The bill creates two new criminal offence. The first will be to \u201cincite hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group based on their protected attribute\u201d, with a penalty of up to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The second will be to \u201cthreaten physical harm or property damage against a person or a group based on their protected attribute\u201d, which carries up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. These offences will apply in any context \u2013 private, public or online. The existing serious vilification offence requires proof that a person has incited hatred and threatened physical harm or property damage. According to the government, proving both elements made prosecutions difficult. The bill also removes the requirement for police to seek consent from the director of public prosecutions to pursue offences, except when the accused is under 18. What about civil laws? Two new civil protections will be introduced, making it easier for people to pursue legal action for comments made in public spaces, including on social media, as well as the display of symbols or flags. The government says its priority will be to introduce the criminal offences first, with the civil protections to follow. What about freedom of speech and freedom of religion? The bill retains exceptions that protect activities carried out for \u201cgenuine religious, academic, artistic, public interest or scientific reasons\u201d. Symes said these covered\u201cworshipping, practising, proselytising and teaching religion\u201d. \u201cBeing able to proselytise what you what your religion stands for is unaffected by this bill,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be used as a cloak for unabated abuse.\u201d The bill introduces a \u201cpolitical expression\u201d defence for the criminal incitement offence, which the government said would protect political communication. But threats of physical harm or property damage would not be considered as having a genuine political purpose. Other common law defences including self-defence, duress and mental impairment apply. What has the reaction been? The government was joined at its press conference with members of several community and religious groups, including the Australian Multicultural Foundation, the Hindu Council of Australia, the head of Women With Disabilities Victoria, the gender equality commissioner and the commissioner for LGBTIQA+ communities. Among this group was a rabbi, Gabi Kaltmann, who welcomed the laws amid a rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter whether you wear a kippa or a hijab, if someone vilifies you, if someone wants to go after you, your faith, your background, your belief, your sexuality, the chances are that they will be charged and go to jail or heavily fined,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all become safer.\u201d Kaltmann urged other religious leaders to support the reforms. The Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, told the Age last week he was concerned the changes could erode freedom of religious expression. While the church \u201cabhors vilification of any kind\u201d, Comensoli this week said: \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s clarification that it intends that Victorians reasonably sharing their faith will continue to be protected by the law and will follow the progress of the bill closely.\u201d When could the bill come into force? Symes said she expected the bill would pass the upper house in March, meaning the new criminal offences would be in place by September.",

The inquiry by the oversight board will look at a post from a German account featuring an AI-generated image emblazoned with anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p> <p>It is part of a wave of AI-made rightwing content on social media networks. Posts elsewhere from Europe\u2019s political extremes range from the Italian far right\u2019s deployment of \u201cphoto-realistic\u201d images of women and children eating insects to bolster a conspiracy theory about the intentions of \u201ca global elite\u201d, to Irish far-right images of a police officer stamping on Ireland\u2019s flag and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/aug/02/how-tiktok-bots-and-ai-have-powered-a-resurgence-in-uk-far-right-violence\">Islamophobic memes</a> in the immediate aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/01/southport-stabbings-boy-charged-murder#:~:text=Alice%20Dasilva%20Aguiar%2C%20nine%2C%20Bebe,yoga%20class%20on%20Monday%20morning.\">Southport knife murders in the UK</a>.</p> <p>The use of the same models and themes and the same approach to presenting and packaging the images on social media platforms has given rise to a common aesthetic across borders, and in the EU and Britain.</p> <p>In virtually every case, far-right parties and movements have eschewed the use of any sort of watermarking or identifier on the AI images, according to experts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg because what is coming from individuals and beyond the official channels is even worse,\u201d said Salvatore Romano, the head of research at the nonprofit AI Forensics, which examined the output of parties including France\u2019s National Rally, Reconqu\u00eate and Les Patriotes.</p> <p>William Allchorn, a senior research fellow at Anglia Ruskin University, said the ease of use of AI models was appealing to a political fringe that had shown an attitude of \u201cpragmatic opportunism\u201d to new technology.</p>    <p>\u201cAI lowers the barriers to entry for creating content. You don\u2019t need coding skills or anything like that to generate these images. It is also symptomatic of far-right views going mainstream or being normalised,\u201d he said, adding that the far right appeared to have fewer moral concerns about AI imagery.</p> <p>Allchorn said more established political parties appeared warier of using AI in official campaigns: \u201cMainstream actors still have ethical concerns about the effectiveness, authenticity and reliability of these models that far-right or extremist actors are not beholden to.\u201d </p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>The German far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party and supporters of its anti-immigrant stance have been avid users of AI image generators. The image under scrutiny by Meta\u2019s content moderation board features a blond-haired, blue-eyed woman holding up her hand in a stop gesture, with a stop sign and German flag in the background.</p> <p>The text over the image says people should stop coming to Germany because the country does not need more \u201cgang-rape specialists\u201d due to the Green party\u2019s immigration policy.</p> <p>In September, the AfD\u2019s Brandenburg branch produced AI-made campaign adverts that contrast an idealised Germany featuring blond-haired and blue-eyed people with scenes of veiled women walking down streets and a person waving an LGBTQ+ flag.</p> <p>Reality Defender, a US-based deepfake detection firm, said the image could have been produced within minutes.</p> <p>Other pro-AfD groups on Facebook seen by the Guardian use AI images emblazoned with nativist or anti-immigrant slogans.

      "bodyText": "From fake images designed to cause fears of an immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d to other demonisation campaigns targeted at leaders such as Emmanuel Macron, far-right parties and activists across western Europe are at the forefront of the political weaponisation of generative artificial intelligence technology. This year\u2019s European parliamentary elections were the launchpad for a rollout of AI-generated campaigning by the European far right, experts say, which has continued to proliferate since. This month, the issue reached the independent oversight board of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta when the body opened an investigation into anti-immigration content on Facebook. The inquiry by the oversight board will look at a post from a German account featuring an AI-generated image emblazoned with anti-immigrant rhetoric. It is part of a wave of AI-made rightwing content on social media networks. Posts elsewhere from Europe\u2019s political extremes range from the Italian far right\u2019s deployment of \u201cphoto-realistic\u201d images of women and children eating insects to bolster a conspiracy theory about the intentions of \u201ca global elite\u201d, to Irish far-right images of a police officer stamping on Ireland\u2019s flag and Islamophobic memes in the immediate aftermath of the Southport knife murders in the UK. The use of the same models and themes and the same approach to presenting and packaging the images on social media platforms has given rise to a common aesthetic across borders, and in the EU and Britain. In virtually every case, far-right parties and movements have eschewed the use of any sort of watermarking or identifier on the AI images, according to experts. \u201cWhat we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg because what is coming from individuals and beyond the official channels is even worse,\u201d said Salvatore Romano, the head of research at the nonprofit AI Forensics, which examined the output of parties including France\u2019s National Rally, Reconqu\u00eate and Les Patriotes. William Allchorn, a senior research fellow at Anglia Ruskin University, said the ease of use of AI models was appealing to a political fringe that had shown an attitude of \u201cpragmatic opportunism\u201d to new technology. \u201cAI lowers the barriers to entry for creating content. You don\u2019t need coding skills or anything like that to generate these images. It is also symptomatic of far-right views going mainstream or being normalised,\u201d he said, adding that the far right appeared to have fewer moral concerns about AI imagery. Allchorn said more established political parties appeared warier of using AI in official campaigns: \u201cMainstream actors still have ethical concerns about the effectiveness, authenticity and reliability of these models that far-right or extremist actors are not beholden to.\u201d Germany The German far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party and supporters of its anti-immigrant stance have been avid users of AI image generators. The image under scrutiny by Meta\u2019s content moderation board features a blond-haired, blue-eyed woman holding up her hand in a stop gesture, with a stop sign and German flag in the background. The text over the image says people should stop coming to Germany because the country does not need more \u201cgang-rape specialists\u201d due to the Green party\u2019s immigration policy. In September, the AfD\u2019s Brandenburg branch produced AI-made campaign adverts that contrast an idealised Germany featuring blond-haired and blue-eyed people with scenes of veiled women walking down streets and a person waving an LGBTQ+ flag. Reality Defender, a US-based deepfake detection firm, said the image could have been produced within minutes. Other pro-AfD groups on Facebook seen by the Guardian use AI images emblazoned with nativist or anti-immigrant slogans. Another shows a giant pig \u2013 an animal whose meat is prohibited from consumption in Islam \u2013 chasing a group of people in Islamic clothing, with the slogan \u201cArabic film version of Godzilla\u201d. The UK In the aftermath of the Southport stabbings, when a teenager killed three young girls, AI was deployed to advertise protests and to post Islamophobic content, based on false assumptions about the identity of the alleged attacker. One image depicted bearded men in traditional Islamic dress outside parliament, with one waving a knife, behind a crying child in a union jack T-shirt. The tweet was captioned: \u201cWe must protect our children!\u201d The far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has also appeared in AI-generated images and has the technology on his own social media accounts, including one post commemorating D-day that attracted derision because it showed second world war troops marching off the beach and into the sea. France Generative AI imagery was identified as an integral part of the campaign strategy of far-fight political parties during this year\u2019s European and legislative elections in France. Posts on X included images of people approaching a beach on boats, emblazoned with an anti-immigration slogan, and videos criticising the president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cOnly far-right parties consistently used AI-generated visuals to build their websites and represent photo-realistic events that never occurred, making this a distinctive and strategic element of their campaigns,\u201d said Romano of AI Forensics. Ireland While Ireland has no successful far-right party mirroring those in other EU states, the use of generative AI surged among the country\u2019s emergent far-right street movement after riots in Dublin in November 2023. A frequent meme has featured Conor McGregor, the former mixed martial arts star who has flirted with far-right language and whose anti-government and anti-migrant messaging resonated with far-right groups. Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Connor, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said one particularly popular post on X depicted McGregor standing in front of a burning bus \u2013 an echo of one of the genuine images from the riots when a vehicle was torched in the city centre. The image was posted by the far-right UK group Britain First and later tweeted by McGregor himself before he deleted it. It received 20m views. Since then, O\u2019Connor said generative AI had been used in support of anti-immigration protests and groups and to create content to depict specific scenes that appear to be aimed at evoking anti-migrant sentiments. A campaign by the small far-right Irish People party included a post on X where it acknowledged using an AI-generated image of a \u201csupporter\u201d saying they \u201chardly recognise\u201d where they grew up. Italy In Italy, the populist Lega party published anti-trans and Islamophobic AI-generated images including a bearded pregnant man, a group of men in Arab-style clothing burning a copy of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, and Macron posing as a fictional \u201cEU soldier\u201d, in a message with anti-EU overtones. The political adverts were published on Facebook and Instagram and on the social media accounts of Lega\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini. Other non-watermarked images on Salvini\u2019s account include images of women and children eating insects, a reference to a popular rightwing conspiracy theory that the EU was preparing to make European citizens eat insect-based food.",

      "body": "<p>For quite a while, Chris McCausland kept turning down the offer to appear on Strictly Come Dancing. He wasn\u2019t going to do it this year either. \u201cIt terrified me,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind stretching myself, but I have to know something\u2019s possible.\u201d And Strictly seemed impossible. Blind since his early 20s, McCausland spent his teenage years listening to 90s grunge and throwing himself around mosh pits rather than paying any attention to ballroom dancing. So he had no idea what an American smooth or a paso doble even looked like. For some, Strictly has been unavoidable for the last 20 years, but McCausland, 47, a comedian whose natural TV home is shows such as Would I Lie to You?, says the first time he ever heard the theme tune was when he was standing in the studio on launch night.</p> <p>Why did he decide to embrace the sequins now? \u201cAs well as being a comedian, I am \u2013 whether I like it or not \u2013 representative of another group of people, people who are blind, people with a disability and people who are underrepresented.\u201d He was so nervous before the first show that he couldn\u2019t even eat. But it felt like an opportunity and a privilege, he says. \u201cWhen you weigh that up, and you stop thinking about yourself so much, and the fact that you\u2019re shitting your pants, there becomes more benefit than risk.\u201d</p> <p>He is proud to be the show\u2019s first blind contestant. \u201cI thought, if I do say no again, and they find somebody else who is blind, then I\u2019ll never do it.\u201d But he felt as if a lot was at stake. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being the butt of a joke, and if something goes wrong, I don\u2019t mind laughing about it, but there\u2019s a lot of weight in being the first blind guy on the show and it not being a disaster.\u201d The idea, he says, \u201cis to prove that this is doable. You need to do above the average significantly in order to represent in a good way and I just didn\u2019t think that would be possible.\u201d</p> <p>How wrong he was \u2013 McCausland has been brilliant. From the beginning, his footwork has been superior and at the Blackpool show just over a week ago, he scored two 10s for his American smooth. He completely commits to each performance and while he may not be the best dancer of the remaining quarter-finalists, betting companies have him as the favourite to win. \u201cIt\u2019s surprised me as much as anybody,\u201d he says with a laugh. But it has been gruelling. When we meet in the on-site cafe at Strictly\u2019s Elstree studios, he says he \u201ccan\u2019t remember the last time I didn\u2019t feel tired.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a difficult year for the show, with allegations of abuse in rehearsals emerging over the summer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to undermine anybody\u2019s experience of it, because it is stressful,\u201d says McCausland. \u201cI think it\u2019s worked well for the vast majority of people that have done it but a handful of people have had an issue and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been hard for them.\u201d He says the producers have gone \u201cout of their way\u201d to make things better than they have in the past \u2013 this includes a member of the production team now sitting in on rehearsals.</p>    <p>Having no visual frame of reference for the dances, McCausland\u2019s professional dancer partner Dianne Buswell has had to teach him using detailed descriptions, metaphors and physically putting his body into the correct shapes. \u201cSometimes she has to just yank my arms where she wants them.\u201d When the pair did the paso doble this weekend, the dramatic Latin dance, it took Buswell two days just to describe it. \u201cI was like: \u2018Are you sure this is right? It doesn\u2019t feel like anyone should be standing like this.\u2019\u201d It has been helpful, says McCausland, to come up with mental images to perfect his posture. \u201cI\u2019ve found the best thing to do is pretend you need to go the toilet and keep your cheeks clenched.\u201d </p> <p>Aside from Buswell\u2019s teaching methods, there haven\u2019t been too many adjustments to the show. Beforehand, the producers asked McCausland if he\u2019d prefer the studio audience to be quiet so he could hear where Buswell was in relation to him, but he said no. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian, part of the reason you\u2019re in it is to create a good atmosphere.\u201d He laughs and adds: \u201cI\u2019m a needy bastard.\u201d</p> <p>He has been thrilled with the support he has received from viewers. \u201cMy attitude was: I\u2019ve never seen the show, but take it seriously and put 100% into it.\u201d The remaining couples, he says, are \u201cbetter than us, so all we can do is connect with people \u2013 that\u2019s been our goal, me and Dianne, to connect with people, entertain and do the best that we can.\u201d He has pitched it perfectly, throwing himself into it while also bringing a mischievous edge to the live broadcast. After his first dance, a cha-cha-cha, he spoke about the brilliant ludicrousness of the entire show. The dance, he deadpanned, was \u201cnonsense. It\u2019s like someone\u2019s sucked all the fun out of dancing and replaced it with terms and conditions.\u201d</p> <p>Humour has been a constant in McCausland\u2019s life. It was the way the family dealt with the eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, that affected his mother and grandmother, as well as McCausland and his sister (his 11-year-old daughter has not inherited the gene). As a child, he remembers being tested to see whether he had it \u2013 at that point he still had sight, but the condition would mean it would gradually deteriorate. \u201cIt just was always a thing,\u201d he says. By the second year of primary school, he noticed that while he could see the blackboard in class, he couldn\u2019t make out much of what was on it. Did it feel as if sight loss was hanging over him? \u201cNot really. It is so slow that it\u2019s like a frog in boiling water \u2013 you don\u2019t notice it.\u201d It brought many frustrations, and still does, but he says it was \u201cnever a sad thing\u201d.</p>    <p>He grew up in a Liverpool suburb \u2013 though today, his accent is softened by nearly three decades in the south. His maths A-level teacher urged him to apply to university, and he ended up studying software engineering at Kingston, where he already had a friend. \u201cI was terrified of this big new environment when you can\u2019t see properly so he was kind of like a security blanket.\u201d By then, his sight loss was almost total. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of denial and resistance to it, especially when you\u2019re in your late teens and your early 20s. You\u2019re always thinking you can do the things you could do yesterday and you\u2019re always pretending you can see when you can\u2019t.\u201d He refused to use an aid such as a white cane. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 20, 21, you\u2019re embarrassed, you think everybody is staring at you. There\u2019s a lot of shame.\u201d</p> <p>Comedy helped. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known this at the time, but I think it was another form of denial. I never talked about being blind on stage and I think that was maybe me trying to be \u2018normal\u2019.\u201d It was partly about challenging preconceptions \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to only tell jokes about being blind \u2013 but also about him not feeling very comfortable with who he was. \u201cI always thought, if I was in the audience and someone like me came on stage I\u2019d think: \u2018Oh fucking hell, this is going to be 20 minutes of blind jokes.\u2019 Which is why I never talked about it \u2013 I always tried to make them forget and probably make myself forget.\u201d</p> <p>After university, working as a computer programmer became difficult due to his deteriorating sight. He was unemployed for a while, then he got a job in a call centre. Around that time, he challenged himself to write a five-minute comedy set. \u201cIt was never to do with a career. I just wanted to give it a go as a bit of a dare,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no performance skills whatsoever, I never did drama at school. My first gig was shit, I was so monotone. But I got enough laughs and I did it again. Then you loosen up, it becomes a hobby, you meet people and there\u2019s a community. It was adrenaline and something to look forward to.\u201d</p> <p>After being a gigging comedian for years, McCausland was invited to be on the televised standup show Live at the Apollo in 2018. It couldn\u2019t have gone better, he says, but it didn\u2019t prove to be the springboard to TV panel shows and higher profile gigs that he\u2019d hoped. He was trying to get on shows such as Mock the Week and 8 Out of 10 Cats, but failing. Why weren\u2019t they booking him? \u201cIt\u2019s a risk with any comedian,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can do standup, can you improvise? Can you be funny about topical stuff?\u201d With McCausland, there were added considerations \u2013 and he thinks TV producers would have been concerned about making changes to the show. But they could have been small adjustments \u2013 changing a picture round to an audio round, for instance. These days, he says, shows are far more open to making them.</p>    <p>He also turned down offers to be on shows which only featured other disabled people. \u201cIt happens a lot every four years, or it used to, every time the Paralympics comes around. They\u2019ll be like: \u2018We\u2019ve had this idea to put all these disabled people together in this comedy show. We\u2019ve had the idea to send all these disabled people away together.\u2019 I\u2019ve always thought that\u2019s segregation and not integration.\u201d He could have been on TV much earlier had he done these kinds of shows, he says, but any fame from them \u201cI think would have been very short-lived\u201d. He thinks progress is being made. \u201cIt\u2019s not: \u2018We\u2019re going to do Strictly for disabled people.\u2019\u201d And, while him being on the show may help improve the representation of blind and partially sighted people on TV, \u201cI think the more important thing is everybody else seeing somebody blind on Strictly. It\u2019s good that people can see somebody like themselves, but our problem is not ourselves; our problem is everybody else\u2019s low expectations of us.\u201d</p> <p>McCausland has had a few acting roles, including in the children\u2019s show Me Too! and Jimmy McGovern\u2019s drama Moving On. As for the tricky subject of whether actors should only be cast in disabled roles if they themselves are disabled, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as cut and dried as that. The problem isn\u2019t \u2018can non-disabled people play disabled people?\u2019, the problem is there should be more disabled casting.\u201d Even now, he says, usually \u201csomebody only uses a wheelchair if that is the story. We need to get to the point where somebody has a script and they go: \u2018Well, why can\u2019t they use a wheelchair? It doesn\u2019t mention it in the script but why can\u2019t this person be deaf?\u2019\u201d That said, he adds with a laugh, he<strong> </strong>has written and is starring in a Christmas film for Sky, Bad Tidings, with the comedian Lee Mack, in which \u201cthe whole point of the film is a blind guy catching burglars. I\u2019ve written that because I thought it would be funny, but I\u2019ve created that job for myself.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s busy now \u2013 he\u2019s about to go on a huge tour: \u201cAnd it goes on until I\u2019m dead.\u201d To crown this year, I\u2019m hoping McCausland triumphs on Strictly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/11/absolutely-spectacular-why-chris-mccausland-will-win-strictly-and-save-the-show\">\u2018Absolutely spectacular\u2019: why Chris McCausland will win Strictly \u2013 and save the show </a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has really only been in the last 10 years or so that, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve maybe been comfortable in my own skin and happy to be me\u201d. It was partly getting older, and having more life experience, but it also had a lot to do with the birth of his daughter. \u201cI think that really changes your outlook on life and yourself,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "For quite a while, Chris McCausland kept turning down the offer to appear on Strictly Come Dancing. He wasn\u2019t going to do it this year either. \u201cIt terrified me,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind stretching myself, but I have to know something\u2019s possible.\u201d And Strictly seemed impossible. Blind since his early 20s, McCausland spent his teenage years listening to 90s grunge and throwing himself around mosh pits rather than paying any attention to ballroom dancing. So he had no idea what an American smooth or a paso doble even looked like. For some, Strictly has been unavoidable for the last 20 years, but McCausland, 47, a comedian whose natural TV home is shows such as Would I Lie to You?, says the first time he ever heard the theme tune was when he was standing in the studio on launch night. Why did he decide to embrace the sequins now? \u201cAs well as being a comedian, I am \u2013 whether I like it or not \u2013 representative of another group of people, people who are blind, people with a disability and people who are underrepresented.\u201d He was so nervous before the first show that he couldn\u2019t even eat. But it felt like an opportunity and a privilege, he says. \u201cWhen you weigh that up, and you stop thinking about yourself so much, and the fact that you\u2019re shitting your pants, there becomes more benefit than risk.\u201d He is proud to be the show\u2019s first blind contestant. \u201cI thought, if I do say no again, and they find somebody else who is blind, then I\u2019ll never do it.\u201d But he felt as if a lot was at stake. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being the butt of a joke, and if something goes wrong, I don\u2019t mind laughing about it, but there\u2019s a lot of weight in being the first blind guy on the show and it not being a disaster.\u201d The idea, he says, \u201cis to prove that this is doable. You need to do above the average significantly in order to represent in a good way and I just didn\u2019t think that would be possible.\u201d How wrong he was \u2013 McCausland has been brilliant. From the beginning, his footwork has been superior and at the Blackpool show just over a week ago, he scored two 10s for his American smooth. He completely commits to each performance and while he may not be the best dancer of the remaining quarter-finalists, betting companies have him as the favourite to win. \u201cIt\u2019s surprised me as much as anybody,\u201d he says with a laugh. But it has been gruelling. When we meet in the on-site cafe at Strictly\u2019s Elstree studios, he says he \u201ccan\u2019t remember the last time I didn\u2019t feel tired.\u201d It has been a difficult year for the show, with allegations of abuse in rehearsals emerging over the summer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to undermine anybody\u2019s experience of it, because it is stressful,\u201d says McCausland. \u201cI think it\u2019s worked well for the vast majority of people that have done it but a handful of people have had an issue and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been hard for them.\u201d He says the producers have gone \u201cout of their way\u201d to make things better than they have in the past \u2013 this includes a member of the production team now sitting in on rehearsals. Having no visual frame of reference for the dances, McCausland\u2019s professional dancer partner Dianne Buswell has had to teach him using detailed descriptions, metaphors and physically putting his body into the correct shapes. \u201cSometimes she has to just yank my arms where she wants them.\u201d When the pair did the paso doble this weekend, the dramatic Latin dance, it took Buswell two days just to describe it. \u201cI was like: \u2018Are you sure this is right? It doesn\u2019t feel like anyone should be standing like this.\u2019\u201d It has been helpful, says McCausland, to come up with mental images to perfect his posture. \u201cI\u2019ve found the best thing to do is pretend you need to go the toilet and keep your cheeks clenched.\u201d Aside from Buswell\u2019s teaching methods, there haven\u2019t been too many adjustments to the show. Beforehand, the producers asked McCausland if he\u2019d prefer the studio audience to be quiet so he could hear where Buswell was in relation to him, but he said no. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian, part of the reason you\u2019re in it is to create a good atmosphere.\u201d He laughs and adds: \u201cI\u2019m a needy bastard.\u201d He has been thrilled with the support he has received from viewers. \u201cMy attitude was: I\u2019ve never seen the show, but take it seriously and put 100% into it.\u201d The remaining couples, he says, are \u201cbetter than us, so all we can do is connect with people \u2013 that\u2019s been our goal, me and Dianne, to connect with people, entertain and do the best that we can.\u201d He has pitched it perfectly, throwing himself into it while also bringing a mischievous edge to the live broadcast. After his first dance, a cha-cha-cha, he spoke about the brilliant ludicrousness of the entire show. The dance, he deadpanned, was \u201cnonsense. It\u2019s like someone\u2019s sucked all the fun out of dancing and replaced it with terms and conditions.\u201d Humour has been a constant in McCausland\u2019s life. It was the way the family dealt with the eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, that affected his mother and grandmother, as well as McCausland and his sister (his 11-year-old daughter has not inherited the gene). As a child, he remembers being tested to see whether he had it \u2013 at that point he still had sight, but the condition would mean it would gradually deteriorate. \u201cIt just was always a thing,\u201d he says. By the second year of primary school, he noticed that while he could see the blackboard in class, he couldn\u2019t make out much of what was on it. Did it feel as if sight loss was hanging over him? \u201cNot really. It is so slow that it\u2019s like a frog in boiling water \u2013 you don\u2019t notice it.\u201d It brought many frustrations, and still does, but he says it was \u201cnever a sad thing\u201d. He grew up in a Liverpool suburb \u2013 though today, his accent is softened by nearly three decades in the south. His maths A-level teacher urged him to apply to university, and he ended up studying software engineering at Kingston, where he already had a friend. \u201cI was terrified of this big new environment when you can\u2019t see properly so he was kind of like a security blanket.\u201d By then, his sight loss was almost total. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of denial and resistance to it, especially when you\u2019re in your late teens and your early 20s. You\u2019re always thinking you can do the things you could do yesterday and you\u2019re always pretending you can see when you can\u2019t.\u201d He refused to use an aid such as a white cane. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 20, 21, you\u2019re embarrassed, you think everybody is staring at you. There\u2019s a lot of shame.\u201d Comedy helped. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have known this at the time, but I think it was another form of denial. I never talked about being blind on stage and I think that was maybe me trying to be \u2018normal\u2019.\u201d It was partly about challenging preconceptions \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to only tell jokes about being blind \u2013 but also about him not feeling very comfortable with who he was. \u201cI always thought, if I was in the audience and someone like me came on stage I\u2019d think: \u2018Oh fucking hell, this is going to be 20 minutes of blind jokes.\u2019 Which is why I never talked about it \u2013 I always tried to make them forget and probably make myself forget.\u201d After university, working as a computer programmer became difficult due to his deteriorating sight. He was unemployed for a while, then he got a job in a call centre. Around that time, he challenged himself to write a five-minute comedy set. \u201cIt was never to do with a career. I just wanted to give it a go as a bit of a dare,\u201d he says. \u201cI had no performance skills whatsoever, I never did drama at school. My first gig was shit, I was so monotone. But I got enough laughs and I did it again. Then you loosen up, it becomes a hobby, you meet people and there\u2019s a community. It was adrenaline and something to look forward to.\u201d After being a gigging comedian for years, McCausland was invited to be on the televised standup show Live at the Apollo in 2018. It couldn\u2019t have gone better, he says, but it didn\u2019t prove to be the springboard to TV panel shows and higher profile gigs that he\u2019d hoped. He was trying to get on shows such as Mock the Week and 8 Out of 10 Cats, but failing. Why weren\u2019t they booking him? \u201cIt\u2019s a risk with any comedian,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can do standup, can you improvise? Can you be funny about topical stuff?\u201d With McCausland, there were added considerations \u2013 and he thinks TV producers would have been concerned about making changes to the show. But they could have been small adjustments \u2013 changing a picture round to an audio round, for instance. These days, he says, shows are far more open to making them. He also turned down offers to be on shows which only featured other disabled people. \u201cIt happens a lot every four years, or it used to, every time the Paralympics comes around. They\u2019ll be like: \u2018We\u2019ve had this idea to put all these disabled people together in this comedy show. We\u2019ve had the idea to send all these disabled people away together.\u2019 I\u2019ve always thought that\u2019s segregation and not integration.\u201d He could have been on TV much earlier had he done these kinds of shows, he says, but any fame from them \u201cI think would have been very short-lived\u201d. He thinks progress is being made. \u201cIt\u2019s not: \u2018We\u2019re going to do Strictly for disabled people.\u2019\u201d And, while him being on the show may help improve the representation of blind and partially sighted people on TV, \u201cI think the more important thing is everybody else seeing somebody blind on Strictly. It\u2019s good that people can see somebody like themselves, but our problem is not ourselves; our problem is everybody else\u2019s low expectations of us.\u201d McCausland has had a few acting roles, including in the children\u2019s show Me Too! and Jimmy McGovern\u2019s drama Moving On. As for the tricky subject of whether actors should only be cast in disabled roles if they themselves are disabled, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as cut and dried as that. The problem isn\u2019t \u2018can non-disabled people play disabled people?\u2019, the problem is there should be more disabled casting.\u201d Even now, he says, usually \u201csomebody only uses a wheelchair if that is the story. We need to get to the point where somebody has a script and they go: \u2018Well, why can\u2019t they use a wheelchair? It doesn\u2019t mention it in the script but why can\u2019t this person be deaf?\u2019\u201d That said, he adds with a laugh, he has written and is starring in a Christmas film for Sky, Bad Tidings, with the comedian Lee Mack, in which \u201cthe whole point of the film is a blind guy catching burglars. I\u2019ve written that because I thought it would be funny, but I\u2019ve created that job for myself.\u201d He\u2019s busy now \u2013 he\u2019s about to go on a huge tour: \u201cAnd it goes on until I\u2019m dead.\u201d To crown this year, I\u2019m hoping McCausland triumphs on Strictly. It has really only been in the last 10 years or so that, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve maybe been comfortable in my own skin and happy to be me\u201d. It was partly getting older, and having more life experience, but it also had a lot to do with the birth of his daughter. \u201cI think that really changes your outlook on life and yourself,\u201d he says. He had been fairly pragmatic about the impact of sight loss on his life, and ready to pivot careers when necessary, \u201cwhereas being a dad, you can\u2019t just decide to find something else to do. I worried about it a lot, and there\u2019s a lot of slack that my wife picks up, a lot of the logistical stuff.\u201d But he loves his work, especially since he has found his own voice \u2013 an authenticity that has gone a long way to endear him to Strictly fans. \u201cYou stop trying to have a persona or put yourself across in a certain way, or even mimic other people. I did have a moment where I just kind of settled into being me \u2013 and that worked.\u201d \u2022 Tickets for Chris McCausland\u2019s comedy tour Yonks! are on sale now",

      "body": "<p>Angela Merkel was notoriously discreet and privacy-conscious as Germany\u2019s chancellor, rarely veering off message during her 16 years in office.</p> <p>In her eagerly anticipated political autobiography <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/freedom-9781035020751/\">Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021</a>, she has hardly turned into a gossipmonger overnight. But across 721 pages \u2013 published on Tuesday in German and English thanks to nine different translators working on chunks of the book simultaneously \u2013 there are glimpses of a Merkel previously unseen.</p> <p>Here are eight things we learned.</p>  <h2>Regrets? She has very few\u2026</h2>  <p>Merkel\u2019s policies on migration, nuclear energy and Russia have come under severe scrutiny in the three years since she left office. But Freedom is not a book of any major mea culpas.</p> <p>Her decision to accept more than 1 million refugees, mostly Syrian, into Germany in 2015 was not a mistake, she says: \u201cThe opposite is true.\u201d Her 2011 policy U-turn on nuclear energy, leading to the phase-out of the country\u2019s remaining reactors, came about because the accident in Fukushima, Japan, \u201cchanged my perception of risk posed by nuclear energy\u201d. She says she wouldn\u2019t recommend the use of nuclear in the future either.</p> <p>The book presents a number of reasons why she and the then French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, were right to block Ukraine and Georgia from joining Nato\u2019s membership action plan (Map) in 2008 \u2013 a decision heavily criticised by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion. With her veto, she says, she was considering not just Ukraine\u2019s security but also the need to \u201cincrease the efficacy of Nato as a whole\u201d.</p>     <h2>... but there are a couple</h2>  <p>Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/24/angela-merkel-tormented-brexit-vote-humiliation-eu\">genuinely shook Merkel</a>: she experienced it as \u201ca humiliation, a disgrace for us\u201d, which left the EU weakened, and she asked herself whether she and other European leaders should have done more to keep Britain in. \u201cI was tormented by whether I should have made even more concessions toward the UK,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a full admission of an error, because she concludes that Brexit was a self-inflicted wound that Britain\u2019s neighbours could have done little to prevent. By promising a referendum to appease the hardliners in his party, she writes, David Cameron \u201cput himself in the hands of those who were skeptical about the European Union, and was never able to escape this dependency\u201d.</p> <p>Merkel also corrects her stance on her domestic fiscal policy, even if this too is not exactly phrased as a regret. The \u201cdebt brake\u201d mechanism, which limits Germany\u2019s budget deficit to 0.35% of GDP, was enshrined in the constitution during Merkel\u2019s first term. It was a totemic policy she steadfastly defended for the rest of her reign, in the face of critics who said it was leading to a chronic underinvestment in infrastructure.</p> <p>But in her memoir, which comes out three weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/german-government-on-brink-of-collapse-after-olaf-scholz-sacks-finance-minister\">her successor government collapsed</a> over the debt brake question, she breezily suggests that the mechanism now needs to be reformed, \u201cto allow higher levels of debt to be assumed for the sake of investment in the future\u201d. A gift to the next German chancellor, who is likely to hail from her Christian Democratic party, or a poisoned chalice?</p>   <h2>Never trust a photograph...</h2>  <p>There are many photographs and clips of Merkel in power, but not all are what they seem. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/germany-daunted-by-great-expectations-as-obama-passes-baton-to-merkel\">One viral image</a> from 2015 showed an animated Merkel with outstretched arms, talking to a seated Barack Obama, then the US president, on the eve of a G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps.</p> <p>After Donald Trump\u2019s first election victory in 2016, the image seemed to visualise a line of succession, from one \u201cleader of the free world\u201d to the next. In fact, she says in Freedom, the snapper had caught her discussing something more banal: not the extent of the geopolitical task on her hands, but the size of an extra-large wicker chair she had squeezed into for a photo opportunity at a previous summit.</p>   <h2>\u2026 or a video</h2>  <p>One video clip was frequently shared not by her admirers but her critics on the far right: filmed on the eve of federal elections in 2013, it shows a stern-looking Merkel take a German flag out of the hands of Hermann Gr\u00f6he, the CDU general secretary and later her health minister, and chuck it to the side of the stage. </p> <p>Far from showing her disdain for patriotism, Merkel writes, she found the flag-waving \u201cinappropriate\u201d because she believed her party should be humble in victory. \u201cEven in our hour of triumph we do not forget that not everyone voted for us, and that there are others who are not so happy.\u201d</p> <p>Another widely shared clip from the early years of her tenure showed the then US president, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4wKg2Ddoas\">George W Bush, giving Merkel an impromptu shoulder massage</a> as he entered a G8 summit in St Petersburg in 2008. On camera, her awkward reaction suggested that the German leader was far from pleased, but in her telling the footage did not show \u201ca sexist infringement\u201d: \u201cIt was a joke that wasn\u2019t meant to intimidate or belittle me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBush and I liked and respected each other.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4wKg2Ddoas\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i4wKg2Ddoas?start=21&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=21\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Video showing an impromptu shoulder massage by the then US president, George W Bush, in 2008.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>She saw Donald Trump was \u2018fascinated\u2019 by Vladimir Putin (and the pope advised her on how to handle them both)</h2>  <p>Unlike Bush, Donald Trump does not elicit sympathy from Merkel. She says she made the mistake of trying to engage with him as if he were someone \u201ccompletely normal\u201d. She sees parallels between him and Vladimir Putin, and says Trump is \u201cclearly fascinated\u201d by the Russian president: \u201cI received the distinct impression he [Trump] was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial traits.\u201d Both are childlike in their grievances, she says, and both try to embarrass her in front of the press \u2013 Putin once apparently tried to intimidate her with his labrador, Konni, and Trump refused to shake her hand.</p> <p>Merkel tried to take the high ground with both leaders, letting the provocations wash over her and focusing on joint interests, which mostly meant trade. She cites advice given her by Pope Francis: \u201cBend, bend, and bend some more, but take care it doesn\u2019t break.\u201d It\u2019s a virtuous strategy, but one which did not stop Trump from cancelling the US\u2019s participation in the Paris climate agreement, nor Putin from invading Ukraine shortly after she left office.</p>   <h2>She felt a lot more patronised by westerners than she let on</h2>  <p>Since Merkel left office, a debate around continuing economic and cultural discrimination against people from the former East Germany has gone mainstream in Germany \u2013 the Leipzig-based literary scholar Dirk Oschmann\u2019s polemic The East: A West German Invention and the historian Katja Hoyer\u2019s book Beyond the Wall were bestsellers in 2023.</p> <p>That kind of assertiveness is very different to Merkel\u2019s attitude while she was in power. After she was elected as a member of parliament in 1990, she found that \u201cit was more difficult than I had expected [\u2026] to speak openly to the West German media about one\u2019s own life in the GDR\u201d.</p> <p>Interviews in which she mentioned her participation in Marxism-infused educational programmes in her youth sent journalists scouring archives for covered-up files from her schooldays.</p> <p>As a result, she spoke little about her East German identity as she rose through the party ranks.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel was notoriously discreet and privacy-conscious as Germany\u2019s chancellor, rarely veering off message during her 16 years in office. In her eagerly anticipated political autobiography Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021, she has hardly turned into a gossipmonger overnight. But across 721 pages \u2013 published on Tuesday in German and English thanks to nine different translators working on chunks of the book simultaneously \u2013 there are glimpses of a Merkel previously unseen. Here are eight things we learned. Regrets? She has very few\u2026 Merkel\u2019s policies on migration, nuclear energy and Russia have come under severe scrutiny in the three years since she left office. But Freedom is not a book of any major mea culpas. Her decision to accept more than 1 million refugees, mostly Syrian, into Germany in 2015 was not a mistake, she says: \u201cThe opposite is true.\u201d Her 2011 policy U-turn on nuclear energy, leading to the phase-out of the country\u2019s remaining reactors, came about because the accident in Fukushima, Japan, \u201cchanged my perception of risk posed by nuclear energy\u201d. She says she wouldn\u2019t recommend the use of nuclear in the future either. The book presents a number of reasons why she and the then French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, were right to block Ukraine and Georgia from joining Nato\u2019s membership action plan (Map) in 2008 \u2013 a decision heavily criticised by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion. With her veto, she says, she was considering not just Ukraine\u2019s security but also the need to \u201cincrease the efficacy of Nato as a whole\u201d. ... but there are a couple Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in 2016 genuinely shook Merkel: she experienced it as \u201ca humiliation, a disgrace for us\u201d, which left the EU weakened, and she asked herself whether she and other European leaders should have done more to keep Britain in. \u201cI was tormented by whether I should have made even more concessions toward the UK,\u201d she writes. It\u2019s not a full admission of an error, because she concludes that Brexit was a self-inflicted wound that Britain\u2019s neighbours could have done little to prevent. By promising a referendum to appease the hardliners in his party, she writes, David Cameron \u201cput himself in the hands of those who were skeptical about the European Union, and was never able to escape this dependency\u201d. Merkel also corrects her stance on her domestic fiscal policy, even if this too is not exactly phrased as a regret. The \u201cdebt brake\u201d mechanism, which limits Germany\u2019s budget deficit to 0.35% of GDP, was enshrined in the constitution during Merkel\u2019s first term. It was a totemic policy she steadfastly defended for the rest of her reign, in the face of critics who said it was leading to a chronic underinvestment in infrastructure. But in her memoir, which comes out three weeks after her successor government collapsed over the debt brake question, she breezily suggests that the mechanism now needs to be reformed, \u201cto allow higher levels of debt to be assumed for the sake of investment in the future\u201d. A gift to the next German chancellor, who is likely to hail from her Christian Democratic party, or a poisoned chalice? Never trust a photograph... There are many photographs and clips of Merkel in power, but not all are what they seem. One viral image from 2015 showed an animated Merkel with outstretched arms, talking to a seated Barack Obama, then the US president, on the eve of a G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps. After Donald Trump\u2019s first election victory in 2016, the image seemed to visualise a line of succession, from one \u201cleader of the free world\u201d to the next. In fact, she says in Freedom, the snapper had caught her discussing something more banal: not the extent of the geopolitical task on her hands, but the size of an extra-large wicker chair she had squeezed into for a photo opportunity at a previous summit. \u2026 or a video One video clip was frequently shared not by her admirers but her critics on the far right: filmed on the eve of federal elections in 2013, it shows a stern-looking Merkel take a German flag out of the hands of Hermann Gr\u00f6he, the CDU general secretary and later her health minister, and chuck it to the side of the stage. Far from showing her disdain for patriotism, Merkel writes, she found the flag-waving \u201cinappropriate\u201d because she believed her party should be humble in victory. \u201cEven in our hour of triumph we do not forget that not everyone voted for us, and that there are others who are not so happy.\u201d Another widely shared clip from the early years of her tenure showed the then US president, George W Bush, giving Merkel an impromptu shoulder massage as he entered a G8 summit in St Petersburg in 2008. On camera, her awkward reaction suggested that the German leader was far from pleased, but in her telling the footage did not show \u201ca sexist infringement\u201d: \u201cIt was a joke that wasn\u2019t meant to intimidate or belittle me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBush and I liked and respected each other.\u201d She saw Donald Trump was \u2018fascinated\u2019 by Vladimir Putin (and the pope advised her on how to handle them both) Unlike Bush, Donald Trump does not elicit sympathy from Merkel. She says she made the mistake of trying to engage with him as if he were someone \u201ccompletely normal\u201d. She sees parallels between him and Vladimir Putin, and says Trump is \u201cclearly fascinated\u201d by the Russian president: \u201cI received the distinct impression he [Trump] was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial traits.\u201d Both are childlike in their grievances, she says, and both try to embarrass her in front of the press \u2013 Putin once apparently tried to intimidate her with his labrador, Konni, and Trump refused to shake her hand. Merkel tried to take the high ground with both leaders, letting the provocations wash over her and focusing on joint interests, which mostly meant trade. She cites advice given her by Pope Francis: \u201cBend, bend, and bend some more, but take care it doesn\u2019t break.\u201d It\u2019s a virtuous strategy, but one which did not stop Trump from cancelling the US\u2019s participation in the Paris climate agreement, nor Putin from invading Ukraine shortly after she left office. She felt a lot more patronised by westerners than she let on Since Merkel left office, a debate around continuing economic and cultural discrimination against people from the former East Germany has gone mainstream in Germany \u2013 the Leipzig-based literary scholar Dirk Oschmann\u2019s polemic The East: A West German Invention and the historian Katja Hoyer\u2019s book Beyond the Wall were bestsellers in 2023. That kind of assertiveness is very different to Merkel\u2019s attitude while she was in power. After she was elected as a member of parliament in 1990, she found that \u201cit was more difficult than I had expected [\u2026] to speak openly to the West German media about one\u2019s own life in the GDR\u201d. Interviews in which she mentioned her participation in Marxism-infused educational programmes in her youth sent journalists scouring archives for covered-up files from her schooldays. As a result, she spoke little about her East German identity as she rose through the party ranks. Yet it didn\u2019t mean she was immune to real or perceived slights against her upbringing: Freedom seethes with quiet rage at those who patronised her for implying that having been socialised in a dictatorship meant she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be trusted at the head of reunified Germany\u201d. But quite how she ended up growing up in East Germany remains a mystery even to her Young Angela moved from Hamburg, in the former West Germany, to the East German village of Quitzow in 1954, when she was six months old. The timing of their move \u2013 a year after the suppression of a workers\u2019 uprising in East Berlin, at a time when 180,000 people were moving the other way \u2013 has raised retrospective questions about the political character of the household Merkel grew up in. Her father, Horst, nicknamed \u201cRed Kasner\u201d, was influenced by Latin American liberation theology and opposed the church tax that paid for the privileges he enjoyed in his parish, she writes. But that didn\u2019t endear him to East German authorities, who were state atheist by policy and suspicious of any member of the intelligentsia. Quite why her father, who died in 2011, had moved her family behind the iron curtain seems to continue to puzzle her: \u201cHe was convinced that people like him were needed there,\u201d she writes in an intriguingly bristly comment. \u201cI think it might be called a vocation.\u201d At least, she writes, her father taught her how to fend off East Germany\u2019s secret police. When the Stasi tried to recruit her as an informant to monitor her fellow students in the late 70s, she told them: \u201cI\u2019m a communicative person, and I always have to tell other people what\u2019s on my mind\u201d \u2013 a method also employed by her father. The Stasi, she recalls, immediately backed off. She\u2019s a feminist (of sorts) after all As with being East German, so with being a woman. Her first senior position may have been as the minister for women and youth in the cabinet of the chancellor Helmut Kohl, but Merkel never leaned into her sex \u2013 she was unwilling, she writes, \u201cto be defined as part of a group\u201d. As a conservative, she also disagreed with Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s \u201cillusion\u201d that \u201cfeminism and a socialist vision of the world belonged together\u201d. Even as late as 2017, when she was asked, during a podium discussion with Ivanka Trump, whether she considered herself a feminist, she gave a non-answer and threw the question back at the audience. In her memoirs, she is more assertive. She gives emphatic credit to her most loyal advisers, Beate Baumann and Eva Christiansen, and to female colleagues whose achievements have gone underappreciated, such as the Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini and the former Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskait\u0117. If she were asked if she was a feminist now, she says, she would be (a bit) more unequivocal: \u201cYes, I am a feminist, in my way.\u201d",

Prosecutors say they will continue to pursue the case against two of Trump\u2019s employees. JD Vance responded to the news by tweeting: \u201cIf Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison.\u201d On Truth Social, Donald Trump himself wrote that the cases were \u201ca political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products coming in to the United States from Mexico and Canada and additional tariffs on China. </strong>\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d Trump said in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215051155542\">post</a> on Truth Social. Trump said the tariffs would remain in place until the two countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants crossing the border illegally. In a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215408213585\">follow-up post</a>, Trump announced that the US \u201cwill be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In a statement, Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said China had taken steps to combat drug trafficking after an agreement was reached last year between </strong><strong>Joe Biden and </strong><strong>Xi Jinping. </strong>\u201cThe Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against narcotics,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAll these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality,\u201d Liu said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Neither the US</strong><strong> nor China would win a trade war, the Chinese </strong><strong>embassy in Washington</strong> added. \u201cAbout the issue of US tariffs on China, China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,\u201d Liu said in a statement. \u201cNo one will win a trade war or a tariff war,\u201d Liu said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, released a statement saying country places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US.</strong> The statement did not mention the tariffs directly. It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border protection \u201cwork together every single day to to disrupt the scourge of fentanyl coming from China and other countries.\u201d </p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau spoke on Monday night about trade and border security,</strong> Reuters reported, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with situation.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Joe Biden and </strong><strong>first </strong><strong>lady Jill Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/biden-attending-trump-inauguration\">will attend</a> Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, a White House spokesperson told Reuters.</strong> \u201cThe president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election,\u201d said <strong>Andrew Bates</strong>, senior deputy press secretary at the White House. \u201cHe and the First Lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><strong>Philadelphia </strong><strong>district </strong><strong>attorney Larry Krasner has dropped his office\u2019s lawsuit against Elon Musk and his America Pac.</strong> Krasner had sued Musk over his super Pac\u2019s $1m-a-day lottery, where swing state voters were entered into a drawing every day before the presidential election in exchange for signing a petition.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that leaders of so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should have to explain why they deserve federal funding and warned that they could lose their funding.</strong> Greene, who has been tapped to lead a subcommittee called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) under Elon Musk and <strong>Vivek Ramaswamy</strong>, <a

federal funds to \u201charbor illegal criminal aliens\u201d.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump\u2019s pick for the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, faces renewed scrutiny over sexual assault allegations as Republican lawmakers are reportedly uncomfortable after a number of claims have surfaced.</strong> The concerns come as Hegseth was also revealed to have criticized several key US alliances, including

lunch at a hotel in Palm Beach, where he asked for a monthly retainer of at least $30,000 to promote his name at Mar-a-Lago in case Trump won the election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

Ten weeks into her pregnancy, Ngumezi started to bleed and went to Houston Methodist Sugar Land, which is part of the Houston Methodist hospital chain and located in the Houston metropolitan area. While at the hospital, Ngumezi continued to bleed for several hours. She underwent multiple blood transfusions.</p> <p>Doctors who reviewed Ngumezi\u2019s case told ProPublica that she should have been offered a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C, a common procedure that can be used for miscarriages and abortions to clear tissue from the uterus. However, some doctors in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state\">states with abortion bans</a> have become hesitant to offer D&amp;Cs, doctors said, because they are afraid of being punished for violating abortion bans \u2013 even in situations where women\u2019s pregnancies have ended, as in Ngumezi\u2019s case.</p> <p>Rather than being offered a D&amp;C, a doctor gave Ngumezi misoprostol, ProPublica reported. Although misoprostol is frequently used in miscarriages and abortions, it can be dangerous to give to women who are \u2013 like Ngumezi \u2013 bleeding heavily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/texas-porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-abortion-ban\">Texas woman dies after receiving inadequate treatment for a miscarriage</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6745063a8f087ff7bcc458eb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T23:26:34.459Z\">11.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump announces three choices for White House offices</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump has announced three choices for directors of White House offices.</p> <p>The first is <strong>James Braid</strong>, who was JD Vance\u2019s lead political staffer in the Senate, as deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Legislative Affairs.</p> <p>The second is <strong>Matt Brasseaux</strong>, who was deputy political director of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, as deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Political Affairs.</p> <p>The third is <strong>Alex Latcham</strong>, also as deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Public Liaison.

and their cities\u201d.</p> <p>When asked whether such cities and states would lose federal funding, Greene said: \u201cIf they use their police officers and resources to harbor and protect illegal criminal aliens, then absolutely.\u201d</p> <p>So-called \u201csanctuary\u201d cities are places around the country that don\u2019t cooperate with the federal government on enforcing harsh immigration

You can read the full story at the link below: Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election has dismissed the case, hours after special counsel Jack Smith asked to end the case. Smith is planning to release a final report into his investigations into Trump\u2019s classified documents and election interference cases, CNN reports. Prosecutors say they will continue to pursue the case against two of Trump\u2019s employees. JD Vance responded to the news by tweeting: \u201cIf Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison.\u201d On Truth Social, Donald Trump himself wrote that the cases were \u201ca political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country\u201d. Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products coming in to the United States from Mexico and Canada and additional tariffs on China. \u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump said the tariffs would remain in place until the two countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants crossing the border illegally. In a follow-up post, Trump announced that the US \u201cwill be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America\u201d. In a statement, Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said China had taken steps to combat drug trafficking after an agreement was reached last year between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. \u201cThe Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against narcotics,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAll these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality,\u201d Liu said. Neither the US nor China would win a trade war, the Chinese embassy in Washington added. \u201cAbout the issue of US tariffs on China, China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature,\u201d Liu said in a statement. \u201cNo one will win a trade war or a tariff war,\u201d Liu said. Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, released a statement saying country places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US. The statement did not mention the tariffs directly. It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border protection \u201cwork together every single day to to disrupt the scourge of fentanyl coming from China and other countries.\u201d Trump and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau spoke on Monday night about trade and border security, Reuters reported, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with situation. Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, a White House spokesperson told Reuters. \u201cThe president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election,\u201d said Andrew Bates, senior deputy press secretary at the White House. \u201cHe and the First Lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration.\u201d Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner has dropped his office\u2019s lawsuit against Elon Musk and his America Pac. Krasner had sued Musk over his super Pac\u2019s $1m-a-day lottery, where swing state voters were entered into a drawing every day before the presidential election in exchange for signing a petition. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that leaders of so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should have to explain why they deserve federal funding and warned that they could lose their funding. Greene, who has been tapped to lead a subcommittee called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) under Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News she wants to question officials on whether they\u2019re using federal funds to \u201charbor illegal criminal aliens\u201d. Trump\u2019s pick for the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, faces renewed scrutiny over sexual assault allegations as Republican lawmakers are reportedly uncomfortable after a number of claims have surfaced. The concerns come as Hegseth was also revealed to have criticized several key US alliances, including Nato, as well as allied countries such as Turkey and international institutions such as the UN, and has said that US troops should not be bound by the Geneva conventions. The identities of private donors funding Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition are being kept secret, in a break with precedent, that is obscuring which groups, businesses or wealthy individuals are supporting his second presidential launch. Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s proposed use of the US military to conduct mass deportations of immigrants when he returns to the White House. While Paul still supports Trump\u2019s plans to expel millions of immigrants from the US, the lawmaker has opposed using the US military to do so, arguing that law enforcement would be better suited. Gavin Newsom, California governor, has announced that the state may offer state tax rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration cuts the federal tax credit for electric vehicles. In a statement on Monday, Newsom said that if the Trump administration eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles he would propose creating a new version of the state\u2019s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, phased out in 2023, which funded 594,000 cars and saved more than 456m gallons of fuel. Internal rivalries spilled into public view on Monday as Boris Epshteyn, a top adviser to Donald Trump, found himself at the center of an ouster effort over accusations he asked potential administration nominees to pay monthly consulting fees in exchange for lobbying for them to the president-elect. Internal rivalries spilled into public view on Monday as Boris Epshteyn, a top adviser to Donald Trump, found himself at the center of an ouster effort over accusations he asked potential administration nominees to pay monthly consulting fees in exchange for lobbying for them to the president-elect. The maelstrom engulfing Epshteyn suggested that barely 20 days since Trump won the election, the knife-fight culture of the first Trump presidency, where bitter aides took any opportunity to remove rivals, had returned. Over the weekend, David Warrington, the Trump 2024 campaign\u2019s general counsel, finalized the main conclusions of a review into Epshteyn that found he had unsuccessfully solicited tens of thousands of dollars from potential nominees including Scott Bessent, who has been tapped to be Treasury secretary. According to the review, one day after Trump met with Bessent for the first time in February, Epshteyn invited him to lunch at a hotel in Palm Beach, where he asked for a monthly retainer of at least $30,000 to promote his name at Mar-a-Lago in case Trump won the election. \u201cMexico and Canada remain heavily dependent on the US market so their ability to walk away from President-elect Trump\u2019s threats remains limited,\u201d Wendy Cutler, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, and former US trade official, told AFP. AFP reports that by citing the fentanyl crisis and illegal immigration, Trump appears to be using national security concerns as a means to break the USMCA trade deal, something that is usually allowed under the rules set by the World Trade Organization or in trade deals. But most countries and the WTO treat national security exceptions as something to be used sparingly, not as a routine tool of trade policy. While migrant arrests reached a record during President Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, straining US border enforcement, illegal crossings fell dramatically this year as Biden instituted new border restrictions and Mexico stepped up enforcement, Reuters reports. More than 83% of exports from Mexico went to the US in 2023 and 75% of Canadian exports go to the country. Trump\u2019s threatened new tariff would appear to violate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade. The deal which Trump signed into law took effect in 2020, and continued the largely duty-free trade between the three countries. Canada and the United States at one point imposed sanctions on each others\u2019 products during the rancorous talks that eventually led to USMCA. Trump will have the opportunity to renegotiate the agreement in 2026, when a \u201csunset\u201d provision will force either a withdrawal or talks on changes to the pact. Here is our full story on Trump\u2019s tariff threats: More now from the statement from Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, released on Monday evening, which says that the country places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US. The statement did not mention the tariffs directly. It also said that the Canada Border Services Agency, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and US Customs and Border protection \u201cwork together every single day to to disrupt the scourge of fentanyl coming from China and other countries.\u201d Trump and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau spoke on Monday night about trade and border security, Reuters reported, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with situation.

The statement from Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, says that the US-Canada relationship today is balanced and mutually beneficial, particularly for american workers. Meanwhile according to the Canadian source directly familiar with the situation who spoke to Reuters, Trump and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had '\u201cGood discusison\u201d and agreed to stay in touch. Trump and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau spoke on Monday night about trade and border security, Reuters reports, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with situation. Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, has released a statement saying that the country places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US, Reuters reports. The statement does not mention the tariffs directly. In the small island country of Samoa, lives have been forever altered by an outbreak of the measles in 2019 that caused at least 83 deaths and 1,867 hospitalisations, mostly of babies and young children. Thousands more fell sick. The preventable illness was able to spread through the small, closely knit population of about 200,000 due to record low vaccination rates \u2013 stemming from a medical vaccination error, the Samoan government\u2019s public health mismanagement, and fuelled by anti-vaccination sentiment, including by Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the US health department, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Michelle Duff reports from Apia for the Guardian: China\u2019s embassy in Washington has responded to Trump\u2019s announcement, saying that \u201cno one will win a trade war or tariff war,\u201d Reuters reports. More shortly. While on the campaign trail in October, Trump described \u201ctariff\u201d as \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, and made clear his intentions to reduce US companies\u2019 use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost. The policy, he said, would strengthen the US\u2019s international trade position and boost US job growth. Robert Reich, former US secretary of labor, warned that the tariff doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cA tariff is basically a sales tax, raising the price of almost everything you buy. It\u2019s also regressive \u2013 taking a higher percentage out of the paychecks of working people than out of the wealthy,\u201d he posted on social media. Trump has previously pledged to end China\u2019s most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% \u2013 much higher than those imposed during his first term. Trump\u2019s announcement on Monday of plans for tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while US stock futures and share markets in Asia fell. The Chinese economy is in a much more vulnerable position given the country\u2019s prolonged property downturn, debt risks and weak domestic demand. Guardian Australia\u2019s Greg Jericho points out that America gets a large percentage of its cars from Canada and Mexico which, under the tariff plans announced today, would likely cost consumers an extra 25%: The billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman\u2019s analysis of Trump\u2019s tariffs is that they \u201cwill not be implemented, or once implemented will be removed\u201d and that Trump is using the threat of the tariffs as a \u201cweapon to achieve economic and political outcomes, he wrote on X. Ackman is a Trump supporter, who may, according to a report in Fortune, be involved in work carried out by the new Department of Government Efficiency that will be headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. A Missouri court on Monday upheld a new state law that bans some gender-affirming health care for minors, the Associated Press reports, a victory for supporters of the ban as a multitude of lawsuits against similar bans in other states continue to play out. Republican attorney general Andrew Bailey said in a statement that Missouri is the \u201cfirst state in the nation to successfully defend such a law at the trial court level.\u201d Bailey, who tried to ban minors\u2019 access to gender-affirming health care through rule change but dropped the effort when the law passed, is responsible for defending the legislation in court. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of the thousands of hours my office put in to shine a light on the lack of evidence supporting these irreversible procedures,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWe will never stop fighting to ensure Missouri is the safest state in the nation for children.\u201d Every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans on gender-affirming care for minors and supported the medical care for youth when administered appropriately. Lambda Legal and the ACLU of Missouri, which are representing the plaintiffs who sued to overturn the law, on Monday said they will appeal against the ruling. Missouri is among at least 26 states that have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. A Louisiana civil court judge on Monday halted state agencies\u2019 plans to forcibly clear homeless encampments in New Orleans, Reuters reports. Orleans Parish Civil District Court Judge Ethel Julien issued a temporary restraining order blocking state police and two other agencies from evicting homeless people from their encampments in New Orleans or seizing their property without following city laws and due process. Republican Governor Jeff Landry had called earlier this month for the City of New Orleans to remove a large encampment before Thanksgiving and warned he would intervene if the city did not comply. \u201cIf a judge believes that people have a right to be on whatever public space they choose, maybe that judge should have them move into her chambers and courtroom,\u201d Landry said after the judge issued the restraining order Monday. Louisiana State Police spokesperson Sgt. Katharine Stegall said the agency\u2019s legal team and the state attorney general\u2019s Office are reviewing the order. State police have \u201cpromptly halted activities\u201d and are \u201ccomplying with the restrictions\u201d of the order, Stegall said. Landry and New Orleans officials have repeatedly clashed over how to address the issue of homelessness in the city. New Orleans city councilmember Lesli Harris said Monday that directing more resources towards moving homeless people into stable housing was \u201cinfinitely more effective than punitive sweeps\u201d of encampments. \u201cCoordination between the government and service providers on the housing of people is imperative, and continuously moving people only makes it that much harder to house them,\u201d Harris said. Jirari points out that the tariff on goods from Canada would affect building costs in particular. She writes that the 25% tariff announced a short while ago by Trump, Would spike building costs dramatically. Key materials we rely on from Canada: $105b in cement/minerals jumping to $131b $28B in lumber/paper to $34b $33b in metals/tools to $42B Total hit: $41b more for same materials. Building just got pricier.\u201d Tahra Jirari, the director of economic analysis at an organisation called the Chamber of Progress, which describes itself as \u201ca new tech industry coalition devoted to a progressive society, economy, workforce, and consumer climate\u201d, has reacted to Trump\u2019s tariffs, pointing out that they will lead to higher prices for consumers. In a post on X she writes, \u201cTrump vows 25% tariff on ALL Mexico/Canada imports if elected. This means higher prices for Americans. Tariffs = taxes that YOU pay at the store. Cars, food, electronics - all cost more. Even your grocery bill would jump. Companies can\u2019t absorb 25% - it hits your wallet.\u201d On Truth Social, Trump has also announced that the US \u201cwill be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America\u201d. He said that the reason for the additional tariff was Chinas failure to curb the number of drugs entering the US. His post on Truth Social says, I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail. Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before. Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Trump has announced on Truth Social that he will sign an executive order charging Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff \u201con ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders\u201d. He writes: On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! A Texas woman has died after receiving inadequate medical treatment for a miscarriage, according to a new report from ProPublica \u2013 the fifth pregnant woman the publication has found to have died since the fall of Roe v Wade after receiving inadequate care or being denied a legal abortion. Porsha Ngumezi, a 35-year-old mother of two, died in June 2023 after experiencing a miscarriage in Texas, where nearly all abortions are banned, ProPublica reported on Monday. Ten weeks into her pregnancy, Ngumezi started to bleed and went to Houston Methodist Sugar Land, which is part of the Houston Methodist hospital chain and located in the Houston metropolitan area. While at the hospital, Ngumezi continued to bleed for several hours. She underwent multiple blood transfusions. Doctors who reviewed Ngumezi\u2019s case told ProPublica that she should have been offered a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C, a common procedure that can be used for miscarriages and abortions to clear tissue from the uterus. However, some doctors in states with abortion bans have become hesitant to offer D&amp;Cs, doctors said, because they are afraid of being punished for violating abortion bans \u2013 even in situations where women\u2019s pregnancies have ended, as in Ngumezi\u2019s case. Rather than being offered a D&amp;C, a doctor gave Ngumezi misoprostol, ProPublica reported. Although misoprostol is frequently used in miscarriages and abortions, it can be dangerous to give to women who are \u2013 like Ngumezi \u2013 bleeding heavily. Trump has announced three choices for directors of White House offices. The first is James Braid, who was JD Vance\u2019s lead political staffer in the Senate, as deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Legislative Affairs. The second is Matt Brasseaux, who was deputy political director of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, as deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Political Affairs. The third is Alex Latcham, also as deputy assistant to the president and director of the Office of Public Liaison. Latcham was also a senior political director on the Trump campaign. More soon. The outgoing head of the top US public health agency urged the next administration to maintain its focus and funding to keep Americans safe from emerging health threats. \u201cWe need to continue to do our global work at CDC to make sure we are stopping outbreaks at their source,\u201d Dr Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview Monday with the Associated Press. \u201cWe need to keep that funding up. We need to keep the expertise up. We need to keep the diplomacy up.\u201d Cohen, 46, will be leaving office in January after about 18 months in the job. PDonald Trump on Friday night said he picked Dave Weldon, a former congressman from Florida, to be the agency\u2019s next chief. Cohen said she has not met Weldon and doesn\u2019t know him. She previously voiced concern about Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine advocate and CDC critic nominated to oversee all federal public health agencies. The CDC, with a $9.2bn core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. Today so far Thanks for joining us today so far. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the day\u2019s major headlines: The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election has dismissed the case, hours after special counsel Jack Smith asked to end the case. Smith is planning to release a final report into his investigations into Trump\u2019s classified documents and election interference cases, CNN reports. Prosecutors say they will continue to pursue the case against two of Trump\u2019s employees. JD Vance responded to the news by tweeting: \u201cIf Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison.\u201d On Truth Social, Donald Trump himself wrote that the cases were \u201ca political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country\u201d. Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, a White House spokesperson told Reuters. \u201cThe president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election,\u201d said Andrew Bates, senior deputy press secretary at the White House. \u201cHe and the First Lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration.\u201d Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner has dropped his office\u2019s lawsuit against Elon Musk and his America Pac. Krasner had sued Musk over his super Pac\u2019s $1m-a-day lottery, where swing state voters were entered into a drawing every day before the presidential election in exchange for signing a petition. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that leaders of so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should have to explain why they deserve federal funding and warned that they could lose their funding. Greene, who has been tapped to lead a subcommittee called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) under Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News she wants to question officials on whether they\u2019re using federal funds to \u201charbor illegal criminal aliens\u201d. Trump\u2019s pick for the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, faces renewed scrutiny over sexual assault allegations as Republican lawmakers are reportedly uncomfortable after a number of claims have surfaced. The concerns come as Hegseth was also revealed to have criticized several key US alliances, including Nato, as well as allied countries such as Turkey and international institutions such as the UN, and has said that US troops should not be bound by the Geneva conventions. The identities of private donors funding Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition are being kept secret, in a break with precedent, that is obscuring which groups, businesses or wealthy individuals are supporting his second presidential launch. Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s proposed use of the US military to conduct mass deportations of immigrants when he returns to the White House. While Paul still supports Trump\u2019s plans to expel millions of immigrants from the US, the lawmaker has opposed using the US military to do so, arguing that law enforcement would be better suited. Gavin Newsom, California governor, has announced that the state may offer state tax rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration cuts the federal tax credit for electric vehicles. In a statement on Monday, Newsom said that if the Trump administration eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles he would propose creating a new version of the state\u2019s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, phased out in 2023, which funded 594,000 cars and saved more than 456m gallons of fuel. Jim O\u2019Neill, who served in the Department of Health and Human Services under George W Bush, is favored to become Donald Trump\u2019s pick for deputy secretary of the department, the Washington Post reports. O\u2019Neill, who went to work in Silicon Valley after leaving Washington, has invested heavily in tech ventures alongside PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. Thiel, who advised Trump\u2019s first administration, has encouraged the president-elect to nominate O\u2019Neill to a high-level health role in the administration. O\u2019Neill has been vocally critical of the food and drug administration, saying in a 2014 speech that the FDA should approve drugs \u201cafter their sponsors have demonstrated safety, and let people start using them at their own risk\u201d and \u201cprove efficacy after they\u2019ve been legalized\u201d. Robert F Kennedy Jr, who Trump has selected to lead health and human services, favors O\u2019Neill for the role, the Post reports, although the position still requires Senate confirmation. Reacting to the news that special counsel Jack Smith has dropped charges against Donald Trump in classified documents and election interference cases, Democrats say the decision \u201cestablishes that Donald Trump is above the law.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly has more: Responding to news that the special counsel Jack Smith had dropped all charges against Donald Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and retention of classified information, Dan Goldman, a prosecutor turned New York Democrat and member of the House oversight committee, lamented \u201ca shame for justice in this country\u201d. \u201cIt establishes that Donald Trump is above the law,\u201d Goldman told CNN. \u201cThe supreme court put him above the law [by ruling that he had \u2018absolute immunity\u2019 for official acts] but now he appears to escape full accountability for what were crimes charged by a grand jury.\u201d Goldman rejected the argument that by re-electing Trump, the American people had acquitted him of all charges. Florida congressman Mike Waltz will resign from Congress on 20 January, Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration day, Politico and Axios report. Trump has selected Waltz to be his national security adviser. The timing of Waltz\u2019s resignation means the congressman will still be in Congress for the 3 January speakership vote. It also means two Florida congressional seats will be vacant until 1 April. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida also resigned from Congress after Trump named him as his attorney general pick \u2013 although Gaetz withdrew from consideration amid a House ethics investigation into sexual assault allegations against him. The judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election has dismissed the case, hours after special counsel Jack Smith asked to end the case. In an opinion dismissing the case, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote that the charges could be brought again after Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cDismissal without prejudice is also consistent with the Government\u2019s understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\u201d Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, a White House spokesperson told Reuters. \u201cThe president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election,\u201d said Andrew Bates, senior deputy press secretary at the White House. \u201cHe and the First Lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration.\u201d Just hours after Joe Biden pardoned two turkeys in an event marking the official start of the holiday season in Washington, First Lady Jill Biden received the White House Christmas tree. The Frasier fir was delivered to the White House from the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina, a region recently impacted by Hurricane Helene. Jack Smith is planning to release a final report into his investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents and election interference cases, CNN reports. Attorney general Merrick Garland will publicly release the report, as he has past special counsel reports, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. However, it remains unclear how much information will be included in the reports. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has dropped his office\u2019s lawsuit against Elon Musk and his America Pac. Krasner had sued Musk over his super Pac\u2019s $1m-a-day lottery, where swing state voters were entered into a drawing every day before the presidential election in exchange for signing a petition. Teddy Schleifer of Puck News first posted a screen capture of the court case today, marking it \u201cDiscontinued and Ended\u201d. A Philadelphia judge had rejected Krasner\u2019s request for an injunction, on the basis that Musk\u2019s lottery violated state election laws, on 4 November. Donald Trump has declined to sign presidential transition paperwork that requires disclosure of private donors. The memorandum of understanding, which requires an incoming president to disclose the names of private donors and caps their donations at $5,000, would give Trump access to up to $7.2m in federal funding. Here\u2019s Robert Tait with more: Sidestepping it means Trump can raise unlimited amounts of cash from rich backers to finance his return to the White House while concealing what they are being promised in return. He is the first incoming president not to sign the federal transition funding agreement, which is dictated by the Presidential Transition Act. Transition funds are typically raised to pay for staff, office space and travel needed to put together an administration. Trump\u2019s decision to avoid the standard procedure has alarmed ethics experts, who warn that it enables wealthy individuals to influence the makeup of a new administration without their names or potential conflicts of interest being disclosed. It also means the president-elect can accept unlimited donations from foreign donors, who \u2013 in contrast to rules prohibiting foreigners from contributing to election campaigns \u2013 are legally allowed to donate to transitions. Chuck Schumer, Senate majority leader, has scheduled Senate Democrats\u2019 leadership elections for 3 December, according to reports. According to CNN, the leadership elections will start at 9:30am, per a Democratic leadership aide. Meanwhile, the Democratic national committee announced earlier today that it will select its next chair during a 1 February vote. The committee also plans to hold four forums for candidates in January. Trump has broken his silence on the decisions by prosecutors to drop the election interference charges and the classified documents case against him. In a post on Truth Social, the president-elect said: \u201cThese cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless, and should never have been brought.\u201d He continued: Over $100m Dollars of taxpayer Dollars has been wasted in the Democrat Party\u2019s fight against their Political Opponent, ME. Nothing like this has ever happened in our Country before. They have also used State Prosecutors and District Attorneys, such as Fani Willis and her lover, Nathan Wade (who had absolutely zero experience in cases such as this, but was paid MILLIONS, enough for them to take numerous trips and cruises around the globe!), Letitia James, who inappropriately, unethically, and probably illegally, campaigned on \u201cGETTING TRUMP\u201d in order to win Political Office, and Alvin Bragg, who himself never wanted to bring this case against me, but was forced to do so by the Justice Department and the Democrat Party. It was a political hijacking, and a low point in the History of our Country that such a thing could have happened, and yet, I persevered, against all odds, and WON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While the case involving classified documents case will be dropped against Donald Trump, prosecutors say they will continue to pursue the case against two of his employees. According to CNN, special counsel Jack Smith said that while he is dropping the prosecution of Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents, prosecutors will proceed with the case against two of his employees \u2013 Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira \u2013 who are co-defendants in the case. Both individuals, who work for Trump, are accused of assisting the former president in obstructing the federal investigation into sensitive government documents. CNN noted that the case is now before the 11th US circuit court of appeals, which is reviewing a judge\u2019s order dismissing all charges. Vice-president-elect JD Vance has responded to the news that prosecutors have dropped election interference charges and the classified documents case against Donald Trump. \u201cIf Donald J. Trump had lost an election, he may very well have spent the rest of his life in prison,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThese prosecutions were always political.\u201d He continued: \u201cNow it\u2019s time to ensure what happened to President Trump never happens in this country again.\u201d In statement, Steven Cheung, the communications director for the president-elect, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law. \u201cThe American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country,\u201d he added. Federal prosecutors have also moved today to abandon the classified documents case against Donald Trump, similarly to the election interference case, in light of longstanding justice department policy that says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution \u2013 even though Trump has not yet been inaugurated. The announcement in an appeals court filing in Florida came shortly after the similar filing was made by prosecutors in Washington DC, where they asked to dismiss the case accusing Trump of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, the Associated Press reports. The move amounts to a predictable but nonetheless stunning conclusion to a criminal case that just one year ago had been seen as the most perilous legal threat that he faced. It reflects the practical consequences of Trump\u2019s electoral victory, ensuring he enters office free from scrutiny over his hoarding of top secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after leaving office in January 2021 \u2013 conduct that prosecutors said had jeopardized national scrutiny. The dismissal had been foreshadowed in recent weeks by the revelation that special counsel Jack Smith was evaluating how to wind down both that case and a separate pending prosecution he brought charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Justice department legal opinions dating back decades say sitting presidents cannot be indicted or prosecuted while in office and the government\u2019s filings today indicate that, although unprecedented, they have decided this also applies to a president-elect who was charged while still a private citizen. The government\u2019s motion to dismiss the election interference case against Donald Trump also says that the prohibition on cases going forward against the president-elect \u201cis categorical\u201d but notes that it \u201cdoes not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government\u2019s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind\u201d. It adds, \u201cbased on the department\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution, the Government moves for dismissal without prejudice\u201d, and says that the government has conferred with Trump\u2019s defense lawyers and they do \u201cnot object to this motion\u201d. A grand jury in Washington DC decided in August 2023 that there was cause to indict Trump, \u201ccharging the defendant with four felony offenses in connection with his efforts to interfere with Congress\u2019s certification of the 2020 presidential election and the lawful transfer of presidential power\u201d. From the moment Joe Biden\u2019s victory was declared in November 2020, Trump made both legal and vocal challenges to the result and declared it fraudulent. Then, on January 6, 2021, the day that both houses of Congress were due to meet to certify the results, Trump held a rally urging supporters to \u201cfight\u201d against the result, after which thousands from the crowd went from the White House to the US Capitol and some fought with police and broke in, in a violent assault. Lawmakers were evacuated as the mob took over the halls, offices and House chamber, but many hours later a shaken congress convened in the early hours of January 7 and belatedly certified Biden\u2019s victory. Trump was impeached for inciting insurrection but cleared by the Senate. The filing then goes on to say that Jack Smith\u2019s office consulted with the justice department\u2019s office of legal counsel \u201cwhose interpretation of constitutional questions such as those raised here is binding\u201d on department prosecutors, which is what Smith, as special counsel, is. It notes that, essentially after \u201cspecial consideration\u201d precedent relating to sitting presidents applies here, even though Trump is only president-elect and will not be inaugurated until 20 January 2025, when Biden, having metaphorically taken the keys to the White House from Trump four years ago, will hand them back. \u201cAs a result, this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant inaugurated.\u201d The government points out in its filing the motion to dismiss the election interference case against Donald Trump: \u201cIt has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the criminal indictment and subsequent federal prosecution of a sitting President.\u201d It notes that American society has never faced the situation before where a private citizen (as Trump became after he left the White House on 20 January 2020 and Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president) has been indicted and a prosecution is underway \u201cwhen the defendant is elected president\u201d. Special counsel prosecutors dismissed the criminal case against Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to a court filing Monday, as they bowed to the reality that it would not be completed or proceed to trial before Trump returns to the presidency next year. The withdrawal in the case marked the end of the years-long legal battle between Trump and the special counsel, Jack Smith, and reflected the extraordinary ability of Trump to sidestep an indictment that would have sunk the presidential bid of anyone else. Trump\u2019s election victory was always going to spell the end of the criminal cases against him due to justice department policy that prohibits prosecutors from taking criminal action against a sitting president. But the preemptive withdrawals showed how Trump used politics to beat the legal system. In a court filing, Smith says he and his team were faced with the unprecedented situation of the impending criminal prosecution of a sitting president being forbidden. The document says: \u201cAfter careful consideration, the Department has determined \u2026 this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\u201d Special counsel Jack Smith has filed a motion to drop all charges against Donald Trump in the federal election interference case against the president-elect. If you\u2019re just joining us now, here is a recap of what has happened today so far: Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that leaders of so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should have to explain why they deserve federal funding and warned that they could lose their funding. Greene, who has been tapped to lead a subcommittee called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News she wants to question officials on whether they\u2019re using federal funds to \u201charbor illegal criminal aliens\u201d. When asked whether such cities and states would lose federal funding, Greene said: \u201cIf they use their police officers and resources to harbor and protect illegal criminal aliens, then absolutely.\u201d So-called \u201csanctuary\u201d cities are places around the country that don\u2019t cooperate with the federal government on enforcing harsh immigration policies. Trump\u2019s pick for the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, faces renewed scrutiny over sexual assault allegations as Republican lawmakers are reportedly uncomfortable after a number of claims have surfaced. The concerns come as Hegseth was also revealed to have criticized several key US alliances, including Nato, as well as allied countries such as Turkey and international institutions such as the UN, and has said that US troops should not be bound by the Geneva conventions. Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to Donald Trump, said that he and the president-elect have \u201cno concerns at all\u201d regarding Pete Hegseth\u2019s confirmation by the Senate as the next US secretary of defense. During an appearance on NewsMax, Lewandowski was asked if Trump had any concerns about Hegseth and his nomination, to which Lewandowski responded: \u201cWe have no concerns at all.\u201d The identities of private donors funding Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition are being kept secret, in a break with precedent, that is obscuring which groups, businesses or wealthy individuals are supporting his second presidential launch. Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s proposed use of the US military to conduct mass deportations of immigrants when he returns to the White House. While Paul still supports Trump\u2019s plans to expel millions of immigrants from the US, the lawmaker has opposed using the US military to do so, arguing that law enforcement would be better suited. Gavin Newsom, California governor, has announced that the state may offer state tax rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration cuts the federal tax credit for electric vehicles. In a statement on Monday, Newsom said that if the Trump administration eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles he would propose creating a new version of the state\u2019s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, phased out in 2023, which funded 594,000 cars and saved over 456m gallons of fuel. Joe Biden has pardoned his final White House turkeys. The president pardoned two turkeys from Minnesota, Peach and Blossom, named after the Delaware state flower, the Peach blossom, which symbolizes resilience, Biden said. After pardoning the turkeys, Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s my last time to speak here as your president during the season and give thanks and gratitude, so let me say to you, it\u2019s been the honor of my life, I\u2019m forever grateful.\u201d In a post on Truth Social, Trump endorsed Jimmy Patronis for Florida\u2019s first congressional district, which was previously held by former representative Matt Gaetz. Gaetz said he wouldn\u2019t take his seat after being nominated as attorney general \u2013 later pulling out of the process amid concerns over sexual misconduct claims. The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, says conversations on a Lebanon-Israel ceasefire are positive and going in the right direction, according to Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019re close,\u201d he reportedly said. Damian Williams, the United States attorney for the southern district of New York, has announced that he would resign on 13 December, about a month before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. In statement on Monday, Williams said that the decision was \u201cbittersweet\u201d adding that \u201cit is bitter in the sense that I am leaving my dream job, leading an institution I love that is filled with the finest public servants in the world\u201d and that \u201cit is sweet in that I am confident I am leaving at a time when the Office is functioning at an incredibly high level \u2013 upholding and exceeding its already high standard of excellence, integrity, and independence\u201d. He continued: \u201cThat success is due to the career attorneys, staff members, and law enforcement agents of this Office. Working with them during my tenure has been a privilege of a lifetime. They are worthy custodians of this Office\u2019s tradition of doing the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons. They are patriots. They are my family. And I will miss them dearly.\u201d Edward Kim, currently serving as Williams\u2019s deputy, will take over on an acting basis as US attorney for the southern district of New York, according to the announcement. Earlier this month, Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton for the position. The position requires confirmation by the US Senate. In a post on Truth Social, the president-elect endorsed Jimmy Patronis for Florida\u2019s tfirst congressional district, which was previously held by former representative Matt Gaetz. Trump wrote: Jimmy Patronis, Chief Financial Officer for the Great State of Florida, has done a tremendous job as CFO, where he also serves as the State\u2019s Fire Marshall, and as an important member of the Florida Cabinet. I hear that Jimmy is now considering launching a Campaign for Congress in Florida\u2019s 1st Congressional District!\u201d A fourth generation Floridian from the beautiful Panhandle, and owner of an iconic seafood restaurant, Jimmy has been a wonderful friend to me, and to MAGA. As your next Congressman, Jimmy would work tirelessly alongside of me to Grow our Economy, Secure our Border, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Incredible Military/Vets, Restore American Energy DOMINANCE, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment. Should he decide to enter this Race, Jimmy Patronis has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JIMMY, RUN! Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to Donald Trump, has said that he and the president-elect have \u201cno concerns at all\u201d regarding Pete Hegseth\u2019s confirmation by the Senate as the next US secretary of defense. During an appearance on NewsMax, Lewandowski was asked if Trump had any concerns about Hegseth and his nomination, to which Lewandowski responded: \u201cWe have no concerns at all.\u201d \u201cPete is eminently qualified to be the secretary of defense, the issue is that he\u2019s outside of the box thinking, he\u2019s not the traditional military industrial complex choice,\u201d he added. Later in the interview, Lewandowski said that with \u201c53 Republican US senators, we\u2019re going to get all of our nominees through\u201d. This comes as Hegseth, a 44-year-old former Fox News host and army veteran, is facing scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault and has come under fire for his extreme positions and past remarks. Joe Biden participates in his final White House turkey pardon. This morning, the president pardoned two turkeys from Minnesota, Peach and Blossom, named after the Delaware state flower, the Peach blossom, which symbolizes resilience, Biden said. After pardoning the turkeys, Biden said: \u201cThis event marks the official start of the holiday season here in Washington.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s also my last time to speak here as your president during the season and give thanks and gratitude, so let me say to you, it\u2019s been the honor of my life, I\u2019m forever grateful.\u201d The tradition of the turkey pardon dates to 1947 when the National Turkey Federation, which represents turkey farmers and producers, first presented a national Thanksgiving turkey to President Harry Truman. Here are some photos from the event: Gavin Newsom, California governor, has announced that the state may offer state tax rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration cuts the federal tax credit for electric vehicles. In a statement on Monday, Newsom said that if the Trump administration eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles he would propose creating a new version of the state\u2019s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, phased out in 2023, which funded 594,000 cars and saved over 456m gallons of fuel. Funding for the new rebate system could come from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the statement adds, \u201cwhich is funded by polluters under the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program\u201d. \u201cConsumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong \u2013 zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe will intervene if the Trump administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe\u2019re not turning back on a clean transportation future \u2013 we\u2019re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don\u2019t pollute.\u201d Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, has criticized Donald Trump\u2019s proposed use of the US military to conduct mass deportations of immigrants when he returns to the White House. While Paul still supports Trump\u2019s plans to expel millions of immigrants from the US, the lawmaker has opposed using the US military to do so, arguing that law enforcement would be better suited. During a Sunday interview with CBS News\u2019s Face the Nation, Paul was asked how immigration authorities should carry out mass deportations. \u201cWhat we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially. How do you suggest they implement it?\u201d asked the CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan. Paul criticized plans to use the military for deportation as \u201cillegal\u201d, adding: \u201cIf they send the army into New York and you have 10,000 troops marching carrying semi-automatic weapons, I think it\u2019s a terrible image, and I will oppose that.\u201d Read more about the remarks here: My colleague Robert Tait reported this morning that the identities of private donors funding Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition are being kept secret, in a break with precedent, that is obscuring which groups, businesses or wealthy individuals are supporting his second presidential launch. The president-elect has managed to maintain secrecy regarding his financial backers by neglecting to sign an agreement with the outgoing Biden administration. This agreement would have imposed strict limits on private funding in exchange for up to $7.2m in federal funding for his transition efforts. Read more about it here: Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that leaders of so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d should have to explain why they deserve federal funding and warned that they could lose their funding. Greene, who has been tapped to lead a subcommittee called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News that she would \u201clike to talk to the governors of sanctuary states and the mayors of sanctuary cities and have them come before our committee and explain why they deserve federal dollars if they\u2019re going to harbor illegal criminal aliens in their states and their cities\u201d. When asked whether such cities and states would lose federal funding, Greene said: \u201cIf they use their police officers and resources to harbor and protect illegal criminal aliens, then absolutely.\u201d So-called \u201csanctuary\u201d cities are places around the country that don\u2019t cooperate with the federal government on enforcing harsh immigration policies. The interviewer also asked Greene where she sees as the \u201cmost government waste\u201d to which she responded: \u201cIt\u2019s all over, every single government department, program, grant programs, contracts, it is everywhere.\u201d She said she would do a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into all government departments and programs. Vice-president Kamala Harris and her former running mate, Governor Tim Walz, are hosting a call on Tuesday to thank their supporters. The call has been scheduled for 3pm ET on Tuesday, and is described as a \u201cnational grassroots call\u201d featuring Harris and Walz to thank their supporters. \u201cLearn how to stay involved in this fight\u201d the description adds. Harris is scheduled to arrive in California on Monday, after vacationing in Hawaii with her husband, Doug Emhoff, since Tuesday. A new survey conducted CBS News has found that most Americans say they approve of Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the presidential transition process. The new poll, released this morning, also found that 31% of respondents reported feeling \u201chappy\u201d about Trump\u2019s win, while 24% said they were satisfied. In contrast, 23% said they were dissatisfied, and 21% reported feeling angry. Among Democratic voters surveyed, 50% reported feeling scared about what Trump will do as president, and 35% expressed concern. In contrast, a majority of Republicans surveyed said that they were excited for Trump\u2019s second presidency, and 41% reported feeling optimistic. Overall, CBS reports that Republicans today are more enthusiastic about Trump\u2019s presidency now than they were in 2016 when he was first elected. Meanwhile, Democrats say they feel more scared about what Trump might do than they did in 2016, with many believing he will threaten their rights and freedoms. In the last three days Donald Trump finished up making his major cabinet announcements. If you missed them, here is a quick roundup. Trump chose Brooke Rollins, president of the America First Policy Institute, to be agriculture secretary. Trump named Scott Bessent, a longtime hedge-fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, to serve as treasury secretary. Trump picked Russell Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Vought was OMB chief during Trump\u2019s previous term in office and has been deeply involved in Project 2025 in recent years. Trump announced Sebastian Gorka, a former Breitbart writer and longtime rightwing Maga supporter, as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counter-terrorism in his second administration. Trump named Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Oregon representative, as his nominee for labor secretary. Chavez-DeRemer recently lost her re-election bid for the House of Representatives. Dr Janette Nesheiwat, a double board-certified medical doctor, a regular Fox News contributor, is Trump\u2019s pick for surgeon general. Alex Wong, a former state department official will serve as deputy national security adviser. Trump also said he would nominate the Johns Hopkins surgeon and writer Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration. Trump announced Scott Turner as his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Trump announced Dave Weldon, a former representative and a medical doctor, as his choice for director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. This morning, we start with news that president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, has previously criticized several key US alliances, including Nato, as well as allied countries such as Turkey and international institutions such as the UN, and has said that US troops should not be bound by the Geneva conventions. This comes as Hegseth is also facing scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault and misconduct from 2017. Police did not press charges at the time, and Hegseth has maintained that the encounter was consensual and has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, the police report detailing the allegations and incident was made public, and since then, concerns around Hegseth\u2019s path to confirmation have grown, with some Republican lawmakers reportedly uncomfortable with the series of sexual misconduct allegations against Hegseth and Trump\u2019s other cabinet picks. As Hegseth faces a potentially challenging Senate confirmation process next year, concerns continue to arise regarding his qualifications for the position, as well as about his controversial views and past statements. In other news: The prominent Republican US senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma said on Sunday that Congress would not give blanket approval to Trump\u2019s controversial cabinet picks. Public health experts are concerned that if confirmed, Trump\u2019s selection for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr could jeopardize access to pharmaceutical drugs in favor of more experimental treatments.",

Then, through expansive powers, the minister for communications will determine what methods will be used and to which platforms they\u2019re applied.</p> <p>Michelle Rowland\u2019s Labor predecessor in the communications portfolio, Stephen Conroy, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-28/conroy-plays-down-red-underpants-comments/4286562\">once said</a> he had \u201cunfettered legal power\u201d and could make telecommunications companies \u201cwear red underpants on [their] head\u201d if he wanted. The social media sector might wonder if this is where these new powers may go.</p> <p>Elon Musk\u2019s X has warned that these new powers could be weaponised by a minister, and could limit free speech. X and the Human Rights Law Centre have both raised questions over the lawfulness of the bill.</p> <p>We\u2019re told in media interviews which platforms are in and which are out \u2013 such as YouTube \u2013 but that will be up to the minister to decide at a later date.</p> <p>The government has been at pains to say people won\u2019t be required to prove their age via the government\u2019s new digital ID, or that they will be required to hand over licences or passports to every social media platform. But there\u2019s nothing in the legislation today preventing that.</p> <p>That was one of the key takeaways from the short four-hour hearing on the bill on Monday. It came after a question from one of the few sceptics of the legislation from the two major parties: the Liberal National party senator, Matt Canavan.</p> <p>However, the Coalition indicated on Tuesday it had secured agreement from government for amendments to the bill to prevent people being forced to hand over IDs to social media platforms.</p> <p>TikTok has said any requirement to hand over IDs is tantamount to requiring every social media user in Australia to have a licence to access social media.</p> <p>Having read through the vast bulk of the publicly available written submissions, it\u2019s clear that most experts believe this is an ill thought-through policy which lacks evidentiary basis, likely won\u2019t work, and will have wide-ranging ramifications for every social media user in Australia.</p> <p>One of the authors of the only major study on the effects of social media on teen mental health cited by the government <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/11/20/teen-social-media-ban-michelle-rowland-study-question-time/\">doesn\u2019t back the government\u2019s ban</a>.</p> <p>At the Monday hearing, there was only one witness in favour of the bill \u2013 and she had campaigned for it well before today. Everyone else who wasn\u2019t a government agency or one of the politicians asking the questions was against the ban.</p> <p>It appears the legislation will fly through parliament after a week of consideration.</p> <p>Just over a year ago, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches, the government had suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/31/roadmap-for-age-verification-online-pornographic-material-adult-websites-australia-law\">age-assurance raised too many privacy and security concerns</a> for every Australian. Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/23/australia-social-media-ban-under-16-age-verification-technology\">has revealed</a> the eSafety commissioner\u2019s own position has previously been that no country has been able to solve this problem.</p> <p>Nothing substantial in the technology has changed since then. So why the change?</p> <p>It appears to be the result of a combination of a months-long wedge from the opposition pushing the government to adopt the policy, public polling backing the ban, and a News Corp campaign that \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9JVZaNCEPI\">Deidre Chambers-style coincidence</a> \u2013 just happened to launch not long after Meta announced it would not enter into new deals to pay for news.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/26/australia-should-delay-social-media-ban-until-age-check-trial-finishes-google-and-meta-say\">Australia should delay social media ban until age-check trial finishes, Google and Meta say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, News Corp\u2019s tabloid front pages across the major cities and an editorial in the Australian urged the parliament to pass the bill.</p> <p>Passing the bill now, and it not coming into effect until after the next election serves two purposes: it takes it off the table as an election issue; and it puts responsibility for implementation onto the next government.</p> <p>The concern over the bill from members of parliament has seen odd pairings: the Greens, One Nation, some teals, and others such as Gerard Rennick, and Coalition MPs who already had concerns over the eSafety commissioner\u2019s powers. Some want more regulation to make the platforms safer for everyone, others want the digital public square to be more free of regulation. But on this at least they\u2019re a unity ticket.</p> <p>However, they will probably not have the numbers to stop this going through before the end of this week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A dominant theme of the hastily written submissions to the federal government\u2019s one-day review of its social-media ban bill is that the process is far too rushed to consider its wide-ranging effects on all Australians. A year from now, every Australian logging on to Facebook, Instagram or TikTok may be confronted with a prompt that the company is requiring you to prove your age. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email But even that is just speculation. The bill that was introduced into parliament last week, and sent off to a committee for a single day \u2013 receiving over 15,000 submissions \u2013 contains no details about how it will work, only that the companies will be expected to take reasonable steps to ensure users are aged 16 and over. The actual detail will come later, through the completion of a trial of age-assurance technology in mid-2025. Then, through expansive powers, the minister for communications will determine what methods will be used and to which platforms they\u2019re applied. Michelle Rowland\u2019s Labor predecessor in the communications portfolio, Stephen Conroy, once said he had \u201cunfettered legal power\u201d and could make telecommunications companies \u201cwear red underpants on [their] head\u201d if he wanted. The social media sector might wonder if this is where these new powers may go. Elon Musk\u2019s X has warned that these new powers could be weaponised by a minister, and could limit free speech. X and the Human Rights Law Centre have both raised questions over the lawfulness of the bill. We\u2019re told in media interviews which platforms are in and which are out \u2013 such as YouTube \u2013 but that will be up to the minister to decide at a later date. The government has been at pains to say people won\u2019t be required to prove their age via the government\u2019s new digital ID, or that they will be required to hand over licences or passports to every social media platform. But there\u2019s nothing in the legislation today preventing that. That was one of the key takeaways from the short four-hour hearing on the bill on Monday. It came after a question from one of the few sceptics of the legislation from the two major parties: the Liberal National party senator, Matt Canavan. However, the Coalition indicated on Tuesday it had secured agreement from government for amendments to the bill to prevent people being forced to hand over IDs to social media platforms. TikTok has said any requirement to hand over IDs is tantamount to requiring every social media user in Australia to have a licence to access social media. Having read through the vast bulk of the publicly available written submissions, it\u2019s clear that most experts believe this is an ill thought-through policy which lacks evidentiary basis, likely won\u2019t work, and will have wide-ranging ramifications for every social media user in Australia. One of the authors of the only major study on the effects of social media on teen mental health cited by the government doesn\u2019t back the government\u2019s ban. At the Monday hearing, there was only one witness in favour of the bill \u2013 and she had campaigned for it well before today. Everyone else who wasn\u2019t a government agency or one of the politicians asking the questions was against the ban. It appears the legislation will fly through parliament after a week of consideration. Just over a year ago, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches, the government had suggested age-assurance raised too many privacy and security concerns for every Australian. Guardian Australia has revealed the eSafety commissioner\u2019s own position has previously been that no country has been able to solve this problem. Nothing substantial in the technology has changed since then. So why the change? It appears to be the result of a combination of a months-long wedge from the opposition pushing the government to adopt the policy, public polling backing the ban, and a News Corp campaign that \u2013 in a Deidre Chambers-style coincidence \u2013 just happened to launch not long after Meta announced it would not enter into new deals to pay for news. On Tuesday, News Corp\u2019s tabloid front pages across the major cities and an editorial in the Australian urged the parliament to pass the bill. Passing the bill now, and it not coming into effect until after the next election serves two purposes: it takes it off the table as an election issue; and it puts responsibility for implementation onto the next government. The concern over the bill from members of parliament has seen odd pairings: the Greens, One Nation, some teals, and others such as Gerard Rennick, and Coalition MPs who already had concerns over the eSafety commissioner\u2019s powers. Some want more regulation to make the platforms safer for everyone, others want the digital public square to be more free of regulation. But on this at least they\u2019re a unity ticket. However, they will probably not have the numbers to stop this going through before the end of this week.",

      "bodyText": "The week before her three children died, Fa\u2019aoso Tuivale and her husband took them for a swim in the river flowing behind their house in the Samoan village of Lauli\u2019i. Itila, 3, and his twin siblings, Tamara and Sale, 13 months, had a fever and their parents hoped to cool them down. The children were ill with measles and were not vaccinated. When they worsened, on a Sunday, Fa\u2019aoso took them to hospital in Apia, 9km away. They were seen, and sent home. The next day, they took Itila back to hospital. He died the same day. Tamara was admitted and died in intensive care the following Friday. Fa\u2019aso was frightened by the sight of her tiny daughter, connected to so many tubes. She felt helpless. Sale was in better condition, so she took him home. The family crushed fruit from the nonu tree for him to drink. They prayed upon him. They went to see a traditional healer, who held him under a tap. \u201cHe was crying, and I grabbed him, wrapped a towel around him, held him to my heart and I knew he was gone,\u201d Fa\u2019aoso said, sitting on the grave of her children in the front yard of their banana and taro plantation. \u201cI did everything I could.\u201d In the small island country of Samoa, lives have been forever altered by an outbreak of the disease in 2019 that caused at least 83 deaths and 1,867 hospitalisations, mostly of babies and young children. Thousands more fell sick. The preventable illness was able to spread through the small, closely knit population of about 200,000 due to record low vaccination rates \u2013 stemming from a medical vaccination error, the Samoan government\u2019s public health mismanagement, and fuelled by anti-vaccination sentiment, including by Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the US health department, Robert F Kennedy Jr. In Samoa these days, mothers are fearful. \u201cI\u2019m always worried,\u201d said Shuvourn Samuelu, who clutched her one-year-old son Leiato Samuelu in the emergency room of a hospital in Apia last week. She had brought him in to get a fever checked out. Five years ago, the hospital was overflowing when her son Lologa Samuelu, then 14 months, and nephew Isaako Junior, six months, died after complications from measles. They were not vaccinated. \u201cI knew they were sick, but I never thought they would die. We learned the hard way.\u201d Now, five years on from an epidemic that has traumatised a generation, Samoan health officials are among those sounding alarm over the nomination of Kennedy as US health secretary. \u201cWe cannot and should not stay silent. We know what this appointment means. It means more platforms for anti-vaxxers and less funding for vaccines and health programmes,\u201d Aiono Prof Alec Ekeroma, Samoa\u2019s director general of health, told the Guardian. \u201cIt must be treated as a threat to our health security.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s visit to Samoa The roots of the tragedy stretch back to July 2018 and the deaths of two babies due to a medical error in the administration of an MMR vaccine, after the vaccine powder was mixed with expired muscle relaxant anaesthetic instead of water. The government shut down the vaccination programme for 10 months to investigate \u2013 allowing thousands of babies to go unvaccinated, against World Health Organization advice, and creating space for rumours to take hold. During the same period, Kennedy, who denies being anti-vaccine, had been hosted in Samoa. He visited four months before the measles outbreak was declared, in October 2019, meeting with government officials and anti-vaccine influencers in what health advocates and Ekeroma claim was a \u201csignificant disinformation campaign\u201d stoking distrust in vaccines. Kennedy and his wife, Cheryl Hines, were special guests at Samoa\u2019s 57th independence celebrations in June 2019, as part of a trip that came about after the anti-vaccination non-profit group Kennedy founded, Children\u2019s Health Defense, connected with vocal Samoan vaccine critic and traditional healer Edwin Tamasese. Tamasese was arrested during the measles epidemic for incitement against a government vaccination order. The charges against Tamasese were later dropped, with a judge citing insufficient evidence. Kennedy, who would later hail Tamasese as a \u201chero\u201d in a blog post and describe the epidemic as \u201cmild\u201d, also met with the Australian Samoan anti-vaccine influencer Taylor Winterstein. She posted a photo of the pair to her social media using anti-vax hashtags, saying his visit was \u201cprofoundly monumental\u201d for the movement. Months after his visit, Kennedy wrote a letter to then-Samoan prime minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi urging him to consider if children\u2019s deaths were caused by a \u201cdefective\u201d vaccine or a \u201cmutant strain\u201d of measles caused by it. Neither is plausible. Emails sent to Kennedy\u2019s team and Children\u2019s Health Defense went unanswered. A man who answered the phone at a press number for Kennedy said he would not be giving media interviews until after confirmation. Vaccine misinformation spreads Samoa is a deeply Christian nation, where traditional cultural practices, such as natural healing, find their home alongside \u201cpalagi\u201d, or white, western medicine, which is still distrusted by many. A central government runs alongside a fa\u2019a Matai (chief) system that sees society organised into villages where life is lived communally. The average hourly wage is US$1.30 (\u00a31). A fractured health system and lack of confidence in vaccines faced Dr Take Naseri as director general of health during the outbreak in 2019. \u201cWe were caught, and it exposed all the gaps in our health system,\u201d said Naseri, from his GP practice in Apia.

When the government did restart its vaccination programme, people were reluctant: when the epidemic was declared on 16 October, the rate had dropped to 31%, down from 84% four years previously, according to WHO data. \u201cThe Samoan establishment handled the whole situation really badly and did not take the support and advice that was provided to them at the time, which is what allowed this to unravel and let RFK get in there,\u201d Petousis-Harris said. \u201cWhen you get people who are wealthy and influential going into a fragile setting, it\u2019s like the top of the food chain visiting and meeting up with those who act as the megaphone.

      "bodyText": "An alleged scam call centre in the Philippines has been busted for targeting Australian men over the age of 35 on dating apps and social media, the the Australian federal police say, resulting in the arrest of more than 250 people. The alleged scammers would work in shifts from a compound to align with Australian times zones, building trust with the men before asking them to invest their money in a fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platform, police alleged. The AFP says it has identified 50 Australians who were targeted by the call centre so far. But based on intelligence provided by Philippine authorities, police say the number of Australians targeted could be in the thousands. Philippine law enforcement seized more than 300 computer towers, more than 1,000 mobile phones and thousands of sim cards after they executed a search warrant over suspected immigration violations. Police later arrested more than 190 foreign nationals and 68 Filipino nationals for alleged immigration offences. The AFP searched the compound soon after under Operation Firestorm, which works to shut down organised crime syndicates that operate abroad and deceive Australians through romance, investment or cryptocurrency scams. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email David McLean, an AFP assistant commissioner, said the search of the call centre was the first time investigators had accessed an alleged scam compound under the operation. \u201cWe have gathered valuable intelligence on the structure of these types of [alleged] scam call centres, how they are targeting Australians and the ways to help identify victims,\u201d McLean said. \u201cAn AFP cryptocurrency expert was given a unique insight into the [alleged] financial and money laundering structures operating within these hubs, and that will be immensely helpful in developing our strategies in combatting this crime impacting Australia.\u201d In a statement, the AFP warned Australians to remain vigilant against romance scams, and be skeptical of urgent requests for personal information or money. It also urged people to report any suspicious profiles. \u201cRomance scammers can profess love or strong emotions quickly to manipulate their targets emotionally. Be aware of these signs,\u201d the AFP said in a statement. \u201cAlways verify the identity of the person you\u2019re communicating with online. Request video calls or meetings in person, if possible. \u201cTrust your instincts. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d",

Martin Pengelly writes that Rogan said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201c100% wrong\u201d but claimed that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was \u201cabout to start world war three\u201d with Joe Biden\u2019s support. \u201cI listen to your latest podcast,\u201d said Klitschko, whose brother, Vitali, was also a world champion boxer and is mayor of Kyiv. \u201cI\u2019m sending you this video to let you know that I disagree. You talk about these American weapons being sent to Ukraine, which you believe will lead to the third world war. So let me tell you that you\u2019re repeating Russian propaganda.\u201d",

A review of the experiences of 193 children in England who were victims of sexual abuse by a family member found seven went on to take their own lives, while 14 more \u2013 including a seven-year-old \u2013 either attempted suicide or talked about killing themselves. Ten children became pregnant as a result of the abuse, of which at least six gave birth, the youngest of whom was 11 when her baby was born, while another pregnant child who was given an illegal abortion agent procured via the internet nearly died as a result. The report, commissioned by the child safeguarding practice review panel, blamed \u201csystemic failings\u201d, with child victims too often either ignored or disbelieved, and the risk posed by their relatives minimised or misunderstood. Meanwhile, more than a third of cases involved a family member already known to present some risk of sexual harm, including convicted sex offenders and relatives previously prosecuted for sexual abuse, including rape. The report called on the government to put in place a national action plan to tackle intrafamilial child sexual abuse, which it said would require \u201cwholesale change\u201d to training, supervision and leadership in the sector. Part of the reason for the loss of expertise in the field is the shift in focus over the past 20 years away from child sexual abuse within families to sexual abuse of children in public institutions, by strangers on the internet and high-profile individuals, according to the report. \u201cDespite commonalities between different types of sexual abuse, the \u2018othering\u2019 and moral outrage that can accompany media attention on extra-familial sexual abuse has perhaps distracted attention from the more commonplace nature of familial abuse,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn turning our attention away from the latter, we have undermined the confidence and capability of professionals to identify and respond to sexual abuse in families.\u201d The panel chair, Annie Hudson, said: \u201cThe systemic issues identified in this report are longstanding.

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of her 16-year tenure, former German chancellor Angela Merkel was garlanded with superlative titles: the \u201cqueen of Europe\u201d, the \u201cmost powerful woman in the world\u201d, the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d. In reality, her role was always more that of a mediator than a sovereign. Born and brought up for 35 years in an anti-church, Moscow-allied socialist command economy but politically active for 31 years in a Christian, staunchly pro-Nato and pro-market conservative party, Merkel\u2019s unique political calling card was her ability to see eye-to-eye with politicians from opposing camps, because she understood their ideological hinterland.</p> <p>And so Freedom, released just three years after she left office, was never going to be a score-settling kind of autobiography. Meetings with politicians as different as George W Bush and former leftwing Greek prime minister Al\u00e9xis Ts\u00edpras are recalled with equal respect and affection \u2013 even though Merkel concludes that the former\u2019s war in Iraq was \u201ca mistake, waged on a basis of mistaken beliefs\u201d, and the latter provides her with \u201cthe most astonishing moment of any phone call in my entire political career\u201d, when he tells her he will recommend that the Greek people vote against a bailout deal he himself negotiated with her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Merkel\u2019s personal hairdresser comes across as a more complex political animal than Macron</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When it comes to those who slighted her, Merkel says she adhered to a motto usually associated with the British royal family: \u201cNever explain, never complain\u201d. The closest thing to disses here are non-mentions. Yanis Varoufakis, the self-styled rebel hero of the Greek government debt-crisis, is named not once in the 721-page tome. Boris Johnson gets two passing mentions in a book that goes into exhaustive detail when describing the menu at the chancellory canteen (\u201cBut nor will I forget the mixed salads,\u201d reads one immortal line). Merkel\u2019s personal hairdresser comes across as a more complex political animal than French president Emmanuel Macron.</p> <p>The notion that political opponents \u201cshould be considered strange even as human beings,\u201d she writes at one point, is \u201ccompletely alien\u201d to her, though she makes an exception for Donald Trump. When he flusters her at their first official meeting by refusing to shake hands in front of the cameras, she reprimands herself for assuming the US president would be \u201csomeone completely normal\u201d. Trump\u2019s combative approach to the European Union on trade and tariffs \u2013 from the perspective of a real-estate developer to whom \u201call countries were in competition, and the success of one meant the failure of another\u201d \u2013 runs completely counter to her view of the world.</p> <p>Even then, she swallows her scorn and lets the subtext do the talking. In a statement that is surprising given how long the book\u2019s publication date was announced in advance, she says \u201cI wish with all my heart that Kamala Harris [\u2026] defeats her competitor and becomes president.\u201d</p> <p>Freedom starts with a lengthy section on Merkel\u2019s first three decades behind the iron curtain, and it\u2019s hard to shake the&nbsp;impression that this is the book she really wanted to write. Not because of any lingering <em>ostalgie</em>: she thought the German Democratic Republic was \u201cas petty, narrow-minded, tasteless and humourless as it could possibly be\u201d. Unlike many more active dissidents, Merkel says she held no illusions that East and West Germany could be reunited on equal terms after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and in her first weeks as a member of the newly founded Democratic Awakening party backs East Germany\u2019s currency to be replaced by the Deutschmark as swiftly as possible.</p> <p>Rather, this reads like the voice of someone finally unburdened of the need to keep quiet about their upbringing. Her first experiences with journalists after the wall went down, she writes, make her realise that it is difficult \u201cto speak openly with West German media about one\u2019s own life in the GDR\u201d, and she explains that she was reluctant to make too much of becoming Germany\u2019s first female chancellor because she didn\u2019t want to be \u201cpigeonholed\u201d.</p> <p>Going by how eager her politician colleagues were to patronise her, that reluctance was perfectly understandable. There\u2019s her former interior minister Horst Seehofer, who describes her 2015 decision to open German borders to refugees from Syria as having led to a \u201ctyranny of injustice\u201d, seemingly putting a Merkel-led Germany on par with the GDR\u2019s dictatorship. Or&nbsp;how about Mexican president Felipe Calder\u00f3n who, at a G20 meeting in 2012, thought he could nudge her into unleashing the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme by likening her to a \u201clittle girl\u201d on the playground, asking her \u201cbig brother\u201d for help to fight off the bullies.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to ask my brother,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI have to get through this on my own.\u201d Her feelings are clear, but it\u2019s not phrased as a complaint, and it doesn\u2019t come with any further explanation.</p> <p>The second half of the book, which deals with geopolitics, is more breathless, as if its pace is still dictated by her crammed diaries during the cumulative crises that marked her career: the global banking crisis that began in 2007, followed by the threat of the break-up of the eurozone, the arrival of an estimated 1.3 million displaced people on Europe\u2019s borders in 2015, and a brewing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p> <p>The wisdom of the strategic decisions she made during these key moments came into question just two-and-a-half months after she stepped down, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Merkel was a stellar student of Russian, and Putin spoke fluent German, which had positioned her to become the west\u2019s closest negotiating partner with the Kremlin. Even before diplomatic relations deteriorated, she writes, she held no illusions as to Putin\u2019s desire \u201cto push back against the American victory in the Cold War\u201d. The 2014 annexation of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts made it clear to her that the Russian president was a \u201crulebreaker\u201d who \u201cmust be stopped\u201d.</p> <p>If so, why did Germany under her leadership allow its reliance on Russian gas to rise? Why did she not discontinue the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that linked Russia directly with her constituency in Germany\u2019s north-east, allowing gas transits to bypass Ukraine? Why did she not campaign to ramp up Europe\u2019s&nbsp;defence?</p> <p>Her answers are frustratingly formulaic. Justifying Germany and France in 2008 blocking Ukraine\u2019s admission to the Membership Action Plan that would have put the country on a road to join Nato, she says it is \u201cillusory\u201d that this would have deterred Russian aggression: Putin wouldn\u2019t have \u201ctwiddled his thumbs\u201d. But for Putin even the rhetorical gesture towards Ukraine\u2019s future Nato membership that she agreed to as a compromise was a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d. So what difference did her veto make?

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of her 16-year tenure, former German chancellor Angela Merkel was garlanded with superlative titles: the \u201cqueen of Europe\u201d, the \u201cmost powerful woman in the world\u201d, the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d. In reality, her role was always more that of a mediator than a sovereign. Born and brought up for 35 years in an anti-church, Moscow-allied socialist command economy but politically active for 31 years in a Christian, staunchly pro-Nato and pro-market conservative party, Merkel\u2019s unique political calling card was her ability to see eye-to-eye with politicians from opposing camps, because she understood their ideological hinterland. And so Freedom, released just three years after she left office, was never going to be a score-settling kind of autobiography. Meetings with politicians as different as George W Bush and former leftwing Greek prime minister Al\u00e9xis Ts\u00edpras are recalled with equal respect and affection \u2013 even though Merkel concludes that the former\u2019s war in Iraq was \u201ca mistake, waged on a basis of mistaken beliefs\u201d, and the latter provides her with \u201cthe most astonishing moment of any phone call in my entire political career\u201d, when he tells her he will recommend that the Greek people vote against a bailout deal he himself negotiated with her. When it comes to those who slighted her, Merkel says she adhered to a motto usually associated with the British royal family: \u201cNever explain, never complain\u201d. The closest thing to disses here are non-mentions. Yanis Varoufakis, the self-styled rebel hero of the Greek government debt-crisis, is named not once in the 721-page tome. Boris Johnson gets two passing mentions in a book that goes into exhaustive detail when describing the menu at the chancellory canteen (\u201cBut nor will I forget the mixed salads,\u201d reads one immortal line). Merkel\u2019s personal hairdresser comes across as a more complex political animal than French president Emmanuel Macron. The notion that political opponents \u201cshould be considered strange even as human beings,\u201d she writes at one point, is \u201ccompletely alien\u201d to her, though she makes an exception for Donald Trump. When he flusters her at their first official meeting by refusing to shake hands in front of the cameras, she reprimands herself for assuming the US president would be \u201csomeone completely normal\u201d. Trump\u2019s combative approach to the European Union on trade and tariffs \u2013 from the perspective of a real-estate developer to whom \u201call countries were in competition, and the success of one meant the failure of another\u201d \u2013 runs completely counter to her view of the world. Even then, she swallows her scorn and lets the subtext do the talking. In a statement that is surprising given how long the book\u2019s publication date was announced in advance, she says \u201cI wish with all my heart that Kamala Harris [\u2026] defeats her competitor and becomes president.\u201d Freedom starts with a lengthy section on Merkel\u2019s first three decades behind the iron curtain, and it\u2019s hard to shake the impression that this is the book she really wanted to write. Not because of any lingering ostalgie: she thought the German Democratic Republic was \u201cas petty, narrow-minded, tasteless and humourless as it could possibly be\u201d. Unlike many more active dissidents, Merkel says she held no illusions that East and West Germany could be reunited on equal terms after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and in her first weeks as a member of the newly founded Democratic Awakening party backs East Germany\u2019s currency to be replaced by the Deutschmark as swiftly as possible. Rather, this reads like the voice of someone finally unburdened of the need to keep quiet about their upbringing. Her first experiences with journalists after the wall went down, she writes, make her realise that it is difficult \u201cto speak openly with West German media about one\u2019s own life in the GDR\u201d, and she explains that she was reluctant to make too much of becoming Germany\u2019s first female chancellor because she didn\u2019t want to be \u201cpigeonholed\u201d. Going by how eager her politician colleagues were to patronise her, that reluctance was perfectly understandable. There\u2019s her former interior minister Horst Seehofer, who describes her 2015 decision to open German borders to refugees from Syria as having led to a \u201ctyranny of injustice\u201d, seemingly putting a Merkel-led Germany on par with the GDR\u2019s dictatorship. Or how about Mexican president Felipe Calder\u00f3n who, at a G20 meeting in 2012, thought he could nudge her into unleashing the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme by likening her to a \u201clittle girl\u201d on the playground, asking her \u201cbig brother\u201d for help to fight off the bullies. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to ask my brother,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI have to get through this on my own.\u201d Her feelings are clear, but it\u2019s not phrased as a complaint, and it doesn\u2019t come with any further explanation. The second half of the book, which deals with geopolitics, is more breathless, as if its pace is still dictated by her crammed diaries during the cumulative crises that marked her career: the global banking crisis that began in 2007, followed by the threat of the break-up of the eurozone, the arrival of an estimated 1.3 million displaced people on Europe\u2019s borders in 2015, and a brewing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The wisdom of the strategic decisions she made during these key moments came into question just two-and-a-half months after she stepped down, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Merkel was a stellar student of Russian, and Putin spoke fluent German, which had positioned her to become the west\u2019s closest negotiating partner with the Kremlin. Even before diplomatic relations deteriorated, she writes, she held no illusions as to Putin\u2019s desire \u201cto push back against the American victory in the Cold War\u201d. The 2014 annexation of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts made it clear to her that the Russian president was a \u201crulebreaker\u201d who \u201cmust be stopped\u201d. If so, why did Germany under her leadership allow its reliance on Russian gas to rise? Why did she not discontinue the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that linked Russia directly with her constituency in Germany\u2019s north-east, allowing gas transits to bypass Ukraine? Why did she not campaign to ramp up Europe\u2019s defence? Her answers are frustratingly formulaic. Justifying Germany and France in 2008 blocking Ukraine\u2019s admission to the Membership Action Plan that would have put the country on a road to join Nato, she says it is \u201cillusory\u201d that this would have deterred Russian aggression: Putin wouldn\u2019t have \u201ctwiddled his thumbs\u201d. But for Putin even the rhetorical gesture towards Ukraine\u2019s future Nato membership that she agreed to as a compromise was a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d. So what difference did her veto make? On Nord Stream, Merkel writes that halting the project would have required a special ruling at a European level, which she would have looked into had Ukraine and Russia not signed a new transit contract. A vigorous defence would read differently. At its worst, Freedom is as patronising towards the European states to Germany\u2019s east as her male colleagues were to Merkel. Many countries in central and eastern Europe, she writes, had very little appetite for investing in any relationship with Russia. \u201cThey seemed to wish that their gigantic neighbour would disappear from the map, simply cease to exist.\u201d Yet wasn\u2019t it Germany that engaged in make-believe, convincing itself that expanding trade relations with Russia would somehow restrain its imperial ambitions? All the human qualities that made Merkel a likable and liked leader are in this book: the lack of showmanship, the understated sense of humour, the dedication to building alliances and forging compromises. And yet you finish Freedom asking yourself whether good human beings automatically make good decision-makers. In the foreword, Merkel promises to \u201cidentify my misjudgements\u201d, but the only mea culpas relate to a few rhetorical slip-ups, such as the \u201ctrite\u201d and \u201cparochial\u201d image of the thrifty Swabian housewife she evoked during the eurozone crisis. After Brexit, she is \u201ctormented\u201d by whether more concessions would have kept the UK in the EU, but concludes that Britain\u2019s exit had been a foregone conclusion ever since David Cameron tried to appease Eurosceptics within his own party. Answering to the rights or wrongs of Germany\u2019s big-picture risk calculation \u2013 of banking on Russian natural gas to enable a nuclear energy phase-out \u2013 somehow gets forgotten in the rush from summit communique to summit communique. Is it fair to hold one woman accountable for the mess in which the western liberal democracy she embodied finds itself in 2024, especially given her leadership of a country with more restraints on executive power than her counterparts in France or the UK? Merkel answers that question herself.

Most of the women thawing eggs for treatment were in a heterosexual relationship (85%), followed by single women (13%) and women in a same-sex couple (2%).

The HFEA said that IVF funding was least common for single patients and female same-sex couples compared with heterosexual couples in 2022. About 16% of lesbian couples and 18% of single patients had NHS funding for their first IVF treatment, compared with 52% of heterosexual couples aged 18 to 39, the report found.
