Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a family of medications that help people shed the pounds, manage blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes and prevent heart attacks and strokes in people with heart disease. But while the benefits of the drugs for treating obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are well known, their potential impact on kidney health has been less certain. Now the largest and most comprehensive analysis of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney outcomes suggests they could have significant benefits. The findings were published in the Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology journal. Researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 11 large-scale clinical trials of weight loss drugs involving more than 85,000 people. The group included people with type 2 diabetes, and people with cardiovascular disease who were overweight or obese but did not have type 2 diabetes. Seven different GLP-1 receptor agonists were investigated among the trials, including semaglutide, also known as Ozempic or Wegovy, dulaglutide and liraglutide. Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the risk of kidney failure by 16% and the worsening of kidney function by 22%, researchers said. The combined reduction in the risk of kidney failure, worsening kidney function and death due to kidney disease was 19%. The analysis also confirmed previous findings that weight-loss drugs protect cardiovascular health, with a 14% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack and non-fatal stroke, compared with placebo. Death by any cause was 13% lower among patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Lead author Prof Sunil Badve, professorial fellow at the George Institute for Global Health and UNSW Sydney, said the study expanded current knowledge about the potential benefits of the drugs. \u201cThis is the first study to show a clear benefit of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease, suggesting they have a key role in kidney-protective and heart-protective treatment for patients with common medical conditions like type 2 diabetes, overweight or obesity with cardiovascular disease, or CKD [chronic kidney disease],\u201d he said. \u201cThese results are particularly important for patients with chronic kidney disease. It is a progressive condition eventually leading to kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation and is associated with premature death, mostly from heart disease.

Prof Vlado Perkovic, professorial fellow at the George Institute, provost at UNSW Sydney and senior author on the study, said: \u201cThis research shows that GLP-1 receptor agonists could play an important role in addressing the global burden of non-communicable diseases. \u201cOur study will have a major impact on clinical guidelines for the management of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease in people with and without diabetes. \u201cMore work is now needed to implement the results of this study into clinical practice and improve access to GLP-1 receptor agonists to people who will benefit from them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, a White House spokesperson said on Monday. \u201cThe president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election,\u201d said Andrew Bates, senior deputy press secretary at the White House, Reuters reported. \u201cHe and the First Lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration.\u201d The president-elect did not attend Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021, which came days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Earlier this month, the US president welcomed Trump back to the White House \u2013 another tradition Trump eschewed after losing the 2020 election- with Biden promising a transfer of power that is \u201cas smooth as it can get\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having, like we said, a smooth transition. We\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure you\u2019re accommodated, what you need, and we\u2019re going to get a chance to talk about some of that today,\u201d Biden said earlier this month. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision to skip Biden\u2019s inauguration was not without precedent, but he was the first president to skip his successor\u2019s inauguration in more than 150 years and his then outgoing administration was represented by then outgoing vice-president Mike Pence.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. Congratulations to West Ham, who have moved away from the relegation zone with that win. Ta ra! West Ham\u2019s Jarrod Bowen speaks to the cameras: We needed a performance, and I think we did that. To keep Newcastle to a clean sheet, to control the atmosphere, to control the game, we did that perfectly. We have quality from set pieces. If you sit on a lead here, as we found out last season, you can get punished. We went for the second goal. We have a massive game against Arsenal but we need to be winning games on the bounce. Sometimes when you have new players that come in, it\u2019s up to player like me, that have been at the club for a while, to show them the standards of this club. I think we should be pushing for European football every year. Teams have improved but we have a really good side, a really good manager. We haven\u2019t played to a high enough standard this season but this is a really big turning point. That was an excellent win for West Ham. Defensively sound (Fabianski was also excellent), clinical on the counter-attack. The players ran their hearts out, and there was a clear identity to their play. If ever there was a performance to help a manager under pressure, this was it. With Fullkrug (injured) and Kudus (suspended) to return next month, things are looking up for the Hammers. I still don\u2019t think anything beyond a top-half finish is possible this season though. Perhaps you could say the same for Newcastle, but it\u2019s still early days in the season. Newcastle have been woeful, but all credit to West Ham. This has been a complete away performance, and a huge boost to Lopetegui. 90+4 min: Sky Sports have made Paqueta their man of the match. The Brazilian has had a decent game, but Bowen has been the best player on the pitch. Wan Bissaka has also played very well, and not just because of his goal. 90+2 min: After a hopeful cross into the box, the ball finds kindly to Isak, but the Newcastle striker swipes wildly at the ball, which lands softly in Fabianski\u2019s hands. 90 min: A minimum of six minutes added on. But there isn\u2019t a roar from the home side, encouraging their side to find an unlikely way back into this match. In fact, some are leaving. \u201cThe body language just hasn\u2019t been right from the get go,\u201d emails Chris Paraskevas. \u201cToo many players casual in possession, taking too many extra touches. Defensively a shambles, with no-one sure who to pick up, or leaving it to someone else. Looks like too many \u2018stars\u2019 believed their own hype and expected to win by simply turning up. Soucek\u2019s free header [for the first goal set the tone\u201d. 88 min: West Ham are now officially taking the mickey. The ol\u00e9\u2019s have started as the visitors stroke the ball around the pitch. 86 min: More substitutions. Trippier on for Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, who looked injured as he hobbled straight down the tunnel. Looks like Lewis Hall is going into midfield. West Ham bring on Andy Irving and Guido Rodriguez for Carlos Soler and Crysencio Summerville. 84 min: This is so, so comfortable for West Ham, who are cruising towards victory here. Newcastle have been so poor this second half. \u201cWhen was the last time the West Ham keeper made a save?\u201d asks John Ryan. \u201cCause it wasn\u2019t tonight\u201d. 82 min: \u201cThe fact that 3,000+ West Ham fans have made the trip to SJP for a Monday night game is surely worth a mention,\u201d emails Anthony Ashworth. \u201cBack in the day I went up there for the same fixture on a Sunday when we lost 4-0 in a game televised live. There were barely 300 Hammers fans there, as was the norm in those days. The worst thing was I forgot to take the sandwiches my mum had made me for the trip\u201d. I think I spotted Carlton Cole in the West Ham away end tonight. 80 min: Bowen and Ings linking really nicely since the latter came on. Newcastle\u2019s midfield appears to have evaporated defensively. Partly, perhaps, because of the change to 4-4-2, partly because Bruno Guimar\u00e3es is limping. 78 min: Bowen with a great chance! The West Ham talisman picks the ball up midfield and is allowed to run a full 30 yards, into Newcastle\u2019s box, before anyone in black and white thinks to close him down. Bowen shoots with his weaker right foot, and drags it horribly wide. A great opportunity, though! 76 min: West Ham make two more changes to keep things fresh. Coufal replaces Emerson, which means Wan-Bissaka will switch from right to left back. Ings comes on for Antonio, who has been a nuisance all night despite not getting a sight of goal. 74 min: An email from Rick Harris. \u201cAfter the surprising sacking of Leicester manager Steve Cooper yesterday following an underwhelming performance by his team, it is refreshing to see the West Ham players come out tonight determined to keep Julen Lopetegui in a job, at least for a while\u201d. 72 min: Penalty shout for Newcastle! A cross comes in towards Wilson, and Mavropanos is surely all over the striker? Wilson appeals, as do the home supporters. It will go to VAR \u2026 no penalty! Wow. Really surprised at that, was a fairly obvious foul, well before the cross arrived. 70 min: Bowen nutmegs Murphy. Welcome to the game, pal. 69 min: Two badly-needed changes made by Howe. Callum Wilson replaces Joelinton to make his first appearance of the season. Jacob Murphy is also on for Gordon, who has been anonymous on the right wing. I think Newcastle are now playing 4-4-2. 67 min: A no-look pass from Wan-Bissaka! West Ham are taking the piss now. 65 min: Interesting that Wan-Bissaka, naturally a defensive-minded right back, has obviously been given license to roam forward. He does so again, just as he did for the goal, but West Ham\u2019s move fizzles out. 63 min: Jarrod Bowen having a brilliant game for West Ham. Every touch is purposeful and considered. 61 min: Right on the edge of Newcastle\u2019s box, Kelly upends Bowen with a clumsy tackle. Despite his protestations at the booking, Kelly is lucky not to see red. He was the last man, but Livramento probably retreated quickly enough to be considered a covering defender. Soler shoots from the resulting free-kick, beaten away by Pope. 59 min: Newcastle are all over the place! West Ham should be home and dry, as Bowen and Soucek both have shots blocked, after Kelly denies Summerville with a brilliant clearing tackle. 57 min: Both sides make changes: Mavropanos comes on for Todibo. It\u2019s not clear whether that was tactical or an injury. Todibo has probably been the poorest performer for West Ham tonight. Tonali comes on for Longstaff. That\u2019s a straight swap for Newcastle. 56 min: West Ham nearly add a third! Bowen shoots from 20 yards and only a good save from Pope stops another West Ham goal. What an away performance this is. They have soaked up plenty of pressure but haven\u2019t conceded a lot of golden chances and have been clinical with their own opportunities. The most unlikely of goalscorers! Just the third goal of the right-back\u2019s career, in nearly 250 club appearances! Bruno Guimar\u00e3es has his pocket picked by compatriot Paqueta in midfield. The Brazilian feeds Bowen, who finds Wan-Bissaka on the underlap \u2026 and the right-back finishes brilliant from a tight angle, arrowing a shot off the far post! 53 min: Gordon, sporting a mullet haircut that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the 2005 Australian cricket team, fires just wide after some good work from Barnes, who has been given plenty of space since coming on. 51 min: Summerville is a tricky character. The West Ham winger has been lively without any end product tonight. 48 min: Newcastle instantly on the offensive. Gordon breaks forward on the counter-attack, before Schar tries his luck from 40 (!) yards out. The Swiss has got previous from that range. 46 min: Newcastle have made one change: Harvey Barnes replaces Joe Willock. That means Barnes will play on the left, Gordon on the right, and Joelinton into central midfield. Peeeeeeeep! We\u2019re off again. Half-time reading: A very pleasing half for Julen Lopetegui. 45+2 min: West Ham win a couple of debatable free-kicks to eat through some of the time. Bowen tries his luck from range. This is a frustrating end to the half for Newcastle. 45 min: Three minutes added on for injury time. 43 min: West Ham get their foot on the ball. It looks like they have survived that spell. There are nervous glances of Howe and assistant on the sidelines. Good to see Jason Tindall getting his share of airtime. 41 min: It\u2019s all Newcastle. West Ham are trying to hold on for half-time. Joelinton has swapped flanks with Gordon, who is now playing on the right. 39 min: Isak misses from 10 yards! Bruno Guimar\u00e3es wins the ball back in midfield and plays a beautiful lofted pass to Isak, who takes the ball down on his chest and fires wide with his left foot. The Swede was reaching for the ball there, and put under pressure by the retreating Kilman and onrushing Fabianski, but you still would have expected him to bury that. Replays show Isak was onside. 35 min: Great save from Fabianski! Todibo fails to deal with simple Newcastle cross from the right, and gifts possession to Gordon on the six-yard box. But Fabianski is off his line in a flash and falls expertly at the feet of Gordon to block the shot! 33 min: Newcastle are getting closer. Hall flashes a cross-shot across West Ham\u2019s six-yard box that avoids both the far post and Isak, lurking just beyond it. Could easily have been a tap-in for the Swede. 31 min: A good excuse for Antonio to remove his shirt without getting booked. His shirt has been ripped. Sky Sports commentator Seb Hutchinson, sometimes of this parish on Football Weekly, says Antonio has a custom shirt made to fit his neck, and that garment is more susceptible to ripping. 29 min: Newcastle growing back into this game. They are enjoying a lot of the ball, but haven\u2019t created a lot with West Ham sitting deep in a 4-5-1 formation. 27 min: Looks like Antonio has taken my earlier comment to heart. The West Ham striker is now linking the play nicely and tearing around like a man possessed when Newcastle have the ball. Antonio chases Longstaff down and wins the ball back brilliantly, before setting West Ham off on the counter-attack. 24 min: In attempting to block Soler\u2019s shot, Longstaff careered into Newcastle teammate Willock, who requires some treatment. Looks like Willock will be OK, though. 23 min: A wonderful flowing move from West Ham! Summerville, Paquet\u00e1 and Soler exchange a trio of one-touch, slick passes on the edge of Newcastle\u2019s box, which ends with the latter finding a pocket of space and firing wide. A good chance, spurned. 21 min: After Summerville is harshly penalised for tackling Longstaff, Lopetegui is given a yellow card for protesting too much on the sidelines. That means the Spanish manager will be suspended for the visit of Arsenal on Saturday! 19 min: Not sure I love seeing Joelinton playing in this right-wing role. He\u2019s such a talented, chaotic menace in central midfield, alongside Bruno Guimar\u00e3es. Newcastle do seem particularly well stocked in central midfield \u2013 Tonali is on the bench tonight \u2013 and particularly light at right wing. Almiron is out of favour, and Jacob Murphy is useful without being elite. 16 min: Back come Newcastle. Wan-Bissaka nods a poor defensive header straight to Willock, who bends an effort two yards wide of Fabianski\u2019s far post. 14 min: Newcastle are reeling slightly, as West Ham push for a second! Antonio gets to the byline but his cut back is scrambled clear. The visitors win another corner, and surprisingly take it short. You would have thought West Ham would want to throw another cross into the mixer after the goal. 12 min: Now, then. Out of nothing, West Ham are ahead! The visitors win a corner, from which Emerson swings in a cross to the penalty spot, where an unmarked Soucek nods into the far corner! Where was the marking? Kelly was the nearest defender but he didn\u2019t even challenge the Czech. 7 min: Antonio looks miles off it. But West Ham are sitting very deep and the Jamaican international doesn\u2019t have a great deal of support. 5 min: Hall plays a brilliant ball from deep, and Isak drifts off the shoulder of Todibo to again run in behind. The Swede is through on goal and dinks the ball delicately over the onrushing Fabianski into the net. Oh! But the goal is ruled out for offside. Replays show that Isak was a few inches offside when running in behind. West Ham are playing a very high line, though. Dangerous against Isak. 4 min: The home side fashion the first half-chance as Joelinton slips in Isak, who runs in behind and shoots high and wide from a tight angle. Kilman marshalled Isak nicely there. 2 min: Lloyd Kelly, in his first start for Newcastle since September, wins the first header against Antonio. Peeeeeeeep! And we\u2019re off in the north-east. The teams are out! Jarrod Bowen is the West Ham captain tonight. Huge tifos for Isak are being unveiled at St James\u2019 Park. Wow! \u201cNice to see our Callum Wilson back from injury\u201d, emails Chris Paraskevas. \u201cThe last time he was fit for Newcastle was around the time Henry II was ordering the big keep to be built in the city: didn\u2019t bother visiting it when I was on Tyneside - went straight to the football and then had a few drinks at the Bigg Market. Wilson has an insane goal-scoring record against West Ham. I have a feeling they might cause us a couple of problems if we\u2019re not \u2018on it\u2019 from the first whistle\u201d. Wilson is on the bench for Newcastle tonight. He has 12 goals in 14 appearances for West Ham since his first match against the Hammers (for Bournemouth) 2015-16. It is 2024 and Michail Antonio, 34, is still leading the line for West Ham. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug is injured, remember. The German has made just four appearances his summer move and is yet to score for his new club. This fixture last season was a cracker: Newcastle 4-3 West Ham. Harvey Barnes is on the bench again tonight. The Englishman is a fine player but is not very versatile (doesn\u2019t play on the right or through the middle) and is struggling to be first choice on the left ahead of Anthony Gordon. Barnes also hasn\u2019t committed for an international team, having played once for England\u2019s senior team (in a friendly) back in 2020. The 26-year-old, in the prime of his career, is also eligible to represent Scotland. Newcastle: Pope, Livramento, Schar, Kelly, Hall, Longstaff, Guimaraes, Willock, Gordon, Isak, Joelinton. Subs: Dubravka, Trippier, Tonali, Wilson, Barnes, Targett, Osula, Jacob Murphy, Almiron. West Ham: Fabianski, Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Emerson Palmieri, Soucek, Bowen, Soler, Lucas Paqueta, Summerville, Antonio. Subs: Areola, Cresswell, Coufal, Mavropanos, Luis Guilherme, Ings, Rodriguez, Irving, Scarles. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire) Which of the next two games for West Ham is an easier match for Julen Lopetgui and his team? Away at a resurgent Newcastle, who are fresh from three wins on the spin (against Chelsea, Arsenal and away at Nottingham Forest)? Or, this coming Saturday, a visit from the Gunners? Truth is, neither is an enviable task. Yet it seems that Lopetegui has these two games to save his job after a summer of expensive recruitment and a poor start to the season. West Ham are just three points above the relegation zone, while Newcastle will jump into the top six with a win tonight. There were some mild concerns about Eddie Howe\u2019s position a few weeks ago after a poor run in October, but the return of fitness (particularly Alexander Isak) and form has meant the whispers of any change have faded in the north-east. St James\u2019 Park under the lights, rarely disappoints and for both teams, there is a little bit more on this early-season encounter than normal. Kick-off: 8pm GMT.",

He is distressed that they have absorbed the gambling ad message and that their passion for sport is expressed through gambling. I assured him that given Labor and the Coalition would legislate a ban on social media for 16-year-olds they cannot enforce, it was surely a fait accompli that we would see a gambling ad ban which they can enforce. Exactly the same anxiety that parents feel about social media, they feel about gambling ads grooming their kids. Just a few hours later I saw the news that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, seems to have squibbed any gambling ad reform at all. I was profoundly shocked. A year ago, I had witnessed the emotion of the PM when he spoke at Peta Murphy\u2019s funeral and I had been assured that Labor would honour her groundbreaking legacy on gambling reform. I honestly believed that. She showed us the pathway to address one of our biggest health issues, in the country with the world\u2019s highest per-capita gambling losses. The only question, I believed, was whether they would adopt her recommendation for a full ad ban or legislate just a partial ban. Would they move gambling out of racing and sport to address it in our health departments? Would they implement a national gambling regulator or continue to allow the Northern Territory to continue as the de facto regulator of these ads? Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email But to squib any reform at all, and dishonour her legacy so totally, never entered my mind. What has just happened? Well, it was not public opinion that defeated any reform. More than 70% of the public wanted a full ad ban and everyone wanted some limits placed on the ubiquity of these predatory ads normalising gambling in children\u2019s minds with the AFL and NRL. The AFL supporters\u2019 survey showed that 76% wanted a gambling ad ban from TV and radio. With more than a million ads a year on free-to-air television, the Australian public has had enough. There is a collective psychic vomit every time an ad appears, as well as parental incomprehension about why, 18 months after the Murphy inquiry, our children are still being subjected to this. Peter Dutton knew this. Months before the Murphy recommendations were handed down, he promised in his 2023 budget reply to limit gambling ads and received an overwhelmingly positive response. The Coalition has not responded to Murphy and was waiting to react to the government\u2019s response. Now that the government has squibbed any reform, Dutton has a big opportunity. What happened is pretty simple in my view. The vested interests cowed the PM into dishonouring Murphy\u2019s legacy. Those vested interests start with the obscenely rich foreign-owned sports betting companies. The British online gambling company Bet365 is well connected through their peak body Responsible Wagering Australia, which had former Labor senator Stephen Conroy as CEO followed by former Liberal chief of staff Kai Cantwell. Sporting bodies are often associated with gambling companies. The former CEO of the AFL is now CEO of Tabcorp. The AFL have been lobbying the PM not to implement the Murphy recommendations.

Superior court judge Michael Jesic said during a much-anticipated hearing on Monday that he needed more time to review the new evidence, and to give Los Angeles county\u2019s newly elected district attorney, Nathan Hochman, who is more politically conservative than the current district attorney, time to weigh in on the case. Jesic said he will consider the resentencing request on 30 January instead of 11 December as originally planned, prompting news headlines from Hollywood outlets closely following the case that the Menendez Brothers Won\u2019t Be Free By Christmas. Jesic said he had 17 boxes of documents to review, which includes abuse evidence raised in the habeas petition. Hochman, the incoming district attorney, who takes office in December, said in a statement to media in November that he looked forward to putting in the \u201chard work to thoroughly review the facts and law of the Menendez case\u201d. Two of the brothers\u2019 aunts, Joan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez\u2019s sister, and Teresita Baralt, Jose\u2019s older sister, did testify at the Los Angeles hearing on Monday and asked for their release, saying 35 years was a long time for the brothers after suffering abuse. \u201cWe miss those who are gone tremendously,\u201d Baralt said in tears after taking the stand. \u201cBut we miss the kids too.\u201d Last month, Los Angeles prosecutors recommended resentencing for the brothers, saying they had worked on redemption and rehabilitation and demonstrated good behavior inside prison. There is no question the brothers committed the killing, George Gasc\u00f3n, the current district attorney, told CNN. \u201cThe question is to what degree of culpability should they be held accountable to, given the totality of the circumstance.\u201d Gasc\u00f3n asked for new sentences of 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for parole because they were less than 26 years old when they killed their parents. The developments come as a a more sympathetic view of the brothers emerged in recent years, due in part to viral TikTok videos that focused on their story of abuse.

The lawyers had not known of the letter and realized it had not been introduced at their trials, making it in effect new evidence that they say corroborates allegations that Erik was sexually abused by his father. More new evidence emerged when Roy Rossell\u00f3, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, recently came forward to allege he had been drugged and raped by Jos\u00e9 Menendez, the boys\u2019 father, when he was a teen in the 1980s. Menudo were signed under RCA Records, where Jos\u00e9 Menendez was chief operating officer. Rossell\u00f3 spoke about the alleged abuse in the Peacock docuseries Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, and provided a signed declaration to the brothers\u2019 lawyers. Had these two pieces of evidence been available during the brothers\u2019 trial, prosecutors would not have been able to argue that there was no corroboration of sexual abuse, or that Jos\u00e9 Menendez was not the \u201ckind of man that would\u201d abuse children, the petition argues. While clemency might be another pathway to freedom for the brothers, last week Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, said he would not decide until Hochman, who unseated Gasc\u00f3n in the 5 November election, reviews the case.

When a downbeat Trump held this event at the end of his own presidency in 2020, there were shouted questions such as \u201cMr President, will you be issuing a pardon for yourself?\u201d Biden has ruled out a last-minute pardon for his son, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hunter-biden\">Hunter</a>, convicted on federal gun charges.</p> <p>But a mischief-maker with a dark sense of humour might have named this year\u2019s turkeys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/nancy-pelosi-biden-democrats-election-loss\">Nancy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack</a>, after the two Democrats who hastened the president\u2019s exit from the election race after his disastrous TV debate against Trump.</p> <p>Instead the two white-plumed birds, raised in Minnesota, were called <a href=\"https://x.com/POTUS/status/1861126516421099871\">Peach and Blossom</a>, named after the official state flower of Biden\u2019s home state, Delaware.</p> <p>Wearing his trademark aviator sunglasses, Biden, marking his final holiday season at the White House, could not resist remarking: \u201cAnd by the way, Delaware has a long history of growing peaches. In fact, the <a href=\"https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/delaware/state-food-agriculture-symbol/peach-pie\">peach pie</a> in our state is one of my favorite. It\u2019s a state dessert!\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPeach blossom flower also symbolises resilience, which is, quite frankly, fitting for today.\u201d</p> <p>It was ostensibly a comment about the turkeys\u2019 resourcefulness in avoiding the Thanksgiving dinner table. Some might also have detected a poignant acknowledgement that, even Biden talked turkey, a man his allies branded a fascist is down at Mar-a-Lago preparing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/president-trump-election-maga\">hammer America\u2019s democratic institutions</a> all over again.</p> <p>George HW Bush <a href=\"https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-backgrounders/history-of-white-house-thanksgiving-traditions\">made it an annual tradition</a> to formally pardon a Thanksgiving turkey, though tales of the birds being spared from dinner tables go back to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency. Biden recalled that, in the past four years, he has continued the tradition by pardoning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/biden-pardons-thanksgiving-turkeys-peanut-butter-jelly\">Peanut Butter and Jelly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/biden-turkey-pardon-thanksgiving\">Chocolate and Chip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/20/turkey-pardon-biden-thanksgiving\">Liberty and Bell</a>. \u201cAnd today, Peach and Blossom will join the free birds of the United States of America.\u201d</p> <p>As he continued, Peach could be heard gobbling. \u201cYeah, I hear you,\u201d Biden said, as the crowd laughed. \u201cPeach wants to speak a little bit here.\u201d</p> <p>Peach weighs 41lbs, loves to eat tater-tot-topped hotdish, enjoys cross-country skiing, dreams of seeing the Northern Lights and lives by the motto, \u201cKeep calm and gobble on\u201d, the president quipped. Blossom weighs 40lbs, loves to eat cheese curds and watch boxing, dreams of visiting each of Minnesota\u2019s 10,000 lakes and lives by the motto: \u201cNo fowl play, just Minnesota nice\u201d.</p> <p>The turkeys had travelled 1,100 miles over 16 and a half hours, listening to their favourite music, including the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDK9QqIzhwk\">Living on a Prayer</a>. Biden added: \u201cWell, fellas, your prayer is going to be answered today. Based on your temperament and commitment to being productive members of society, I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom.\u201d</p> <p>And so the lame duck pardoned the turkeys.</p> <p>As is customary, Biden then promised to close on a more serious note. He acknowledged that this would be his last time speaking here as president during this season. \u201cSo, let me say to you: It\u2019s been the honour of my life. I\u2019m forever grateful.\u201d</p> <p>There were characteristic reflections on those who have lost loved ones, the importance of family and how America is the greatest country on earth. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hyperbole,\u201d he added, as if anticipating dissenters. \u201cWe are.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what, in America, we never give up. We keep going. We keep the faith. We just have to remember who we are. We\u2019re the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.\u201d</p> <p>It is a line that Biden uses often at the end of his speeches. But on Monday it sounded like a plea from a man whose legacy is imperilled. With Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, gutting of the federal bureaucracy and \u201cAmerica first\u201d isolationism, a presidency that once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/09/jon-meacham-joe-biden-fdr\">seemed so consequential</a> is at risk of fading fast.</p> <p>Despite the big crowd, Biden\u2019s turkey farewell felt more muted than that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/23/barack-obama-thanksgiving-turkey-pardon\">Barack Obama</a> who, despite the knowledge that Trump was looming, managed to remain cheerful fire off a \u201ca corny-copia of dad jokes about turkeys\u201d. Obama that day seemed demob happy; Biden like a man in denial.</p> <p>Peach and Blossom will now head to an agricultural centre in Minnesota to help promote the state and educate future farmers. Biden, riding off into a sunset of his own, may find retirement brings far less peace.</p>",

And he knows how obsessed Trump is with crowd sizes. \u201cThey tell me there\u2019s 2,500 people here today,\u201d said Biden, standing at the presidential lectern on the south lawn and quipping, \u201clooking for a pardon.\u201d He laughed and so did the crowd. When a downbeat Trump held this event at the end of his own presidency in 2020, there were shouted questions such as \u201cMr President, will you be issuing a pardon for yourself?\u201d Biden has ruled out a last-minute pardon for his son, Hunter, convicted on federal gun charges. But a mischief-maker with a dark sense of humour might have named this year\u2019s turkeys Nancy and Barack, after the two Democrats who hastened the president\u2019s exit from the election race after his disastrous TV debate against Trump. Instead the two white-plumed birds, raised in Minnesota, were called Peach and Blossom, named after the official state flower of Biden\u2019s home state, Delaware. Wearing his trademark aviator sunglasses, Biden, marking his final holiday season at the White House, could not resist remarking: \u201cAnd by the way, Delaware has a long history of growing peaches. In fact, the peach pie in our state is one of my favorite. It\u2019s a state dessert!\u201d He added: \u201cPeach blossom flower also symbolises resilience, which is, quite frankly, fitting for today.\u201d It was ostensibly a comment about the turkeys\u2019 resourcefulness in avoiding the Thanksgiving dinner table. Some might also have detected a poignant acknowledgement that, even Biden talked turkey, a man his allies branded a fascist is down at Mar-a-Lago preparing to hammer America\u2019s democratic institutions all over again. George HW Bush made it an annual tradition to formally pardon a Thanksgiving turkey, though tales of the birds being spared from dinner tables go back to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s presidency. Biden recalled that, in the past four years, he has continued the tradition by pardoning Peanut Butter and Jelly, Chocolate and Chip and Liberty and Bell. \u201cAnd today, Peach and Blossom will join the free birds of the United States of America.\u201d As he continued, Peach could be heard gobbling. \u201cYeah, I hear you,\u201d Biden said, as the crowd laughed. \u201cPeach wants to speak a little bit here.\u201d Peach weighs 41lbs, loves to eat tater-tot-topped hotdish, enjoys cross-country skiing, dreams of seeing the Northern Lights and lives by the motto, \u201cKeep calm and gobble on\u201d, the president quipped. Blossom weighs 40lbs, loves to eat cheese curds and watch boxing, dreams of visiting each of Minnesota\u2019s 10,000 lakes and lives by the motto: \u201cNo fowl play, just Minnesota nice\u201d. The turkeys had travelled 1,100 miles over 16 and a half hours, listening to their favourite music, including the song Living on a Prayer. Biden added: \u201cWell, fellas, your prayer is going to be answered today. Based on your temperament and commitment to being productive members of society, I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom.\u201d And so the lame duck pardoned the turkeys. As is customary, Biden then promised to close on a more serious note. He acknowledged that this would be his last time speaking here as president during this season. \u201cSo, let me say to you: It\u2019s been the honour of my life. I\u2019m forever grateful.\u201d There were characteristic reflections on those who have lost loved ones, the importance of family and how America is the greatest country on earth. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hyperbole,\u201d he added, as if anticipating dissenters. \u201cWe are. \u201cNo matter what, in America, we never give up. We keep going. We keep the faith. We just have to remember who we are. We\u2019re the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.\u201d It is a line that Biden uses often at the end of his speeches. But on Monday it sounded like a plea from a man whose legacy is imperilled. With Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, gutting of the federal bureaucracy and \u201cAmerica first\u201d isolationism, a presidency that once seemed so consequential is at risk of fading fast. Despite the big crowd, Biden\u2019s turkey farewell felt more muted than that of Barack Obama who, despite the knowledge that Trump was looming, managed to remain cheerful fire off a \u201ca corny-copia of dad jokes about turkeys\u201d. Obama that day seemed demob happy; Biden like a man in denial. Peach and Blossom will now head to an agricultural centre in Minnesota to help promote the state and educate future farmers. Biden, riding off into a sunset of his own, may find retirement brings far less peace.",

The canvasser told her about all the services the group offers: Spanish language workshops for parents on how to apply for scholarships, English language tutoring, computer classes and more. In Baena\u2019s words, Libre\u2019s goal is to get people in a room, help them meet their basic needs, and then preach the gospel of small government.</p> \n<p>Beana is a co-founder of Siembra NC, which mostly organizes around workers\u2019 rights, in particular the challenges many immigrant laborers face, including wage theft. Ideologically, Baena is diametrically opposed to Libre\u2019s politics, but she is fascinated by their tactics. She has seen Libre staffers doing stunts outside discount grocery stores, blasting Bidenomics and inflation. They offer cash-strapped shoppers gift cards in the amount of money that Democrats\u2019 policies supposedly \u201cstole\u201d from them. People are grateful for the help and so they stop to chat.</p> \n<p>By capturing the Republican party, Trump positioned himself to reap the benefits of decades of work by rightwing activists, donors and strategists who aimed to strengthen the grip of conservative ideologues and corporate interests on American political life. With laser-like focus, they attacked labor unions, gutted campaign finance law, captured the courts, reconfigured electoral maps and mobilized key interest groups, from anti-abortion activists to gun lovers. And they are actively broadening their reach.</p> \n<p>When Democrats insist that Trump had no ground game, they ignore the right wing\u2019s investment and presence in spaces that are not purely electoral and that engage people year-round, including groups like Libre, along with the evangelical churches and student groups that increasingly function as social clubs recruiting people to the Maga cause. As Tiffany Dena Loftin details in the new issue of the Black leftist magazine <a href=\"https://hammerandhope.org/article/students-campus-organizing\">Hammer &amp; Hope</a>, the right wing has spent decades systematically attacking and defunding progressive student unions and networks and building up their conservative counterparts. The Charlie Kirk-founded and Republican billionaire-funded Turning Point USA claims to have \u201cfreedom chapters\u201d at more than 3,500 colleges and high schools, which offer young conservatives a sense of belonging and community, leadership development, and pathways to political engagement, of which get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts are just one part.</p> \n<p>The Trump campaign built on this model, providing its base with community and purpose and organizing them, in turn, to mobilize others to turn out and vote. Before joining Trump\u2019s team as campaign co-chair, Susie Wiles spent years working to lock down Florida for Republicans (she\u2019s since been named Trump\u2019s incoming <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff\">chief of staff</a>). Her tactics make people feel like an essential part of a group with a clear goal. Wiles piloted the<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campain-election-2024-susie-wiles-chris-lacivita/678806/\"> \u201c10 for Trump\u201d</a> Iowa caucus program, which gave a subset of 2,000 volunteers the title of \u201ccaptain\u201d, a limited-edition gold-embroidered hat, and the goal of motivating 10 people in their precincts to turn out. In the general election, specially trained volunteers were dubbed<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/04/inside-trump-campaigns-ground-game/\"> \u201cTrump Force 47\u201d</a> and tasked with developing longer term relationships with so-called low- or mid-propensity voters, going beyond the usual door-knocking to forge relationships aimed at converting these targets into Republican loyalists. The campaign also used Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud to recruit and train tens of thousands of hyper-vigilant poll workers and Maga acolytes.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump or someone around him is quite bright about the definitional difference between mobilization and organization,\u201d Tory Gavito, founder of Way to Win, told me. Mobilizing people to turn out and cast a ballot is not nearly as powerful as organizing people to adopt an identity, commit to a cause, and join a collective effort to push for change. That\u2019s why Way to Win, a progressive donor network, directs funds to groups that do year-round organizing, rather than helicoptering in days or weeks before an election or relying on high-profile celebrity endorsements.</p> \n<p>In Gavito\u2019s estimation, Trump\u2019s GOTV effort probably mattered less in the end than what she calls the \u201corganizations and institutions that shape worldviews\u201d and engage large numbers of people in their daily lives. That\u2019s where the Democrats\u2019 super polished, pop-up ground game fell short.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Knocked on too many doors\u2019</h2> \n<p>Ironically, the right not only has its own (often lavishly funded) political and cultural infrastructure; it also benefits from infrastructure\u2019s absence in a way the left does not. Widespread feelings of isolation, loneliness and alienation help their cause. The conservative culture warrior Christopher Rufo, for example, has boasted about how a lack of social trust works to his advantage. Distrust makes it easier to spread lies and misinformation and pit communities against each other \u2013 to divide and conquer in order to shrink government, raise corporate profits, and concentrate power.</p> \n<p>Firelands Workers United is an organization that brings together working families to rebuild this tattered social trust, working in rural Washington, including in counties where majorities voted for Trump. They do so by organizing for good jobs, housing, healthcare and fair taxes. The way they organized in 2024 offers a lesson in class-based solidarity that the national Democratic party should learn from.</p> \n<p>This electoral cycle, Firelands\u2019 base was focused on fighting several ballot measures. Washington might be a blue state, but it is one with a remarkably regressive tax system and perennial budget problems. This year the California hedge fund manager Brian Heywood spent $6m on four ballot measures that aimed to repeal popular policies, including a recently passed capital gains tax. The result would have reduced funding for affordable childcare and schools and killed rural jobs. If the capital gains ballot measure had passed, 4,000 wealthy Washingtonians would get richer while everyone else, non-immigrant and immigrant, would pay the price.</p> \n<p>Through 2024, Firelands trained dozens of members so they could educate their communities about this looming threat. They did so by emphasizing a shared class interest, not partisan loyalties, which allowed them to reach across cultural and political divides. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Republicans or Democrats. People out here are frustrated with any politician who sides with the rich over working people,\u201d said the group\u2019s co-founder Stina Janssen.</p> \n<p>Firelands members collaborate across very different backgrounds. A Washington-born retired corrections officer and a Latin American immigrant mill worker would canvas together and develop a real relationship. They, in turn, would connect with voters over anger at billionaires and inequality and invite them into a movement, opening space for people\u2019s assumptions and attitudes to change. \u201cThere would not have been a chance to build these friendships or for the people born here to learn and hear people\u2019s immigration stories with the same level of curiosity without this close work together,\u201d Janssen said.</p> \n<p>Now the group\u2019s non-immigrant members understand what it means for someone to be facing deportation. And immigrant members feel less alone as they understand they are not the only people struggling with healthcare or rent. \u201cOur organizing approach held and affirmed everyone\u2019s suffering and helped people see how their experiences were tied together,\u201d Janssen explained. This \u201cdignity-based solidarity\u201d, as Janssen calls it, isn\u2019t about asking people to check their privilege. It\u2019s rooted in the recognition that we all suffer and deserve better: making ends meet shouldn\u2019t be this hard for me or for you.</p> \n<p>This kind of deep organizing takes time because it aims at shifting political consciousness and fostering enduring commitment. It also requires resources. As Baena told me, groups like Turning Point and Libre Initiative \u201ccan hire so many people because they have endless money\u201d. It\u2019s easier to fund an organization that helps billionaires\u2019 bottom lines than one that threatens them.</p> \n<p>Yet Democrats had plenty of money this year, much of which was contributed by smaller donors. But they spent it on the standard playbook. The Harris campaign spent billions blanketing the airwaves with ads (outspending Republicans three to one on paid media), bombarding undecided voters with text messages, and bussing out-of-state volunteers to canvas neighborhoods. None of those tactics leave a trace after the campaign pulls up stakes. They might as well have set the cash on fire.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/trump-racism-people-of-color-voters\">Why Trump\u2019s racism isn\u2019t an issue \u2013 or enough of one \u2013 for some voters of color</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Like many other organizers I spoke to, Billy Wimsatt, the executive director of Movement Voter Pac (MVP), believes those resources could have been deployed more wisely. \u201cWhat if, instead of spending millions to keep cable news on life support, you had split that money between strategically building up local organizing and online influencer organizing?\u201d he said. This year, MVP moved money to hundreds of organizations that do year-round issue-based organizing in key battleground states in addition to GOTV. That entailed everything from mutual aid to media to ballot measures and candidate recruitment. Wimsatt highlighted the work of Faith in Minnesota, a multi-faith, multi-racial, statewide organization. The group organizes diverse communities, including Muslims and manufactured home park residents, around high-impact issues like housing affordability. This season, Faith in Minnesota volunteers had thousands of conversations with voters and helped protect the state house from flipping to Republicans. \u201cReal organizing wins. Superficial mobilizing loses,\u201d Wimsatt said.</p> \n<p>Andrew Willis Garc\u00e9s, another Siembra NC co-founder, puts it bluntly: Democrats across the country actually \u201cknocked too many doors\u201d. The party\u2019s much ballyhooed ground game failed because it was engineered to facilitate one-off conversations that stick to a script instead of supporting local organizations and campaigns that engage ordinary people around issues they care about. For the people Siembra aims to reach, that means fights to recover stolen wages, stop local law enforcement from collaborating with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and win protections for mobile home tenants. Garc\u00e9s believes that these kinds of local issue campaigns can drive voter engagement by helping people connect their lived experience to candidates or campaigns that might otherwise seem distant, abstract or uninspiring.</p> \n<p>That can make a difference in an election like the recent one, which Baena describes as a three-way race between Trump, Harris and the couch. In terms of sheer numbers, the couch came out ahead. While much has been said about Latino men turning to Trump, Baena and Garc\u00e9s believe the real story is that lots of Latino voters, like other key voting groups, \u201csat this one out\u201d. All told, nearly <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2024-11-15/how-many-people-didnt-vote-in-the-2024-election\">90 million eligible</a> voters, 36% of the overall electorate, stayed home.</p> \n<p>As Baena sees it, the Democrats didn\u2019t have much to offer working people, whatever their race, gender or ethnicity, in terms of tangible improvement to their daily lives or a clear and compelling vision of why the future under Harris would have been better. At the door, there wasn\u2019t much to say besides \u201cthe other guy is bad\u201d. You can\u2019t win people over by telling them everything is fine when they can\u2019t afford groceries, rent, and gas, or when they are upset about the war on Gaza.</p> \n<p>This all goes back to the lack of trust. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust people outside their families and they don\u2019t trust politicians or the government,\u201d Baena said. Parachuting canvassers into a community to have one-time conversations will never truly move the needle; you need to listen and earn trust before you can change minds. \u201cThe work of base-building is getting people to befriend strangers and build community outside of their families, and that\u2019s a pathway to getting people to trust their neighbors and institutions,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf liberals really care about winning elections,\u201d Baena continued, \u201cthey need to reach these people. We need year-round organizing to really bring people in and to show them that they and their families can benefit from public investment and services. And we have to organize in a way that allows the base to feel they\u2019ve helped win the election, not that the campaign won.\u201d</p> \n<p>That\u2019s the feeling Firelands managed to inspire in its members \u2013 a feeling of being agents of change, not passive consumers of politics. On election day, all the regressive ballot measures were voted down in the rural areas where Firelands and their partners organized, including Grays Harbor county, where Trump won 51.5% of the vote but nearly 60% of voters said \u201cno\u201d to repealing taxes on capital gains. Groups like Faith in Minnesota and Firelands show that by emphasizing shared class interests and focusing on clear progressive policies, it\u2019s possible to make inroads with voters who are skeptical of politicians and even sympathetic to aspects of the Maga movement.</p> \n<h2>People-centered, issue-focused organizing</h2> \n<p>Before the 2016 election, the New York senator Chuck Schumer made a now infamous pronouncement about the Democratic party\u2019s electoral strategy: \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2021, on the other hand, the then US representative Jim Banks of Indiana (now senator-elect) <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo\">shared a memo</a> with the then House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, detailing how the Republican party could \u201cpermanently become the Party of the Working Class\u201d in part by appealing to \u201cminority voters\u201d.</p> \n<p>Three years later, Banks\u2019s proposal no longer reads as wishful thinking. Trump\u2019s campaign made inroads with low-income communities and voters of color in urban and rural areas nationwide, including peeling off an alarming number of unionized voters. Meanwhile, Schumer\u2019s plan of tacking to the center in order to target Republican voters at the expense of less affluent Democratic ones helped Harris get trounced.</p> \n<p>Instead of aspiring to razor-thin margins of victory, Democrats must become more populist and more ambitious. But better messaging must be coupled with a disciplined strategy to expand the voting base and win resounding majorities so politicians can actually deliver on a platform that makes this country more inclusive, sustainable, and fair.</p> \n<p>To accomplish this, Democrats need to find ways to win over some of the people who voted for Trump not because they are committed to Maga, but out of frustration with the status quo. And they also need to connect with many more of those millions of people who chose the couch. Instead of listening to the Liz Cheney-loving consulting class and the cable ad-buying gurus at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/us/elections/future-forward-kamala-harris-ads.html\">Future Forward</a>, Democrats need to muster the kind of political determination that drove Susie Wiles to swing Florida firmly to the right and enabled Republicans to paint Texas a deep red.</p> \n<p>You can bet that conservative strategists are thinking about how to eat away at Democratic strongholds, including California. Where\u2019s the 10-year plan to flip Texas and its 40 electoral votes back to blue?</p> \n<p>The problem isn\u2019t just a lack of vision or political will, but resources. The big money bundlers and special interests don\u2019t want to cede control. According to Way to Win\u2019s Gavito, the aftermath of Trump\u2019s first victory brought together an unlikely coalition of Democratic donors, many of whom were not particularly liberal, let alone progressive, but who were concerned about threats to democracy and craving a return to normalcy. After Joe Biden won, many ceased to collaborate or invest in base-building efforts, wary of strategies aimed at empowering diverse working-class voters or delivering the kind of progressive policy measures that might appeal to them. Perhaps, now, some of these donors will realize that their cautious, center-hewing strategy has failed and reassess their approach.</p> \n<p>But changes at the top won\u2019t be enough if they\u2019re not tethered to change on the ground. Voter outreach needs to be people- and place-centered, not data- and advertiser-driven. It needs to be issue-focused and year-round, not scaled in eight weeks and gone overnight. And it must offer more than an awkward conversation at the door and an alienating avalanche of texts treating recipients like little more than ATMs. People need a sense of belonging and a compelling and credible vision of a future worth fighting for.</p> \n<p>In the end, the fate of democracy is too precious to leave in the hands of the Democratic party. Across the country, ordinary people are building the relationships, organizations, and power required to move this country forward. They are the ground game we need.</p>",

The canvasser told her about all the services the group offers: Spanish language workshops for parents on how to apply for scholarships, English language tutoring, computer classes and more. In Baena\u2019s words, Libre\u2019s goal is to get people in a room, help them meet their basic needs, and then preach the gospel of small government.

When Democrats insist that Trump had no ground game, they ignore the right wing\u2019s investment and presence in spaces that are not purely electoral and that engage people year-round, including groups like Libre, along with the evangelical churches and student groups that increasingly function as social clubs recruiting people to the Maga cause. As Tiffany Dena Loftin details in the new issue of the Black leftist magazine Hammer &amp; Hope, the right wing has spent decades systematically attacking and defunding progressive student unions and networks and building up their conservative counterparts. The Charlie Kirk-founded and Republican billionaire-funded Turning Point USA claims to have \u201cfreedom chapters\u201d at more than 3,500 colleges and high schools, which offer young conservatives a sense of belonging and community, leadership development, and pathways to political engagement, of which get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts are just one part. The Trump campaign built on this model, providing its base with community and purpose and organizing them, in turn, to mobilize others to turn out and vote. Before joining Trump\u2019s team as campaign co-chair, Susie Wiles spent years working to lock down Florida for Republicans (she\u2019s since been named Trump\u2019s incoming chief of staff). Her tactics make people feel like an essential part of a group with a clear goal. Wiles piloted the \u201c10 for Trump\u201d Iowa caucus program, which gave a subset of 2,000 volunteers the title of \u201ccaptain\u201d, a limited-edition gold-embroidered hat, and the goal of motivating 10 people in their precincts to turn out. In the general election, specially trained volunteers were dubbed \u201cTrump Force 47\u201d and tasked with developing longer term relationships with so-called low- or mid-propensity voters, going beyond the usual door-knocking to forge relationships aimed at converting these targets into Republican loyalists. The campaign also used Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud to recruit and train tens of thousands of hyper-vigilant poll workers and Maga acolytes. \u201cTrump or someone around him is quite bright about the definitional difference between mobilization and organization,\u201d Tory Gavito, founder of Way to Win, told me. Mobilizing people to turn out and cast a ballot is not nearly as powerful as organizing people to adopt an identity, commit to a cause, and join a collective effort to push for change. That\u2019s why Way to Win, a progressive donor network, directs funds to groups that do year-round organizing, rather than helicoptering in days or weeks before an election or relying on high-profile celebrity endorsements. In Gavito\u2019s estimation, Trump\u2019s GOTV effort probably mattered less in the end than what she calls the \u201corganizations and institutions that shape worldviews\u201d and engage large numbers of people in their daily lives. That\u2019s where the Democrats\u2019 super polished, pop-up ground game fell short. \u2018Knocked on too many doors\u2019 Ironically, the right not only has its own (often lavishly funded) political and cultural infrastructure; it also benefits from infrastructure\u2019s absence in a way the left does not. Widespread feelings of isolation, loneliness and alienation help their cause. The conservative culture warrior Christopher Rufo, for example, has boasted about how a lack of social trust works to his advantage. Distrust makes it easier to spread lies and misinformation and pit communities against each other \u2013 to divide and conquer in order to shrink government, raise corporate profits, and concentrate power. Firelands Workers United is an organization that brings together working families to rebuild this tattered social trust, working in rural Washington, including in counties where majorities voted for Trump. They do so by organizing for good jobs, housing, healthcare and fair taxes. The way they organized in 2024 offers a lesson in class-based solidarity that the national Democratic party should learn from. This electoral cycle, Firelands\u2019 base was focused on fighting several ballot measures. Washington might be a blue state, but it is one with a remarkably regressive tax system and perennial budget problems. This year the California hedge fund manager Brian Heywood spent $6m on four ballot measures that aimed to repeal popular policies, including a recently passed capital gains tax. The result would have reduced funding for affordable childcare and schools and killed rural jobs. If the capital gains ballot measure had passed, 4,000 wealthy Washingtonians would get richer while everyone else, non-immigrant and immigrant, would pay the price. Through 2024, Firelands trained dozens of members so they could educate their communities about this looming threat. They did so by emphasizing a shared class interest, not partisan loyalties, which allowed them to reach across cultural and political divides. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Republicans or Democrats. People out here are frustrated with any politician who sides with the rich over working people,\u201d said the group\u2019s co-founder Stina Janssen. Firelands members collaborate across very different backgrounds. A Washington-born retired corrections officer and a Latin American immigrant mill worker would canvas together and develop a real relationship. They, in turn, would connect with voters over anger at billionaires and inequality and invite them into a movement, opening space for people\u2019s assumptions and attitudes to change. \u201cThere would not have been a chance to build these friendships or for the people born here to learn and hear people\u2019s immigration stories with the same level of curiosity without this close work together,\u201d Janssen said. Now the group\u2019s non-immigrant members understand what it means for someone to be facing deportation. And immigrant members feel less alone as they understand they are not the only people struggling with healthcare or rent. \u201cOur organizing approach held and affirmed everyone\u2019s suffering and helped people see how their experiences were tied together,\u201d Janssen explained. This \u201cdignity-based solidarity\u201d, as Janssen calls it, isn\u2019t about asking people to check their privilege. It\u2019s rooted in the recognition that we all suffer and deserve better: making ends meet shouldn\u2019t be this hard for me or for you. This kind of deep organizing takes time because it aims at shifting political consciousness and fostering enduring commitment. It also requires resources. As Baena told me, groups like Turning Point and Libre Initiative \u201ccan hire so many people because they have endless money\u201d. It\u2019s easier to fund an organization that helps billionaires\u2019 bottom lines than one that threatens them. Yet Democrats had plenty of money this year, much of which was contributed by smaller donors. But they spent it on the standard playbook. The Harris campaign spent billions blanketing the airwaves with ads (outspending Republicans three to one on paid media), bombarding undecided voters with text messages, and bussing out-of-state volunteers to canvas neighborhoods. None of those tactics leave a trace after the campaign pulls up stakes. They might as well have set the cash on fire. Like many other organizers I spoke to, Billy Wimsatt, the executive director of Movement Voter Pac (MVP), believes those resources could have been deployed more wisely. \u201cWhat if, instead of spending millions to keep cable news on life support, you had split that money between strategically building up local organizing and online influencer organizing?\u201d he said. This year, MVP moved money to hundreds of organizations that do year-round issue-based organizing in key battleground states in addition to GOTV. That entailed everything from mutual aid to media to ballot measures and candidate recruitment. Wimsatt highlighted the work of Faith in Minnesota, a multi-faith, multi-racial, statewide organization. The group organizes diverse communities, including Muslims and manufactured home park residents, around high-impact issues like housing affordability. This season, Faith in Minnesota volunteers had thousands of conversations with voters and helped protect the state house from flipping to Republicans. \u201cReal organizing wins. Superficial mobilizing loses,\u201d Wimsatt said. Andrew Willis Garc\u00e9s, another Siembra NC co-founder, puts it bluntly: Democrats across the country actually \u201cknocked too many doors\u201d. The party\u2019s much ballyhooed ground game failed because it was engineered to facilitate one-off conversations that stick to a script instead of supporting local organizations and campaigns that engage ordinary people around issues they care about. For the people Siembra aims to reach, that means fights to recover stolen wages, stop local law enforcement from collaborating with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice), and win protections for mobile home tenants. Garc\u00e9s believes that these kinds of local issue campaigns can drive voter engagement by helping people connect their lived experience to candidates or campaigns that might otherwise seem distant, abstract or uninspiring. That can make a difference in an election like the recent one, which Baena describes as a three-way race between Trump, Harris and the couch. In terms of sheer numbers, the couch came out ahead. While much has been said about Latino men turning to Trump, Baena and Garc\u00e9s believe the real story is that lots of Latino voters, like other key voting groups, \u201csat this one out\u201d. All told, nearly 90 million eligible voters, 36% of the overall electorate, stayed home. As Baena sees it, the Democrats didn\u2019t have much to offer working people, whatever their race, gender or ethnicity, in terms of tangible improvement to their daily lives or a clear and compelling vision of why the future under Harris would have been better. At the door, there wasn\u2019t much to say besides \u201cthe other guy is bad\u201d. You can\u2019t win people over by telling them everything is fine when they can\u2019t afford groceries, rent, and gas, or when they are upset about the war on Gaza. This all goes back to the lack of trust. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust people outside their families and they don\u2019t trust politicians or the government,\u201d Baena said. Parachuting canvassers into a community to have one-time conversations will never truly move the needle; you need to listen and earn trust before you can change minds. \u201cThe work of base-building is getting people to befriend strangers and build community outside of their families, and that\u2019s a pathway to getting people to trust their neighbors and institutions,\u201d he added. \u201cIf liberals really care about winning elections,\u201d Baena continued, \u201cthey need to reach these people. We need year-round organizing to really bring people in and to show them that they and their families can benefit from public investment and services. And we have to organize in a way that allows the base to feel they\u2019ve helped win the election, not that the campaign won.\u201d That\u2019s the feeling Firelands managed to inspire in its members \u2013 a feeling of being agents of change, not passive consumers of politics. On election day, all the regressive ballot measures were voted down in the rural areas where Firelands and their partners organized, including Grays Harbor county, where Trump won 51.5% of the vote but nearly 60% of voters said \u201cno\u201d to repealing taxes on capital gains. Groups like Faith in Minnesota and Firelands show that by emphasizing shared class interests and focusing on clear progressive policies, it\u2019s possible to make inroads with voters who are skeptical of politicians and even sympathetic to aspects of the Maga movement. People-centered, issue-focused organizing Before the 2016 election, the New York senator Chuck Schumer made a now infamous pronouncement about the Democratic party\u2019s electoral strategy: \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d In 2021, on the other hand, the then US representative Jim Banks of Indiana (now senator-elect) shared a memo with the then House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, detailing how the Republican party could \u201cpermanently become the Party of the Working Class\u201d in part by appealing to \u201cminority voters\u201d. Three years later, Banks\u2019s proposal no longer reads as wishful thinking. Trump\u2019s campaign made inroads with low-income communities and voters of color in urban and rural areas nationwide, including peeling off an alarming number of unionized voters. Meanwhile, Schumer\u2019s plan of tacking to the center in order to target Republican voters at the expense of less affluent Democratic ones helped Harris get trounced. Instead of aspiring to razor-thin margins of victory, Democrats must become more populist and more ambitious. But better messaging must be coupled with a disciplined strategy to expand the voting base and win resounding majorities so politicians can actually deliver on a platform that makes this country more inclusive, sustainable, and fair. To accomplish this, Democrats need to find ways to win over some of the people who voted for Trump not because they are committed to Maga, but out of frustration with the status quo. And they also need to connect with many more of those millions of people who chose the couch. Instead of listening to the Liz Cheney-loving consulting class and the cable ad-buying gurus at Future Forward, Democrats need to muster the kind of political determination that drove Susie Wiles to swing Florida firmly to the right and enabled Republicans to paint Texas a deep red. You can bet that conservative strategists are thinking about how to eat away at Democratic strongholds, including California. Where\u2019s the 10-year plan to flip Texas and its 40 electoral votes back to blue? The problem isn\u2019t just a lack of vision or political will, but resources. The big money bundlers and special interests don\u2019t want to cede control. According to Way to Win\u2019s Gavito, the aftermath of Trump\u2019s first victory brought together an unlikely coalition of Democratic donors, many of whom were not particularly liberal, let alone progressive, but who were concerned about threats to democracy and craving a return to normalcy. After Joe Biden won, many ceased to collaborate or invest in base-building efforts, wary of strategies aimed at empowering diverse working-class voters or delivering the kind of progressive policy measures that might appeal to them. Perhaps, now, some of these donors will realize that their cautious, center-hewing strategy has failed and reassess their approach. But changes at the top won\u2019t be enough if they\u2019re not tethered to change on the ground. Voter outreach needs to be people- and place-centered, not data- and advertiser-driven. It needs to be issue-focused and year-round, not scaled in eight weeks and gone overnight. And it must offer more than an awkward conversation at the door and an alienating avalanche of texts treating recipients like little more than ATMs. People need a sense of belonging and a compelling and credible vision of a future worth fighting for. In the end, the fate of democracy is too precious to leave in the hands of the Democratic party. Across the country, ordinary people are building the relationships, organizations, and power required to move this country forward. They are the ground game we need.",

      "bodyText": "Going into the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump stood accused of 91 felony counts across criminal cases in New York, Florida, Washington DC and Georgia. In May, he became the first former president ever to be convicted of a crime. But now that he has won re-election to a second term, the president-elect is unlikely to be sent to prison or see other trials move forward. That likelihood has been slim since 1 July, when the US supreme court ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution. His sentencing in connection with his New York conviction was delayed, and the presiding judge in Florida dismissed the case alleging he illegally retained classified documents. Special counsel Jack Smith dropped the federal election interference case on 25 November. Prosecutors also abandoned the classified documents case in an appeals court filing. Trump had already been hit with more than a half-billion dollars in penalties from a pair of New York civil trials. Trump has twice been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming E Jean Carroll by juries, awarding her a combined $88m in damages. In his New York civil fraud trial, a judge decided that Trump and the Trump Organization had lied about the value of their assets to secure better loan terms and fined him more than $350m plus interest, which has accrued to an additional $100m and counting. Classified documents case in Florida Status: Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case on 15 July, siding with Trump and ruling that the special counsel who brought the prosecution had been improperly appointed. On 25 November, prosecutors abandoned the case in an appeal court filing. Key figures: Charges: 40 counts, including willful retention of national defense information under the Espionage Act and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Summary: In the weeks before he left the White House in January 2021, Trump and his aides allegedly packed up hundreds of classified documents with his personal belongings and transported those documents to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Federal officials repeatedly tried to recover the classified materials, but prosecutors say Trump intentionally withheld dozens of documents from investigators and misled them as they attempted to locate the missing files. Hush-money case in New York Status: Trump was convicted of 34 felonies on 30 May, but his sentencing has been delayed.. Key figures: Charges: 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. Summary: The case involves a hush-money scheme during the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to quash her story about having an extramarital affair with the former president. Trump has denied the affair took place. Prosecutors accused the former president of illegally reimbursing Cohen for the hush-money payment by falsely classifying the transaction, executed by the Trump Organization, as legal expenses. This was the first of Trump\u2019s criminal cases to go to trial. January 6 case in Washington Status: Special counsel Jack Smith dismissed the case against Trump on 25 November, citing longstanding rules that sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution. The withdrawal had been expected and shows how Trump used politics to beat the legal system. Trump had pleaded not guilty in the case. Key figures: Charges: Four counts: conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights in his relentless pursuit to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election and remain in office. Summary: On 6 January 2021, a group of Trump\u2019s supporters staged a violent attack on the US Capitol in an effort to disrupt the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election. A bipartisan Senate report later concluded that seven people died in connection to the insurrection. The House impeached Trump for inciting the insurrection, but the former president was acquitted by the Senate. He now faces criminal charges for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss \u2013 including his actions leading up to and during the attack. 2020 election meddling case in Georgia Status: Pending trial. Key figures: Charges: 13 counts against Trump including racketeering, forgery, perjury, filing false documents, false statements and others. Summary: As part of his frantic efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, Trump infamously instructed the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to rob Joe Biden of his win in the battleground state. The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, had been investigating Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia for more than two years before charging Trump and more than a dozen co-defendants with attempting to illegally overturn Georgia\u2019s 2020 election results. E Jean Carroll lawsuits in New York Status: Trump found liable for defamation in two separate civil lawsuits and ordered to pay more than $88m in combined penalties. Key figures: Charges: Defamation and sexual abuse. Summary: The case centered on Trump\u2019s response to allegations by writer E Jean Carroll that he sexually assaulted her at a department store in 1996. Trump denied the allegations while repeatedly attacking Carroll\u2019s character. He was ordered to pay $5m in fines after losing his first case, but continued to attack Carroll, which led to a second trial in which the judge ruled he\u2019d intentionally defamed her again and ordered him to pay an additional $83m. Trump Organization civil fraud case Status: Trump and co-defendants found liable and ordered to pay more than $450m including interest. Trump is appealing. Key figures: Charges: Financial fraud. Summary: In February 2019, Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that the then president had repeatedly lied on financial forms about the value of his assets to procure better tax and loan terms. \u201cIt was my experience that Mr Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes,\u201d Cohen told the House oversight committee. His testimony triggered a civil inquiry, led by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, into the Trump Organization\u2019s business practices. That led to a civil trial against Trump, his two eldest sons and the Trump Organization. They lost the case and were ordered in February 2024 to pay more than $350m in penalties plus interest, a combined sum that had grown to more than $450m by the time of the ruling.

He bats with such beauty and grace that it is far more pleasurable to watch a sumptuous highlights reel. But as Root racks up yet more records it\u2019s worthwhile to consider the mighty numbers for a while. Last month, while hitting a double century against Pakistan, Root became England\u2019s highest scorer when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/oct/09/like-a-cricketing-michelangelo-joe-root-has-chiselled-his-name-in-test-history\">sailed past Alastair Cook\u2019s previous record</a> of 12,472 runs. He and Harry Brook plundered 454 runs while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/12/root-and-brook-masterclass-was-a-beautiful-warning-of-test-crickets-end-days\">setting a record for England\u2019s highest Test partnership</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried not to get too obsessed with that stuff,\u201d Root says with a gentle shrug, \u201cbecause it goes against the way I look at the game. They are all niceties but, ultimately, the real enjoyment is when you\u2019re sat there after winning a Test over five days of hard graft, enjoying it with your mates. I know it\u2019s a cliche but that\u2019s what you want more than anything. The 2019 World Cup final was one of the worst games I\u2019ve had in an England shirt, but it\u2019s one of the best days I\u2019ve had on a cricket field. That\u2019s the beauty of cricket.\u201d</p> <p>Root warms to his selfless theme. \u201cCricket is a game of failure because the amount of times you walk off disappointed outweighs the times where you\u2019ve had a great day,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s always something else, and someone else, you can celebrate. That\u2019s what makes it so fun. It\u2019s not all about you, it\u2019s about collectively dragging each other over the line.\u201d</p> <p>Next month will mark the 12th anniversary of Root\u2019s Test debut. In Nagpur, he came out at No 6 and bumped gloves with Kevin Pietersen. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/13/kevin-pietersen-england-joe-root\">England were creaking at 119 for four but Root beamed</a>. He and Pietersen ended up joint-top scorers in the first innings with 73 each and he was unbeaten on 20 in the second innings. Root had arrived in style.</p>    <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like 12 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got pretty vivid memories of that experience \u2013 and all the nerves I\u2019d had waiting to bat just disappeared. I was so excited and couldn\u2019t stop smiling. I remember being thrilled to be out there and having the opportunity to play. I thought of how I would have felt when I was 12.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout my career I\u2019ve tried to carry that 12-year-old version of myself, that kid who dreamed and practised for hours and hours, wanting to play for England. When you\u2019ve done it quite a few times, it would be easy to forget what a great opportunity you have and what it was like being a kid just desperate to play. When I was 12, I would wake up in the morning and open the curtains and pray it wasn\u2019t raining so I could play.\u201d</p> <p>Root concedes that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/joe-root-resigns-as-england-test-cricket-captain-after-torrid-run\">especially during his difficult years as captain</a> and the grind of enduring a Covid bubble, \u201cyou obviously need little reminders here and there \u2026 but I can sit here now and say that, thankfully, I enjoy playing cricket as much as I did 12 years ago. It\u2019s important to have that because you need to turn up to training wanting to get better. That enthusiasm, that sheer enjoyment factor, has to be a really big part of who you are.\u201d</p> <p>His pleasure in cricket is obvious as he holds one of the New Balance bats which has allowed him to score so many runs in Test cricket. Root is an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/root66/p/C5XwXvXNL1P/\">ambassador for the company</a> and, even on a day off, he looks serene with a bat in his hands. But what have been the greatest challenges of his career? \u201cThe same as any player \u2013 dips in form,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much information and technology now that the opposition can work you out, pick up trends and modes of dismissals and target certain areas. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to constantly evolve. There have probably been times where I\u2019ve overtinkered but it\u2019s all come from trying to stay one step ahead of the opposition. That attitude has brought me a lot of success but sometimes you have to take a few hits before moving another big step forward.\u201d</p> <p>Root\u2019s balanced perspective has been sharpened by the loss he felt when Graham Thorpe, his batting mentor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/12/graham-thorpes-wife-reveals-former-england-cricketer-killed-himself\">took his own life</a> in August. He was a pallbearer at Thorpe\u2019s funeral and Root talks quietly about how much he learned from his great friend. They forged a bond on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/06/joe-root-england-lions-sri-lanka\">England Lions tour of Sri Lanka</a> when, Root says: \u201cI\u2019d have been 21. Throughout that whole trip I learned so much from him, how I wanted to create different angles, use my sweeps and manipulate the ball into gaps. There\u2019ve been so many other lessons over a 10\u2011year period. A lot of my success has been down to Graham and I will be eternally grateful for all that he did for me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got so many good memories because he was such a great man with such a great sense of humour and good nature. He taught me so much on and off the field \u2013 in that old Guns N\u2019 Roses T-shirt that he wore at some point on every tour throughout that 10-year period.\u201d</p>    <p>Thorpe experienced depression <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/13/cricket.comment\">most of his cricketing life</a> and Root stresses: \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to keep having those conversations, checking in, making sure people are doing OK. You spend so much time together, going through all the highs and lows and being away from your family for so long. Whether they\u2019re in and around the team, or away from you, the hope is that people know they can talk to you about things. You want people to feel like they don\u2019t need to deal with things all on their own.\u201d</p> <p>When Root broke Cook\u2019s record, his captain Ben Stokes highlighted his \u201cselflessness\u201d. Stokes concentrated on the fact that Root is \u201ca great bloke\u201d rather than simply \u201can incredible player\u201d. It might sound too touchy-feely for the hard-bitten cynic but an hour in Root\u2019s company suggests that Stokes found the right tone when he concluded: \u201cThe non\u2011selfishness that Joe possesses is the one thing that sets him apart.\u201d</p> <p>Root, naturally, deflects the praise. \u201cThey\u2019re nice things to hear but ultimately that\u2019s what it should be because no one\u2019s bigger than the team.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m full of cliches today but it\u2019s the truth. You\u2019re going to have bad days but you have to try to be consistent and keep driving things in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the personal plaudits, Root is part of a squad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/23/stokes-and-mccullum-need-strong-start-to-year-that-could-define-bazball\">entering a defining period</a>. New Zealand are on a high after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/03/cricket-new-zealand-beat-india-again-historic-test-series-win\">3-0 series win in India</a> this month. They will provide extremely difficult opposition and then, next year, England face five Tests at home against India before travelling to the Ashes in Australia. These next 13 Tests could make or break an often thrilling but still somewhat tenuous era for a team led by Stokes and coached by Brendon McCullum.</p> <p>England won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/11/cricket-pakistan-england-win-first-test-day-five-jack-leach\">first Test in Pakistan by an innings</a>. It was a remarkable victory as Root and Brook chased down Pakistan\u2019s first\u2011innings score of 556. Yet England collapsed in the next two Tests and lost the series against a previously struggling Pakistan. \u201cThey outplayed us in key moments,\u201d Root admits, while pointing out that the second Test in Multan was played on the same wicket used for the opening match. The third Test in Rawalpindi featured a pitch that had been blasted with heaters, and raked heavily.</p> <p>\u201cThey were fast-forward wickets, a day-six pitch on day one for the second Test and then they\u2019d raked it and used their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/26/england-pakistan-third-test-cricket-day-three-report\">home advantage for the third Test</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYou can understand it as they had not won a Test at home for a long time and they exploited it better than we did. But in those big moments we missed a couple of chances in the field. In those low-scoring games, that can really cost you. But credit to them as their spinners performed exceptionally.\u201d</p> <p>Considering New Zealand\u2019s achievements in India, Root says: \u201cThey played some really good cricket against a very experienced and successful team. I think we were the last team to win in India, in 2012, so New Zealand were incredible. It\u2019s going to be a tough tour and then we play India followed by the Ashes. It will give a really good barometer of where we are and so it\u2019s a mouth-watering 12 months ahead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love us to win the Ashes over there. That would mean more to me than anything. The last time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/03/england-last-ashes-win-in-australia-still-feels-like-dream-2010-11-cricket\">England won in Australia was 2010-11</a> and I was there at the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide. During that Test I was net-bowling against the guys that weren\u2019t playing. I then went to Melbourne to watch the Boxing Day Test match. It was great to watch it unfold and to do something similar would be the ultimate.\u201d</p>    <p>Root has yet to score a Test hundred in Australia and, in 14 Ashes Tests away from home, he has lost 12 and drawn two. He says: \u201cThe last couple of times I\u2019ve been out there, particularly when I was captain, I probably wanted it a bit too much. Ben feels the same. We\u2019ve played a lot out there and not had a lot to show for it. But the prospect of doing so much better this time is exciting.\u201d</p> <p>At 33 he remains fresh-faced but it is striking that Root is now the same age as Cook when the former England record-holder retired. Cook was worn out while Root\u2019s enthusiasm seems undimmed. \u201cWe\u2019re very different players,\u201d Root says. \u201cCookie\u2019s mental fortitude and resilience was his greatest strength but opening the batting takes its toll. Sometimes, you\u2019ve fielded all day and you have to face five overs in rubbish light against fresh bowlers. That can weigh you down more than the role I\u2019ve played.\u201d</p> <p>Root has such talent, the game comes so easily to him, and those gifts help explain his longevity. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different and on a different journey,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might still be that my career finishes quite abruptly if I change my mind. But it doesn\u2019t feel that way at the minute and I\u2019m not going to put any timeline on how long I play for. As long as I\u2019m fit, healthy and I\u2019ve still got that drive and enjoyment I\u2019ll continue to keep playing and loving it.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, </em><em><a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a></em><em>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI know this one,\u201d Joe Root says with a little grin as he confirms the latest milestone he will reach in Test cricket on Wednesday when England play New Zealand in Christchurch. \u201cIt will be my 150th Test. We\u2019re fortunate to play so much Test cricket compared to other nations, so you can rattle them up rather quickly. But I\u2019ve had to work hard and overcome different challenges along the way, so I\u2019m very grateful to have had so many chances.\u201d A minute earlier Root had been uncertain when I asked him if he knew what it would mean were he to score another 625 Test runs. A modest and generous man, Root thought hard and then admitted he had no clue. The answer is that, once those runs have been accumulated, he will become the second highest scorer in Test cricket. He will overtake Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis and Ricky Ponting and trail only Sachin Tendulkar. It might seem a small sacrilege to consider the weight of Root\u2019s monumental achievements in purely statistical terms. He bats with such beauty and grace that it is far more pleasurable to watch a sumptuous highlights reel. But as Root racks up yet more records it\u2019s worthwhile to consider the mighty numbers for a while. Last month, while hitting a double century against Pakistan, Root became England\u2019s highest scorer when he sailed past Alastair Cook\u2019s previous record of 12,472 runs. He and Harry Brook plundered 454 runs while setting a record for England\u2019s highest Test partnership. \u201cI\u2019ve tried not to get too obsessed with that stuff,\u201d Root says with a gentle shrug, \u201cbecause it goes against the way I look at the game.

In the budget, business has been the cash cow and it\u2019s been milked. Don\u2019t go and whack it,\u201d Soames warned at the CBI\u2019s annual conference in Westminster.</p> <p>He was speaking shortly before Rachel Reeves took to the stage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/25/rachel-reeves-rebuke-budget-critics-cbi\">face down the backlash</a> against her budget. The chancellor told business leaders she had taken the decision to \u201cdraw the line\u201d, once and for all, under what she called the \u201cfiction\u201d of the public finance projections left by the Conservatives.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done that now, and businesses can now be certain that we\u2019re never going to do a budget like that again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.\u201d</p> <p>The budget on 30 October included \u00a340bn of tax rises to fund public services, with the biggest revenue-raiser a \u00a325bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs). Business groups have blamed the move for hitting confidence, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/retailers-are-right-to-warn-of-job-cuts-after-reeves-budget-says-andrew-bailey\">big retailers writing to Reeves</a> last week to warn of potential job losses.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, the CBI\u2019s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, highlighted a recent survey of 266 firms that suggested half were considering cutting jobs and almost two-thirds were rethinking plans to hire new staff, as a result of the extra costs.</p> <p>The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, also addressed the CBI conference on Monday.

      "bodyText": "The chair of the Confederation of British Industry, Rupert Soames, accused the government of treating employers as a \u201ccash cow\u201d on Monday as he urged ministers to water down plans for workers\u2019 rights. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough on business. In the budget, business has been the cash cow and it\u2019s been milked. Don\u2019t go and whack it,\u201d Soames warned at the CBI\u2019s annual conference in Westminster. He was speaking shortly before Rachel Reeves took to the stage to face down the backlash against her budget. The chancellor told business leaders she had taken the decision to \u201cdraw the line\u201d, once and for all, under what she called the \u201cfiction\u201d of the public finance projections left by the Conservatives. \u201cWe\u2019ve done that now, and businesses can now be certain that we\u2019re never going to do a budget like that again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.\u201d The budget on 30 October included \u00a340bn of tax rises to fund public services, with the biggest revenue-raiser a \u00a325bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs). Business groups have blamed the move for hitting confidence, with big retailers writing to Reeves last week to warn of potential job losses. Earlier on Monday, the CBI\u2019s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, highlighted a recent survey of 266 firms that suggested half were considering cutting jobs and almost two-thirds were rethinking plans to hire new staff, as a result of the extra costs. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, also addressed the CBI conference on Monday. She attacked what she called Labour\u2019s \u201cunprecedented raid on business\u201d, but refused to commit to reversing the employer NICs rise. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to do is comment on every bit of micro-policy,\u201d she said. Pressed on whether she could suggest an alternative way of raising the revenue \u2013 or public services cuts to make up the shortfall \u2013 she insisted: \u201cI disagree with the premise of the question.

Soames suggested businesses might be prepared to forgive the NICs increase if other policies were tweaked. \u201cI think they need to see this in the round,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can come to a position where business can say: \u2018Well OK, the budget was a bit shit but we can live with the rest,\u2019 then there\u2019s probably a landing ground we can get to, where the government can retain the confidence of business.\u201d Labour published its employment bill last month, with scores of policies aimed at boosting workers\u2019 rights.

      "body": "<p>That one in eight young people in the UK are not in education, employment or training is a dismal statistic. Nearly a decade after the school-leaving age was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school\">raised to 18</a> in England (in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland it remains 16), and 25 years after Tony&nbsp;Blair aimed to have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49841620\">50% of young people</a> in higher education, Britain under the Tories went backwards.</p> <p>The problem of a shrinking workforce, and the rising benefits bill it entails, is not limited to young adults. The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/03/number-of-people-in-uk-out-of-work-due-to-ill-health-growing-by-300000-a-year\">lack of a post-pandemic bounceback</a> in employment is a concern in other age groups, particularly the over-50s. But the government is right to be alarmed by the phenomenon of young people emerging from 14 years of schooling unable to work or undertake training. Unemployment and long-term illness are not a great start to anyone\u2019s adult life.</p> <p>So it makes sense that this week\u2019s announcements about benefits will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/24/liz-kendall-says-young-people-who-wont-take-up-work-will-lose-benefits\">directed at young claimants</a>. The challenge for Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is to convince them that finding work \u2013 or signing up for a course \u2013 serves their interests as well as the government\u2019s. Years of harsh rhetoric around the benefits system and its working-age recipients have made this task far harder. Rather than a basic entitlement and a necessity \u2013 particularly for families with children, disabled people and those living in unaffordable housing \u2013 social security has been wrongly depicted, by politicians and others opposed to the welfare state, as a reward for doing nothing. If the new government intends to reduce the number of&nbsp;people on sickness or disability benefits from 2.8&nbsp;million back to closer to the 2 million figure of five years ago, it needs to do this without coercion. As this column has argued often, one of the lessons of the past 14 years is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/06/the-guardian-view-on-disability-benefit-reform-the-latest-proposals-are-dangerously-out-of-touch\">demoralising people</a> is more likely to make them ill than productive.</p> <p>The lifting of the minimum wage announced in last month\u2019s budget was a positive move. So was the pledge that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/29/national-minimum-wage-to-rise-by-67-from-april-reeves-confirms\">16% increase</a> in the lower hourly rate for workers aged 18-20 (from \u00a38.60 to \u00a310) will eventually lead to equalisation with older workers\u2019 pay. Problems around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/22/britain-working-class-pain-mental-health\">working conditions</a>, job insecurity and the lack of progression opportunities remain. But at least ministers recognise that if people are to be encouraged to work, then work must pay them enough to live on.</p> <p>The transformation of jobcentres into what Ms&nbsp;Kendall calls a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/uk-jobcentres-not-fit-for-purpose-says-liz-kendall-ahead-of-major-reforms\">\u201ca genuine public employment service\u201d</a> is also welcome. A stronger emphasis on proactive advice should help more people find suitable roles. Linking jobcentres with other services is also constructive and in line with a health&nbsp;reform agenda that emphasises prevention, early intervention and co-working with councils and the voluntary sector.</p> <p>The limited nature of many of the jobs on offer is one problem Ms Kendall can\u2019t solve. The government\u2019s argument is that by investing in the health service, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/25/liverpool-shows-labour-how-long-term-sickness-blights-lives-and-the-economy\">areas with the longest&nbsp;waiting lists</a>, while also boosting the labour market, they can nudge the nation back towards a better overall state of health. The hope is that this, in turn, will foster the kind of economic development that creates more fulfilling opportunities and, eventually, lives.</p> <p>The proof, as always, will be in the pudding. But policies to incentivise employment were inevitable given the shifts of the past few years. As long as social and health support systems are in place, this&nbsp;approach is a reasonable one.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "That one in eight young people in the UK are not in education, employment or training is a dismal statistic. Nearly a decade after the school-leaving age was raised to 18 in England (in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland it remains 16), and 25 years after Tony Blair aimed to have 50% of young people in higher education, Britain under the Tories went backwards. The problem of a shrinking workforce, and the rising benefits bill it entails, is not limited to young adults. The UK\u2019s lack of a post-pandemic bounceback in employment is a concern in other age groups, particularly the over-50s. But the government is right to be alarmed by the phenomenon of young people emerging from 14 years of schooling unable to work or undertake training. Unemployment and long-term illness are not a great start to anyone\u2019s adult life. So it makes sense that this week\u2019s announcements about benefits will be directed at young claimants. The challenge for Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is to convince them that finding work \u2013 or signing up for a course \u2013 serves their interests as well as the government\u2019s. Years of harsh rhetoric around the benefits system and its working-age recipients have made this task far harder. Rather than a basic entitlement and a necessity \u2013 particularly for families with children, disabled people and those living in unaffordable housing \u2013 social security has been wrongly depicted, by politicians and others opposed to the welfare state, as a reward for doing nothing. If the new government intends to reduce the number of people on sickness or disability benefits from 2.8 million back to closer to the 2 million figure of five years ago, it needs to do this without coercion. As this column has argued often, one of the lessons of the past 14 years is that demoralising people is more likely to make them ill than productive. The lifting of the minimum wage announced in last month\u2019s budget was a positive move. So was the pledge that the 16% increase in the lower hourly rate for workers aged 18-20 (from \u00a38.60 to \u00a310) will eventually lead to equalisation with older workers\u2019 pay. Problems around working conditions, job insecurity and the lack of progression opportunities remain. But at least ministers recognise that if people are to be encouraged to work, then work must pay them enough to live on. The transformation of jobcentres into what Ms Kendall calls a \u201ca genuine public employment service\u201d is also welcome. A stronger emphasis on proactive advice should help more people find suitable roles. Linking jobcentres with other services is also constructive and in line with a health reform agenda that emphasises prevention, early intervention and co-working with councils and the voluntary sector. The limited nature of many of the jobs on offer is one problem Ms Kendall can\u2019t solve. The government\u2019s argument is that by investing in the health service, particularly in areas with the longest waiting lists, while also boosting the labour market, they can nudge the nation back towards a better overall state of health. The hope is that this, in turn, will foster the kind of economic development that creates more fulfilling opportunities and, eventually, lives. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding. But policies to incentivise employment were inevitable given the shifts of the past few years. As long as social and health support systems are in place, this approach is a reasonable one.

Instead Centrelink made that lump sum payment into the old account she shared with her partner. \u201cI knew he had access to my Centrelink stuff; I knew he was an excessive checker of the bank account. When he came home, he was like \u2018what\u2019s this about?\u2019\u201d Alannah said she called Centrelink to report the error. \u201cI said \u2018you don\u2019t understand the danger you\u2019ve put me in\u2019. And then there was this rigmarole, they couldn\u2019t just take the money back.\u201d In the meantime, her ex moved the money into his own personal account that Alannah had no access to. Centrelink never explained how or why the payment got messed up, she said. Alannah\u2019s case is one of many that highlights the way that government platforms like MyGov, Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office are being used to facilitate financial abuse, as the Centre for Women\u2019s Economic Safety (CWES) launches a campaign calling on the government to reform its systems to better protect women. Rebecca Glenn, the CWES founder and chief executive, said the way these systems were set up made it easy for perpetrators to inflict ongoing financial abuse on a victim-survivor for many years after they left a violent relationship. Financial abuse occurs in 79-99% of cases of domestic and family violence, according to estimates, with 16% of women and 7.8% of men in Australia experiencing partner economic abuse in their lifetime. \u201cA lot of these systems are designed to protect people from strangers but not from people they know,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cWe know that people have a fair bit of information about their partners: email addresses, security questions, dates of birth, passwords, tax file numbers. \u201cThe MyGov platform is often misused in many different ways by perpetrators of domestic violence and economic abuse. It can be used to learn about a new address, [and] during Covid we saw it misused to access super. Post-separation, it can be used to see health records and weaponise those in family court proceedings.\u201d Glenn said simply telling people not to share their password with a partner \u2013 particularly a controlling one \u2013 was not only unreasonable, it could be highly dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important platform in people\u2019s lives, we are urging the government to consider safety by design in consultation with victim-survivors, to see how we can prevent the misuse of that system or mitigate harm.\u201d Among the other systems commonly used by perpetrators are the tax system and child support system. \u201cWe see perpetrators misusing business structures and creating tax debt in the name of their partner and ex-partner,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cAccording to the way the law is written, the tax office can\u2019t exercise discretion and has to chase the person in whose name the debt is.\u201d In May, Guardian Australia reported the case of Penelope*, who alleges her then-husband forced her to sign documents making her the director of his business. She alleges he then did not file tax returns for his business for several years and took out company loans that he did not repay and that she had spent years being chased by both the lenders and the tax office for these debts. Penelope faced the prospect of bankruptcy and losing her home as a result and it has taken a professional financial counsellor over a year of work to try to extricate her from the situation. Glenn said Penelope\u2019s situation could have been avoided if Australia adopted a provision in its taxation legislation \u2013 as there was in the US \u2013 called \u201cinnocent spouse relief\u201d, which gave the ATO discretion in cases of tax and debt relief when financial abuse had played a role. The CWES is also calling for an overhaul of the child support system, which she said routinely failed women and children. According to data provided to a recent parliamentary inquiry into the child support system, there is currently $1.7bn in unpaid child support owed in Australia. Advocates say this estimate is on the low side. \u201cOne hundred per cent of the women we support in our money clinics [financial counsellor sessions provided by the CWES for financial abuse victims] have not been paid child support, or have had it drastically minimised and it\u2019s insufficient,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cNo one gets the full amount.\u201d The CWES argues that child support payments should be guaranteed by the government \u2013 with the parent paying the child support paying it to the government, and if they fail to pay, the burden falls on the tax office to chase the funds. \u201cEffectively it becomes a debt owed to the government rather than a debt owed to the women and children,\u201d Glenn said. The minister for women, Katy Gallagher, said that after a meeting of national cabinet in September, the federal government announced it would undertake an audit of key government systems as part of its commitment to end violence against women. \u201cWe know that too often perpetrators of family and domestic violence exploit and manipulate government systems to control, threaten or harass a current or former partner,\u201d she said. \u201cThe audit will initially focus on the child support, social security and tax systems and will be informed by people with lived experience.\u201d For Alannah, if she did not have to chase her ex-partner for child support it would give him one less tool with which to perpetrate post-separation abuse. Alannah said that even though her ex was required to pay only about $40 per child per week in child support, he regularly made these payments late and required her to chase him for them. \u201cIt forces me, even though I\u2019m meant to have escaped him and shouldn\u2019t have to even think about him \u2026 to focus on him and navigate him,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even get on with my life.\u201d * For privacy, Alannah is a pseudonym. \u2022 In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

      "bodyText": "Sitting in a makeshift press conference room on the dancefloor of Camden\u2019s Underworld music venue, beneath the World\u2019s End pub, Emma Hayes breaks into a big grin. \u201cThankfully it still smells of fart and feet,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a big indie place for me back in the day. I\u2019ve definitely not seen this place in the daylight, so that\u2019s refreshing.\u201d Hayes is home in London and with another grin declares: \u201cI\u2019ve got my mojo back.\u201d The head coach of the USA women\u2019s national team is back where it all began for her in preparation for the showpiece friendly on Saturday between her Olympic champions and the European champions, England, at Wembley. This week her cultures are colliding, as she brings her team from the US, where she spent a number of formative years coaching, to London, where she grew up, played, then became one of the world\u2019s best. Thanksgiving will be celebrated at the training ground of the team she supported as a child, Tottenham. This will be a special week. It is a year since Hayes announced she would be leaving Chelsea after 12 years to take the USA job and six months since she left Cobham for the last time. Since then, she has lifted the USA side back to the top, winning the Olympic final 72 days after her first training session. She needed a change, making no secret of the toll club management was taking on her by the end of her tenure, but didn\u2019t know what to expect from international coaching. \u201cI was a little bit afraid of how this new rhythm was going to affect me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so used to getting in the car and driving to the training ground six or seven days a week. I worried about that for about four seconds. And then I said: \u2018OK, what\u2019s the benefits?\u2019 I get to get up and breathe, not rush. I get to take Harry [her son] to school. I get to go to the gym. I get to create my schedule in and around those things. I don\u2019t sacrifice the things that make me feel healthy. I definitely didn\u2019t feel healthy at the end. I actually felt quite unwell at the end of my time at Chelsea. \u201cDoing all those things during menopause was even harder. So, to get on top of them all, I feel like I\u2019ve got my mojo, my smile and joy back, I didn\u2019t realise how much I\u2019d lost all that. To do that means that I\u2019m loving football more than ever and I\u2019m clear about all the things that I want to do.\u201d There is a lot on Hayes\u2019s to-do list. \u201cI\u2019m fresh out of a packet.

Alison Kelly, the executive lead for safeguarding children at the Countess of Chester hospital, was told by senior doctors in May 2016 that Letby was linked to an increase in baby deaths on the neonatal unit. Kelly told the Thirlwall inquiry on Monday that \u201cat that time it wasn\u2019t clear to me that this was a safeguarding issue\u201d but that in hindsight it was. The former director of nursing began her evidence by issuing an apology to the families of Letby\u2019s victims, saying she \u201cdidn\u2019t get everything right\u201d. She said: \u201cI would like to express my condolences to all the families.

I do really appreciate having the opportunity to being part of this inquiry and to share my reflections and recommendations going forward.\u201d Kelly is the first Countess of Chester hospital executive to give evidence to the inquiry about the events surrounding the murder of seven babies and attempted murder of seven others by Letby in the year to June 2016. The inquiry heard that a senior doctor, Dr Stephen Brearey, told Kelly on 11 May 2016 that there had been a sudden spike in deaths on the neonatal unit and that consultant paediatricians were concerned that Letby could be responsible, either through deliberate harm or incompetence. Kelly accepted that Brearey was raising the possibility that the nurse \u201cmay\u201d be harming babies but claimed \u201cthere was never any clarity in him articulating his true concerns\u201d. Brearey told the inquiry last week that he gave Kelly details about Letby\u2019s connection to the unexpected and unexplained deaths during this meeting, and about how these incidents had stopped when the nurse was taken off night shifts. Asked by counsel to the inquiry, Nicholas de la Poer KC, whether she should have viewed the concerns as a safeguarding issue, Kelly said: \u201cI have reflected a lot on my safeguarding role in all of this case and, reflecting back, maybe I should have done, yes.\u201d The inquiry was told that Cheshire police would have been alerted if the hospital had triggered safeguarding processes at this time. They were not informed until nearly a year later, in late April 2017. Kelly told the inquiry she did not make a formal safeguarding referral until early 2018 \u2013 nine months after the police had launched an investigation \u2013 after a senior local official telephoned to ask why they had not been alerted. \u201cI do accept \u2013 and there is an email to evidence that \u2013 it was much, much later than it should have been,\u201d she said, and denied that her safeguarding report was \u201cmisleading and highly defensive\u201d. Giving evidence at Liverpool town hall, Kelly admitted she failed to read a crucial document linking Letby to the spike in baby deaths on 21 March 2016 and then failed to act on it for several weeks. She denied she was \u201ctoo slow\u201d to act, but said: \u201cI\u2019ve reflected on this because it does feel as there\u2019s a big delay.

Kelly told the grievance process that \u201cno themes or trends\u201d had been identified by external reviews into the deaths \u2013 a claim she admitted to the inquiry was \u201cpotentially false\u201d \u2013 and that they had found \u201cnothing significant\u201d about the nurse.

His remarks come just days after Trump nominated the Wall Street investor Howard Lutnick to lead the Department of Commerce with direct responsibility for trade. While Trump has already warned he would impose tariffs on EU imports, Lutnick has singled out Ireland for criticism saying \u201cit is nonsense that Ireland of all places runs a trade surplus at our expense\u201d. Simon Harris said if he was returned as taoiseach in Friday\u2019s general election, he would immediately seek engagement with Trump. He has also proposed an early EU-US trade summit to avert damage in trade ties with the overall European trade bloc. \u201cIf three US companies left Ireland it could cost us \u20ac10bn [\u00a38.5bn] in corporation tax,\u201d Harris said on Monday while canvassing in Dundrum, Dublin. \u201cI\u2019m not pre-empting it, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m not predicting it, but that is the level of risk that our economy is exposed to,\u201d he said. Ten multinationals account for 60% of Ireland\u2019s corporate tax receipts, with Microsoft, which books some global as well as EU revenues through Ireland, thought to be the single biggest contributor. Ireland\u2019s goods trade surplus with the US is now a record \u20ac35bn with Irish goods exports up by 8% in the first eight months of 2024, boosted by the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors. Goods exported to the US totalled \u20ac45.5bn between January and August, according to the government\u2019s Central Statistics Office, compared with imports of \u20ac11bn for the same period. Harris said he had no reason to believe that Trump was not \u201cserious about pursuing the policies that he has campaigned on\u201d, which includes repatriating jobs and profits that he believes should be homegrown. He also referenced the Wall Street Journal article on what it said was the \u201cUS tax system blows a windfall into Ireland\u201d fuelling savings into not just one but two sovereign wealth funds, including a \u20ac14bn windfall in back tax from Apple on the foot of a European court of justice ruling. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal front page gives an indication here\u201d that Trump is intent on action, said Harris.

      "body": "<p>A defiant Rachel Reeves has rebuked critics of her tax-raising budget on Monday, telling disgruntled business leaders that they have offered \u201cno alternatives\u201d to her plans.</p> \n<p>Since Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years last month, business groups have warned that the chancellor\u2019s \u00a325bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) will force them to cut jobs and raise prices. Thousands of farmers have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/a-way-of-life-farmers-in-westminster-express-fears-for-their-futures\">protested</a> against changes to inheritance tax.</p> \n<p>But Reeves told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference in Westminster that no one has offered a better solution to the challenging situation left behind by the previous, Conservative government.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have heard lots of responses to the government\u2019s first budget but I have heard no alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have asked businesses and the wealthiest to contribute more. I know those choices will have an impact. But I stand by those choices as the right choices for our country: investment to fix the NHS and rebuild Britain, while ensuring working people don\u2019t face higher taxes in their payslips.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chancellor\u2019s budget on 30 October <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/31/reeves-tax-rises-will-boost-growth-sustainably-says-imf\">included \u00a340bn of tax rises</a> to boost public spending. Increases to employer NICs were the biggest revenue-raiser for the Treasury.</p> \n<p>Coming alongside a significant uplift in the minimum wage in April, businesses in some industries, including hospitality and retail, have said they will struggle to absorb the extra NIC costs.</p> \n<p>The CBI\u2019s director-general, Rain Newton-Smith, will use her speech at the gathering to welcome Reeves\u2019s moves to stabilise the public finances, but also accuse her of jeopardising economic growth by taxing firms more heavily.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you hit profits, you hit competitiveness, you hit investment, you hit growth,\u201d Newton-Smith is expected to say. \u201cAlmost two-thirds of firms told us this budget will damage UK investment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Underlining corporate frustration at the unexpected tax raid, she will say: \u201cTax rises like this must never again be simply done to business. That\u2019s the road to unintended consequences.\u201d</p> \n<p>A survey of 266 businesses carried out by the CBI to assess the impact of the budget found that half are considering cutting jobs and almost two-thirds are rethinking plans to hire new staff.</p> \n<p>Nearly half of the firms surveyed said they were likely to delay, or reduce, pay increases in the coming months. </p> \n<p>Newton-Smith will urge the government to press ahead with business rates reform, to ease the pressure on struggling firms, and call for tax breaks for occupational health to help support workers with health conditions to stay in a job.</p> \n<p>Reeves\u2019s insistence that naysayers have offered \u201cno alternative\u201d to her plans will inevitably spark comparisons with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s defence of her tough economic policies. The prime minister told the Conservative women\u2019s conference in 1980: \u201cI believe people accept there\u2019s no real alternative.\u201d</p> \n<p>As a result of her fondness for the phrase, Thatcher\u2019s cabinet critics nicknamed her Tina, an acronym of \u201cThere is no alternative.\u201d </p> \n<p>Labour promised during this year\u2019s general election campaign not to increase the major personal taxes, which are national insurance, income tax and VAT.</p> \n<p>After the party\u2019s landslide victory, Reeves claimed that she had been left with a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances, and would need to take action to prevent borrowing running out of control.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had to clear up the mess of what we had been left,\u201d Reeves will tell the CBI. \u201cThe easiest thing I could have done is to have dodged the difficult choices. Put short-term interests before the national interest. I was not willing to do that.\u201d</p> \n<p>She will insist that Labour has no intention of making tax increases on the same scale in future years, however, saying: \u201cI do not plan to have another budget like this. I have wiped the slate clean.\u201d</p> \n<p>Reeves will also point to some of Labour\u2019s plans for pro-growth policies, which she says she wants to work alongside business to deliver, including the Back to Work white paper, due later this week.</p> \n<p>Last week\u2019s official growth figures showed the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/15/uk-economy-third-quarter-2024-ons-labour\">expanded by just 0.1%</a> in the third quarter, with some business groups, including the CBI, blaming pre-budget uncertainty for the marked slowdown.</p> \n<p>Reeves will repeat that she was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with those growth figures, the same line used by Keir Starmer when he responded to the data last week at the G20 summit in Rio.</p> \n<p>Financial markets have also downgraded their expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England since the budget, putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/18/uk-mortgage-rates-creep-up-as-brokers-warn-of-possible-further-pain-interest-rates-inflation-figures\">upward pressure on mortgage rates</a>, though on a much smaller scale than the dramatic jump after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget.</p> \n<p>The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, has blamed Reeves\u2019s budget for endangering the outlook for the economy, claiming: \u201cLabour\u2019s national insurance jobs tax will make it more expensive for businesses, which will then fuel higher prices, higher inflation, higher mortgage costs and slower growth.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chancellor\u2019s serious tone on Monday will be in contrast to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/22/boris-johnson-praises-peppa-pig-and-loses-place-in-rambling-speech\">Boris Johnson\u2019s speech</a> at the same conference three years ago, when he delivered a rambling address on the merits of children\u2019s theme park Peppa Pig World.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeppa Pig World is very much my kind of place.

      "bodyText": "A defiant Rachel Reeves has rebuked critics of her tax-raising budget on Monday, telling disgruntled business leaders that they have offered \u201cno alternatives\u201d to her plans. Since Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years last month, business groups have warned that the chancellor\u2019s \u00a325bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) will force them to cut jobs and raise prices. Thousands of farmers have also protested against changes to inheritance tax. But Reeves told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) annual conference in Westminster that no one has offered a better solution to the challenging situation left behind by the previous, Conservative government. \u201cI have heard lots of responses to the government\u2019s first budget but I have heard no alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have asked businesses and the wealthiest to contribute more. I know those choices will have an impact. But I stand by those choices as the right choices for our country: investment to fix the NHS and rebuild Britain, while ensuring working people don\u2019t face higher taxes in their payslips.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s budget on 30 October included \u00a340bn of tax rises to boost public spending. Increases to employer NICs were the biggest revenue-raiser for the Treasury. Coming alongside a significant uplift in the minimum wage in April, businesses in some industries, including hospitality and retail, have said they will struggle to absorb the extra NIC costs. The CBI\u2019s director-general, Rain Newton-Smith, will use her speech at the gathering to welcome Reeves\u2019s moves to stabilise the public finances, but also accuse her of jeopardising economic growth by taxing firms more heavily. \u201cWhen you hit profits, you hit competitiveness, you hit investment, you hit growth,\u201d Newton-Smith is expected to say. \u201cAlmost two-thirds of firms told us this budget will damage UK investment.\u201d Underlining corporate frustration at the unexpected tax raid, she will say: \u201cTax rises like this must never again be simply done to business. That\u2019s the road to unintended consequences.\u201d A survey of 266 businesses carried out by the CBI to assess the impact of the budget found that half are considering cutting jobs and almost two-thirds are rethinking plans to hire new staff. Nearly half of the firms surveyed said they were likely to delay, or reduce, pay increases in the coming months. Newton-Smith will urge the government to press ahead with business rates reform, to ease the pressure on struggling firms, and call for tax breaks for occupational health to help support workers with health conditions to stay in a job. Reeves\u2019s insistence that naysayers have offered \u201cno alternative\u201d to her plans will inevitably spark comparisons with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s defence of her tough economic policies. The prime minister told the Conservative women\u2019s conference in 1980: \u201cI believe people accept there\u2019s no real alternative.\u201d As a result of her fondness for the phrase, Thatcher\u2019s cabinet critics nicknamed her Tina, an acronym of \u201cThere is no alternative.\u201d Labour promised during this year\u2019s general election campaign not to increase the major personal taxes, which are national insurance, income tax and VAT. After the party\u2019s landslide victory, Reeves claimed that she had been left with a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances, and would need to take action to prevent borrowing running out of control. \u201cWe had to clear up the mess of what we had been left,\u201d Reeves will tell the CBI. \u201cThe easiest thing I could have done is to have dodged the difficult choices. Put short-term interests before the national interest. I was not willing to do that.\u201d She will insist that Labour has no intention of making tax increases on the same scale in future years, however, saying: \u201cI do not plan to have another budget like this. I have wiped the slate clean.\u201d Reeves will also point to some of Labour\u2019s plans for pro-growth policies, which she says she wants to work alongside business to deliver, including the Back to Work white paper, due later this week. Last week\u2019s official growth figures showed the economy expanded by just 0.1% in the third quarter, with some business groups, including the CBI, blaming pre-budget uncertainty for the marked slowdown. Reeves will repeat that she was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with those growth figures, the same line used by Keir Starmer when he responded to the data last week at the G20 summit in Rio. Financial markets have also downgraded their expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England since the budget, putting upward pressure on mortgage rates, though on a much smaller scale than the dramatic jump after Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, has blamed Reeves\u2019s budget for endangering the outlook for the economy, claiming: \u201cLabour\u2019s national insurance jobs tax will make it more expensive for businesses, which will then fuel higher prices, higher inflation, higher mortgage costs and slower growth.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s serious tone on Monday will be in contrast to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at the same conference three years ago, when he delivered a rambling address on the merits of children\u2019s theme park Peppa Pig World. \u201cPeppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems,\u201d Johnson told his baffled audience. At one point he also imitated the sound of an accelerating car. Reeves\u2019s speech at the CBI event comes as the business organisation tries to rehabilitate its public image following the Guardian\u2019s revelations about sexual misconduct at the lobbying group, which its president has described as \u201can appalling shock\u201d that tipped it into a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Special counsel prosecutors dismissed the two federal criminal cases against Donald Trump in separate court filings on Monday, as they bowed to the reality that they would not be completed or proceed to trial before Trump returns to the presidency next year. The withdrawals marked the end of the years-long legal battle between Trump and the special counsel Jack Smith, and reflected the extraordinary ability of Trump to sidestep an indictment that would have sunk the presidential bid of anyone else. Trump\u2019s election victory was always going to spell the end of the criminal cases against him \u2013 over Trump\u2019s retention of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 due to justice department policy that prohibits taking criminal action against a sitting president. But the withdrawals also showed just how successfully Trump, with help from sympathetic judges, managed to beat the justice system with an audacious play of using a presidential campaign and the political calendar to sidestep deeply perilous charges. In a six-page motion to dismiss the 2020 election interference case, prosecutors said even though Trump was not yet president, they had been told by the department\u2019s office of legal counsel, which provides internal legal advice, to withdraw the case before his inauguration in January. \u201cIt has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President,\u201d wrote Smith\u2019s top deputy, Molly Gaston. \u201cThat prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government\u2019s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,\u201d she added. Moments later, prosecutors told the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit that they were withdrawing their challenge against the earlier dismissal of the classified documents case with respect to Trump. But they said they would continue trying to bring cases against Trump\u2019s co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira - although it was unclear whether those charges would also be dropped once Trump\u2019s loyalist attorney general pick, Pam Bondi, takes over the justice department. From the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, the site of the presidential transition where Trump allegedly stashed 101 classified documents after he left office and was indicted after ignoring a subpoena for their return, Trump\u2019s communications director, Steven Cheung, issued a gleeful statement on the news. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system,\u201d Cheung wrote. Within days of Trump\u2019s victory, prosecutors started examining how to shut down the 2020 election case in federal district court in Washington, and the more complicated matter of the classified documents case that was before the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit. Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2022 under the cloud of an impending special counsel investigation into his retention of national security materials at his Mar-a-Lago club after he lost the 2020 presidential election and left the White House. He repeatedly told supporters at rallies and in public statements that he was running for his literal freedom, urging voters to return him to the presidency in part because the charges would only disappear if he were re-elected. Trump also vowed to pursue the prosecutors and federal investigators involved in the cases. In anticipation of an expected legal retribution effort, Smith and his top deputies are expected to resign from the justice department before Trump is inaugurated, the Guardian has reported. For months, Trump\u2019s overarching legal strategy was to delay the criminal cases until after Tuesday\u2019s election \u2013 banking on the fact that if he won he could appoint a loyalist attorney general who would simply drop the prosecutions. He was unsuccessful in delaying his New York criminal case, tied to his efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election through an unlawful hush-money scheme, and for which he was convicted on 34 felony counts.

They featured interrogation of a bearded man in military fatigues, who had his hands tied and spoke slowly in English to give details from his biography, including that he served as a signalman in the British army between 2019 and 2023. Anderson is 22, according to the date of birth he gave in the video.</p> <p>Russian news agencies confirmed a British man had been captured.</p> <p>The UK foreign secretary said on Monday he had been briefed on the case. \u201cI have been updated about that development in the last couple of days. Of course, we will do all that we can to offer this UK national all the support we can,\u201d said David Lammy, during a break in G7 talks in Italy. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson reportedly travelled to Ukraine eight months ago to volunteer as part of the Ukrainian army\u2019s International Legion. The exact circumstances of how he was captured remain uncertain and it is not clear when the video was filmed. The International Legion did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Russian bloggers claim he was taken near the village of Plekhovo in the Kursk region inside Russia. \u201cA mercenary from Great Britain, who called himself James Scott Rhys Anderson, was captured. He is now giving evidence,\u201d a Russian security source told the state-funded news agency RIA.</p> <p>Russia traditionally treats foreigners fighting with the Ukrainian army as mercenaries and says they are not subject to standard protections offered to prisoners of war \u2013 protections that Russia regularly violates in any case.</p> <p>Although there have been numerous foreign fighters taken prisoner by Russian forces in Ukraine, Anderson\u2019s capture, if confirmed, would be the first known case of a western solider being caught inside Russia. Ukrainian forces occupied a chunk of Russian territory in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/ukrainian-troops-audacious-incursion-russia-kursk\">audacious offensive</a> earlier this year, but Russian troops are pushing them back and have recaptured about 40% of the territory they had lost, amid heavy fighting.</p> <p>Anderson\u2019s father, Scott Anderson, said he had been called by his son\u2019s Ukrainian commander to inform him about the capture, and had also seen the video. \u201cI was in complete shock and in tears. I could see straight away it was him,\u201d Scott Anderson <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14120989/Father-ex-British-soldier-22-captured-Putins-forces-fighting-Ukraine-Russia-soil-tells-heartache-son-imprisoned-trying-right.html\">told the Daily Mail</a>.</p> <p>One person who had spent time with Anderson in Ukraine said: \u201cHe is a very giggly, positive, funny and energetic person who loves to hang out with his boys. It\u2019s very easy to talk to him even though he can be introverted in a crowd. He is observant and is a really fun and comfortable person to be around.\u201d</p> <p>Shaun Pinner, a former British solider who served with the Ukrainian army and was captured while fighting in 2022, told the Guardian that the next 10 days would be crucial for Anderson.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult but it will be down to his fortitude and resilience. At the end of the day he is a Ukrainian soldier, not a mercenary. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d said Pinner. \u201cWhen I was captured the Russians would try to bring Britain into it at every<br>turn as part of their false narrative that there are British soldiers on the ground here.\u201d </p> <p>Pinner was eventually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/11/family-shaun-pinner-sentenced-death-russia-call-for-cooperation\">sentenced to death</a> by a Russian proxy court in east Ukraine, but was released later in 2022 after the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich helped broker a deal to free several British captives.</p> <p>Pinner said it was important to remember that anything said publicly about Anderson could have an effect on his case and be used against him in interrogations. \u201cThe Russians will take anything that is put out and will show it to him and we have to recognise that the guys who are behind the camera are also likely to be his interrogators,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s International Legion was set up early in the full-scale war and consists mostly of foreign volunteers. There are also foreigners fighting in many other parts of the Ukrainian army. Early in the war, Ukrainian authorities said more than 20,000 people from 52 countries had arrived in Ukraine to fight against Russia, but since then the numbers have been classified.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has entered a new phase marked by escalated rhetoric in the weeks before Donald Trump takes over as US president. Ukraine finally received a long-requested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/biden-has-lifted-ban-on-ukraine-using-us-weapons-to-strike-deeper-into-russia-reports\">green light</a> from the Biden administration to fire long-range missiles into Russia to support the operation in Kursk last week; Vladimir Putin responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/russian-ballistic-missile-attack-ukraine-a-severe-escalation-says-zelenskyy\">firing an experimental ballistic missile</a> at the city of Dnipro and threatening nuclear retaliation.</p> <p>Russia has also kept up its drone barrage on Ukrainian cities, while a Monday morning missile attack on Kharkiv hit a residential area and injured at least 23 people, according to the city\u2019s mayor, Ihor Terekhov. A missile also injured 10 people in the middle of the day in the southern city of Odesa, local officials said.</p> <p>Ukraine has continued its own attacks on targets inside Russia linked to the Kremlin\u2019s war effort. Ukrainian military intelligence officials told Associated Press that Ukrainian drones were responsible for explosions and a fire at an oil depot in Russia\u2019s Kaluga region in the early hours of Monday.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK government has promised to do all it can to assist a former British soldier fighting for Ukraine who has been taken prisoner by the Russian army. Two videos of a man who identified himself as James Scott Rhys Anderson surfaced on Russian Telegram channels over the weekend. They featured interrogation of a bearded man in military fatigues, who had his hands tied and spoke slowly in English to give details from his biography, including that he served as a signalman in the British army between 2019 and 2023. Anderson is 22, according to the date of birth he gave in the video. Russian news agencies confirmed a British man had been captured. The UK foreign secretary said on Monday he had been briefed on the case. \u201cI have been updated about that development in the last couple of days. Of course, we will do all that we can to offer this UK national all the support we can,\u201d said David Lammy, during a break in G7 talks in Italy. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man following reports of his detention.\u201d Anderson reportedly travelled to Ukraine eight months ago to volunteer as part of the Ukrainian army\u2019s International Legion. The exact circumstances of how he was captured remain uncertain and it is not clear when the video was filmed. The International Legion did not respond to requests for comment. Russian bloggers claim he was taken near the village of Plekhovo in the Kursk region inside Russia. \u201cA mercenary from Great Britain, who called himself James Scott Rhys Anderson, was captured. He is now giving evidence,\u201d a Russian security source told the state-funded news agency RIA. Russia traditionally treats foreigners fighting with the Ukrainian army as mercenaries and says they are not subject to standard protections offered to prisoners of war \u2013 protections that Russia regularly violates in any case. Although there have been numerous foreign fighters taken prisoner by Russian forces in Ukraine, Anderson\u2019s capture, if confirmed, would be the first known case of a western solider being caught inside Russia. Ukrainian forces occupied a chunk of Russian territory in an audacious offensive earlier this year, but Russian troops are pushing them back and have recaptured about 40% of the territory they had lost, amid heavy fighting. Anderson\u2019s father, Scott Anderson, said he had been called by his son\u2019s Ukrainian commander to inform him about the capture, and had also seen the video. \u201cI was in complete shock and in tears. I could see straight away it was him,\u201d Scott Anderson told the Daily Mail. One person who had spent time with Anderson in Ukraine said: \u201cHe is a very giggly, positive, funny and energetic person who loves to hang out with his boys. It\u2019s very easy to talk to him even though he can be introverted in a crowd. He is observant and is a really fun and comfortable person to be around.\u201d Shaun Pinner, a former British solider who served with the Ukrainian army and was captured while fighting in 2022, told the Guardian that the next 10 days would be crucial for Anderson. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult but it will be down to his fortitude and resilience. At the end of the day he is a Ukrainian soldier, not a mercenary. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d said Pinner. \u201cWhen I was captured the Russians would try to bring Britain into it at every turn as part of their false narrative that there are British soldiers on the ground here.\u201d Pinner was eventually sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in east Ukraine, but was released later in 2022 after the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich helped broker a deal to free several British captives. Pinner said it was important to remember that anything said publicly about Anderson could have an effect on his case and be used against him in interrogations. \u201cThe Russians will take anything that is put out and will show it to him and we have to recognise that the guys who are behind the camera are also likely to be his interrogators,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s International Legion was set up early in the full-scale war and consists mostly of foreign volunteers. There are also foreigners fighting in many other parts of the Ukrainian army. Early in the war, Ukrainian authorities said more than 20,000 people from 52 countries had arrived in Ukraine to fight against Russia, but since then the numbers have been classified. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has entered a new phase marked by escalated rhetoric in the weeks before Donald Trump takes over as US president. Ukraine finally received a long-requested green light from the Biden administration to fire long-range missiles into Russia to support the operation in Kursk last week; Vladimir Putin responded by firing an experimental ballistic missile at the city of Dnipro and threatening nuclear retaliation. Russia has also kept up its drone barrage on Ukrainian cities, while a Monday morning missile attack on Kharkiv hit a residential area and injured at least 23 people, according to the city\u2019s mayor, Ihor Terekhov. A missile also injured 10 people in the middle of the day in the southern city of Odesa, local officials said. Ukraine has continued its own attacks on targets inside Russia linked to the Kremlin\u2019s war effort. Ukrainian military intelligence officials told Associated Press that Ukrainian drones were responsible for explosions and a fire at an oil depot in Russia\u2019s Kaluga region in the early hours of Monday.",

Many of the overwhelmed towns and villages experienced similar devastation in 2020 when Storm Dennis swept through \u2013 yet those interviewed by the Guardian said little, if anything, had been done to future-proof against floods and storms in the intervening years. Pontypridd, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, was one of the worst affected towns, where the banks of the River Taff burst and flooded dozens of properties. Jenna Cowley, 38, is the co-owner of Storyville Books on Mill Street, where the flood waters rose through the drains and overwhelmed the district of independent shops and businesses. Cowley was stacking surviving books into plastic storage boxes, salvaging what she could; the floors and lower shelves of the bookcases were grimy with brown water stains and a dehumidifier buzzed in the doorway.

      "body": "<p>Somewhere in the mud and the destruction a ball appeared, left there by the flood. Six days after the worst catastrophe in Spanish history had taken 229 lives and devastated thousands more, on a street still caked in sludge a game began. <a href=\"https://www.levante-emv.com/videos/sociedad/2024/11/04/tierna-imagen-ninos-jugando-futbol-aldaia-valencia-111353736.html\">Someone recorded it</a>, sharing a moment\u2019s happiness amidst the pain, a little light and hope let in: four boys from the small town of Aldaia covered in dirt, playing among piles of furniture from broken homes. Nineteen days later and seven miles away, a fifth local boy scored the goal of this or any season.</p> \n<p>At 2.12pm on Saturday, seven minutes into Valencia\u2019s first game since the catastrophe \u2013 not so much a football match as an expression of community, one giant, collective embrace \u2013 the ball dropped to C\u00e9sar T\u00e1rrega at the south end of Mestalla. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClVfo18tYzk\">It was a simple finish</a>, but if these fans have seen better goals, they hadn\u2019t felt any like this. Suddenly, the silence \u2013 and it had been so, so silent \u2013 was broken, all those emotions escaping. T\u00e1rrega had cried in the quiet before kick off; now he let go, tears returning to his eyes. Then he ran to collect a shirt, holding it high. On the back, a message had been printed: \u201c<em><a href=\"https://x.com/valenciacf/status/1860317839455859130\">Tots junts eixirem</a></em>.\u201d Together, we will come through this.</p> \n<p>Born and raised in Aldaia, T\u00e1rrega got a call at about 10.30pm on the night of 29 October, telling him that everything was flooding. His home, a town of 32,200 people in the Horta Sud, inland from the regional capital, was one of the worst hit. It hadn\u2019t rained much there but the water from a year\u2019s worth of precipitation in 48 hours rushed down towards them, the Saleta ravine overflowing. The mayor, Guillermo Luj\u00e1n, described it as a \u201ctsunami\u201d. Six people died, mud covered everything, cars were swept into macabre piles. Unwarned and abandoned, 99% of the homes had been affected, Luj\u00e1n said. Among them, the building where T\u00e1rrega\u2019s parents, Esther and Manolo, live on the third floor.</p> \n<p>Just under a week later, a group of young kids were helping clean up, shovels, buckets and brooms in hand. As they worked, a little boy named Iker, aged five or six, found a ball buried and, as one of the boys\u2019 dads put it, \u201cwhat had to happen, happened\u201d. Three began to play, a fourth asked if he could join in and soon they were squelching through thick mud, slipping with every kick, picking their way past fridges and furniture, possessions piled in the street. They didn\u2019t know they were being recorded and it wasn\u2019t much of a match but it was everything. The images went viral, the television station turning up. The metaphor was unmissable, the symbolism inescapable.</p> \n<p>Already a focal point of the community and the rescue effort, Mestalla becoming a giant store for aid and support, Valencia invited the kids to their Paterna training ground. Iker, Alejandro, Roberto and \u00c1lvaro, accompanied by Alexis and Valentina, met managerRub\u00e9n Baraja and his players, a dozen of them. Games were set up, the pitch green and the ball white this time. \u201cWe played with Cesar T\u00e1rrega: he\u2019s from my town,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuq_aKuo5ss&amp;t=5s\">Roberto said</a>.</p> \n<p>At that point Valencia were not playing and didn\u2019t know when they would, or if they really wanted to yet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/04/spain-valencia-floods-la-liga\">La Liga had played on</a>, but they could not. For 26 days, they did not return. \u201cWe have people who\u2019ve lost homes, family members,\u201d Baraja said. It is not only T\u00e1rrega \u2013 Yarek and Rub\u00e9n Iranzo had been directly affected as had the team delegate, Voro \u2013 but that he, another kid from Aldaia, should score the first when this weekend they finally did reappear, felt fitting.</p> \n<p>It all did. After almost a month away and three games postponed \u2013 against Real Madrid and Espanyol in the league, Parla Escuela in the Copa del Rey \u2013 Valencia came back against Real Betis this Saturday. They did so uneasily, unsure how it would be, how it <em>should</em> be, how they would and should feel too, let alone how they would perform, wondering whether it was right. By the end, few doubted that it was. Not because Valencia won 4-2, securing their second win of the season and climbing off the bottom of the table, or at least not only that, but because of something else, something deeper. \u201cWhat we want is for people to feel that we are with them, that we are there for them,\u201d Baraja had said. \u201cSometimes a friend needs something: take it to them.\u201d And so they did.</p> \n<p>Football is an escape, the old line says, a means of forgetting. But that is not always true: sometimes it is the opposite, not about avoiding life but embracing it, marking it. This is what football is for, what it <em>is</em>. Community, identity, belonging. There is probably no greater meeting place in Valencian society than Mestalla, nowhere with the mystique, history or even just the size, a ground where a sign marks the water level from the last time there was a flood, in 1957. If Saturday was almost like a funeral, that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t have happened but that it should: a homage not to a person but a people, a rite of passage that was sad and moving but beautiful. A catharsis, one paper called it. A comfort, perhaps, a source of solace, honouring those who had passed and those who had suffered, maybe not easing the suffering exactly but sharing it; 43,975 people were there.</p> \n<p>In the morning, Betis had visited a school in Alfafar, delivering material. In the stands, their fans, many of them from Valencia too, held a banner of support. Buses had collected around 500 Valencia supporters from the towns worst hit; many of those have, of course, been left without cars. Of the club\u2019s season ticket holders, around 8,500 are from areas devastated by the flood. Nino Bravo\u2019s <em>Mi Tierra</em> (My Land) went round. Rei Ortola played <em>Voces de Valencia</em> (Voices of Valencia). When the teams came out, there was no cheer, only applause, the sound of a cello and his guitar. A 50-metre wide Valencian flag, first unfurled at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and then handed to second-division Levante when they returned last week, playing in \u201cmud stained\u201d kits, covered the pitch. Twenty-two children who play for clubs in the worst-hit areas were there in their teams\u2019 shirts.</p> \n<p>A big black ribbon was carried on to the pitch. Valencia\u2019s players wore black kits, \u201cunited, as always\u201d on the front. On the bench, Baraja wore a black suit and a black tie. In the stands, there were messages of loss \u2013 \u201cthis is for you, Rub\u00e9n\u201d \u2013 words of thanks to the thousands of volunteers who had come to their aid, and a hush. As the players stood and the Valencian anthem played, performed with traditional local instruments, a black banner came down listing all the places hit. For the entire game, those names appeared on the scoreboard, one after the other, every two seconds. A red and yellow mosaic in the region\u2019s colours covered the rest of the ground. There was a minute\u2019s silence, deep and lingering. <a href=\"https://www.valenciacf.com/un-camp-de-mestalla-lleno-de-sentimientos-a-flor-de-piel?image=1\">Tears came quietly, cameras caught a lady trembling</a>.</p> \n<p>As the players stood, the Betis captain Marc Bartra gently put an arm around Hugo Duro\u2019s shoulder. Duro admitted that he had struggled to keep it together in the team talk, players held in a tight huddle as captain Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e0 spoke; for a man who had volunteered in Chiva and Picanya, it wasn\u2019t easy now either. \u201cI\u2019m an emotional person and it is like there has been a war here,\u201d he said. All around, people swallowed hard. As for T\u00e1rrega, he could not contain the tears, blowing hard to stop himself breaking entirely.</p> \n<p>When the kid from Aldaia scored, just seven minutes in, he couldn\u2019t contain anything. \u201cC\u00e9sar has suffered a lot over these weeks and he deserves to score the goal so that he could dedicate it to every <em>valenciano</em> and all the people in his town,\u201d teammate Diego L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThis is for all of you,\u201d Tarrega wrote later. Mestalla had been quiet until then, strange and still, like this wasn\u2019t real, wasn\u2019t an actual game. The goal came as a kind of permission, that moment that makes you smile, breaking people but releasing them too. A reminder: you <em>are</em> allowed to enjoy this, to live. In fact, you\u2019re supposed to.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Mestalla mourns\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

When Betis equalised there was no celebration. Instead, Aitor Ruibal and Bartra went to the touchline, raised a Valencia flag and Mestalla applauded them. When Chimy \u00c1vila got Betis\u2019s second late on, he did not celebrate either. By then, though, Valencia had scored three more anyway: Duro got two of them, L\u00f3pez the other. \u201cI hit it with all my soul, thinking of the people,\u201d the winger said. Victory had been secured, felt differently but perhaps more deeply than any other; perhaps needed too. There has never been a game like this. \u201cMaybe they played with the extra emotion of what this means,\u201d \u00c1vila suggested. As the whistle approached, Mestalla stood and sang the Valencian anthem together, like it was the final hymn before it all came to a close and the congregation departed, brought there by the ball.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe emotion we felt ... I had goosebumps,\u201d Baraja said. \u201cWe wanted to honour the victims, everyone affected. We want to be there for them, for them to know we\u2019re here. We want to be with society, hold their hands and not let go. We want them to get their lives back; it won\u2019t happen soon and we will never forget. But if those who came, watched on television or just saw the score can smile, if we\u2019ve changed their day a little, helped them in some small way, let them enjoy themselves for a little while then we\u2019ve done something. And that is what we play for.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fa59b326-ae36-464b-99ba-9bad2407cf19\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

      "bodyText": "Somewhere in the mud and the destruction a ball appeared, left there by the flood. Six days after the worst catastrophe in Spanish history had taken 229 lives and devastated thousands more, on a street still caked in sludge a game began. Someone recorded it, sharing a moment\u2019s happiness amidst the pain, a little light and hope let in: four boys from the small town of Aldaia covered in dirt, playing among piles of furniture from broken homes. Nineteen days later and seven miles away, a fifth local boy scored the goal of this or any season. At 2.12pm on Saturday, seven minutes into Valencia\u2019s first game since the catastrophe \u2013 not so much a football match as an expression of community, one giant, collective embrace \u2013 the ball dropped to C\u00e9sar T\u00e1rrega at the south end of Mestalla. It was a simple finish, but if these fans have seen better goals, they hadn\u2019t felt any like this. Suddenly, the silence \u2013 and it had been so, so silent \u2013 was broken, all those emotions escaping. T\u00e1rrega had cried in the quiet before kick off; now he let go, tears returning to his eyes. Then he ran to collect a shirt, holding it high. On the back, a message had been printed: \u201cTots junts eixirem.\u201d Together, we will come through this. Born and raised in Aldaia, T\u00e1rrega got a call at about 10.30pm on the night of 29 October, telling him that everything was flooding. His home, a town of 32,200 people in the Horta Sud, inland from the regional capital, was one of the worst hit. It hadn\u2019t rained much there but the water from a year\u2019s worth of precipitation in 48 hours rushed down towards them, the Saleta ravine overflowing. The mayor, Guillermo Luj\u00e1n, described it as a \u201ctsunami\u201d. Six people died, mud covered everything, cars were swept into macabre piles. Unwarned and abandoned, 99% of the homes had been affected, Luj\u00e1n said. Among them, the building where T\u00e1rrega\u2019s parents, Esther and Manolo, live on the third floor. Just under a week later, a group of young kids were helping clean up, shovels, buckets and brooms in hand. As they worked, a little boy named Iker, aged five or six, found a ball buried and, as one of the boys\u2019 dads put it, \u201cwhat had to happen, happened\u201d. Three began to play, a fourth asked if he could join in and soon they were squelching through thick mud, slipping with every kick, picking their way past fridges and furniture, possessions piled in the street. They didn\u2019t know they were being recorded and it wasn\u2019t much of a match but it was everything. The images went viral, the television station turning up. The metaphor was unmissable, the symbolism inescapable. Already a focal point of the community and the rescue effort, Mestalla becoming a giant store for aid and support, Valencia invited the kids to their Paterna training ground. Iker, Alejandro, Roberto and \u00c1lvaro, accompanied by Alexis and Valentina, met managerRub\u00e9n Baraja and his players, a dozen of them. Games were set up, the pitch green and the ball white this time. \u201cWe played with Cesar T\u00e1rrega: he\u2019s from my town,\u201d Roberto said. At that point Valencia were not playing and didn\u2019t know when they would, or if they really wanted to yet. La Liga had played on, but they could not. For 26 days, they did not return. \u201cWe have people who\u2019ve lost homes, family members,\u201d Baraja said. It is not only T\u00e1rrega \u2013 Yarek and Rub\u00e9n Iranzo had been directly affected as had the team delegate, Voro \u2013 but that he, another kid from Aldaia, should score the first when this weekend they finally did reappear, felt fitting. It all did. After almost a month away and three games postponed \u2013 against Real Madrid and Espanyol in the league, Parla Escuela in the Copa del Rey \u2013 Valencia came back against Real Betis this Saturday. They did so uneasily, unsure how it would be, how it should be, how they would and should feel too, let alone how they would perform, wondering whether it was right. By the end, few doubted that it was. Not because Valencia won 4-2, securing their second win of the season and climbing off the bottom of the table, or at least not only that, but because of something else, something deeper. \u201cWhat we want is for people to feel that we are with them, that we are there for them,\u201d Baraja had said. \u201cSometimes a friend needs something: take it to them.\u201d And so they did. Football is an escape, the old line says, a means of forgetting. But that is not always true: sometimes it is the opposite, not about avoiding life but embracing it, marking it. This is what football is for, what it is. Community, identity, belonging. There is probably no greater meeting place in Valencian society than Mestalla, nowhere with the mystique, history or even just the size, a ground where a sign marks the water level from the last time there was a flood, in 1957. If Saturday was almost like a funeral, that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t have happened but that it should: a homage not to a person but a people, a rite of passage that was sad and moving but beautiful. A catharsis, one paper called it. A comfort, perhaps, a source of solace, honouring those who had passed and those who had suffered, maybe not easing the suffering exactly but sharing it; 43,975 people were there. In the morning, Betis had visited a school in Alfafar, delivering material. In the stands, their fans, many of them from Valencia too, held a banner of support. Buses had collected around 500 Valencia supporters from the towns worst hit; many of those have, of course, been left without cars. Of the club\u2019s season ticket holders, around 8,500 are from areas devastated by the flood. Nino Bravo\u2019s Mi Tierra (My Land) went round. Rei Ortola played Voces de Valencia (Voices of Valencia). When the teams came out, there was no cheer, only applause, the sound of a cello and his guitar. A 50-metre wide Valencian flag, first unfurled at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and then handed to second-division Levante when they returned last week, playing in \u201cmud stained\u201d kits, covered the pitch. Twenty-two children who play for clubs in the worst-hit areas were there in their teams\u2019 shirts. A big black ribbon was carried on to the pitch. Valencia\u2019s players wore black kits, \u201cunited, as always\u201d on the front. On the bench, Baraja wore a black suit and a black tie. In the stands, there were messages of loss \u2013 \u201cthis is for you, Rub\u00e9n\u201d \u2013 words of thanks to the thousands of volunteers who had come to their aid, and a hush. As the players stood and the Valencian anthem played, performed with traditional local instruments, a black banner came down listing all the places hit. For the entire game, those names appeared on the scoreboard, one after the other, every two seconds. A red and yellow mosaic in the region\u2019s colours covered the rest of the ground. There was a minute\u2019s silence, deep and lingering. Tears came quietly, cameras caught a lady trembling. As the players stood, the Betis captain Marc Bartra gently put an arm around Hugo Duro\u2019s shoulder. Duro admitted that he had struggled to keep it together in the team talk, players held in a tight huddle as captain Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e0 spoke; for a man who had volunteered in Chiva and Picanya, it wasn\u2019t easy now either. \u201cI\u2019m an emotional person and it is like there has been a war here,\u201d he said. All around, people swallowed hard. As for T\u00e1rrega, he could not contain the tears, blowing hard to stop himself breaking entirely. When the kid from Aldaia scored, just seven minutes in, he couldn\u2019t contain anything. \u201cC\u00e9sar has suffered a lot over these weeks and he deserves to score the goal so that he could dedicate it to every valenciano and all the people in his town,\u201d teammate Diego L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThis is for all of you,\u201d Tarrega wrote later. Mestalla had been quiet until then, strange and still, like this wasn\u2019t real, wasn\u2019t an actual game. The goal came as a kind of permission, that moment that makes you smile, breaking people but releasing them too. A reminder: you are allowed to enjoy this, to live. In fact, you\u2019re supposed to. Which didn\u2019t mean it was done, or just another game now. When Betis equalised there was no celebration. Instead, Aitor Ruibal and Bartra went to the touchline, raised a Valencia flag and Mestalla applauded them. When Chimy \u00c1vila got Betis\u2019s second late on, he did not celebrate either. By then, though, Valencia had scored three more anyway: Duro got two of them, L\u00f3pez the other. \u201cI hit it with all my soul, thinking of the people,\u201d the winger said. Victory had been secured, felt differently but perhaps more deeply than any other; perhaps needed too. There has never been a game like this. \u201cMaybe they played with the extra emotion of what this means,\u201d \u00c1vila suggested. As the whistle approached, Mestalla stood and sang the Valencian anthem together, like it was the final hymn before it all came to a close and the congregation departed, brought there by the ball. \u201cThe emotion we felt ... I had goosebumps,\u201d Baraja said. \u201cWe wanted to honour the victims, everyone affected. We want to be there for them, for them to know we\u2019re here. We want to be with society, hold their hands and not let go. We want them to get their lives back; it won\u2019t happen soon and we will never forget. But if those who came, watched on television or just saw the score can smile, if we\u2019ve changed their day a little, helped them in some small way, let them enjoy themselves for a little while then we\u2019ve done something. And that is what we play for.\u201d",

It is an imagined story \u2013 there is no Scrooge and, unlike his unfortunate business partner, he is not dead. But that does not appear to have mattered to a vandal in Shropshire, where a gravestone of Scrooge used in a 1984 film adaptation has been smashed into multiple pieces. The prop, a heavy piece of stone several centimetres thick engraved with the name \u201cEbenezer Scrooge\u201d, has lain in the graveyard of St Chad\u2019s church, Shrewsbury, since the movie 40 years ago starring George C Scott. While Scrooge is definitely fictional, the stone may have belonged to an unknown real person whose name was weathered away over hundreds of years, according to a BBC interview with Martin Wood, Shrewsbury\u2019s town crier, who was a body double in the film. It can be seen in the scene where Scrooge, described by Dickens as \u201ca squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner\u201d, is taken to the grave of an unloved man by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and discovers it bears his own name. Town council clerk Helen Ball said the prop was a popular attraction in the town. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that is very dear to everybody\u2019s hearts,\u201d she told BBC Radio Shropshire. \u201cWhen you look at the Facebook messages that people put on yesterday, it\u2019s united a community in terms of the disgust that somebody can do that.\u201d The movie was filmed around Shropshire and is one of a number of beloved adaptations of the book, which also includes a 2019 Stephen Knight miniseries for the BBC with Guy Pearce, a Disney version with Jim Carrey and, arguably the most faithful of all, the Muppet Christmas Carol with Michael Caine as Scrooge and narrated by Gonzo as Dickens. Ball said the damage had been reported to the police when it was discovered on Sunday morning but the identity and motive of the culprit was unknown. She said: \u201cMaybe if it\u2019s someone in their drunken revelry, they might have posted it on Facebook or something, and maybe somebody with a bit of conscience might let us know who that is. \u201cOr equally,\u201d she said, providing a potentially satisfying ending, \u201cthe person who did it may have a conscience and decide to own up\u201d. Ball added, in true Victorian style, it would be a \u201cgood reason to bring the stocks back\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2024 because an earlier version, in one instance, referred to the town of Shrewsbury as a village.",

The IFS is broadly supportive of what the government is doing, but it accepts that the change in inheritance tax rules has disadvantaged elderly farmers who, if they knew this was coming, would have already given away their farms to their children. Summing up the IFS arguments, <strong>David Sturrock</strong>, one of the authors of the paper, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Inheritance tax [IHT] relief for agricultural and business assets favours those whose wealth is held in these forms rather than others. It also provides a tax incentive for agricultural land to be used by the wealthy as a way to avoid inheritance tax. That is unfair, inefficient and creates economic costs. </p> \n   <p>Those objecting to the change claim that paying IHT will have detrimental effects on food production or the environment. But if government wishes to promote food production or certain uses of land, there are much better ways of doing so than through an inheritance tax break. It is also objected, as a matter of principle, that this could result in families having to sell up and move on from farms that have been in the same family for generations. That is an argument against inheritance tax in general \u2013 it can have the same effect on family homes, for example \u2013 rather than a strong case for protecting certain forms of assets specifically. </p> \n   <p>The exact design of the tax change is important, and there are two mitigations which the government could consider. There is a good case for making unused portions of the new \u00a31m allowance inheritable by a spouse or civil partner, as happens for the main inheritance tax allowances. In addition, current farm owners passing away in the next seven years (but after the new regime comes into force in April 2026) will not have had the opportunity to avoid inheritance tax by making lifetime gifts. If the government wished to give current farm owners the same opportunity to avoid inheritance tax as owners of other assets, it could, for example, make lifetime gifts of agricultural property made before a certain future date inheritance tax free, regardless of the timing of the death.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Responding to the report, <strong>Tim Farron</strong>, the Lib Dem environment spokesperson, said</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The government hid behind the IFS to try and justify this disastrous policy. That very same organisation is now telling them that their own proposals need an overhaul.</p> \n   <p>It would be beggars belief for the government to continue to push forward with these stupid plans.</p> \n   <p>They need to swallow their pride, realise the damage this family farm tax will do and axe the tax.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-67448d8a8f08849211a44590\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T15:06:04.707Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour claims Badenoch's refusal to commit to reversing employers' NICs rise shows Tories accept budget tax increases</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Labour</strong> claims the Conservative party is now implicitly accepting the need for the tax increases in the budget.

After the election many people assumed that the Labour landslide, and the drastic change in the composition of parliament, meant that there is now a majority for assisted dying. But in recent weeks there have been indications that opponents of the bill are gaining ground, in part because Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary (the two cabinet ministers who would have most responsibility for implementing assisted dying) have come out against it forcefully.</p> \n  <p>In interviews this morning Phillips said she would be voting for assisted dying, as she did in 2015. She also rejected the suggestion that Mahmood\u2019s criticism of the bill could be disregarded because it was motivated by religion (something <strong>Charlie Falconer</strong>, the former Labour lord chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/ministers-speaking-out-against-assisted-dying-false-impression-charlie-falconer\">suggested yesterday</a>).

      "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has refused commit to reversing the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance in the budget. (See 2.13pm.) Responding to her comment at a CBI conference, Labour said this meant the Tories were now implicitly accepting the need for the tax increases announced by the government. (See 3.06pm.) Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has told the CBI that she is ruling out a further rise to overall public spending and that \u201cpublic services now need to live within the envelope that we\u2019ve set\u201d. (See 4.46pm.) Rupert Soames, the CBI chair, has accused the government of treating employers as a \u201ccash cow\u201d in last month\u2019s budget, and urged ministers to water down plans for workers\u2019 rights. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has said the UK\u2019s flood defences are in the \u201cworst condition on record\u201d and promised the new Labour government has committed \u00a32.4bn to upgrade them. There is more coverage on our Storm Bert live blog. Keir Starmer is under renewed pressure over electoral reform after dozens of newly elected Labour MPs signed up to a parliamentary group calling for the UK to move to a proportional voting system. Scottish Labour will force a vote designed to re-design the Scottish government\u2019s winter fuel payments, despite them being cut because of a decision by the UK government, PA Media reports. PA says: Within weeks of taking office, chancellor Rachel Reeves set off a political firestorm by announcing the winter fuel payment would be means-tested, cutting spending and ultimately scuppering the Scottish government\u2019s plan to offer its own universal counterpart. But last week, Scottish Labour announced it would bring in re-designed payments, which would lower the bar for those who would receive them if it won the 2026 Holyrood election. And today the party announced it would seek to bring the payments back by forcing a vote in Holyrood during stage three of the social security (amendment) (Scotland) bill. Amendments submitted by the party would require ministers to make regulations that would make all pensioners eligible for winter heating assistance, while also allowing for any payments made to be recovered if the recipient\u2019s household income exceeds an amount set by ministers. Currently, winter heating assistance \u2013 as described in the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 which the current bill is designed to amend \u2013 is \u201cassistance (which may or may not take the form of money) given by the Scottish ministers under section 24 to an individual to meet, or help towards meeting, the individual\u2019s heating costs during the winter months\u201d. The amendments would appear to make changes to the devolved benefit the Scottish government pushed back until next year after the chancellor\u2019s announcement. Commenting on the move, the Scottish government\u2019s social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said: This is hypocrisy on stilts from Labour. After betraying millions of pensioners by taking away their winter fuel payment, they now expect people to believe that they can be trusted to stand up for pensioners. Hamish Falconer, a Foreign Office minister, has said that if Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, were to visit the UK, a court would ultimately decide if he should be arrested because of the international criminal court warrant against him over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Falconer was responding to an urgent question from Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, who has strongly criticised the ICC\u2019s decision. (See 1.13pm.) Explaining what would happen, Falconer said: In line with this government\u2019s stated commitment to the rule of law, we respect the independence of the ICC. We will comply with our international obligations. There is a domestic legal process through our independent courts that determines whether or not to endorse an arrest warrant by the ICC, in accordance with the ICC Act of 2001. This process has never been tested because the UK has never been visited by an ICC indictee, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process and due process would be followed in relation to those issues. There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, two terrorist organisations. This government has been clear, Israel has a right to defend itself in accordance with international law, that right is not under question, and the court\u2019s approval of the warrants last week do not change that. Patel said the ICC \u201cappears to be drawing a moral equivalence between Israel\u2019s war of self-defence and Hamas terrorism\u201d and she said the only beneficiaries of the decision were Hamas. But Falconer urged her to respect the ICC. He said: Diplomacy will continue, regardless of the process of the ICC, but I had understood it to be the common position of this house that the international rule of law is an important commitment. The international criminal court is an important, the primary body, in enforcing these norms and the issues on jurisdiction and complementarity were heard by the pre-trial chamber, its three judges have issued their findings, and I think we should respect those. Q: What are your grounds for optimism? Reeves says she is hugely optimistic for Britain. The country has got so much going for it, she says. Government has to play a part. But businesses have to play a part too, she says. Government has to provide stability. And she says it has to remove the barriers that are in the way of growth. As chancellor, Reeves says she has to get the whole of government thinking about how it can remove barriers holding up investment. And that\u2019s the end of the Q&amp;A. Reeves says public services now need to live within the envelope set. She says departmental spending limits for beyond 2026 will be set out in the next phase of the spending review. She goes on: But what I am really sure about \u2026 [is] that public services now need to live within the envelope that we\u2019ve set. We will not be coming back to top up those budgets. UPDATE: Reeves said: We\u2019ll be publishing the second phase of the spending review in spring next year. But what I am really clear about, and I\u2019ve said it already a couple of times today, [is] that public services now need to live within the envelope that we\u2019ve set. We will not be coming back to top up those budgets. We have set the envelope for public spending, and it\u2019s through reform and through economic growth that we need to be able to properly fund our public services and to improve living standards for ordinary families. Q: [From ITV\u2019s Joel Hills] A CBI survey says half of businesses might have to let people go as a result of the budget. Will you reconsider any of the measures? Reeves says she has made her decisions. She is determined to put the public finances back on a firm footing. Overall, the budget is good for jobs and good for growth, she says. Reeves is now taking media questions. Q: [From the Telegraph] Businesses are disappointed with the budget. Haven\u2019t you betrayed them. And are you ruling out any more big tax rises on businesses? Reeves says she faced a massive hole in the public finances. In the last parliament people saw what happened when government did not address that. She won\u2019t be that sort of chancellor, she says. She goes on: Public services now need to live within their means, because I\u2019m really clear, I\u2019m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes \u2026 At this budget, we did wipe the slate team to put public finances and public services on footing, and as a result, we won\u2019t have to do a budget like this ever again. And indeed, unlike the last government, I will only be doing one budget a year, so that this government can focus on what our number one priority is, and that\u2019s growing the economy. Reeves says she had to \u201cwipe the slate clean\u201d with the budget. But she says she will not need to deliver another budget with tax rises like that again. You can be confident we\u2019re not going to have to come back again and do another budget like this. So you can be confident about the tax rates we\u2019ve set for this parliament, and public services now, these are within the means that we\u2019ve set. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, tells the CBI that \u201ceverybody knows that that inheritance [at the time of the budget] was pretty dire in terms of the back hole in the public finances\u201d. In line with the advance briefing, she says her critics have not been able to come up with alternative proposals. Q: How will people know if your plans are working? Reeves says she will be judged on whether the economy grows. And that will only happen if investment starts to happen, she says. I want you to judge this government on our number one mission, which is to bring growth back to the UK economy. We can\u2019t do that overnight \u2026 But over this parliament, we going to return investment, we\u2019re going to return growth to the economy, because, in the end, that\u2019s the only way to ensure that Britain is competitive and to ensure that we pull our weight in the world to improve living standards for working people. At the CBI conference Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has just started taking part in a Q&amp;A. There is a live feed here. People who stay in Wales overnight, including children, are set to be charged a visitor levy under a scheme that could raise up to \u00a333m a year to be ploughed back into tourism and culture, Steven Morris reports. The Welsh government\u2019s news release about the visitor accommodation (register and levy) etc. (Wales) bill is here. Commenting on the plan, Mark Drakeford, the finance secretary in the Welsh government, said: We know tourism makes an important contribution to the Welsh economy and to Welsh life. We want to ensure its long-term sustainability. That\u2019s why we believe it is fair visitors contribute towards local facilities, helping to fund infrastructure and services integral to their experience. Visitor levies are common around the world \u2013 benefiting local communities, tourists and businesses \u2013 and we want the same for Wales. Money raised through a levy would be retained by local authorities and reinvested back into their local areas to support local, sustainable tourism. It\u2019s a small contribution that could make a big difference. The government has been criticised for the quality of the reports it has produced assessing the likely consequences of its employment rights bill. A series of impact assessments (IAs) were published last month. But the regulatory policy committee (RPC), a body set up to scrutinise the quality of impact assessments, has published a report saying the work by the government for this is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. It says: The RPC has assessed eight of the 23 individual IAs as \u2018not fit for purpose\u2019 and six of these are in the \u2018highest impact\u2019 measure category in the summary IA. The overall assessment for the bill IA is therefore \u2018not fit for purpose\u2019. Given the number and reach of the measures, it would be proportionate to undertake labour market and broader macroeconomic analysis, to understand the overall impact on employment, wages and output, and particularly, the pass-through of employer costs to employees. Commenting on the report, Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: Labour\u2019s impact assessment for their radical trade union charter has been rated \u2018not fit for purpose\u2019 by the government\u2019s own regulator. But businesses up and down the country knew this already. Just like the national insurance Jobs\u2019 Tax, this bill is the second wave of an attack on job creators. Keir Starmer is paying tribute to Prescott now. He says Prescott was the longest-serving deputy PM ever and \u201ca politician for working people through and through\u201d. In many respects, Prescott was ahead of his time, Starmer says. He championed causes like tackling climate change, fighting regional inequality, supporting the minimum wage, improving public transport, and building council houses. Prescott was \u201ca skilled negotiator, sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity\u201d, Starmer says. He says Prescott had a talent for bringing people together who had different points of view. He was someone who was not in politics for himself, Starmer says. And he was someone who was a team player who would support a position in public, even if he had opposed it in private before the collective decision was taken. UPDATE: Starmer said: Make no mistake, [Prescott] did things his own way, and forged his own path, and in doing so, he brought about some of the greatest transformation this country has ever seen, the linchpin of New Labour, because beneath the pugnacious exterior, John was a skilled negotiator, sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity. He had an incredible skill, which was the ability to bring people together from different starting points, whether that was his work on climate negotiations, or closer at home in his own party, to stand together in a better place. And that sums up another thing that the public, I think, sensed about John. He was not in it for himself. He was a team player, and he was proud to play for Team Labour, that was never more evident than during the campaign season, when it was time to bring out the battle bus, which has become a tradition our deputy prime minister proudly continued this year, because the Prescott Express was a morale boost to any campaign. It may have been arriving in a Tesco car park, but John was always met with a reception like Beatlemania and no wonder, the public were at the heart of John\u2019s politics. And it\u2019s clear the public had a particular place in their heart for him too, and that was key to his popularity. And indeed, after the famous incident, it was the public who came out swinging for him. In the Commons MPs are now paying tribute to John Prescott. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, recalls Prescott visting Hoyle\u2019s constituency soon after Hoyle became an MP. He says there was so much pushing from reporters that a woman in the crowd broke her arm. Prescott insisted on going to visit her in hospital, Hoyle says. He says that is the sort of person he was. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has published a paper suggesting two changes to the government\u2019s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms that it says would make them fairer. The IFS is broadly supportive of what the government is doing, but it accepts that the change in inheritance tax rules has disadvantaged elderly farmers who, if they knew this was coming, would have already given away their farms to their children. Summing up the IFS arguments, David Sturrock, one of the authors of the paper, said: Inheritance tax [IHT] relief for agricultural and business assets favours those whose wealth is held in these forms rather than others. It also provides a tax incentive for agricultural land to be used by the wealthy as a way to avoid inheritance tax. That is unfair, inefficient and creates economic costs. Those objecting to the change claim that paying IHT will have detrimental effects on food production or the environment. But if government wishes to promote food production or certain uses of land, there are much better ways of doing so than through an inheritance tax break. It is also objected, as a matter of principle, that this could result in families having to sell up and move on from farms that have been in the same family for generations. That is an argument against inheritance tax in general \u2013 it can have the same effect on family homes, for example \u2013 rather than a strong case for protecting certain forms of assets specifically. The exact design of the tax change is important, and there are two mitigations which the government could consider. There is a good case for making unused portions of the new \u00a31m allowance inheritable by a spouse or civil partner, as happens for the main inheritance tax allowances. In addition, current farm owners passing away in the next seven years (but after the new regime comes into force in April 2026) will not have had the opportunity to avoid inheritance tax by making lifetime gifts. If the government wished to give current farm owners the same opportunity to avoid inheritance tax as owners of other assets, it could, for example, make lifetime gifts of agricultural property made before a certain future date inheritance tax free, regardless of the timing of the death. Responding to the report, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem environment spokesperson, said The government hid behind the IFS to try and justify this disastrous policy. That very same organisation is now telling them that their own proposals need an overhaul. It would be beggars belief for the government to continue to push forward with these stupid plans. They need to swallow their pride, realise the damage this family farm tax will do and axe the tax. Labour claims the Conservative party is now implicitly accepting the need for the tax increases in the budget. Referring to the Kemi Badenoch\u2019s speech to the CBI, and her refusal to commit her party to reversing the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance in the budget (see 2.13pm), a Labour spokesperson said: After weeks of campaigning against it, Kemi Badenoch is now refusing to say whether she would actually reverse the employer national insurance rise. The opposition seem to finally accept that the damage they did to the economy made tax rises necessary - but the least the public deserve is an answer on what their actual position is. It\u2019s no wonder there was nothing to trail from the leader of the opposition\u2019s speech: she has nothing to say. While the Tories try and work out what they think, Labour is getting on with fixing the foundations and rebuilding the country. Simon Jack, business editor of the BBC, asked Kemi Badenoch about her claim that there was an alternative to the budget plans. (See 2.03pm.) If she did not agree with the taxes, what taxes would she raise instead? Or what services would she cut? Badenoch said she did not accept the premise of the question. She went on: We need to stop looking at everything as if it\u2019s just a ledger where there\u2019s taxes raised and services delivered. Not everything that government does is public services. We can do things better. We can redesign things. Badenoch suggested there was no need for government to set up a football regulator. Although this was just a \u201ctiny thing\u201d, it was an example of unnecessary, \u201cburdensome\u201d regulation. That is why I\u2019m not talking about which tax will tweak here or which service we\u2019re going to cut there. We need to completely change the way we talk about how our economy works. She said she wanted \u201cdeep, real [policy] reviews, asking the right questions, not just a policy tweak here or there\u201d. She went on: If we\u2019re going to rewire the state, we need to start from there and not just adjust little nods and levers on tax or insurance. Let\u2019s think about everything from first principles. During the Q&amp;A after her speech Kemi Badenoch would not commit to reversing the rise in employers\u2019 national insurance in the budget. Asked if she would give such a commitment, Badenoch said that, if a tax increase is not raising money, the Tories would reverse it. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re going to have to do is rewire everything,\u201d she said. But she said she would not \u201ccomment on every bit of micro-policy\u201d now. However, she did say the fact so many firms are complaining about the tax, and saying that it will make employing people on low wages unaffordable, meant that the government should \u201clook again\u201d at the plan. And that would be something the Tories would look at when they started work on their policy platform, she said. UPDATE: Badenoch said: Where we can see that a change that has been brought in in the budget ... will not raise any money, we will change that. What I\u2019m not going to do is comment on every bit of micro-policy. There will be different budgets, there will be new things that occur, the system may change. What I am starting with is principles, we believe that employer\u2019s national insurance, while necessary to help us fund public services, is a tax on jobs. The fact that so many organisations \u2013 especially those that have people who are on the lowest wages \u2013 are saying that this is becoming unaffordable means that we should look again, and that\u2019s one of the first things that we\u2019re going to be doing when we start our policy platform. Badenoch ended her speech by referring to reports that, when Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, speaks to the CBI later, she will say no one has offered a good alternative to the proposal in her budget. Badenoch said: They will tell you there is no alternative, there is. We need an alternative strategy so we can finally unleash the power of business to make our country better. I believe in the immense power of business to do good. You may not be the public sector. But many of you deliver critical services for the public. So I will stand up for the values of business. It\u2019s time to defend free enterprise and capitalism, to defend lower taxes, less borrowing and healthy, real competition. Badenoch said government could learn from business in adapting to change. Government itself must change, it must change what it does if growth is ever properly to return. We didn\u2019t address this when we were in government and if Labour does not they will fail. Government is going to have to learn from business about how to work better quicker and be more responsive. We can no longer tolerate a situation where building roads takes decades. Where Treasury decision making means railways don\u2019t get built. Where the planning system stops investments being made by you and your colleagues. Over the last two decades, you have all had to transform your business models to account for massive societal and technological change. It\u2019s time that government does the same because what we have now isn\u2019t working. Badenoch called for a rethink in the role of the state. We are trying to fix problems with the wrong tools. We are using a mindset and a paradigm that worked well in the late 20th century, but does not work well when we have aggressive competitor economies like China. And when there is rapid technological innovation, when our society is getting older and the birth rate is still too low, more quangos, more interference, more regulations, more laws will not fix that. We need to ask ourselves, \u2018What is the role of the state? What can we do to create a level playing field and allow you to go out and fix those problems?\u2019 Badenoch said she wanted politicians to cut back on regulation. Politics needs to accept boundaries. Every day in the legislature, someone has a great new idea that sounds nice in principle, but in practice, creates more red tape, more bureaucracy, more burden. The incentive for us as politicians is to keep announcing new nice things. But the way to fix things is not just about creating new laws. We must not be a bureaucratic state. We need to get a proper diagnosis of what is going wrong. Why is capital investment so low? Why is productivity still so stubbornly stalled? I have read endless reports and many reviews with all sorts of potential solutions improving skills or getting our pensions working harder for us, and we have brought in regulations and policies to address this. And yet, still, things are not getting better. I think we need to look again. So I\u2019m not standing here telling you that I have all the answers. I am letting you know that I have seen the system from the inside and it is broken. Badenoch also said she wanted to take a new approach to growth. We have got to be more precise when we talk about growth. It is not just about increased GDP. It is not even just about increased GDP per capita. You can increase GDP by increasing immigration, but no one feels richer. In fact, some gets poorer. You can increase GDP per capita by getting more millionaires and billionaires to move to your country, but that won\u2019t necessarily make everyone else better off. In fact, there are many studies that show even when nothing has changed, we are more likely to feel worse when we compare ourselves with those who are a lot wealthier than us. I am talking about real growth, growth that people can see, growth that people can feel, seeing an improved environment around them, as well as having more money in their pockets to spend, knowing that we have enough money to provide security, to protect our families, but also to protect our country in increasingly dangerous times \u2026 The bottom line is that economic growth is not the end in itself. It is a means to an end. The end is to make people\u2019s lives better. Badenoch says, as leader of the opposition, she wants to start by setting out principles, not policies. So what are our principles? I believe that we need to have free and fair competition, not monopolies, not rent seeking, not corporatism, but in genuine competition that allows new entrants in and those who are no longer productive to evolve or leave the economy. That is what free enterprise is about. We Conservatives must be the party of business, not just big business, not just corporates, but small business, too. Every big business started out as a small business, and that is why I am so concerned that the burden on them is still increasing with taxes, corporation tax, employers\u2019 national insurance and new regulations \u2026 So I am here to show you that I understand businesses values. I am not here to represent business interests. That\u2019s your job. I\u2019m here to let you know the Conservative party shares your values. I\u2019m often criticised for talking about capitalism. Someone once told me that capitalism is old fashioned. I don\u2019t think so. I think it is important that we explain what capitalism in a free market environment means. Capitalism is not a dirty word, wealth is not a dirty word, profit is not a dirty word. But we need to start explaining how these things deliver for the people out there people who often think that you are in it for yourselves. Badenoch says she has given the most important economic jobs in her team to people with business experience \u2013 Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, and Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary. Kemi Badenoch starts by asking how you can tell if a politician will do what they say they will do. She goes on: If you really want to know what someone is going to be like, look at what they did when they had the chance. And speaking to all of you today, not just as leader of the Conservative party, but as a former business secretary, many of you would have heard me talk about how we needed to deregulate, and you would have seen examples of how I tried to lift the burden on businesses. Badenoch says, as a minister, she opposed \u201cwell-meaning but burdensome regulation\u201d. She says people often want the government to solve everything. But often government just needs to get out of the way, she says. This is a very difficult argument to make. People want the government to fix everything. They want the government to solve everything, and if you ever sound hesitant, then they will make you out to be a cruel, unfeeling person, as I have discovered, to my own personal cost. And this is partly how we have got ourselves into a state where debt is at record levels, and we are spending more on debt servicing than we are on health or on education or on defence. That needs to change. Kemi Badenoch will soon be giving her first speech to a CBI conference as Conservative leader. There is a live feed here. At 3.30pm a Foreign Office minister will respond to an urgent question tabled by Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, about the international criminal court\u2019s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Benjamain Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, for alleged war crimes in Gaza. In an open letter to Keir Starmer about this yesterday, Patel said: The White House has \u2018fundamentally rejected\u2019 the ICC\u2019s decision. Not least because this decision will do nothing to help secure the release hostages, get more aid into Gaza or deliver a sustainable end to the conflict. But, by contrast, the UK government\u2019s response to the decision has been nonsensical. On Friday, the home secretary refused to say whether Mr Netanyahu would be detained if he travelled to the UK. This opens the farcical spectre of your government trying to sanction the arrest on UK soil of the leader of an ally of the UK, while you continue a diplomatic charm offensive with the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping. It falls to you to clarify the government\u2019s position - now. The Government must make clear that it does not support an arrest warrant being issued which has no proper basis in international law. If the ICC is to regain any legitimacy, it must act within legal norms and correct this failure of leadership. The UK should lead the diplomatic pressure to bring about this urgent change. After the UQ there will be a statement from Steve Reed, the environment secretary, on Storm Bert. In a message yesterday on X, the social media platform that he owns, as well as promoting the petition calling for a UK election, the Trump ally and multi-billionaire businessman Elon Musk described Britain as \u201ca tyrannical police state\u201d. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, asked if Keir Starmer agreed with this, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said he would not be drawn on individual comments. But he stressed Starmer\u2019s commitment to law and order. Downing Street has defended Keir Starmer\u2019s decision this morning to promote plans to make spiking a criminal offence (see 11.16am) \u2013 even thought it is already illegal. Although No 10 said in its news release that spiking will become \u201ca new criminal offence\u201d, not that it will become an offence for the first time, people following the news casually could be lulled into thinking the government is banning something that is currently legal. Starmer himself implied this earlier today when he posted this on social media. Spiking will be made a criminal offence. My government was elected to take back our streets, central to this mission is making sure women and girls can feel safe at night. Perpetrators of spiking will feel the full force of the law. Asked if this was misleading, the PM\u2019s spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing this morning that the government was creating a new offence to \u201csend a very clear signal\u201d that offenders should expect punishment. He went on: This new legislation will also empower victims to report offences and give them confidence that the justice system will support them. When it was put to him that Starmer\u2019s tweet implied spiking was not already illegal, the spokesperson said the PM was referring to a new offence being created. The spiking law is a good example of what the Economist\u2019s Bagehot column described earlier this year as the \u201cban it harder\u201d trend in British politics. \u201cWhen it comes to tackling an injustice that is already against the law, the answer can be simple: ban it harder,\u201d Bagehot wrote. On the subject of spiking in particular, the column said: Spiking, in which a victim\u2019s drink is drugged in order to rob or assault them, is a terrifying crime. It was already prosecutable under seven separate offences before the Home Office proposed legal amendments in December 2023 to show \u201cwithout any doubt, spiking is illegal\u201d. But the reason why prosecutions are rare, and the true scale of spiking hard to define, is because hospitals do not routinely test for drugs in emergency wards. A new offence is unlikely to change that. The Foreign Office has announced a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of oil tankers which it is using to try to evade international restricitons on its oil importants. In a news release, the Foreign Office said: Thirty ships in Russia\u2019s shadow fleet, responsible for transporting billions of pounds worth of oil and oil products in the last year alone, have today been sanctioned by the UK. With half of the ships targeted today transporting more than $4.3bn worth of oil and oil products like gasoline in the last year alone, today is the largest UK package of its kind. The move will further constrain the Kremlin\u2019s ability to fund their illegal war in Ukraine and their malign activity worldwide, and brings the total number of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK to 73, more than any other nation - demonstrating the UK\u2019s leadership on tackling the shadow fleet. This is what Keir Starmer told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain when asked about the online petition signed by 2 million people calling for an election on the grounds that \u201cthe current Labour government have gone back on the promises they laid out in the lead up to the last election\u201d. Starmer said: Look, I remind myself that very many people didn\u2019t vote Labour at the last election. I\u2019m not surprised that many of them want a rerun. That isn\u2019t how our system works. There will be plenty of people who didn\u2019t want us in in the first place. So, what my focus is on is the decisions that I have to make every day. Calling for a general election now when we had one less than six months ago and when the government has a working majority of 163 is clearly bonkers. But the petition is attracting signatures because it is being strongly promoted by high-profile rightwinger provocateurs like the X owner Elon Musk and the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Starmer agrees that shoplifting is a terrible problem. And he says he will come back on the programme in the future to discuss how well he is doing this. Q: The last time you were on this programme you said you would get your children a dog when you moved into No 10. Starmer says he was in negotiations on that. But they have got a cat, he says, called Prince. But Prince has not yet met Larry, the Downing Street cat, he says (implying Prince does not leave the family flat). He says he is worried that Larry would win in a fight. They end talking about Christmas, and cooking. Starmer says he does a lot of cooking, and that the dish his children like most is a pasta bake, with layers of sauce, with different cheeses. He likes to cook on a Saturday, he says. He says he is particularly proud of his tandoori salmon and tandoori Quorn. Q: Are you feeling the pressure? There is a petition signed by 2 million people calling for another election. Starmer says he is not surprised that people who did not support Labour in the first place want the election to be re-run. But that is not how the system worked. Q: Your approval rating is lower than Nigel Farage\u2019s. That must be disappointing. Starmer says, if you take the difficult decisions first, it is inevitable some people won\u2019t be happy. I\u2019m not surprised, quite frankly, that as we\u2019re doing the tough stuff, there are plenty of people who say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m impacted.\u2019 Q: Is it harder than you expected? Starmer says he always knew this would be difficult. But he came into politics to take difficult decisions, he says. He says there are 7 million people on waiting lists. He wants to bring them down. Asked what his experience of government has been like, Starmer says he is taking the hard decisions first. I think anybody who\u2019s turned around an organisation or a business will tell you, and they\u2019re right, if you\u2019re really going to turn something around, you have to do the hard yards upfront. Don\u2019t look at a tough decision and then leave it for a year or two. So we\u2019re doing the tough stuff. But in the budget, which is probably the toughest, I\u2019m really pleased that we were able to put so much money into the National Health Service \u2026 Anybody watching this who uses the NHS will know we absolutely had to make that a priority. Starmer says halving violence against women and girls is one of the missions of his government. It will be hard, but he is determined to do it, he says. He urges people to text messages to British Transport Police on the 61016 number if they see a woman being harassed on a train. Q: Shouldn\u2019t there be more police officers on the trains? Starmer says he cannot say every text sent to that message will prompt a response. But sometimes it has led to offenders being arrested getting off a train. Keir Starmer is being interviews on ITV\u2019s This Morning. He is being asked about his plans to tackle spiking. He says he first announced he would make it a specific criminal offence in an interview on this programme 18 months ago. He says he is pleased to be back to say this is actually happening. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief executive, has given the government credit for \u201cdrawing the curtain on a near decade of instability at home\u201d. But, in line with the advance briefing, she also used her speech to the CBI conference this morning to argue that the tax rises in the budget will harm business. She said: What really defines growth is the decisions made in boardrooms up and down the country. It\u2019s CFOs [chief financial officers] asking, \u2018can we afford to invest? Can we afford to expand? Can we afford to take a chance on new people?\u2019 Well after the budget, the answer we\u2019re hearing from so many firms is still \u2018not yet\u2019. The rise in national insurance, the stark lowering of the threshold, caught us all off guard. Along with the expansion and the rise of the national living wage \u2013 which everyone wants to accommodate \u2013 and the potential cost of the employment rights bill, they put a heavy burden on business. She also said that tax rises like this should never be imposed on business by surprise again. From now on, we need to shift from consultation to co-design. Tax rises like this must never again be simply done to business. That\u2019s the road to unintended consequences. Instead, we need an elevated partnership for a higher purpose. There is more coverage of her speech on our business live blog. In her interview on the Today programme this morning Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, was asked about a call from UN Women UK for bystanders to be more proactive in intervening to protect women being harassed or threatened in public spaces. Asked if she she would advise people to intervene, Phillips replied: Yes, I would, but I would say always do it safely. If you say something in the street that\u2019s really worrying you, you should ring 999. But what I would say is that you can definitely ask if somebody is all right in the street. There\u2019s no active aggression in that. Phillips also said she was speaking from a club where staff were trained to intervene in this sort of way if they say men bothering women on the dance floor. She said there was nothing offensive about asking a woman if she was OK. MPs will have a free vote on assisted dying, the government is neutral, and that means cabinet ministers are on different sides of the argument. But when asked about this on LBC this morning, Jess Phillips, the Home Office minister, denied suggestions that this was causing acrimony. She said: I actually don\u2019t sense a degree of tension. Those who have now become famous for their opposition to it, the likes of Wes Streeting, for example, I literally just text him and said, \u2018Are we going for dinner this week?\u2019, so even though me and him feel differently about this issue, it is a matter of conscience. The i has splashed today on the cabinet splits over assisted dying. It says 14 cabinet ministers support the bill, but eight are opposed. More than 20 police forces in England and Wales are sending plainclothes officers into bars to look out for predatory sexual behaviour, Keir Starmer is being told at the meeting in Downing Street he is hosting on spiking this morning. In a statement released in advance, assistant chief constable Samantha Millar, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council violence against women and girls strategic programme director, said: Spiking is a complex offence to investigate as drugs can pass through the system quickly and there is often a lack of evidential opportunities, which is why quick reporting and early evidence gathering, including forensic testing, is key. Police forces across the country have been working proactively to stop spiking from happening in the night-time economy and improve feelings of safety for women and girls. This includes regular, targeted patrols of busy town centres and visiting organisations, such as universities, to raise awareness of the symptoms of spiking. Forces also work closely with bars, pubs and clubs to tackle spiking, and during the first national spiking police week of action in March, forces collectively visited over 1900 licensed venues to ensure that staff understood how to support victims. To coincide with the meeting, the British Transport Police says it is relaunching text-to-report number, 61016, which \u201cis now free across all major networks, allowing women to discreetly contact British Transport Police for help if they are or someone else is being harassed on the train\u201d. Russia and other adversaries of the UK are trying to use artificial intelligence to enhance cyber-attacks against the nation\u2019s infrastructure, Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, will warn at a Nato conference in London later today. Dan Sabbagh has the story. Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, are both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is warning about the impact of the budget on business. Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about plans to protect women from spiking. \u201cMy government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,\u201d he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said: We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn\u2019t call it for you at the moment \u2026 Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn\u2019t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I\u2019ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament. Phillips is not the only person finding the vote hard to call. Eleanor Langford from the i has been keeping a tally of how MPs intend to vote and last night she published her figures on social media. Since the assisted dying bill was announced, I\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on MP views I\u2019ve found 207 supportive and 141 opposed... but there are still 291 we don\u2019t know about (N.B. Can\u2019t share full spreadsheet due to anon declarations. Total excludes Sinn Fein and Speakers.) I should underline that these figures are *not* a prediction of the vote, but an interesting look at the direction MPs are leaning With 291 MPs not stating a view at the time of writing, the vote very easily could go either way We\u2019ll know the actual result on Friday afternoon According to Janet Eastham\u2019s story in the Daily Telegraph today, supporters of the bill think it will pass \u2013 provided MPs who have said they support it are willing to vote for it. A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: \u201cIf all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.\u201d When MPs last voted on assisted dying, in 2015, the bill was easily defeated by 330 votes to 118. After the election many people assumed that the Labour landslide, and the drastic change in the composition of parliament, meant that there is now a majority for assisted dying. But in recent weeks there have been indications that opponents of the bill are gaining ground, in part because Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary (the two cabinet ministers who would have most responsibility for implementing assisted dying) have come out against it forcefully. In interviews this morning Phillips said she would be voting for assisted dying, as she did in 2015. She also rejected the suggestion that Mahmood\u2019s criticism of the bill could be disregarded because it was motivated by religion (something Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, suggested yesterday). Asked if it was wrong for Mahmood to impose her faith on others, Phillips said: She will make the decision about how she votes on assisted dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well \u2026 I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP. Here is the agenda for the day.

      "body": "<p>Ministers should give farmers an inheritance tax holiday for the next few years, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said as it warned that government changes to agricultural taxes risked treating some landowners unfairly.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced in her budget last month that farmers with a business worth more than \u00a31m could be subjected to 20% inheritance tax, prompting a tractor protest outside parliament.</p> <p>The government had previously promised no changes would be made to agricultural property relief, which granted farmers an exemption from inheritance tax.</p> <p>A new analysis by the IFS economic thinktank concluded that it was largely fair to treat agricultural assets such as land the same as other assets that were subjected to inheritance tax.</p> <p>But it said mitigations could be required to protect food security and prevent elderly farmers being caught out by the change.</p> <p>David Sturrock, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: \u201cCurrent farm owners passing away in the next seven years (but after the new regime comes into force in April 2026) will not have had the opportunity to avoid inheritance tax by making lifetime gifts.</p> <p>\u201cIf the government wished to give current farm owners the same opportunity to avoid inheritance tax as owners of other assets, it could, for example, make lifetime gifts of agricultural property made before a certain future date inheritance tax free, regardless of the timing of the death.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/21/farmers-aged-80-could-get-exemption-inheritance-tax-rule\">revealed last week </a>that Treasury officials were assessing mitigations to the policy including amending gifting rules for over-80s so they could pass on their farm to their family without having to live for seven years after making the gift.</p> <p>Keir Starmer and the environment secretary, Steve Reed, had previously referred to comments made by the IFS\u2019s director, Paul Johnson, to defend not making changes to the policy. Reeves is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/22/reeves-standing-firm-against-u-turn-on-inheritance-tax-for-farmers\">understood to be holding firm </a>and does not want to consider any changes.</p> <p>Labour has tried to target the policy at wealthy investors buying land to avoid inheritance tax, who have been blamed for driving up land prices.</p> <p>However, many farmers complain that while they may be asset rich, they are cash poor because farm incomes have plummeted owing to cost inflation, poor harvests and fierce competition among retailers.

He has suggested equalising the inheritance tax to 40% but making it payable only when the land is sold, avoiding any impact on those who want to pass the family farm down to relatives.</p> <p>Neidle suggested \u201ca clawback of all inheritance tax relief for a farm if those inheriting farmland sell it within a certain time. In other words, upon a sale, all the [inheritance tax] that was previously exempt suddenly reappears and becomes charged.\u201d</p> <p>He also proposed the Treasury should raise the inheritance tax cap to about \u00a320m so only the \u201clargest and most sophisticated farm businesses become subject to [it]\u201d.</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, said: \u201cThe government hid behind the IFS to try and justify this disastrous policy. That very same organisation is now telling them that their own proposals need an overhaul.\u201d</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cAs the IFS has said the existing rules for these reliefs are unfair and inefficient. We remain committed to fully implementing the policy and are not considering mitigations.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers should give farmers an inheritance tax holiday for the next few years, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said as it warned that government changes to agricultural taxes risked treating some landowners unfairly. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, announced in her budget last month that farmers with a business worth more than \u00a31m could be subjected to 20% inheritance tax, prompting a tractor protest outside parliament. The government had previously promised no changes would be made to agricultural property relief, which granted farmers an exemption from inheritance tax. A new analysis by the IFS economic thinktank concluded that it was largely fair to treat agricultural assets such as land the same as other assets that were subjected to inheritance tax. But it said mitigations could be required to protect food security and prevent elderly farmers being caught out by the change. David Sturrock, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: \u201cCurrent farm owners passing away in the next seven years (but after the new regime comes into force in April 2026) will not have had the opportunity to avoid inheritance tax by making lifetime gifts. \u201cIf the government wished to give current farm owners the same opportunity to avoid inheritance tax as owners of other assets, it could, for example, make lifetime gifts of agricultural property made before a certain future date inheritance tax free, regardless of the timing of the death.\u201d The Guardian revealed last week that Treasury officials were assessing mitigations to the policy including amending gifting rules for over-80s so they could pass on their farm to their family without having to live for seven years after making the gift. Keir Starmer and the environment secretary, Steve Reed, had previously referred to comments made by the IFS\u2019s director, Paul Johnson, to defend not making changes to the policy. Reeves is understood to be holding firm and does not want to consider any changes. Labour has tried to target the policy at wealthy investors buying land to avoid inheritance tax, who have been blamed for driving up land prices. However, many farmers complain that while they may be asset rich, they are cash poor because farm incomes have plummeted owing to cost inflation, poor harvests and fierce competition among retailers. They say many farmers take home less than the minimum wage. Another tax expert, Dan Neidle, has produced research that finds the tax hits working farmers harder than tax avoiders. He has suggested equalising the inheritance tax to 40% but making it payable only when the land is sold, avoiding any impact on those who want to pass the family farm down to relatives. Neidle suggested \u201ca clawback of all inheritance tax relief for a farm if those inheriting farmland sell it within a certain time. In other words, upon a sale, all the [inheritance tax] that was previously exempt suddenly reappears and becomes charged.\u201d He also proposed the Treasury should raise the inheritance tax cap to about \u00a320m so only the \u201clargest and most sophisticated farm businesses become subject to [it]\u201d. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, said: \u201cThe government hid behind the IFS to try and justify this disastrous policy. That very same organisation is now telling them that their own proposals need an overhaul.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cAs the IFS has said the existing rules for these reliefs are unfair and inefficient. We remain committed to fully implementing the policy and are not considering mitigations.\u201d",

While not explicitly cited by Bishop, last year Musk threatened to sue a group of researchers for the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate, whose work revealed that since Musk bought the site now known as X there has been an increase in hate speech on the platform. Musk was elected a fellow in 2018 in recognition of his work and impact in the space and electric vehicle industries. However, in August the Guardian revealed a number of fellows had written to the Royal Society expressing concern over the tech billionaire\u2019s comments regarding unrest in the UK, and raising the possibility of removing his fellowship. The same month, Downing Street criticised comments by the X owner saying \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d posted below a video of violent riots in Liverpool.

The international talks in Baku were pulled back from the brink of collapse early on Sunday morning when negotiators struck an agreement in which rich countries promised to raise $300bn a year by 2035. On paper, this is a tripling of the previous climate finance target of $100bn a year by 2020, and has been trumpeted as such by the UN and others. But the text makes no mention of inflation, missing an important recommendation from leading economists upon which the target is loosely based. It means the world\u2019s poorest countries will receive a sum they already consider inadequate for their needs, but that it will in effect be billions of dollars lower still as the money will lose its value over time, according to Guardian analysis. Money pledged today is likely to have lost about 20% of its value by 2035, assuming the average US inflation rate of the past 15 years (2.38%) continues into the future, according to Guardian calculations.

The farmers furore shows why that\u2019s so hard to achieve, 20 November</a>) makes many good points \u2013 but I think a key issue he missed is the perception of fairness. Junior doctors were incensed by the fact that their pay relative to others had stagnated. They work as hard as anyone and this erosion of their pay was generally felt to be unfair, so their industrial action attracted widespread public support. Farmers equally feel unfairly singled out over inheritance tax, especially when, in the same week, Rachel Reeves eased the rules on bankers\u2019 bonuses. </p> <p>Nobody likes paying tax, but most reasonable people can see that it is necessary to fund public services. The way to sell taxes to the public is by developing a fairer tax system and being honest about the implications of any changes. If&nbsp;sliding scales were used (ie&nbsp;gradual increases) instead of tax bands, I think it would help.

The hard reality of Covid broke all three legs of the stool. And now with the winter allowance and farm inheritance tax, the government is struggling to get the right balance. Both have legitimate goals, but neither appears fully thought through, particularly on thresholds. As Behr underlines, both suffer from a wider issue \u2013 people aren\u2019t convinced of the link between means (higher taxes) and ends (making infrastructure fit for purpose).

      "bodyText": "Rafael Behr (Labour wants tax rises to fall on the \u2018broadest shoulders\u2019. The farmers furore shows why that\u2019s so hard to achieve, 20 November) makes many good points \u2013 but I think a key issue he missed is the perception of fairness. Junior doctors were incensed by the fact that their pay relative to others had stagnated. They work as hard as anyone and this erosion of their pay was generally felt to be unfair, so their industrial action attracted widespread public support. Farmers equally feel unfairly singled out over inheritance tax, especially when, in the same week, Rachel Reeves eased the rules on bankers\u2019 bonuses. Nobody likes paying tax, but most reasonable people can see that it is necessary to fund public services. The way to sell taxes to the public is by developing a fairer tax system and being honest about the implications of any changes. If sliding scales were used (ie gradual increases) instead of tax bands, I think it would help. This should apply to income tax, inheritance tax and council tax. John Harradence Colwall Green, Herefordshire \u2022 Rafael Behr\u2019s column is a reminder that good government depends on aligning three elements: policy, communications and reality. It\u2019s a knack we seem to have lost. Brexit was an example of a skilful communications campaign that hasn\u2019t delivered in reality because the policy wasn\u2019t thought through. The hard reality of Covid broke all three legs of the stool. And now with the winter allowance and farm inheritance tax, the government is struggling to get the right balance. Both have legitimate goals, but neither appears fully thought through, particularly on thresholds. As Behr underlines, both suffer from a wider issue \u2013 people aren\u2019t convinced of the link between means (higher taxes) and ends (making infrastructure fit for purpose). Establishing that link can\u2019t come soon enough. Tom Kelly Prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson, 2001-07 \u2022 Rafael Behr says it is \u201chard to sell taxes to people\u201d, and it is made even more difficult when the rightwing press and politicians use words like \u201cgrab\u201d and \u201craid\u201d to describe taxation, as though there were something nefarious about it. How else do they expect healthcare, pensions, schools and other public services are to be paid for? Ian Arnott Peterborough \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

No autumn fixtures in 2023 and fewer Six Nations matches meant \u00a325.4m less from ticket sales, \u00a322m less received for catering and hospitality, and a \u00a36.4m drop in broadcast revenues. The outgoing chief financial officer, Sue Day, points to a healthy reserve but states that is driven largely by the windfall from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/mar/16/cvcs-365m-backing-for-rugby-union-may-be-less-sexy-than-it-sounds\">CVC via their investment into the Six Nations</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBoth the organisation itself and the entire rugby system in this country have, over the last few years, been through some challenging financial times and we have all worked hard to steer a course through those challenges,\u201d Day writes. \u201cThere remains, of course, much to do but it is also important to emphasise that we are now in a strong and resilient financial position as a result of that work.\u201d</p>",

Sweeney said: \u201cThe RFU has planned well for this year, the fourth year in our business planning cycle, which is always loss-making due to increased costs associated with going to the Rugby World Cup and as a result of hosting fewer games at Allianz Stadium. \u201cEmerging from post-Covid challenges, which saw significant lost revenues, substantial increases in costs and inflation, and a drop in player participation, we are now entering into a period of significant transformation with a great deal to be positive about. \u201cWhile the Autumn Nations Series\u2019 results have been disappointing, we are encouraged by the pipeline of talented young players coming through and the outstanding England win in the World Rugby U20 Championship final against France, taking the title for the first time in eight years.\u201d The RFU has announced an operating loss of \u00a337.9m \u2013 after a \u00a34m profit the previous year \u2013 with a \u00a353.8m decline in year\u2011on\u2011year revenue. Taking into account taxation and adjusting for minority interests, the loss to reserves was \u00a342m. No autumn fixtures in 2023 and fewer Six Nations matches meant \u00a325.4m less from ticket sales, \u00a322m less received for catering and hospitality, and a \u00a36.4m drop in broadcast revenues. The outgoing chief financial officer, Sue Day, points to a healthy reserve but states that is driven largely by the windfall from CVC via their investment into the Six Nations. \u201cBoth the organisation itself and the entire rugby system in this country have, over the last few years, been through some challenging financial times and we have all worked hard to steer a course through those challenges,\u201d Day writes. \u201cThere remains, of course, much to do but it is also important to emphasise that we are now in a strong and resilient financial position as a result of that work.\u201d",

In the mid-twentieth century, a generation of outstanding mathematicians and physicists from Hungary were humorously called Martians, as their intelligence was from another planet. Here are the puzzles again with solutions. 1. Curb your enthusiasm (Ages 13/14) On an island, every resident is either half-hearted or enthusiastic. A visitor from a distant land was invited for dinner by a group of 10 residents. After dinner, the visitor asked all 10 members of the group about the number of enthusiastic inhabitants within their group. She received the following answers: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Knowing that the answers of the half-hearted individuals cannot be more than the actual answer, and the answers of the enthusiastic individuals cannot be less than the actual number, determine the number of enthusiastic inhabitants within the group. Solution 6 Line the inhabitants in a row according to their answers: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. The first thing to note is that no half hearted person can be to the right of an enthusiastic person, so the half-hearteds are on the left. Let\u2019s say there are exactly 3 enthusiastic people. If this were so, the person who said \u20184\u2019 must be enthusiastic, as must everyone to their right, totalling 9 enthusiastic people. Contradiction! So we can eliminate the solution being exactly 3 enthusiastic inhabitants. Let\u2019s say there are exactly 4 enthusiastic inhabitants. Again this leads to contradiction because it would mean there are at least 8 enthusiastic inhabitants. (The people to the right of the person who said \u20184\u2019) Likewise, it is impossible for there to be 5 enthusiastic inhabitants, as this implies at least 7 enthusiastic inhabitants. If there are 6 enthusiastic people, there are no contradictions. But if there are 7 or more enthusiastic people, then it is impossible, since it would mean that some of these enthusiastic people are giving answers of less than 7, so this is impossible. Thus there are 6 enthusiastic people. 2. Edgy logo (Ages 11/12) The task here is to design a 2D logo using only equilateral triangles and squares, each with a side length of 1 cm. The triangles and squares must be glued together along their entire sides without any overlap. Make a logo with a perimeter of 13 cm from the following shapes or prove it is impossible: a) A single triangle and some squares b) The same number of squares and triangles. c) Only triangles. d) Only squares. Solution a) b) c) d) It\u2019s impossible. When you make an object with only squares, all perimeter values are even, since every edge must have a corresponding edge on the other side of the shape, as in a and b here. 3. Axehead tiles (Ages 15/16) The edges of these identical tiles are quarter circles, and their centres are the points marked. Determine the area of a tile, measured in cm2, given that the height of a standing tile is 12cm. Solution 72 The top of a standing tile is a quarter circle, the centre of which is the centre of the tile, therefore the radius of the quarter circle is 6cm, and the corners of the tile are also 6 cm from the centre of the tile. We can dissect the tile by removing the circle segments at the top and the bottom and placing them at the empty places on the left and right sides of the tile. We get a square with a diagonal of 12 cm. If the side length of the square is s, by Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem we have: s2 + s2 = 122. Thus s2 = 72 = the area of the square = the area of the tile.

deflationary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Donald Trump imposing massive tariffs on China could drive down global goods price, leading to lower inflation elsewhere around the world including in Britain, a senior Bank of England policymaker has said.</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Swati</strong> <strong>Dhingra</strong>, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said a second Trump presidency imposing a 60% tariff on Chinese goods sold in the US could lead Chinese exporters to cut their prices to ensure they maintained current trade volumes. </p> \n  <p><strong>Dhingra</strong> said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIt takes a massive amount of demand out of the world market. The way exporters, say in China, would respond to that would be to respond with prices, world prices, as they don\u2019t want to lose market share.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Speaking at a conference in London on Monday, she said there was uncertainty about what policy the president-elect would carry through from his campaign. Trump had warned before the election earlier this month that he would slap tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods and up to 20% on other US trade partners. </p> \n  <p>A leading expert in global trade, Dhingra said a tariff of up to 60% would have a disinflationary impact for the world economy. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf there is the kind of big 60% type of tariff increase that\u2019s been proposed, that will have repercussions on to world price and mostly on the downward direction,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>However, if there was a broader \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d trade war where other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US \u201cthen we\u2019re in a completely different situation\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Drawing a comparison with Brexit, <strong>Dhingra</strong> said Britain leaving the EU had \u201cpermanently\u201d raised the price of products in the UK for households. This had a short-term inflation impact, but this had faded as prices stabilised at a higher plateau. </p> \n  <p>She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cWe saw much higher

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Newsflash: Barclays has been fined \u00a340m by City regulators over allegedly secret payments it made to Qatari investors during the financial crisis 16 years ago.</strong></p> \n  <p>The <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> has announced it has fined Barclays \u00a340m \u201cfor its failure to disclose certain arrangements with Qatari entities in 2008\u201d, which the regulator says was \u201creckless and lacked integrity\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The fine relates to the \u00a3322m the bank paid to Qatar in 2008, allegedly in exchange for the gas-rich Gulf state investing \u00a34bn in Barclays, helping save the lender from a UK government bailout.</p> \n  <p>The fees were seen by critics as a way for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/qatar\">Qatar</a> to effectively purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price that was not offered to other investors, when the City was reeling from the financial crisis.</p> \n  <p>The <strong>FCA</strong> had provisionally proposed fining <strong>Barclays</strong> \u00a350m \u2013 which the bank was appealing against.</p> \n  <p>That case had been due to be heard in the Upper Tribunal today, but the FCA says <strong>Barclays</strong> has now withdrawn its referral.</p> \n  <p><strong>Steve Smart,</strong> joint executive director of

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up. Stocks on Wall Street have hit record levels, as investors welcome the choice of Scott Bessent as the next US Treasury secretary. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 share index touched new peaks, while the dollar has weakened and bond price haves jumped. Investors are hopeful that Bessent would take a gradual approach to the introduction of new trade tariffs, and reduce the US budget deficit. These hopes have pushed down the dollar, giving a lift to the pound and the euro \u2013 which would both suffer from a new translatlantic trade war: Swati Dhingra, an external member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, has suggested that inflation could fall if Donald Trump imposes massive US tariffs on Chinese imports. In the UK, chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended her budget against criticism, telling the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s annual conference that she hasn\u2019t heard alternative suggestions for how she could have got a grip on the public finances. Reeves also promised that she doesn\u2019t plan to deliver another budget like last month\u2019s, which hit businesses with a jump in taxes. However, the chair of the CBI has accused the UK government of treating employers as a \u201ccash cow\u201d in last month\u2019s budget, and urged ministers to water down plans for workers\u2019 rights. Barclays has been fined \u00a340m by the City regulator, over its 2008 rescue financing from Qatar. The B&amp;Q owner, Kingfisher, has said uncertainty around the UK government\u2019s budget hit consumer spending, and it will pay an extra \u00a331m in taxes after Rachel Reeves\u2019s rise in national insurance. Thousands of Amazon workers are expected to protest or strike in more than 20 countries during Black Friday to press for better workers\u2019 rights and climate action from the US retailer. Q: Will you rethink any of the measures in the budget? Rachel Reeves says she is determined to be the chancellor that puts the public finances on a firm footing. Sounding like a lady not for turning, the chancellor insists: We\u2019ve made our decisions. I\u2019ve had lots of feedback on the budget, but what I haven\u2019t heard is any credible alternative to what I did. Q: Why are you targeting firms who employ a large number of people [by raising employment taxes]? Rachel Reeves insists she is \u201cnot immune to the challenges that businesses face\u201d. She adds that smaller businesses are protected from the increase in national insurance rates, by the doubling of the employment allowance. That means many small businesses would pay either less or the same in NICs, she says. Rachel Reeves is now taking questions from the media. Q: Hasn\u2019t Labour betrayed businesses through your budget, and can you confirm there will be no more tax rises for businesses? Reeves says businesses and families paid the price when the previous government lost control of the public finances. She repeats her earlier point that the public finances are now on a firm footing, and that public services must now \u201clive within their means\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll never have to do a budget like that again,\u201d Rachel Reeves tells the CBI\u2019s annual conference. She also compares the public sector to the way private firms were ran a decade ago, adding that the government has \u201ca lot to learn.\u201d. Q: Some businesses will feel some of the measures in your budget will not help growth\u2026 Rachel Reeves insists she didn\u2019t have other options to deal with the \u201chuge black hole\u201d in the public finances, ciiting how borrowing is running higher than official forecasts. Rachel Reeves then tells the CBI that she\u2019s heard a lot of feedback about the budget, but not many suggestions for alternative measures: The chancellor says, firmly: What I haven\u2019t heard are many alternatives. We had to put the public finances on a firm footing, to bring stability back to the economy. Reeves adds that she has met her promise to address the public finances, and create a \u201cbedrock\u201d of stability that can be built on. This confirms the Guardian\u2019s story from this morning: Chancellor Rachel Reeves is now speaking at the CBI\u2019s conference. She talks through the government\u2019s efforts to grow the economy, such as reforming the planning system, ending the effective ban on offshore wind, and a review of the pensions sector. She then touches on the \u201cpretty dire\u201d inheritance she encountered at the Treasury, which led to the \u201cdifficult\u201d decisions in the budget. Reeves says: If I hadn\u2019t made those difficult decisions, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to bring the stability back to the economy that is desperately needed. She compared her job to a new CEO or CCFO taking control of a company, and finding that \u201cquite drastic\u201d action was needed to put it back on a firm footing. That, Reeves insists, is what she did in last month\u2019s budget, pledging that she won\u2019t need to come back for more. The rally in US government bonds is gathering pace. With price rising, the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Treasury bills has dropped by 11 basis points, from 4.41% to 4.3%. That\u2019s a two-week low. Falling yields indicates that investors are less nervous about an inflationary surge under the Trump presidency, with Scott Bessent at the controls at the Treasury. It also reflects the drop in the oil price today, which would ease inflationary pressures. The chair of the Confederation of British Industry, Rupert Soames, has accused the UK government of treating employers as a \u201ccash cow\u201d in last month\u2019s budget, and urged ministers to water down plans for workers\u2019 rights. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough on business. In the budget, business has been the cash cow and it\u2019s been milked. Don\u2019t go and whack it,\u201d Soames said at the CBI\u2019s annual conference in Westminster. He suggested businesses might be prepared to forgive Reeves\u2019s \u00a325bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs), if other policies are tweaked, saying: \u201cI think they need to see this in the round. And if we can come to a position where business can say, \u2018Well OK, the budget was a bit shit but we can live with the rest\u2019, then there\u2019s probably a landing ground we can get to, where the government can retain the confidence of business.\u201d More here: The boss of BP has said he is looking forward to the Donald Trump presidency, saying the Republican leader will help accelerate permitting time for energy projects. Murray Auchincloss told the Energy Intelligence Forum conference in London today: \u201cWe look forward to the Trump presidency. We think it\u2019s a strong chance to help the U.S. get back to putting construction forward, getting regulatory reform in place, and getting faster permitting and really allowing construction to move forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019re most hopeful for, because the US has been struggling in that space. Small US company stocks are also rallying. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller firms across America, has jumped 2% to a record high today. Twenty six of the 30 large US companies who make up the Dow Jones industrial average have risen in the first hour of trading. Unitedhealth Group are the top riser, up 2.8%, followed by DIY chain Home Depot which has gained 2.1% and construction equipment maker Caterpillar which is up 2%. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, suggests we shouldn\u2019t get too carried away with exactly who Donald Trump appoints. Ashworth tells clients today: Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding what policies president-elect Donald Trump will enact during his second term, there is a temptation to read a lot into his Cabinet nominations, but we would caution against that. Following his comprehensive election victory this is Trump\u2019s world, while the rest of us, including his cabinet, just live in it. We still expect Trump to move relatively quickly next year to impose tariffs and immigration curbs. We don\u2019t expect any major fiscal stimulus. We do expect the coming fiscal cliff to be avoided, with an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, but any tax cuts above and beyond that will be largely offset by spending cuts. US department store chain Macy\u2019s has given investors a nasty shock. Macy\u2019s has delayed its Q3 earnings release, which was due tomorrow, as it conducts an internal investigation into an employee who it says hid hundred of millions of dollars of expenses. Macy\u2019s says that a single employee with responsibility for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made erroneous accounting accrual entries to hide approximately $132 to $154 million of cumulative delivery expenses. This took place from the fourth quarter of 2021 until the quarter ending on 2 November this year. Macy\u2019s adds: The individual who engaged in this conduct is no longer employed by the company. The investigation has not identified involvement by any other employee. Macy\u2019s has also reported a 2.4% drop in net sales for the last quarter. Shares in the company have fallen over 4% in early trading. Elsewhere in the markets, oil has fallen by 1.5% on hopes of a breakthrough in the Middle East. Brent crude is down by $1 per barrel to around $74/barrel, after Axios reported that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to the terms of a deal to end the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, citing an unnamed senior U.S. official. This has also knocked safe-haven assets, with gold down 2%, and silver losing 3%. British flying taxi company Vertical Aerospace has agreed a $50m funding deal that will see founder Stephen Fitzpatrick hand over control of the business. Lender Mudrick Capital, run by American debt investor Jason Mudrick, will hand over $25m, with a guarantee of another $25m either from his funds or from other investors. The funding will allow Vertical to avoid a cash crunch that threatened to send it into bankruptcy just as it seeks regulatory approval for a flying taxi \u2013 with room for four passengers, 100 miles of range and top speeds of 150mph \u2013 that it hopes will be able to replace helicopters running on fossil fuels. The aircraft is electric and is a cross between a light plane and a drone, with tilting rotors and the ability to do vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). Fitzpatrick, whose wealth derives from the Ovo retail energy business, founded Vertical in 2016. The company raised money in a merger with a US cash shell in 2021, but it was on the verge of running out of money, with revenues not expected until 2028 after repeated delays. About $130m of Mudrick\u2019s previous loans will be converted to equity, while the payment for the rest of the debt will be extended until December 2028, when the company expects to be manufacturing and selling aircraft at scale. Mudrick will hold 71% of the company, while Fitzpatrick\u2019s stake will drop from nearly 75% to 19%. Fitzpatrick, who will remain on the company\u2019s board, said: The additional equity and stronger balance sheet will enable us to fund the next phase of our development programme and deliver on our mission to bring the amazing electric aircraft to the skies. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a wider swathe of the New York stock market than the Dow, is aso at a new high. Boom! Shares on Wall Street have hit new all time highs, on relief that President-elect Donald Trump has picked Scott Bessent as his incoming Treasury Secretary. The Dow Jones industrial average has opened up 324 points, or 0.7%, at 44,621 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has jumped over the 6,000-point mark, up 0.7% to trade at 6,012 points. And tech stocks are rallying too, lifting the Nasdaq Composite index up by 0.75%. As explained earlier (see here), Bessent is seen as a market-friendly choice who could dilute some of Trump\u2019s more extreme policies and could take a more gradual approach to the introduction of new tariffs. This is also lifting bond prices \u2013 a sign that fears of an inflation surge under the new Trump administration are easing. Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at global financial services company BNY, cites Bessett\u2019s 3-3-3 economic plan, saying: Risk on as markets see bonds rally, USD dip and equites gain on Trump nomination of hedge fund manager Bessent to role of US Treasury Secretary. Bessent pushes 3 arrows for US economy - 3% budget deficit by 2028, 3% GDP and 3 million more oil production a day. In an interview published on Sunday, Bessent told the Wall Street Journal that both tax and spending cuts were priorities. David Morrison, senior market analyst at fintech and financial services provider Trade Nation, says there is hope that Bessent will take a \u2018gradualist\u2019 approach to tariffs: There\u2019s relief that Mr Bessent is a known quantity with a strong track record as a successful hedge fund manager, as well as a fiscal hawk. This ties into the prevailing view that the Trump administration will focus on boosting economic growth, while actively taking measures to cut costs, thereby reducing the fiscal deficit which should reduce the rate of growth in the national debt. Mr Bessent is also in favour of tariffs, although he prefers a gradualist approach which suggests there\u2019s room for negotiation. You might have thought that the high winds that hit the UK yesterday as Storm Bert passed through would have boosted green energy supply, but no. According to energy firm Octopus,\u00a320m was spent yesterday on curtailment payments made to wind farms at such times, to encourage them to shut down to prevent grid overload. Octopus have been calling for this system to be reformed, so that customers to use this currently-wasted energy and benefit from lower wholesale prices. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has refused to say whether she would reverse Rachel Reeves\u2019s \u00a325bn increase in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to do is comment on every bit of micro policy,\u201d Badenoch told business leaders at the CBI\u2019s annual conference, where the tax-raising budget has been much discussed. Badenoch condemned employer NICs as a \u201ctax on jobs,\u201d but said it was too early in her leadership to set out specific policies. When pressed on whether she would raise the \u00a325bn of revenue in a different way - or alternatively what public services she would cut - she replied, \u201cI disagree with the premise of the question. We need to stop looking at everything as if it\u2019s just a ledger, where it\u2019s taxes raised and services delivered.\u201d She went on to pose the question of whether the planned football regulator is necessary, before adding that she didn\u2019t want to talk about, adjusting \u201clittle knobs or levers\u201d. Badenoch had earlier told business leaders she wants to \u201crewire the economy,\u201d and accused Labour of what she called an \u201cunprecedented raid on business\u201d. \u201cCapitalism is not a dirty word,\u201d Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch insists. Nor is \u201cwealth\u201d or \u201cprofit\u201d, she adds, but there is a need to explain how these things deliver for the people. Otherwise, Badenoch warns top business leaders at the CBI, people will think that business leaders are just in it for themselves, with the politicians \u201cin cahoots\u201d with them. She says: People who think business is all about greedy fat cats, rather than people who are working hard, entrepreneurs, and those who are making life better for all of us. Badenoch then turns to her party\u2019s principles, One is \u201cfree and fair competition\u201d. Not monopolies, rent-seeking or corporatism, but \u201cgenuine competition\u201d where new entrants can come in, and failing competitors change or leave the economy, she explains. A second is to represent all businesses, big and small. The burden on those small businesses are increasing, Badenoch warns. She then says that the burden of regulations, and higher national insurance rates, end up falling on the public, as: It is everyday people who bear the brunt, either in higher prices or lower wages, sometimes both. It was obvious that the Conservative government had \u201clost the confidence of business\u201d, Kemi Badenoch continues. She says she wasn\u2019t surprised that so many business leaders attended Labour\u2019s \u201cprawn cocktail, or smoked salmon\u201d offensive last year. That\u2019s because businesses thought the Conservative\u2019s didn\u2019t understand their concerns, and that \u201cwe were going to lose\u201d, she tells the CBI\u2019s annual conference. Badenoch says she has been keen to appoint MPs with actual business experience into the key business-facing roles in her shadow cabinet. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride founded a successful business, which he expanded into the US, before becoming an MP, she says. While shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith, has \u201cserious boardroom experience\u201d having worked as a financial analyst and asset manager. Kemi Badenoch says the previous Conservative government (in which she served) \u201cgot things wrong\u201d. That, she explains, is why she\u2019s speaking to the CBI today as leader of the opposition, not as a government minister. She says her father, a GP, would tell her that if you get the diagnosis wrong, the treatment won\u2019t work. And she then accuses the Labour government of \u201cdoubling down\u201d on the mistakes of the previous government, combined with an \u201cunpredentented raid on business\u201d. Today we are all talking about the consequences of the budget, but do not yet know the full consequences of their legislative problem. Badenoch cites the employment rights bill, which she says is \u201cdesigned by trade unions\u201d. Kemi Badenoch then tells the CBI\u2019s annual conference that the UK economy needs to be rewired, so that the vast majority of jobs are productive, and those that aren\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d. She says that when she speaks to members of the public, many think that money comes from government, and that a lot of people don\u2019t understand concept of productivity. Badenoch tells business leaders: As business, you will know that some jobs are productive, and others less so. Back in London, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is starting to give a speech at the CBI\u2019s annual conference. You can watch it here: Badenoch says she has spoken to many delegates at the conference about the need to deregulate. She says she tried to protect firms from regulation when she was business secretary (until the July election). Badenoch says: I know it is not government that creates growth, it is business. Government often needs to get out of the way. This is a difficult argument to make, she adds, as people want government to solve everything. Badenoch adds: If you ever sound hesitant, then they will make you out to be a cruel, unfeeling person, as I have discovered to my own personal cost. This, she then claims is why the UK national debt is now at record levels, with the country spending more on debt servicing than on health, education or defence. She insists: That needs to change, we need growth. The euro has now gained a whole cent against the US dollar today. It\u2019s climbed up over $1.05, having dipped below $1.04 on Friday for the first time since October 2022. There are fears that the euro could be pushed down to parity if the next US administration launches a trade war against Europe, but those concerns seem to be ebbing today\u2026 Back in London, the CBI\u2019s annual conference has turned to \u201cthe future of public-private partnership,\u201d with a panel discussion sponsored by law firm Browne Jacobson. Browne Jacobson\u2019s banking and finance partner Paul Hill (evidently if you pay for a panel you get a seat on the stage) is arguing we need a new era of public-private partnerships to deliver the government\u2019s plans, including on green energy. But he argues they need a rebrand, because the last generation of PFI schemes - which the last Labour government used to rebuild schools and hospitals - have such a poor reputation (unfairly, Hill reckons). He says: \u201cIt really is a toxic subject, and it\u2019s quite interesting when you think that through. Hill explains: \u201cThe PFI delivered the longest sustained period of investment in public infrastructure in decades\u201d. He adds: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s clear is that any future model cannot have any of the words [in] \u2018PFI\u2019 in it\u201d. Jurgen Maier, the former Siemens boss now chair of GB Energy, says he\u2019s optimistic about the prospects for attracting private investment into green energy projects, but, \u201cwe need to find some different language: I\u2019m starting to talk about \u2018private finance playbooks\u2019\u201d. Donald Trump imposing massive tariffs on China could drive down global goods price, leading to lower inflation elsewhere around the world including in Britain, a senior Bank of England policymaker has said. Swati Dhingra, an external member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said a second Trump presidency imposing a 60% tariff on Chinese goods sold in the US could lead Chinese exporters to cut their prices to ensure they maintained current trade volumes. Dhingra said: \u201cIt takes a massive amount of demand out of the world market. The way exporters, say in China, would respond to that would be to respond with prices, world prices, as they don\u2019t want to lose market share.\u201d Speaking at a conference in London on Monday, she said there was uncertainty about what policy the president-elect would carry through from his campaign. Trump had warned before the election earlier this month that he would slap tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods and up to 20% on other US trade partners. A leading expert in global trade, Dhingra said a tariff of up to 60% would have a disinflationary impact for the world economy. \u201cIf there is the kind of big 60% type of tariff increase that\u2019s been proposed, that will have repercussions on to world price and mostly on the downward direction,\u201d she said. However, if there was a broader \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d trade war where other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US \u201cthen we\u2019re in a completely different situation\u201d. Drawing a comparison with Brexit, Dhingra said Britain leaving the EU had \u201cpermanently\u201d raised the price of products in the UK for households. This had a short-term inflation impact, but this had faded as prices stabilised at a higher plateau. She explained: \u201cWe saw much higher price increases in the UK compared to everywhere else and those pressures have now come off much more quickly as well for the reason they\u2019re not inflationary, they change the price levels, permanently.\u201d Friday night\u2019s choice of Scott Bessent to be US Treasury Secretary has changed the mood in the markets today, reports Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Juckes reports: The nomination of Scott Bessent to be US Treasury Secretary has been a catalyst for lower bond yields, higher equity indices and a weaker dollar this morning. Bessent, the CIO of Soros Fund Management before he set up his own firm in 2015, is perceived to be in favour of pro-growth and deficit-reduction policies, and his nomination was greeted positively by markets worried about the size of the US budget deficit and the inflationary impact of tariffs. Whether he can help get the US to 3% GDP growth and a 3% budget deficit time will tell, but for now, he has changed the market mood, if nothing else. Wall Street is set to hit a new alltime high when trading begins later today, following the news that Donald Trump has chosen billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to be the next US Treasury seccretary. Bessent is seen as a more market-friendly choice than others on the shortlist, who could dilute some of Trump\u2019s more extreme policies and could take a more gradual approach to the introduction of new tariffs. This has lifted the futures contract on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record high this morning, indicating that the Dow could hit a record high when trading begins at 9.30am in New York (2.30pm GMT). Bessent\u2019s selection for the Treasury Secretary role \u2013 which has huge influence over US economy and financial markets \u2013 followed a battle with another top contender, billionaire investor Howard Lutnick. Lutnick, who is the chief executive of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, has been handed the role of commerce secretary. Elon Musk offered his backing to Lutnick for the Treasury berth last week, claiming that Bessent was a \u201cbusiness-as-usual choice, whereas Howard Lutnick will actually enact change.\u201d The financial markets seem to approve of Trump\u2019s choice though. US government bond prices are rallying today, pushing down the yield, or interest rate, on the debt. And the dollar has weakened slightly, having hit a six-month high against the pound last week and a two-year high against the euro. Both bond yields and the dollar had risen in recent weeks, on concerns that a trade war would lift US inflation, leading to higher interest rates. Gilles Mo\u00ebc, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, says: The appointment of Scott Bessent \u2013 generally seen as a pragmatist \u2013 at the Treasury, after the more radical Howard Lutnick at the Department of Commerce, suggests that Donald Trump may not have made a firm decision on how far he wants to dial up the pressure on tariffs. As many US economists \u2013 including mainstream ones \u2013 his main bone of contention with Europe is the lack of demand there, which restricts the capacity to build up a mutually beneficial trade relationship. Developing a proper growth strategy in the EU would not necessarily protect Europe fully from the US protectionist temptations, but it could be a more fruitful strategy, down the line, than merely engaging in retaliatory action, even if it is carefully targeted. The Strategy Team at investment bank Saxo told clients this morning: Bessent is known as a fiscal hawk who has advised Trump to create a \u201c3-3-3\u201d policy, including cutting the budget deficit by 3% of GDP by 2028, pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping extra 3 million barrels of oil each day. He is also expressed that tariffs should be used more as a negotiating tool and implemented more gradually. Newsflash: Microsoft users are reporting problems using the software giant\u2019s suite of business applications. According to the Downdetector website, there has been a surge in the number of people reporting problems with Microsoft 365, which includes Outlook.com, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and online versions of Office applications such as Word, Excel and Outlook. Reports peaked just before 10am UK time. Microsoft\u2019s service status page is currently reporting that \u201cEverything is up and running.\u201d But independent community website Windows Forum reports that there has indeed been disruption. They say: In a whirlwind of frustration and confusion, Microsoft 365 services have hit a significant snag, disrupting the workdays of countless office workers. From the early hours of the morning on November 25, reports began flooding in, particularly focused on Outlook, which has become the go-to email client for many companies. As the sun rose, so did complaints on platforms like Downdetector, painting a vivid picture of an office environment turned chaotic. The deputy governor of the Bank of England has said how companies pass on higher employer national insurance contributions will be influenced by the UK\u2019s current tight labour market. Clare Lombardelli said the impact on UK inflation from the government\u2019s \u00a325bn increase in employer NICs was \u201cuncertain\u201d because there was a number of ways that companies would respond. Business leaders have warned that the measure will lead to job losses, weaker wage growth, and firms passing on the costs in the form of higher prices charged to consumers. Speaking at the Bank of England Watchers\u2019 Conference 2024 at King\u2019s College London today, Lombardelli said: \u201cWe have to see how firms will respond to the fact we do still have a relatively tight labour market.\u201d On NICs, Lombardelli also said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big policy change and it\u2019ll have a large impact, exactly what that impact will be is uncertain.\u201d She said the \u201cearly conversations\u201d Threadneedle Street was having with companies showed \u201cquite a range of proposed responses\u201d depending on the size of a firm and the sector it was operating in. In her first speech since her appointment as the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for monetary policy in July, she warned there were risks to persistently high inflation from resilience in wage growth. While annual wage growth has slowed from a peak of 8.1% in mid-2023 to 4.8% in the three months to September, she said there was some evidence that the \u201cprocess of wage disinflation may be slowing.\u201d As covered earlier, Lombardelli added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to declare victory on inflation. It\u2019s often been said that the last mile may be the hardest, and that\u2019s where we are now.\u201d Rising inflation may hit UK consumer spending this Christmas, supermarket group Asda has warned. Asda\u2019s latest Income Tracker shows that household disposable income fell in October for only the second time this year. Household disposable income decreased by \u00a31.98 in October, Asda reports, due to the pick-up in inflation last month. This has left the average UK household with \u00a3247 per week to spend, after tax and essential purchase such as groceries, electricity, gas, transport costs and mortgage interest payments or rent. The CEBR thinktank, who produce the Income Tracker on behalf of Asda, predict that households will face \u201cdampened spending power over the festive period\u201d Sam Miley, managing economist and forecasting lead at Cebr, says: \u201cOctober\u2019s reading was only the second time this year that the Income Tracker reading has fallen on the month.\u201d \u201cThis was largely expected, given the increase in the Ofgem price cap that took place at the start of the month, bringing higher energy bills. These increased energy prices will persist over the rest of Q4, leading to slightly dampened spending power over the festive period.\u201d Across age groups, those aged 30 to 49 experienced the fastest annual rise in the cost of essential spending, which increased by 3.8% to \u00a3765 in October. These households, often made up of younger families with children, face significant essential expenses, including childcare costs, Asda points out. CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith has kicked off the business lobby group\u2019s annual conference in Westminster, with the strapline, \u201cTime for Growth\u201d. She begain by praising the government, for offering more stability and certainty - including by offering a \u201ccorporate tax roadmap\u201d; making full expensing permanent; and freeing up more resources for investment by changing the fiscal rules. Rain-Smith also welcomed the reset of relations with the EU, and ministers\u2019 overtures to China. She said: \u201cThis government has put us in a strong position by drawing the curtain on a near decade of instability at home. But the main thrust of Newton-Smith\u2019s address, as well trailed in the press this morning, was an attack on the \u00a325bn tax raid on businesses, announced in the budget. \u201cWhat really defines growth is the decisions made in boardrooms up and down the country,\u201d Newton-Smith said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s CFOs asking, \u2018can we afford to invest? Can we afford to expand? Can we afford to take a chance on people? Well after the budget, the answer we\u2019re hearing from so many firms is, \u2018not yet\u2019\u201d She suggested many firms, in particular in retail and hospitality, were now in \u201cdamage control,\u201d insisting, \u201ctax rises like this must never again be simply done to business. Instead, Newton-Smith called for an \u201celevated partnership,\u201d between government and businesses. She cited three specific areas: long-promised business tax reform, tax breaks for occupational health, and reform of the apprenticeship levy. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will both address business leaders here in Westminter later. In a reference to the Guardian\u2019s revelations of sexual misconduct at the lobby group, which sparked an existential crisis, Newton-Smith acknowledged the CBI had travelled a \u201cdifficult road\u201d. She was applauded when she said the CBI was, \u201cback in business\u201d. She also joked about Boris Johnson\u2019s rambling speech here three years ago, saying that today, there will be \u201chopefully not a Peppa Pig in sight!\u201d. The pound is holding its earlier gains against the US dollar, after Bank of England policymaker Clare Lombardelli took a cautious tone about future interest rate cuts this morning. Sterling is still up almost half a cent against the dollat at $1.258, with the greenback still weaker as investors digest the prospect of Scott Bessent becoming the next US Treasury secretary. Bessent is seen as a less extreme option, who might take a measured approach to tariffs and reining in the US budget deficit. That could mean less inflationary pressure, and thus less risk of higher US interest rates\u2026. Over in Germany, business confidence has taken another hit as firms grow more pessimistic about the economic situation, and the outlook for the future. The Business Climate Index produced by the Ifo institute has fallen to 85.7 points in November, down from 86.5 points in October. The decline in business morale was mainly due to the poorer assessment of the current situation, although expectations also fell slightly, Ifo said. Ifo says: Sentiment among companies in Germany has become gloomier\u2026. The German economy is floundering. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, reckons the drop in confidence is due to restructuring announcements from larger corporates, an escalation of the war in Ukraine and still-weak industrial order books and consumption. Germany companies also face the threat of new tariffs from the next Trump administration, he points out, which would add to Germany\u2019s economic risks as 10% of German exports go to the US. Brzeski adds: All in all, today\u2019s Ifo index adds to the evidence that the German economy remains stuck in stagnation and that after meagre growth in the third quarter, a (technical) winter recession looks likely. The much-discussed problems with the UK\u2019s employment data are making it harder for the Bank to tell what\u2019s actually happening in the jobs market, Clare Lombardelli points out. The Bank\u2019s deputy governor also says it\u2019s \u201cuncertain\u201d what impact the increase in employer national insurance contributions will have. Lombardelli tells the Bank of England Watchers Conference: We are hampered by the challenges of the quality of data, in particular in the Labour Force Survey. There have also been recent changes to the costs of employment from the combination of the increase to the National Living Wage, the rise in employer National Insurance Contributions and potentially the changes to workers\u2019 rights. Although the size, timing and interaction of these effects are uncertain. Clare Lombardelli also cites concerns about inflation in the services sector. She tells the Bank of England Watchers\u2019 Conference 2024 that services inflation is still above its pre-pandemic average, having been recorded at 5% in October. The Bank expects it to stay around that rate for another few months, she says. Lombardelli argues that wage rises, rather than profit-seeeking, is fuelling services inflation, saying: Wages are a material driver of services prices, and the slower-moving nature of services inflation reflects in large part the relatively high \u2018stickiness\u2019 of wages compared with other prices\u2026 In principle, higher-than-usual profit margins could also be driving the current elevated services inflation. But we regularly monitor developments in companies\u2019 margins and there is little evidence of that. Newsflash: A deputy governor at the Bank of England has warned that it is \u201ctoo early to declare victory\u201d in the fight against inflation. Clare Lombardelli has told a conference organised by King\u2019s Business School this morning that inflation has fallen steeply over the past two years. But, she is concerned that there are signs that the process of \u201cwage disinflation\u201d may be slowing, which would keep the cost of living rising faster than the Bank\u2019s target. She cites data from the Bank\u2019s Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey, which shows that UK businesses expect to raise pay by between 2% and 4% next year. Wage growth would need to be around 3% to be consistent with inflation at target, Lombardelli says, suggesting that higher earnings growth would make it harder for the Bank to cut interest rates. Opening today\u2019s Bank of England Watchers Conference in London, Lombardelli says: The outlook for wages and services prices is unclear from here. We need to see more evidence that wage growth and services inflation will continue their journey down to target-consistent rates. ut there are some signs that the process of wage disinflation may be slowing, as shown in Chart 5, so it\u2019s too early to declare victory on inflation. It\u2019s often been said that the last mile may be the hardest, and that\u2019s where we are now. In her first speech as Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, Lombardelli concludes: The UK economy has made good progress on disinflation. The shocks that drove inflation up have dissipated and inflation has returned to around target. But the more persistent components of inflation and uncertainties around how the labour market will evolve are cause for concern. So we need careful observation of all the relevant economic data and intelligence as we seek to gradually reduce policy restriction. In the mining sector, Anglo American has agreed a deal to sell its remaining coal operations in Australia to US rival Peabody Energy for up to $3.78bn (\u00a33bn). The sale is part of Anglo\u2019s push to focus on copper and iron ore production, after it fought off a takeover approach from BHP Group earlier this year. The six-month freeze preventing BHP making another approach expires at the end of this week, although its chair said last month that BHP had \u201cmoved on\u201d, and will focus on other growth opportunities instead\u2026 Barclays has confirmed that it has withdrawn its legal action against the FCA, paving the way for this morning\u2019s fine. But, the bank also says that it doesn\u2019t accept the FCA\u2019s findings over its Qatari fundraising \u2013 but is keen to \u2018draw a line\u2019 over the long-running issue. In a statement just released, Barclays says: Barclays PLC (\u201cBarclays\u201d) announces that it has agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) to withdraw its references to the Upper Tribunal (the \u201cReference\u201d) of the Decision Notices regarding Barclays and Barclays Bank PLC concerning the 2008 capital raisings, first published by the FCA on 23 September 2022 (the \u201cDecision Notices\u201d). In view of the time elapsed since the events, Barclays wishes to draw a line under the issues referred to in the Decision Notices and has decided not to contest the Decision Notices further. Barclays does not accept the findings of the Decision Notices and this has been acknowledged by the FCA. Notwithstanding the difference of view, Barclays has concluded that the interests of the Bank, its shareholders and other stakeholders are best served by withdrawing the References. A provision in respect of the financial penalty imposed by the FCA was taken in 2022 and there is no material financial impact on Barclays. Newsflash: Barclays has been fined \u00a340m by City regulators over allegedly secret payments it made to Qatari investors during the financial crisis 16 years ago. The Financial Conduct Authority has announced it has fined Barclays \u00a340m \u201cfor its failure to disclose certain arrangements with Qatari entities in 2008\u201d, which the regulator says was \u201creckless and lacked integrity\u201d. The fine relates to the \u00a3322m the bank paid to Qatar in 2008, allegedly in exchange for the gas-rich Gulf state investing \u00a34bn in Barclays, helping save the lender from a UK government bailout. The fees were seen by critics as a way for Qatar to effectively purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price that was not offered to other investors, when the City was reeling from the financial crisis. The FCA had provisionally proposed fining Barclays \u00a350m \u2013 which the bank was appealing against. That case had been due to be heard in the Upper Tribunal today, but the FCA says Barclays has now withdrawn its referral. Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA says: \u2018Barclays\u2019 misconduct was serious and meant investors did not have all the information they should have had. However, the events took place over 16 years ago and we recognise that Barclays is a very different organisation today, having implemented change across the business. \u2018It is important that listed firms provide investors with the information they need.\u2019 The FCA also says it recognises that this case concerns disclosure decisions made in the context of \u201cvery large and complex capital raisings\u201d that took place many years ago under \u201cconsiderable market pressure\u201d in October 2008 (following the collapse of Lehman Brothers). Back in 2020, three former Barclays bankers accused of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for emergency funding at the height of the 2008 financial crisis were been found not guilty of fraud. The FCA originally revealed it was investigating the controversial fee arrangements back in 2013, but paused its investigation during a criminal trial launched by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). However, the SFO failed to win a trial against Barclays over the Qatar deal, and the case collapsed in 2018. The US dollar is dipping this morning after Donald Trump picked hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to be the next US Treasury secretary. This has lifted the pound up by almost half a cent, to $1.257, away from last Friday\u2019s six-month low. The euro, which hit a two-year low last week, is up almost half a cent too, at $1.045. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says markets are reacting constructively to the choice of Bessent. He told clients: Bessent, a hedge fund CEO, is known to be a fiscal hawk so this should ease some of the more extreme deficit fears as he has advocated a 3% deficit by 2028. In practise that will be extremely tough but for now the market can be a bit relieved. He is also thought to be less extreme on trade policy than some of his rivals for the job. CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith has spoken to Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme about the group\u2019s concerns over the budget, ahead of today\u2019s conference. Q: Rachel Reeves will say she\u2019s heard \u201cno alternative\u201d to her plans, what\u2019s your response? Newton-Smith says the business leaders she\u2019s spoken to have said the decisions made the budget make it harder for them to invest and to hire people. Business investment growth is weaker because of the decisions taken in the budget, she warns. Q: If more money for public services is needed, isn\u2019t it fair to raise it from companies making billions of pounds in profits? Newton-Smith says \u201cno-one is questioning\u201d that tax rises are needed to fund public services. But the challenge with increased national insurance contributions (NICs) is that hits all businesses before they\u2019ve made a profit, so it leads to \u201cserious\u201d pain on businesses. The CBI wants the government to \u201cdouble-down\u201d on measures to help businesses. That could include reforming business rates to remove pressure on businesses, such as in aviation and hospitality. The industrial strategy must make it easy for businesses to invest and hire. Q: Were Labour honest with business in the run-up to the Budget? The chancellor did talk about the need for tough choices, Newton-Smith points out. But\u2026 lowering the NICs threshold hits businesses offering opportunities to people entering the labour market for the first time, she adds. The boss of Britain\u2019s Greggs has pledged that its expansion plans will not be derailed by the new Labour government\u2019s tax raising budget. Greggs CEO Roisin Currie has told Reuters said that although she supported higher wages, changes to tax thresholds were an unwelcome surprise. Currie said the measures would increase its annual costs by tens of millions of pounds, but also predicted that any customer price rises likely to only be \u201cpennies\u201d. Currie says: \u201cOur shop growth plan, our supply chain investment, none of that changes. We are still absolutely going for growth.\u201d Currie also ruled out slashing the bonus distributed to employees to cover the costs of the budget, saying the bonus was \u201cabsolutely sacred\u201d. DIY chain Kingfisher has blamed the budget for hitting consumer confidence, and revealed that increases to employer national insurance contributions will cost it \u00a331m. Kingfisher has slightly lowered its earnings guidance this morning, it now expects adjusted pre-tax profits to be between \u00a3510m to \u00a3540m, down from \u00a3510m-\u00a3550m previously. Thierry Garnier, chief executive officer of Kingfisher, says: \u201cOverall trading in the third quarter was resilient. Improved performance in August and September was offset by the impact of increased consumer uncertainty in the UK and France in October, related to government budgets in both countries. Garnier adds that \u201crecent political and macroeconomic developments\u201d have layered incremental uncertainty onto the near-term outlook in its markets. Rachel Reeves is expected to tell business leaders that they have offered \u201cno alternatives\u201d to her plans, in a defiant defence of her tax-raising budget today. Reeves will tell the CBI\u2019s annual conference in Westminster that no one has offered a better solution to the challenging situation left behind by the previous, Conservative government. \u201cI have heard lots of responses to the government\u2019s first budget but I have heard no alternatives,\u201d she is expected to say. \u201cWe have asked businesses and the wealthiest to contribute more. I know those choices will have an impact. But I stand by those choices as the right choices for our country: investment to fix the NHS and rebuild Britain, while ensuring working people don\u2019t face higher taxes in their payslips.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story, by our economics editor Heather Stewart. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK businesses are warning today that the tax rises in last month\u2019s budget have put a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 on them, putting firms off hiring. Business leaders are gathering at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in central London for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)\u2018s annual conference. They\u2019ll hear from chancellor Rachel Reeves, and leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch, after a breakfast with Bank of England (BoE) governor Andrew Bailey. And the message from the CBI is that Reeves\u2019s first budget will hurt profits, leading to lower investment and growth. A survey conducted by the CBI after the budget found that nearly two-thirds of firms thought the budget will damage UK investment with half of firms looking to reduce headcount as a result. CBI CEO Rain Newton-Smith will tell firms today that \u201ctax rises like this must never again simply be done to business.\u201d She\u2019s expected to say: \u201cWhat really defines growth \u2013 is the decisions made in boardrooms up and down the country. It\u2019s CFOs and CEOs asking: can we afford to invest? Can we afford to expand? Can we afford to take a chance on new people? Well after the Budget, the answer we\u2019re hearing from so many firms is still \u2013 not yet. The rise in National Insurance and the stark lowering of the threshold, caught us all off guard. Set alongside the expansion and rise of the National Living Wage \u2013 which everyone wants to accommodate \u2013 and the potential cost of the Employment Rights Bill changes\u2026 they put a heavy burden on business.\u201d She will then warn: When you hit profits, you hit competitiveness, you hit investment. You hit growth. Data last Friday showed that the UK private sector is stagnating this month, following the budget at the end of October. The CBI, which was hit by claims of sexual misconduct and a \u2018toxic culture\u2019 last year, is now hoping to have a greater influence over government policy again. Newton-Smith is expected to commend the government for \u201cdrawing the curtain on a near decade of instability\u201d but urge them to shift from \u201cconsultation to co-design\u201d. Reeves's budget, at the end of October, included \u00a340bn of tax rises to boost public spending, including \u00a325bn from increasing employer national insurance contributions. The conference will be wrapped up by CBI president Rupert Soames. Back in February, he told us that the Guardian\u2019s revelations about sexual misconduct at the lobbying group were \u201can appalling shock\u201d that tipped it into a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d. Soames said the scandal had triggered an existential crisis; today\u2019s conference will be a test of how well his rescue operation is going. Among the speakers at today\u2019s conference is the US Embassy\u2019s Deputy Chief of Mission, Matthew Palmer, who will discuss the US political situation. Also coming up The Bank of England are holding a conference today too, with economists and other \u2018watchers\u2019 of the UK central bank \u2013 we\u2019ll be watching for any hints on how quickly it will keep cutting interest rates. Financial markets will be digesting Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, to be the next US Treasury secretary. Bessent is seen as a Wall Street-friendly pick.

      "body": "<p>It was Graham Greene who inadvertently launched Barbara Taylor Bradford, who has died aged 91, on the road that would lead, in 2003, to her induction into the Writers Hall of Fame of America, alongside Mark Twain, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway. Character is plot, he had explained in an article \u2013 and suddenly Bradford understood what fiction was really about. </p> <p>It was the mid-1970s, and BTB, as she came to be known, was already a successful journalist, with more than a dozen columns syndicated throughout the US. But as an author she had succeeded only with books on decorating and design, having abandoned several attempts at a novel. \u201cIf I hated them, then the reader would hate them,\u201d she acknowledged. </p> <p>Greene\u2019s comment proved to be a revelation. \u201cSuddenly, I understood what writing fiction was: it\u2019s who you are, what your protagonist is. If it\u2019s a wimpy sort of person they\u2019re not going to get anywhere. But if it\u2019s a driven, ambitious, go-ahead woman who\u2019s not going to be deterred by anybody then, obviously, she\u2019s going to be a combination of all those strong women I admire, such as Marie Curie, Catherine the Great and Elizabeth Tudor.\u201d </p> <p>That, if you will, was the substance of the woman, and so was born Emma Harte, the heroine of Bradford\u2019s debut novel, A Woman of Substance, published in 1979. Sold for $25,000 on the basis of just a few pages, it was an overnight success and went on to sell 32m copies, remaining on the New York Times bestseller lists for 43 weeks. The pregnant 16-year-old kitchen maid who is forced to leave her job and make her own way in the world is, by the novel\u2019s conclusion, a rich matriarch presiding over the outposts of her worldwide empire from the comfort of a private jet.

      "bodyText": "It was Graham Greene who inadvertently launched Barbara Taylor Bradford, who has died aged 91, on the road that would lead, in 2003, to her induction into the Writers Hall of Fame of America, alongside Mark Twain, Robert Frost and Ernest Hemingway. Character is plot, he had explained in an article \u2013 and suddenly Bradford understood what fiction was really about. It was the mid-1970s, and BTB, as she came to be known, was already a successful journalist, with more than a dozen columns syndicated throughout the US. But as an author she had succeeded only with books on decorating and design, having abandoned several attempts at a novel. \u201cIf I hated them, then the reader would hate them,\u201d she acknowledged. Greene\u2019s comment proved to be a revelation. \u201cSuddenly, I understood what writing fiction was: it\u2019s who you are, what your protagonist is. If it\u2019s a wimpy sort of person they\u2019re not going to get anywhere. But if it\u2019s a driven, ambitious, go-ahead woman who\u2019s not going to be deterred by anybody then, obviously, she\u2019s going to be a combination of all those strong women I admire, such as Marie Curie, Catherine the Great and Elizabeth Tudor.\u201d That, if you will, was the substance of the woman, and so was born Emma Harte, the heroine of Bradford\u2019s debut novel, A Woman of Substance, published in 1979. Sold for $25,000 on the basis of just a few pages, it was an overnight success and went on to sell 32m copies, remaining on the New York Times bestseller lists for 43 weeks. The pregnant 16-year-old kitchen maid who is forced to leave her job and make her own way in the world is, by the novel\u2019s conclusion, a rich matriarch presiding over the outposts of her worldwide empire from the comfort of a private jet. The TV miniseries that followed in 1985, starring Jenny Seagrove and Liam Neeson, was a global success with a UK audience of nearly 14 million. Almost immediately after the book\u2019s publication, Bradford began receiving fan mail, asking what happens to Emma next.

      "body": "<p>On Christmas day, 2004, Chris Xaver arrived in Phuket, a popular tourist destination on the south-west coast of Thailand, for a brief holiday. It was already dark by the time she and her then husband, Scott, got to the hotel; she couldn\u2019t see the ocean, but could smell the saltwater of a beach vacation. The next morning, she had just stepped out of the shower when water started flooding their sea-level bungalow. Thinking the water main had broken, they called the front desk. No answer. Outside the bungalow, they saw the remnants of what they assumed was a rogue wave. \u201cThe lexicon, the word tsunami, was not in our brain,\u201d Xaver recalled.</p> <p>Twenty years on, she remembers standing in an open-air beach restaurant, about 40ft behind Scott, watching another wave approach. A journalist by training, she pulled out her camera to record it. Through the lens, she saw the wave scoop up a Toyota pick-up truck and carry it toward her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a wall of water, like a Hawaii Five-0 with a curve,\u201d she remembered. \u201cIt was just raised water coming at you.

Xaver is one of several survivors to share her experience in the four-part series, which expertly collates personal testimony and archival footage of unfathomable devastation, fear, human kindness and loss. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/dec/21/boxing-day-tsunami-community-born-out-of-disaster-video\">deadliest tsunami</a> in recorded history, triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on the morning of 26 December, touched 14 countries around the Indian Ocean, from Thailand to Sri Lanka to Tanzania, and killed more than 225,000 people.</p> <p>Occurring well into the era of personal video but at the dawn of the social media age, there exists much firsthand evidence of the freak, terrible disaster, though it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/2004-indian-ocean-tsunami-10-years-on\">took years</a> to fully grasp the scope of its devastation. Still, some images of the tsunami are by now familiar, haunting \u2013 people roaming the exposed beach as the water pulled back, not aware of the impending wave; a wall of brown water pulverizing cars, buildings, windows, anything in its path; floating masses of debris; hideously churning water as high as the rooftops.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V_xX3UDHb8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4V_xX3UDHb8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Tsunami: Race Against Time, includes much of this footage and the testimony of those who endured the ocean\u2019s horrific game of chance. It also includes stories and archival footage from places less familiar to western news audiences, who primarily heard from English-speaking tourists in hard-hit Thailand. \u201cOne of the first things that we wanted to do is to uncover archive from places that we haven\u2019t seen before, like Sri Lanka and Banda Aceh, Indonesia, in particular, and also a lot of archive from Thailand that had never been shown before,\u201d the director Daniel Bogado said. Bogado, who previously directed a similarly witness-based, minute-by-minute docuseries on 9/11, headed a team of researchers, producers and local fixers \u2013 many of whom survived or lost loved ones to the tsunami \u2013 who spent months sourcing never-before-seen archival footage, and the people in it, from all affected countries. The research was \u201ca labor of love\u201d, said Bogado. \u201cIt\u2019s just a huge amount of work that goes on before you even film a single interview.\u201d</p> <p>The stories recounted over four episodes include a woman who watched her family\u2019s house fill with water on the morning of her wedding in Banda Aceh, Indonesia \u2013 the first major city hit, already reeling from the earthquake\u2019s damage that morning. A hospital in Sri Lanka, which through a terrible quirk of science was hit on all sides of the island by refracted waves. A survivor of a Sri Lankan train that, because of the unprecedented nature of the disaster and a lack of warning systems, barreled right into the tsunami, killing 1,700 people \u2013 the worst railway disaster in history. A man who pulled a toddler from the wreckage in Indonesia, but lost track of her at the hospital. Barry Hirshorn, a seismologist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, who understood the danger of the tsunami as it was happening but because of patchwork warning systems was reduced to attempting to reach foreign governments by corded telephone. People who lost their siblings and parents and friends; people who thought they lost their loved ones, only to miraculously find them in the wreckage.</p>    <p>Even though she was slammed into a wall by water and impaled by porch furniture, Xaver was one of the lucky ones. The power of the water slackened before she lost consciousness and, though badly injured, she was able to stand up. Her husband, pulled from the water by another tourist, also survived. Thanks to a hotel shuttle and triage care by fellow travelers, they were able to escape yet another wave, and made it to a hospital in Phuket, then another in Bangkok. After another hospital stay weeks later for gangrenous infection, she eventually emerged relatively physically unscathed. But the damage lingers. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of guilt that comes with having survived something when amazing human beings did not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to really grapple with all that guilt \u2013 why am I here, and then what is my responsibility for being here? If I\u2019m going to be given this chance, then I better do something with it.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since, Xaver felt a sense of duty to share her story. \u201cIf you survive this, you somehow must share it, because it\u2019s too big and it touched too many lives,\u201d she said. Many others who participated in the series felt similarly, said Bogado. \u201cThe pitch that we made to people was always quite similar, which was this documentary will serve, first, as a historical record\u201d \u2013 particularly important, as much of the footage from the time was on the brink of being lost, if not already compromised by humidity or decay. Twenty years is, it turns out, more than many hard drives can survive.</p> <p>And second, the series serves as a \u201cmemorial to the lives that were lost\u201d, said Bogado. Just a handful are remembered in detail here, each one gutting, by people willing to relive, in empathic and harrowing detail, the worst day of their lives, still unbelievable 20 years on.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tsunami: Race Against Time is available on Disney+ and also Hulu in the US</p></li> </ul>",

Outside the bungalow, they saw the remnants of what they assumed was a rogue wave. \u201cThe lexicon, the word tsunami, was not in our brain,\u201d Xaver recalled. Twenty years on, she remembers standing in an open-air beach restaurant, about 40ft behind Scott, watching another wave approach. A journalist by training, she pulled out her camera to record it. Through the lens, she saw the wave scoop up a Toyota pick-up truck and carry it toward her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a wall of water, like a Hawaii Five-0 with a curve,\u201d she remembered. \u201cIt was just raised water coming at you. I will never, ever forget it.\u201d She had enough time to yell to her husband and jump on a beach chair before she was underwater. The two-ish minutes in which she was swept away by the Boxing Day tsunami were \u201cthe fastest, slowest time period of my life\u201d, she says in Tsunami: Race Against Time, a new documentary series by National Geographic on the worst natural disaster of our lifetimes. Xaver is one of several survivors to share her experience in the four-part series, which expertly collates personal testimony and archival footage of unfathomable devastation, fear, human kindness and loss. The deadliest tsunami in recorded history, triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on the morning of 26 December, touched 14 countries around the Indian Ocean, from Thailand to Sri Lanka to Tanzania, and killed more than 225,000 people. Occurring well into the era of personal video but at the dawn of the social media age, there exists much firsthand evidence of the freak, terrible disaster, though it took years to fully grasp the scope of its devastation. Still, some images of the tsunami are by now familiar, haunting \u2013 people roaming the exposed beach as the water pulled back, not aware of the impending wave; a wall of brown water pulverizing cars, buildings, windows, anything in its path; floating masses of debris; hideously churning water as high as the rooftops. Tsunami: Race Against Time, includes much of this footage and the testimony of those who endured the ocean\u2019s horrific game of chance. It also includes stories and archival footage from places less familiar to western news audiences, who primarily heard from English-speaking tourists in hard-hit Thailand. \u201cOne of the first things that we wanted to do is to uncover archive from places that we haven\u2019t seen before, like Sri Lanka and Banda Aceh, Indonesia, in particular, and also a lot of archive from Thailand that had never been shown before,\u201d the director Daniel Bogado said. Bogado, who previously directed a similarly witness-based, minute-by-minute docuseries on 9/11, headed a team of researchers, producers and local fixers \u2013 many of whom survived or lost loved ones to the tsunami \u2013 who spent months sourcing never-before-seen archival footage, and the people in it, from all affected countries. The research was \u201ca labor of love\u201d, said Bogado. \u201cIt\u2019s just a huge amount of work that goes on before you even film a single interview.\u201d The stories recounted over four episodes include a woman who watched her family\u2019s house fill with water on the morning of her wedding in Banda Aceh, Indonesia \u2013 the first major city hit, already reeling from the earthquake\u2019s damage that morning. A hospital in Sri Lanka, which through a terrible quirk of science was hit on all sides of the island by refracted waves. A survivor of a Sri Lankan train that, because of the unprecedented nature of the disaster and a lack of warning systems, barreled right into the tsunami, killing 1,700 people \u2013 the worst railway disaster in history. A man who pulled a toddler from the wreckage in Indonesia, but lost track of her at the hospital. Barry Hirshorn, a seismologist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, who understood the danger of the tsunami as it was happening but because of patchwork warning systems was reduced to attempting to reach foreign governments by corded telephone. People who lost their siblings and parents and friends; people who thought they lost their loved ones, only to miraculously find them in the wreckage. Even though she was slammed into a wall by water and impaled by porch furniture, Xaver was one of the lucky ones. The power of the water slackened before she lost consciousness and, though badly injured, she was able to stand up. Her husband, pulled from the water by another tourist, also survived. Thanks to a hotel shuttle and triage care by fellow travelers, they were able to escape yet another wave, and made it to a hospital in Phuket, then another in Bangkok. After another hospital stay weeks later for gangrenous infection, she eventually emerged relatively physically unscathed. But the damage lingers. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of guilt that comes with having survived something when amazing human beings did not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to really grapple with all that guilt \u2013 why am I here, and then what is my responsibility for being here? If I\u2019m going to be given this chance, then I better do something with it.\u201d In the years since, Xaver felt a sense of duty to share her story. \u201cIf you survive this, you somehow must share it, because it\u2019s too big and it touched too many lives,\u201d she said. Many others who participated in the series felt similarly, said Bogado. \u201cThe pitch that we made to people was always quite similar, which was this documentary will serve, first, as a historical record\u201d \u2013 particularly important, as much of the footage from the time was on the brink of being lost, if not already compromised by humidity or decay. Twenty years is, it turns out, more than many hard drives can survive. And second, the series serves as a \u201cmemorial to the lives that were lost\u201d, said Bogado. Just a handful are remembered in detail here, each one gutting, by people willing to relive, in empathic and harrowing detail, the worst day of their lives, still unbelievable 20 years on.

Yet it is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/24/greenwashing-cop-summits-best-chance-averting-climate-breakdown\">best mechanism</a> for multilateral action we have, so we have to use it to do everything we can to speed up action.</p> <p>The UK went to Cop29 determined to play its part in a successful negotiation because it is in our national interest. As the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-remarks-at-cop29-12-november-2024\">prime minister said</a> in Baku earlier this month, there is no national security without climate security.

The previous government used the fact that the UK is responsible for about <a href=\"https://eciu.net/insights/2021/why-the-uks-1-of-global-emissions-is-a-big-deal\">1% of annual global emissions</a> as an excuse for inaction. But given that climate impact knows no borders, our only hope of keeping the UK safe is to lead and work with other countries to ensure the other 99% of emissions are also addressed.</p> <p>By this standard, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/24/cop29-climate-progress-trump-presidency-politics-science\">11th-hour deal</a> reached at Cop29 is a step forward. The reality is there is no route to a stable climate without supporting developing countries to embrace the clean-energy revolution. The $300bn climate finance goal, trebling the current $100bn, will help poorer countries get the finance they need to decarbonise their economies and protect their populations.</p> <p>This deal could lead to emissions reductions that are the equivalent to removing the emissions of about 1bn cars, as well as helping to protect up to 1 billion people in developing countries from the effects of floods, heatwaves and droughts caused by the climate crisis.</p> <p>This deal will also help speed up the clean-energy transition globally, which is, crucially, right for Britain because of what it offers in terms of investment and economic opportunity, including exports. For us and others around the world, taking advantage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/05/what-will-the-uks-clean-energy-by-2030-plan-mean-for-the-industry-and-public\">this transition</a> is the route to good jobs, economic growth and higher living standards.</p> <p>The finance goal agreed also reflects a new global landscape where traditional donors will be joined by big emitters such as China to help fund the transition. That is a fair reflection of the world today.</p> <p>Of course, many developing countries facing the intensifying effects of the climate crisis, and the need for development and investment in a low carbon transition, do not feel that this finance goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/23/cop29-agrees-13tn-climate-finance-deal-but-campaigners-brand-it-a-betrayal\">will address their requirements</a>. This is understandable, but the outcome at Cop29 does represent an advance at a time of massive pressures on public finances. The finance goal, along with an agreement at Baku on carbon markets and the mobilisation of the private sector, are the essential elements for ensuring a roadmap to the $1.3tn of finance for developing countries set out in the Cop29 deal.</p> <p>While this Cop did make strides forward on finance, and that was always going to be its focus, it did not make the same progress elsewhere. In particular, the UK would have wanted to see a much stronger outcome on taking forward the global stocktake agreed at Cop28 on the transition away from fossil fuels and on keeping alive the commitment to keep world\u2019s temperature rise below 1.5C.</p> <p>Agreement on these issues was not reached because a number of developed and developing countries did not believe the Cop29 text was sufficiently ambitious.

      "body": "<p>By nature, hip-hop feuds are divisive, but the beef between Drake and Kendrick Lamar was polarising in a way that had nothing to do with whose side you took. There were people who thought it was the greatest rap battle in history, outstripping Jay-Z and Nas, Ice Cube and his former bandmates in NWA, even Biggie and Tupac. Equally, there were others who questioned if it even counted as a rap battle at all: noting that both participants were already superstars, rather than a \u201cyoung, hungry MC using this as a vehicle to get to the next place\u201d, veteran critic Nelson George described it as \u201crich Black men attacking other rich Black men on their social media, from the comfort of their own homes\u201d. But whatever stance you took, it was obvious who the winner was. Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us not only landed a knockout blow, it achieved things no diss track has done before: it went to No 1, affected the campaign messaging of US election, became an American sports anthem, inspired a video game, was nominated for five Grammys \u2013 including record and song of the year \u2013 and got Lamar tapped as the headliner of the 2025 Super Bowl half-time show.</p>    <p>It is a victory that seems to power GNX, a surprise release that couldn\u2019t be more different in tone from Lamar\u2019s last album Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, which spent 75 minutes thrashing about, filled with self-criticism and doubt, contemplating the inevitable end of his moment in the spotlight and reassuring himself that \u201cyou can\u2019t please everyone\u201d on a track called Crown. No such issues on GNX, an album that covers a lot of different topics \u2013 from romance on two duets with SZA, to the dissolution of Lamar\u2019s Black Hippy collective \u2013 but on which the overall message seems to be: who else wants some? \u201cIt used to be \u2018fuck that nigga\u2019, but now it\u2019s plural,\u201d he offers on the opening Wacced Out Murals. So it seems. Although Drake gets it in the neck again, what\u2019s striking is how his targets have now expanded to include Snoop Dogg (who posted a link to Drake\u2019s diss track Taylor Made on social media), Lil Wayne (who was apparently aggrieved about Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl slot), those with \u201cold-ass flows\u201d, people who offer \u201cbackhanded compliments\u201d, sundry unnamed figures accused of trying to \u201chate on me\u201d in Peekaboo and, potentially, Lamar\u2019s own grandma, whom he threatens to cut off \u201cif she don\u2019t see it like I see it\u201d during TV Off.</p> <p>You could read a lot from the fact that, SZA aside, there are no guests even remotely of Lamar\u2019s critical or commercial stature on GNX: if it seems altruistic of him to cede the mic to up-and-comers Hitta J3, Peysoh and YoungThreat on the title track, another reading might be that Lamar doesn\u2019t consider any of his actual peers to be worthy of sharing his spotlight, a feeling reinforced by Reincarnated, which appears to suggest that Lamar is the reincarnation of both John Lee Hooker and Billie Holliday (and, the sample of Made Niggaz that drives the musical backing suggests, Tupac Shakur). The track concludes with God \u2013 voiced by Lamar \u2013appearing in order to admonish him. When he does, Lamar momentarily sounds abashed. Nevertheless, a man who literally requires divine intervention to get him to wind his neck in a bit is clearly not beset by a lack of confidence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiALRpD0Ztg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wiALRpD0Ztg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Kendrick Lamar: Man at the Garden \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s a huge leap from the wracked figure at the centre of Mr Morale, and it would seem faintly risible were it not for the fact that GNX is evidently an album made by an artist at the top of his game.

Taking over the Old Vic after the National left and meeting the UK touring demands of the Arts Council proved irreconcilable.

      "body": "<h2><strong>BACK TO BASICS</strong></h2> <p>Talk about show and tell, doing your opposing manager\u2019s team talk for him. On Saturday, while Ange Postecoglou prepared Tottenham for their tea-time kick-off, the Etihad was staging a celebration of Rodri\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or, Ballon d\u2019Or, Ballon d\u2019Or that WWE would have been proud of. Only the great man\u2019s knee-knack prevented him doing the full Vince McMahon power strut down the red carpet. There it was in huge gold letters, the answer to Tottenham\u2019s prayers, the name of the man that City are lacking, and will continue to lack, Rodri. Spurs duly won 4-0. A one-man team? Let\u2019s not get silly now. Mateo Kovacic, holder of four Big Cup winners\u2019 medals, was also missing. An old team? Perhaps we\u2019re getting closer since in the five-game losing run that has Pep Guardiola rubbing his cranium like he\u2019s polishing an unearthed Roman coin, there has been much creaking. Worse, a lot of pointing. A true giveaway sign of the ageing pro is asking others to do as I say, not what I do as my legs can\u2019t get me there.</p> <p>If Kyle Walker being shown a clean pair of heels by Timo Werner was the meme, there were plenty more moments of dither and delay that just a month ago were unthinkable. A clear-out required? That\u2019s what a few City fans are calling for, though some of the young \u2018uns haven\u2019t been spared: Rico Lewis, Josko Gvardiol and Savinho came under fire, too. So then, Pep, what\u2019s the solution here? To use the phrasing of former City utility man, Fabian Delph, time to go back to the \u201cbasics of football\u201d. Remember when, in the first of those many documentaries City pump out, Delph advised his teammates on \u201cwinning our individual battles, sticking together as a unit, [eff]ing defenders defending, midfielders box-to-box, [eff] keepers making saves\u201d?</p> <p>Remember how Pep shooed Delph away? Not so smart now, Catalan genius, the man who said: \u201cI don\u2019t train the tackles, what are tackles?\u201d Perhaps it is the time for Guardiola, someone who publicly embraces English football traditions as his own, to go back to such basics. Time-honoured thinking, even among the managerial greats, your Fergies, your Paisleys, your Allardyces, your Pulises, was to get the defence sorted, lock down midfield and hope the striker scores one off his backside to arrest the slide. Work the channels, back and face, clear the danger. When in doubt, knock it out. Perhaps Delph, these days retired but very possibly available, might offer the likes of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne some handy hints on the midfielder\u2019s art.</p> <p>Though as a team with no midfield, as highlighted by that Hollywood display of he who can\u2019t play, why not get it launched to the big man, replace Juanma Lillo with Big Joe Royle, and call Niall Quinn in to give Erling Haaland some tips on flick-ons and holding the ball up down those channels? Micah Richards in to drill the defence? Let\u2019s not get silly now.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Michael Butler at 8pm GMT for red-hot minute-by-minute updates on Newcastle 2-0 West Ham in the Premier League.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, we are almost in December and I haven\u2019t received any offers yet to stay in the club.

Remember when, in the first of those many documentaries City pump out, Delph advised his teammates on \u201cwinning our individual battles, sticking together as a unit, [eff]ing defenders defending, midfielders box-to-box, [eff] keepers making saves\u201d? Remember how Pep shooed Delph away? Not so smart now, Catalan genius, the man who said: \u201cI don\u2019t train the tackles, what are tackles?\u201d Perhaps it is the time for Guardiola, someone who publicly embraces English football traditions as his own, to go back to such basics. Time-honoured thinking, even among the managerial greats, your Fergies, your Paisleys, your Allardyces, your Pulises, was to get the defence sorted, lock down midfield and hope the striker scores one off his backside to arrest the slide. Work the channels, back and face, clear the danger. When in doubt, knock it out. Perhaps Delph, these days retired but very possibly available, might offer the likes of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne some handy hints on the midfielder\u2019s art. Though as a team with no midfield, as highlighted by that Hollywood display of he who can\u2019t play, why not get it launched to the big man, replace Juanma Lillo with Big Joe Royle, and call Niall Quinn in to give Erling Haaland some tips on flick-ons and holding the ball up down those channels? Micah Richards in to drill the defence? Let\u2019s not get silly now.

FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS \u2018Caveat emptor\u2019 \u2013 I think Pep Guardiola suffered a severe case of buyer\u2019s remorse on Saturday.

Clive Allen once quoted former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp as saying \u2018when we go, we really go\u2019.

      "bodyText": "A Russian attack on Ukraine\u2019s northeastern city of Kharkiv has injured at least 23 people, officials said. Russia said its air defences had shot down eight ballistic missiles fired by Ukraine, but did not specify what kind of missiles were used or where they were shot down. Ukrainian drones reportedly hit a fuel facility in the Russian region of Kaluga, in Kyiv\u2019s latest attack on Moscow\u2019s energy sites. C\u0103lin Georgescu, a Moscow-friendly politician, is set to face a centre-right candidate in the runoff of Romania\u2019s presidential elections after a shock first-round result that could jeopardise its support for Ukraine. James Scott Rhys Anderson, a 22-year-old British national, has reportedly been captured by Russia\u2019s forces in the Kursk region while fighting for Ukraine. The UK foreign secretary David Lammy told reporters that the government will do all it can to support Anderson, who said he served as a signalman in the British army until 2023 before joining the International Legion in Ukraine to fight against Russia. Britain sanctioned 30 ships in Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet that have been skirting restrictions to transport billions of dollars of petroleum, the Foreign Office said. It is the biggest sanctions package targeting the fleet of illegitimate and often decrepit ships that are operating illegally to avoid sanctions, according to the Foreign Office. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and the new Nato secretary general Mark Rutte discussed possible ways to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine during talks in Ankara on Monday, the Turkish presidency said. \u201cDuring the meeting, what can be done to end the Ukraine-Russia war and the massacre in Palestine were discussed \u2026\u201d the presidency said on X. Nato member Turkey, which has condemned the Russian invasion, says it supports Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and it has provided Kyiv with military support. But Turkey, a Black Sea neighbour of both Russia and Ukraine, also opposes western sanctions against Moscow, with which it shares important defence, energy and tourism ties. The number of people injured in the Russian missile strike on Odesa has increased to 11 (the previous figure was six). Writing on Telegram, Oleh Kiper, chief of the Odesa regional military administration, said: \u201cTwo people were treated on the spot. 8 wounded remain in hospital treatment. One woman is in serious condition, the rest are in a moderate condition. Also, one victim continues treatment on an outpatient basis.\u201d A Russian drone attacked the village of Solonchaky in the Mykolaiv region earlier today while aid was being delivered there, governor Vitalii Kim reported. Five people were injured, and two of them are in serious condition, according to the governor. Romanian prime minister Marcel Ciolacu will resign as leader of the leftist Social Democrats (PSD) party after he failed to make the second round of a presidential election, he said on Monday, adding that he would stay on as prime minister until after the ballot. It means the independent ultranationalist, Moscow-friendly Nato critic C\u0103lin Georgescu will face the centre-right Elena Lasconi in the runoff of Romania\u2019s presidential elections after the first-round result that has upended the country\u2019s politics and could jeopardise its support for Ukraine. Romania shares a 400-mile border with Ukraine and is seen by western allies as playing a key strategic role, hosting a Nato military base, donating a Patriot air defence battery and providing a vital transit route for millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain. Russia said on Monday that its air defences had shot down eight ballistic missiles fired by Ukraine, amid heightened tensions over Kyiv\u2019s use of western-supplied long-range arms against Russia. Ukraine fired US-made Atacms ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time last week after receiving approval from Washington, prompting a furious reaction from Moscow. Made by Lockheed Martin, the missiles can strike targets up to 190 miles (300km) away. Ballistic missiles fly much higher in the atmosphere than most rockets and can evade anti-air defences as they hit the ground at huge speeds. \u201cAir defence forces shot down eight ballistic missiles,\u201d the Russian defence ministry said in a daily briefing earlier today, without saying what kind of missiles were used or where they were shot down. Here are some more comments from the UK\u2019s foreign secretary David Lammy. \u201cWe are determined to ensure that both the ships, the enablers of those ships thwarting European and UK sanctions are hurt at this time,\u201d Lammy told reporters. Britain\u2019s assessment was that Vladimir Putin showed \u201cno signs at all of wanting a negotiation\u201d to end its war with Ukraine, he added. When asked about reports of 22-year-old James Scott Rhys Anderson being detained in the Russian border region of Kursk, Lammy said he had been \u201cupdated about that development\u201d and would \u201coffer this UK national all the support we can\u201d. Britain is imposing the biggest sanctions package against Russia\u2019s shadow fleet (tankers that have reportedly circumvented western restrictions on Russian oil), including 30 vessels, the UK\u2019s foreign minister David Lammy said. He urged G7 allies to stand with, and equip, Ukraine for as long as it needs. The UK has now sanctioned 73 tankers, the most of any nation, in efforts to cripple a major funding source for Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine, the British Foreign Office said. Half the ships sanctioned delivered more than \u00a33.4bn ($4.3bn) worth of oil and oil products in the past 12 months, a Foreign Office statement said. Two insurers were sanctioned for enabling the fleet. Before a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers, Lammy told reporters Britain was announcing \u201cthe biggest sanctions package of the Russian shadow fleet\u201d. He said: It\u2019s hugely important at this G7 that all colleagues \u2026 continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it lasts and we are confident that Ukraine can have the funds and the military equipment and kit to get through 2025. Jon Henley is the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent An ultranationalist, Moscow-friendly Nato critic is set to face a centre-right candidate in the runoff of Romania\u2019s presidential elections after a shock first-round result that has upended the country\u2019s politics and could jeopardise its support for Ukraine. With 99.98% of votes counted, C\u0103lin Georgescu, an independent who has praised Vladimir Putin as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d, was on 22.9%, with the reformist Elena Lasconi, of the Save Romania Union (USR), second on 19.17%. The result is one of the biggest electoral upsets in Romania\u2019s post-communist history and bears little relation to pre-election polls, which had shown the little-known Georgescu running at 5% and predicted the outgoing prime minister, the centre-left, pro-EU Marcel Ciolacu, would win comfortably. Ciolacu instead was in third on 19.15%. Romania\u2019s president has a semi-executive role that includes significant decision-making powers over national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments. The runoff is scheduled for 8 December, after parliamentary elections due next Sunday. The race is being watched well beyond Romania, which shares a 400-mile border with Ukraine and is seen by western allies as playing a key strategic role, hosting a Nato military base, donating a Patriot air defence battery and providing a vital transit route for millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain. Russia launched a missile attack against the central part of Odesa this morning, governor Oleh Kiper said. The Kyiv Independent reports: \u201cAs of now, we recorded six injured. Five are in a condition of moderate severity, their lives are not in danger. One person is in serious condition,\u201d said Oleksandr Kharlov, Kiper\u2019s deputy, in a comment for the media. \u201cCivilian infrastructure was damaged, namely residential buildings,\u201d Kiper said. Officials later said that the damage was caused by fallen missile debris. Russia launched the strike into a densely populated residential area where there are no military targets, damaging a school and a university sports hall, Kharlov reported. No students were reported as injured, as they were hiding in shelters \u2026 Odesa, lying on the Black Sea coast in southern Ukraine, is home to 1 million residents. The port city has been repeatedly targeted throughout the full-scale war. An earlier missile attack on Odesa on 18 November killed at least 10 people and injured over 50. We reported in an earlier post that officials said at least 10 people were injured in a Russian attack on Kharkiv this morning. Kharkiv oblast governor Oleh Syniehubov has now said that 23 people were injured in the Russian shelling, which occurred about 8:30am in the central part of the Ukrainian city. He said 14 people were hospitalised. \u201cAmong them, five patients are in the surgical department, five are treated on an outpatient basis, two are referred for neurosurgical treatment. Two more people are being examined,\u201d the governor wrote in a post on Telegram. Nato allies will need to spend much closer to 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on their militaries to implement the alliance\u2019s new defence plans, a Nato top military official has told Reuters (there is a Nato target for each member to spend 2% of economic output on defence). The chair of Nato\u2019s military committee, Rob Bauer, said: The overall percentage that is necessary to make the new plans executable is much closer to 3% of GDP than it is to 2%. I expect that under the new (Donald) Trump administration (in the US), there will be a much more intense discussion about how much more Europe and Canada need to spend, and that is a healthy and valid discussion to be had. The Ukrainian military has claimed responsibility for the strike on an oil depot overnight in Russia\u2019s western Kaluga region (see opening summary for more details). Vladislav Shapsha, the regional governor, said that there were no injuries and that three drones were destroyed. He did not say which facility was on fire. The Ukrainian military said it had also struck \u201ca number of important targets\u201d overnight in Russia\u2019s Bryansk and Kursk regions, which are adjacent to Ukraine. US president-elect Donald Trump has picked Republican representative Mike Waltz to be his national security adviser. After Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, Waltz called for the Biden administration to provide more weapons to Kyiv to help them push back Moscow\u2019s forces. But during an event last month, Waltz said there had to be a reassessment of the US\u2019s aims in Ukraine. \u201cIs it in America\u2019s interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?\u201d Waltz asked. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, which aired yesterday, Waltz said that Trump had been \u201cvery concerned\u201d about an escalation in fighting between Russia and Ukraine and that the war must be brought \u201cto a responsible end\u201d. \u201cWhat we need to be discussing is who\u2019s at that table, whether it\u2019s an agreement, an armistice, how to get both sides to the table, and then what\u2019s the framework of a deal,\u201d Waltz said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that the Kremlin had taken note of the comments and that Vladimir Putin had repeatedly signalled that Moscow was ready for dialogue over Ukraine. \u201cIndeed, from the circle of Trump supporters and those who have been nominated for future positions in the future administration, the word \u2018peace\u2019 or \u2018peace plan\u2019 is being heard,\u201d Peskov said, when asked about Waltz\u2019s comments. \u201cNo such words are being heard from the current (Biden) administration while provocative escalatory actions continue. That is the reality that we face,\u201d he said. Putin said Ukraine committing to drop its Nato membership ambitions and to hand over the entirety of four provinces claimed by Moscow are pre-conditions for peace talks. Ukraine says such terms would amount to an unacceptable capitulation for Kyiv. Ukraine\u2019s air force says it has shot down 71 out of 145 drones launched by Russia since Sunday evening, adding it had lost track of 71 more drones. Here is a little more information on James Scott Rhys Anderson, the British national the Russian military have reportedly captured fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in Russia\u2019s partially occupied Kursk region. Tass, the Russian news agency, quoted him as saying that he had served as a signalman in the British army for four years and then joined the International Legion of Ukraine, formed early on in Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. In Ukraine, Anderson reportedly served as an instructor for Ukrainian troops and was deployed to the Kursk region against his will. Tass published a video of the man saying in English that he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201chere\u201d. We have not yet been able to independently verify this information. Speaking at the family home in Banbury, Oxfordshire, Anderson\u2019s father, Scott, 41, told the Daily Mail that he fears his son will be tortured. The father-of-four said: I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be used as a bargaining chip but my son told me they torture their prisoners and I\u2019m so frightened he\u2019ll be tortured \u2026 We spoke on WhatsApp almost every day until he went on his most recent operation. He was acting as a signalman. James last came home only a month and a half ago. He said his Ukrainian commander had made a promise that he\u2019d contact me if he was ever killed or captured. When he called me and sent the video I was in complete shock and in tears. I could see straight away it was him. He looks frightened, scared and worried. I didn\u2019t want him to go. I did try to persuade him not to go \u2013 my whole family tried to persuade him. He wanted to go out there because he thought he was doing what was right. He was dead against what was happening to the Ukrainian people. Since he went out earlier this year, he\u2019s fallen in love with a Ukrainian although I don\u2019t know her name. I last spoke to him when I last saw him but we used to talk on WhatsApp every day. He\u2019d tell me where he\u2019d been and the things he\u2019d seen. He was alive, healthy. He sent me a video when he was at Sumy. Then he was being posted within the last week. Dan Sabbagh is the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor Russia and other adversaries of the UK are trying to use artificial intelligence to enhance cyber-attacks against the nation\u2019s infrastructure, the cabinet minister Pat McFadden will warn at a Nato conference in London on Monday. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will announce the creation of a research programme in London, called the Laboratory for AI Security Research (LASR), to keep on top of emerging threats as he warns there is a risk that Russia will try to knock out the electricity grid. There is a danger that artificial intelligence \u201ccould be weaponised against us,\u201d McFadden will warn, arguing that the UK is already engaged in the \u201cdaily reality\u201d of a \u201ccyberwar,\u201d with hacking efforts coming in particular from Russia. Over the past year, Russia\u2019s criminals and hackers have \u201cstepped up their attacks\u201d against the UK, he will add, and targeted other Nato allies who have been supporting Ukraine with military aid as it tries to fight off Russian aggression. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. A Russian attack on Ukraine\u2019s northeastern city of Kharkiv injured at least 10 people on Monday morning, its mayor, Oleh Syniehubov, said. The attack reportedly caused a fire on one of the city\u2019s central streets and damaged civilian infrastructure and cars. There is also a report in the Ukrainian outlet Ukrinform that Russian drones damaged an infrastructure facility in Zaporizhzhia, where a 16-year-old girl was injured in an attack. There was also a drone strike on Kyiv in the early hours of the morning, according to officials. There were no immediate report of casualties. \u201cAs a result of the attack by drones of the armed forces of the Russian Federation on Kyiv in the Dnipro district of the capital, a balcony window on the 9th floor of a 9-story residential building caught fire. Information about the victims is being ascertained,\u201d Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv city military administration, wrote on Telegram. Elsewhere, Russian forces attacked energy infrastructure in Ukraine\u2019s southern region of Mykolaiv overnight, its governor, Vitaliy Kim, said in a post on Telegram. The engineers restored power to most of the consumers facing affected by the power cuts in the attack\u2019s aftermath as of the morning. Here are some of the other latest developments in the war: Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he fears that Ukraine will become \u201ca testing ground\u201d for Russian munitions, with the country being targeted by nearly 500 drones in the past week, as well as more than 20 missiles. Though Russia\u2019s first ever use of the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile on Dnipro on Thursday captured global attention, on Sunday Zelenskyy highlighted the increased level of Shahed drone attacks. Ukraine says Russia has set up two factories to make the distinctive Iran-designed, delta-winged Shahed 136 drones, called Geran-2 by Moscow, about 800 miles from the border in Ukraine. Seven Ukrainian missiles and seven drones were destroyed overnight over Russia\u2019s Kursk, the governor of the region that borders Ukraine said. \u201cOur air defence fighters repelled the attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces last night,\u201d Kursk regional governor Alexei Smirnov wrote on his Telegram channel. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region in August, but has since lost more than 40% of the territory it had captured as Russian forces have mounted waves of counter-assaults, a senior Ukrainian military source told Reuters. Falling debris from destroyed Ukrainian drones sparked a fire at an industrial facility in Russia\u2019s Kaluga, officials said early on Monday. Vladislav Shapsha, the regional governor, said that there were no injuries and that three drones were destroyed. He did not say which facility was on fire. A British national has reportedly been captured by Russia\u2019s forces in the Kursk region while fighting for Ukraine. In a video posted on pro-war Russian Telegram channels on Sunday, a man wearing combat fatigues identifies himself as 22-year-old James Scott Rhys Anderson from the UK. The man, speaking with an English accent, says that he served as a signalman in the British army until 2023 before joining the International Legion in Ukraine to fight against Russia.",

The 75-year-old was arrested in Algiers on arrival from Paris on 16 November, it has now been reported by an Algerian press agency. His disappearance led to many calls for information about his whereabouts, including from Emmanuel Macron. A call for the author\u2019s release, as well as that of \u201call writers imprisoned for their ideas\u201d, was published by French publication Le Point on Saturday, written by Algerian novelist and Le Point columnist Kamel Daoud. \u201cThis new tragedy reflects an alarming reality in Algeria, where freedom of expression is only a memory in the face of repression, imprisonments and the surveillance of the whole of society,\u201d Daoud wrote.

An outspoken critic of Islamism and the Algerian regime, Sansal published his first novel at the age of 50.

In October, President Macron said he believes the land should be under Moroccan sovereignty, increasing tensions between France and Algeria. French publisher Gallimard, which has been publishing Sansal\u2019s books for 25 years, has hired lawyer Fran\u00e7ois Zimeray to defend the author, according to Agence France Presse. Meanwhile, Daoud is facing legal action of his own, after being accused of basing his novel Houris, which won France\u2019s top literary prize the Prix Goncourt earlier this month, on the life of one of his psychiatrist wife\u2019s patients. Sansal is known for his novels Le Serment des Barbares, which won France\u2019s Prix du Premier Roman, a prize for debut novels, in 1999, and Le Village de l\u2019Allemand, the first of his books to be translated into English, as An Unfinished Business (2010).

      "body": "<p>Kathy Bates plays an elegant game in Sky\u2019s new reboot of the 1980s legal drama Matlock. She\u2019s the eponymous lawyer Matty, forced out of retirement having fallen upon hard times, thanks to her no-good husband. Or at least that\u2019s what she says. There\u2019s a lot of mischievous observation about ageism and the opportunities it presents: people look through her, so she can glide past security guards; people underestimate her, so she can bedevil them in negotiations; people shout over her like she isn\u2019t there, so she destroys them in a way that\u2019s pleasing to watch.</p> <p>At first glance, this seems to be a straightforward whodunnit. But Bates would never have taken the role, she says, if that\u2019s all there was to it. The show is certainly enjoyable, warming even, a bit like being hugged. Whether Madeline \u201cMatty\u201d Matlock is appearing in her assumed persona (cuddly, wise) or her true identity (passionate, crusading), she is always agreeably on the side of the angels. \u201cWe\u2019ve had responses from people across all ages, across all demographics,\u201d says Bates. \u201cIt <em>is</em> a comforting thing to be able to put your mind somewhere else, to something entertaining, that also has a bit of a mystery. People need that right now \u2013 to get away from everything and get lost.\u201d </p> <p>Bates, now 76, has come a long way. We\u2019re speaking just after Halloween \u2013 and three people I know dressed up as Bates in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/30/misery-at-30-terrifying-look-toxicity-fandom-kathy-bates\">Misery, the 1990 film</a> about an obsessive fan who kidnaps, torments and eventually mutilates a famous author. It was epoch-makingly scary, won her an Oscar and properly launched her career, which had been highbrow but halting. Stephen King, who wrote the source book, went alone to a screening and at the end shouted: \u201cWatch out, she has a gun!\u201d to an empty room. It relaunched the career of James Caan, playing the writer, and according to Variety, helped \u201cpave the way for torture porn a decade or so later\u201d.</p>    <p>Matlock was written by Jennie Snyder Urman, creator and co-writer of artificial insemination romcom Jane the Virgin. The show has the satisfying clunk-click of Columbo, and the gently droll expectation-reversal of Murder She Wrote, with the homespun, sagacious grandma apparently out of her depth in the modern world among all the whip-smart young\u2019uns, but whaddaya know, somehow she\u2019s always one step ahead. And despite all Bates\u2019s talk of escapism, Matlock effortlessly lands some pretty serious points. \u201cEpisode three was about sexual harassment,\u201d Bates says. \u201cThe insight was that it\u2019s not just the pain of being molested by a superior, of having no power, it\u2019s also the choices you make after. What happens to young women, young actresses, traumatised by a professional encounter? Do they think, \u2018Well, I just have to find a new career for myself\u2019?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worked with someone not long ago who wasn't prepared. It enraged me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This, in turn, is part of a broader story: Matty is a wealthy, successful retiree, sucked back in for one last job \u2013 avenging her daughter, who has died of an opioid overdose. She wants to get into the law firm to find out which corporate deadbeat buried the documents that could have prevented this tragedy. It\u2019s a gruesomely compelling story, one that will be familiar to viewers of miniseries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/11/dopesick-michael-keaton-hulu-opioid-crisis-purdue-pharma\">Dopesick</a>, or readers of Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s Pulitzer-prize-winning novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/10/demon-copperhead-by-barbara-kingsolver-review-dickens-updated\">Demon Copperhead</a>: toxically addictive drugs were flogged as a pharmaceutical magic bullet, with devastating results.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this was going on way back in the early 00s,\u201d Bates says. \u201cCertainly, the Sacklers did so much damage. Their main argument was that people who were really in pain didn\u2019t get addicted, which was ridiculous. They\u2019re totally busted. There are still about 100,000 people dying of this.\u201d Indeed, there were an estimated 108,000 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2024/20240515.htm\">drug overdose deaths in the US last year</a>, of which 81,000 were opioid overdoses. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLCbQ9EQmO8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zLCbQ9EQmO8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Bates is a searching person, who won\u2019t be satisfied with gists and impressions. When it came to playing this grieving mother, she says, \u201cI remember asking someone: \u2018I don\u2019t have a child, how do I do this?\u2019 And my niece told me, \u2018When you have a child, you\u2019re savage about protecting that child.\u2019 I dug for other things in my life: regrets, wishing I could go back and make a different choice. I hurt this person, or that person, the guilt that\u2019s involved with it. We all have those things, I assume.\u201d</p> <p>Bates had brushed against the world of pain relief when she had ovarian cancer in 2003, and breast cancer in 2012. \u201cI was in a lot of pain, for some reason. I think it was because, well, we don\u2019t have to get too graphic about it. I kept asking for better medication and my doctors refused to give me what I wanted. Now I realise it was because of addiction: that hundreds of thousands of people had already become addicted. I took this one pill and \u2013 oh my God \u2013 my whole body was just gone. There was no pain anywhere. And I thought, \u2018I get it. I get why people want this.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>Bates was originally going to direct an episode of Matlock. In 2002, she directed episodes of the funeral home drama Six Feet Under, in which she starred as Bettina. \u201cI loved doing it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I dropped out after I got sick with cancer and didn\u2019t go back to it.\u201d But Matlock was, she says, a whole new world. \u201cI saw how difficult it was. The technical aspects of film-making have changed so much in the last 20 years. I saw what our wonderful director goes through, just energy-wise, to do these episodes. And I thought, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t do this.\u2019 I know I made the right choice.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s an executive producer on it, nevertheless, and watches the rushes with an impartial eye, finding it \u201cdelightful\u201d. She is not self-conscious about watching herself: \u201cI\u2019m not just looking at my performance, I\u2019m looking at the choices. It\u2019s always with an eye to making things the best they can be. One can get too precious. I have friends who have never seen themselves on screen, or have been very selective about what they\u2019ve watched. I think it\u2019s a shame, because the work is so good and I wish they would see it and enjoy what they\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s complex, having a screen self. Bates once explained her long career with the declaration: \u201cI\u2019m not a stunning woman.\u201d She was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/27/magazine/i-never-was-an-ingenue.html\">speaking to the New York Times</a> just after Misery, and added: \u201cI was never an ingenue. I\u2019ve always just been a character actor.\u201d In many ways, this is a golden age for such an actor: looking Hollywood-perfect is more of a garnish in a show that lives or dies on character.</p>    <p>There is some wonderful ensemble acting in Matlock. Skye P Marshall, as her steely boss and possible nemesis Olympia, is particularly noteworthy. Bates can be tantalisingly frank about screen mates from the past, who sadly go un-named. \u201cI worked with someone not long ago who was not prepared,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just enraged me, because it was just two of us. They were the lead. I felt it was very selfish, and kind of blind, not thinking about what they needed to do for the other actor. It was preposterous.\u201d</p> <p>When she moves on to talk about Marshall, the warmth returns. \u201cOne of my favourite Anne Tyler quotes is from The Accidental Tourist. I\u2019m paraphrasing but Tyler has her narrator say, \u2018It\u2019s not whether he loved her, it\u2019s that he loved who he was when he was with her.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what happens with all of us. We\u2019re different with everybody we meet, and we meet people that rejuvenate us and make us excited about being in the world. But that\u2019s rare. It\u2019s rare for me to have this connection with Skye \u2013 and then for Matty to have it with Olympia.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a thought that brings her back to the theme of ageism. \u201cOne wants to feel useful,\u201d Bates says. \u201cWhat happens when you get older \u2013 certainly if you lose your job and find it impossible to get back into the workforce \u2013 is that you miss the feeling of being part of something, the feeling of being helpful.\u201d She\u2019s talking about her character, of course, but the whole show and her performance in it may yet be many kinds of helpful.</p> <p>\u2022 Matlock begins on Sky on 26 November</p>",

Stephen King, who wrote the source book, went alone to a screening and at the end shouted: \u201cWatch out, she has a gun!\u201d to an empty room. It relaunched the career of James Caan, playing the writer, and according to Variety, helped \u201cpave the way for torture porn a decade or so later\u201d. Matlock was written by Jennie Snyder Urman, creator and co-writer of artificial insemination romcom Jane the Virgin. The show has the satisfying clunk-click of Columbo, and the gently droll expectation-reversal of Murder She Wrote, with the homespun, sagacious grandma apparently out of her depth in the modern world among all the whip-smart young\u2019uns, but whaddaya know, somehow she\u2019s always one step ahead. And despite all Bates\u2019s talk of escapism, Matlock effortlessly lands some pretty serious points. \u201cEpisode three was about sexual harassment,\u201d Bates says. \u201cThe insight was that it\u2019s not just the pain of being molested by a superior, of having no power, it\u2019s also the choices you make after. What happens to young women, young actresses, traumatised by a professional encounter? Do they think, \u2018Well, I just have to find a new career for myself\u2019?\u201d This, in turn, is part of a broader story: Matty is a wealthy, successful retiree, sucked back in for one last job \u2013 avenging her daughter, who has died of an opioid overdose. She wants to get into the law firm to find out which corporate deadbeat buried the documents that could have prevented this tragedy. It\u2019s a gruesomely compelling story, one that will be familiar to viewers of miniseries Dopesick, or readers of Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s Pulitzer-prize-winning novel Demon Copperhead: toxically addictive drugs were flogged as a pharmaceutical magic bullet, with devastating results. \u201cAll of this was going on way back in the early 00s,\u201d Bates says. \u201cCertainly, the Sacklers did so much damage. Their main argument was that people who were really in pain didn\u2019t get addicted, which was ridiculous. They\u2019re totally busted. There are still about 100,000 people dying of this.\u201d Indeed, there were an estimated 108,000 drug overdose deaths in the US last year, of which 81,000 were opioid overdoses. Bates is a searching person, who won\u2019t be satisfied with gists and impressions. When it came to playing this grieving mother, she says, \u201cI remember asking someone: \u2018I don\u2019t have a child, how do I do this?\u2019 And my niece told me, \u2018When you have a child, you\u2019re savage about protecting that child.\u2019 I dug for other things in my life: regrets, wishing I could go back and make a different choice. I hurt this person, or that person, the guilt that\u2019s involved with it. We all have those things, I assume.\u201d Bates had brushed against the world of pain relief when she had ovarian cancer in 2003, and breast cancer in 2012. \u201cI was in a lot of pain, for some reason. I think it was because, well, we don\u2019t have to get too graphic about it. I kept asking for better medication and my doctors refused to give me what I wanted. Now I realise it was because of addiction: that hundreds of thousands of people had already become addicted. I took this one pill and \u2013 oh my God \u2013 my whole body was just gone. There was no pain anywhere. And I thought, \u2018I get it. I get why people want this.\u2019\u201d Bates was originally going to direct an episode of Matlock. In 2002, she directed episodes of the funeral home drama Six Feet Under, in which she starred as Bettina. \u201cI loved doing it,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I dropped out after I got sick with cancer and didn\u2019t go back to it.\u201d But Matlock was, she says, a whole new world. \u201cI saw how difficult it was. The technical aspects of film-making have changed so much in the last 20 years. I saw what our wonderful director goes through, just energy-wise, to do these episodes. And I thought, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t do this.\u2019 I know I made the right choice.\u201d She\u2019s an executive producer on it, nevertheless, and watches the rushes with an impartial eye, finding it \u201cdelightful\u201d. She is not self-conscious about watching herself: \u201cI\u2019m not just looking at my performance, I\u2019m looking at the choices. It\u2019s always with an eye to making things the best they can be. One can get too precious. I have friends who have never seen themselves on screen, or have been very selective about what they\u2019ve watched. I think it\u2019s a shame, because the work is so good and I wish they would see it and enjoy what they\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d It\u2019s complex, having a screen self. Bates once explained her long career with the declaration: \u201cI\u2019m not a stunning woman.\u201d She was speaking to the New York Times just after Misery, and added: \u201cI was never an ingenue. I\u2019ve always just been a character actor.\u201d In many ways, this is a golden age for such an actor: looking Hollywood-perfect is more of a garnish in a show that lives or dies on character. There is some wonderful ensemble acting in Matlock. Skye P Marshall, as her steely boss and possible nemesis Olympia, is particularly noteworthy. Bates can be tantalisingly frank about screen mates from the past, who sadly go un-named. \u201cI worked with someone not long ago who was not prepared,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just enraged me, because it was just two of us. They were the lead. I felt it was very selfish, and kind of blind, not thinking about what they needed to do for the other actor. It was preposterous.\u201d When she moves on to talk about Marshall, the warmth returns. \u201cOne of my favourite Anne Tyler quotes is from The Accidental Tourist. I\u2019m paraphrasing but Tyler has her narrator say, \u2018It\u2019s not whether he loved her, it\u2019s that he loved who he was when he was with her.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what happens with all of us. We\u2019re different with everybody we meet, and we meet people that rejuvenate us and make us excited about being in the world. But that\u2019s rare. It\u2019s rare for me to have this connection with Skye \u2013 and then for Matty to have it with Olympia.\u201d It\u2019s a thought that brings her back to the theme of ageism. \u201cOne wants to feel useful,\u201d Bates says. \u201cWhat happens when you get older \u2013 certainly if you lose your job and find it impossible to get back into the workforce \u2013 is that you miss the feeling of being part of something, the feeling of being helpful.\u201d She\u2019s talking about her character, of course, but the whole show and her performance in it may yet be many kinds of helpful. \u2022 Matlock begins on Sky on 26 November",

Two decades on from his first spell turning around the supermarket chain, he has been appointed as its executive chair, tasked with repeating the feat. When Leighton, 71, left Asda in 2000 it was a scrappy challenger to Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s and he had just revived the chain and engineered a sale to Walmart for more than \u00a36bn. Now, it is a lumbering incumbent with 580 supermarkets plus more than 500 convenience stores and risks losing its spot as the UK\u2019s third-largest grocer to a new generation of cheaper discount rivals and small high street stores. First time round, Leighton helped save Asda from collapse with then chair Archie Norman, now chair of Marks &amp; Spencer. Here is what is in Leighton\u2019s in-tray as he tries to get the troubled business back on track once more. Finding a chief executive Leighton\u2019s No 1 job will be finding a retail expert to tackle the business basics that have gone awry since the \u00a36.8bn takeover in early 2021 by Blackburn\u2019s billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital. Several candidates are believed to have turned down the position \u2013 which has been vacant for three years. Mohsin Issa, one of Asda\u2019s co-owners, was leading the supermaket until September. Leighton, who has a reputation as a hands-on, down-to-earth executive, has a bulging contacts book from his slew of boardroom positions. These included roles at BHS, Leeds United and Royal Mail. Most recently, Leighton spent a somewhat bumpy eight years as chair of the Co-op Group, where he helped the mutual recover from the near collapse of its banking arm. At the Co-op, Leighton worked with Richard Pennycook, a turnaround specialist who helped restore Morrisons. He is now on the board of chicken supplier 2 Sisters and kitchen maker Howdens so appears an unlikely hire. The current Co-op boss, Shirine Khoury-Haq, has been unafraid to cut costs while pulling a strong team together, so may be a possibility, and there is also ambitious Co-op food boss, Matt Hood, to consider, although his experience is in small stores. Leighton is more likely to focus on those with large supermarket experience and perhaps an Asda connection. He will want young blood \u2013 someone with experience and energy who is prepared to build a name for themselves in a difficult job. Tackling debts The marketing expert is tasked with reversing the slide in sales as it wrestles with IT issues and heavy debts since the takeover. Asda\u2019s difficulties largely stem from its \u00a38.5bn debt burden, including lease liabilities, which has curbed its ability to cut prices and invest in stores. Net debt stands at \u00a33.8bn. Rival Morrisons sold off assets including property and petrol forecourts to lower its debts, but Asda has fewer options, having already raised millions from property deals. Rebooting IT Leighton will be keen to quickly plug the gaps on the shelves and other problems which have stemmed from struggles to separate Asda\u2019s IT systems from Walmart. The new systems have already required more than \u00a3800m of investment and the switchover is not expected to be completed by a December deadline, potentially leading to additional payments to the American grocery giant. Getting retail basics sorted Asda has struggled to find a new identity since its position as the UK\u2019s cheapest supermarket was stolen by discounters Aldi and Lidl. Leighton will need to decide whether to prioritise competing either on price, quality or range of products. The group has a major asset in its George clothing and homeware ranges, and had been closely connected to British farming. But it has a tricky road to navigate with neither the scale of Tesco nor the efficiency of Aldi and Lidl to help it compete on price. Climbing the league table Asda\u2019s stated aim was once to overtake Sainsbury\u2019s to become the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain. It has a market share of 12.5%, behind Sainsbury\u2019s on 15.5%, according to research firm Kantar, so it has plenty of ground to make up. Leighton\u2019s appointment does not exactly bring fresh eyes to that challenge \u2013 the supermarket has swapped one septuagenarian \u2013 the 75-year-old exiting chair Stuart Rose \u2013 for another.

England couldn\u2019t cope with the intermovement of the Hungarian forwards around the deep-lying centre-forward N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti. The following May they still hadn\u2019t worked out a plan and lost 7-1 in Budapest. But the introspection those games provoked the revolution led by Alf Ramsey, right-back in the Wembley game, and the World Cup win of 1966. Hungary, meanwhile, lost in the 1954 World Cup final, their only defeat in 51 games, and collapsed after the 1956 uprising.

      "body": "<p>Whether you\u2019re a fleet manager or a company car driver, the benefits of opting for a fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle are easy to understand, not least when it comes to tax savings. Things can get more complicated when it comes to deciding on your car, though.</p> <p>Fortunately, with a six-strong range made up of fully electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) that match dynamic style and performance with many more benefits, CUPRA helps make that choice just a bit easier.</p> <p><strong>1 The power of choice <br></strong>Businesses and their drivers have never had more choice when it comes to making the move to an EV or PHEV. It\u2019s certainly true of CUPRA, which now has two battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) \u2013 the Born and all-new Tavascan \u2013 and three PHEVs \u2013 the new Formentor, Leon and the forthcoming Terramar, meaning this disruptive brand has alternatively-powered cars to suit every requirement.</p> <p><strong>2 Switching made simple <br></strong>Switching to electrified cars can be a daunting prospect \u2013 both for businesses and drivers themselves. It\u2019s why CUPRA has come up with a number of ways \u2013 practical and financial \u2013 to help customers make a seamless transition. For Born or Tavascan company car drivers, that includes a free Ohme wallbox* charger or a Charging Service voucher with \u00a3700 credit.</p> <p>\u201cAs a fleet driver, you may be faced with five or six different EVs to choose from,\u201d says Martin Gray, national fleet manager for CUPRA UK. \u201cThe prospect of a free charger or free electricity is extremely beneficial.\u201d</p> <p>The benefits of switching to CUPRA don\u2019t end there. For example, all area fleet managers at the company hold a <a href=\"https://galileocertificate.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galileo Master Certificate</a>, an internationally recognised certificate in the renewable energy industry, to help answer your questions. Every new model comes with a five-year warranty of up to 90,000 miles for added peace of mind. And, in an industry where \u201cdisruptor\u201d brands are an increasing presence, CUPRA \u2013 which was formed in 2018 \u2013 can point, as a member of the Volkswagen group, to a mature servicing network built to ensure vehicles are kept on the road.</p>    <p><strong>3 Electrifying performance <br></strong>Paying less company car tax ranks high on the list for company car drivers. In the case of the five BEV and PHEV options from the manufacturer, this means considerable savings through the benefit-in-kind tax for EVs \u2013 you will currently pay just 2%^ for the Born and Tavascan EVs, and 5%^ for the Formentor, Leon and new Terramar PHEVs.</p> <p>Previously, company car drivers with EVs made savings but were presented with car choices that rarely stirred emotions. But with an electrified range that\u2019s bold, sporty and confident in nature, CUPRA is challenging the status quo, and dispelling the notion that EVs and PHEVs can\u2019t excite. \u201cPaying less company car tax by choosing an EV shouldn\u2019t mean diminishing the opportunity for driving enjoyment,\u201d says Gray. \u201cPeople are looking for something different. And that includes their choice of car.\u201d</p> <p>That the brand that calls Barcelona its home has a lineup of models designed to thrill shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. The clue\u2019s in the name \u2013 CUPRA comes from Cup and Racing, reflecting the brand\u2019s motorsport origins. Speed isn\u2019t just restricted to performance, either. Its electric models can charge from 10-80% in as little as 28 minutes with a 135kW charger<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p><strong>4 For forward-thinking businesses <br></strong>Its range of electric and hybrid vehicles is a symbol of its aim to reduce emissions \u2013 the BEV models combine high performance driving with zero tailpipe emissions. In the case of the Born VZ model, that means an all-electric range of up to 372 miles<sup>2</sup>. Impressive figures extend to the new Formentor plug-in hybrid too, which offers up to <a href=\"https://www.cupraofficial.co.uk/fleet/cupra-fleet/cupra-range\" rel=\"nofollow\">77 miles<sup>3</sup> of all-electric range</a> in V1 specification with a combined mpg of up to 706 miles.</p> <p>And for the brand, activity extends beyond reducing tailpipe emissions. It\u2019s working to revolutionise how its cars are built, with innovative materials such as hemp fabric, Seaqual yarn \u2013 derived from recycled marine plastic \u2013 and 3D flat-knitting technology, which reduces waste by creating fabrics precisely to measure.</p>    <p><strong>5 Dynamic design that stands out <br></strong>CUPRA\u2019s BEVs and PHEVs all share one overriding design goal \u2013 to be truly unmistakable. Take the just-launched, all-new Tavascan, with its standout exterior features including an illuminated logo and three-triangle eye signature headlights. \u201cThey give the Tavascan a domineering presence,\u201d says Ben Smith, product manager at CUPRA for the Born and Tavascan models. \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you see one approaching in your rear-view mirror, with its standout exterior features.\u201d</p> <p>Things are no less dramatic inside, with a meticulously designed interior that puts driver experience at the heart of everything. Highlights include supportive high-back bucket seats, a standout Sennheiser sound system and a cockpit-like feel that allows you to focus on your drive.</p> <p><em>Discover how CUPRA and its <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N65405.280036GUARDIAN/B32785012.409100134;dc_trk_aid=601195631;dc_trk_cid=226640040;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D;gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_755%7D;ltd=;dc_tdv=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">range of alternatively-fuelled vehicles</a> can help your business and its drivers embrace an electric future</em></p> <p><em>*Subject to <a href=\"https://www.cupraofficial.co.uk/fleet/cupra-fleet/charging-offer-terms\" rel=\"nofollow\">terms and conditions</a></em></p> <p>^<em>Based on the on 2024/5 tax year</em></p> <p><sub>1 </sub><sub>Estimated charging times for the standard specification Tavascan 2024.

      "bodyText": "Whether you\u2019re a fleet manager or a company car driver, the benefits of opting for a fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle are easy to understand, not least when it comes to tax savings. Things can get more complicated when it comes to deciding on your car, though. Fortunately, with a six-strong range made up of fully electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) that match dynamic style and performance with many more benefits, CUPRA helps make that choice just a bit easier. 1 The power of choice Businesses and their drivers have never had more choice when it comes to making the move to an EV or PHEV. It\u2019s certainly true of CUPRA, which now has two battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) \u2013 the Born and all-new Tavascan \u2013 and three PHEVs \u2013 the new Formentor, Leon and the forthcoming Terramar, meaning this disruptive brand has alternatively-powered cars to suit every requirement. 2 Switching made simple Switching to electrified cars can be a daunting prospect \u2013 both for businesses and drivers themselves. It\u2019s why CUPRA has come up with a number of ways \u2013 practical and financial \u2013 to help customers make a seamless transition. For Born or Tavascan company car drivers, that includes a free Ohme wallbox* charger or a Charging Service voucher with \u00a3700 credit. \u201cAs a fleet driver, you may be faced with five or six different EVs to choose from,\u201d says Martin Gray, national fleet manager for CUPRA UK. \u201cThe prospect of a free charger or free electricity is extremely beneficial.\u201d The benefits of switching to CUPRA don\u2019t end there. For example, all area fleet managers at the company hold a Galileo Master Certificate, an internationally recognised certificate in the renewable energy industry, to help answer your questions. Every new model comes with a five-year warranty of up to 90,000 miles for added peace of mind. And, in an industry where \u201cdisruptor\u201d brands are an increasing presence, CUPRA \u2013 which was formed in 2018 \u2013 can point, as a member of the Volkswagen group, to a mature servicing network built to ensure vehicles are kept on the road. 3 Electrifying performance Paying less company car tax ranks high on the list for company car drivers. In the case of the five BEV and PHEV options from the manufacturer, this means considerable savings through the benefit-in-kind tax for EVs \u2013 you will currently pay just 2%^ for the Born and Tavascan EVs, and 5%^ for the Formentor, Leon and new Terramar PHEVs. Previously, company car drivers with EVs made savings but were presented with car choices that rarely stirred emotions. But with an electrified range that\u2019s bold, sporty and confident in nature, CUPRA is challenging the status quo, and dispelling the notion that EVs and PHEVs can\u2019t excite. \u201cPaying less company car tax by choosing an EV shouldn\u2019t mean diminishing the opportunity for driving enjoyment,\u201d says Gray. \u201cPeople are looking for something different. And that includes their choice of car.\u201d That the brand that calls Barcelona its home has a lineup of models designed to thrill shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. The clue\u2019s in the name \u2013 CUPRA comes from Cup and Racing, reflecting the brand\u2019s motorsport origins. Speed isn\u2019t just restricted to performance, either. Its electric models can charge from 10-80% in as little as 28 minutes with a 135kW charger1. 4 For forward-thinking businesses Its range of electric and hybrid vehicles is a symbol of its aim to reduce emissions \u2013 the BEV models combine high performance driving with zero tailpipe emissions. In the case of the Born VZ model, that means an all-electric range of up to 372 miles2. Impressive figures extend to the new Formentor plug-in hybrid too, which offers up to 77 miles3 of all-electric range in V1 specification with a combined mpg of up to 706 miles. And for the brand, activity extends beyond reducing tailpipe emissions. It\u2019s working to revolutionise how its cars are built, with innovative materials such as hemp fabric, Seaqual yarn \u2013 derived from recycled marine plastic \u2013 and 3D flat-knitting technology, which reduces waste by creating fabrics precisely to measure. 5 Dynamic design that stands out CUPRA\u2019s BEVs and PHEVs all share one overriding design goal \u2013 to be truly unmistakable. Take the just-launched, all-new Tavascan, with its standout exterior features including an illuminated logo and three-triangle eye signature headlights. \u201cThey give the Tavascan a domineering presence,\u201d says Ben Smith, product manager at CUPRA for the Born and Tavascan models. \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you see one approaching in your rear-view mirror, with its standout exterior features.\u201d Things are no less dramatic inside, with a meticulously designed interior that puts driver experience at the heart of everything. Highlights include supportive high-back bucket seats, a standout Sennheiser sound system and a cockpit-like feel that allows you to focus on your drive. Discover how CUPRA and its range of alternatively-fuelled vehicles can help your business and its drivers embrace an electric future *Subject to terms and conditions ^Based on the on 2024/5 tax year 1 Estimated charging times for the standard specification Tavascan 2024. Test data obtained under standardised conditions for comparison purposes. Actual charging times will vary depending on various factors, including the selected trimline (and battery option, if available), the options you choose, the type of charger used, the level of charge in the battery, the age, type, condition and temperature of the charger and the battery, the power supply to and usage of the charger, ambient temperature at the point of use and other environmental factors. Charging time will be longer in cold weather. Charging times will also be affected by the charging curve (for example, once charging passes 80%, charging will slow to protect the battery\u2019s longevity) and will be longer if battery temperature activates safeguarding technology. Please consult a CUPRA retailer for further information. Data correct as at November 2024. The availability of [150kWh and 350kWh] chargers is currently limited in the UK. They are mainly located on selected motorways and major arterial routes. These chargers are not currently available in Northern Ireland and numbers are low in Scotland, Wales and rural parts of England.

      "bodyText": "We are now closing this blog but you can read our report here Weather forecasters and politicians have come in for strong criticism after hundreds of homes and businesses across the UK suffered devastating flooding in Storm Bert but the Met Office has said it issued sufficient warning There were growing complaints in south Wales, one of the areas most heavily hit, that the Met Office issued only a yellow warning, rather than an amber or red, and that not enough new defences had been put in place by the Welsh government since storms last wreaked havoc in the area four years ago The environment secretary has said the UK\u2019s flood defences are in the \u201cworst condition on record\u201d and promised the new Labour government has committed \u00a32.4bn to upgrade them Green party of England and Wales co-leader Adrian Ramsay linked the storm to climate change, saying \u201c[politicians] who want to stop the drive for net zero need to explain to those whose homes have been flooded during Storm Bert why they think climate action is a luxury There is still one severe flood warning, 125 flood warnings and 151 flood alerts in place in England. There are six flood warnings and 18 flood alerts in effect in Wales, and two flood alerts and three flood warnings in place in Scotland. These are some of the scenes at Billing Aquadrome in Northamptonshire, where residents are being evacuated and a severe flood warning remains in place. PA Media spoke to residents, who said it was the fourth time they had been forced to leave this year. Stan Brown, 67, said he had lived there for 25 years, but \u201cEnough is enough\u201d. Another resident, who did not want to be named, said the mood on Monday morning was \u201clow\u201d, and that many of her neighbours hope to move away soon. Green party of England and Wales MP Ellie Chowns has urged residents in Herefordshire to \u201cplease take care, and stay safe,\u201d and directed them to the local council website for information. The MP for North Herefordshire posted to social media to say she was \u201cvery concerned by the flooding caused by Storm Bert.\u201d Prime minister Keir Starmer has spoken to the first minister of Wales to offer addition support if it is needed, according to environment secretary Steve Reed. PA Media quotes him saying: The government has set up a Floods Resilience Taskforce and that is to make sure that the agencies on the ground in areas that are affected by flooding, as we\u2019ve seen this weekend, are able to offer whatever support they can to those people. It\u2019s important that that is done. The prime minister has spoken to the first minister of Wales and has offered additional support if they need it in Wales. So far, they haven\u2019t said that they need that. But we stand ready to offer whatever further support we can to those parts of Wales that have been the very hardest hit by the floods. He said that \u201cas a result of the previous government, we have flood defences that are in their worst condition on record,\u201d adding \u201cbecause of climate change, we\u2019re getting severe weather events much more frequently. That can mean droughts in the summer, but it means floods and storms in the winter.\u201d WalesOnline has been reporting from Cwmtillery, where Storm Bert triggered a landslide. It spoke to resident Rob Scholes, who said: Very quickly it turned into mud and stuff and nasty bits all over the place and at that point we decided it was not a good idea to open the front door. So we didn\u2019t. It was horrible. It really was horrible. Very quickly. More than anything else it was the speed at which it all happened. So much rain so quickly that it just overwhelmed us. Cwmtillery is just to the south of the Bannau Brycheiniog national park (formerly known as the Brecon Beacons), to the east of Merthyr Tydfil. Our Midlands correspondent Jessica Murray reports on the flooding in Tenbury Wells here: Parts of Tenbury Wells town centre in Worcestershire were flooded by the Kyre Brook on Sunday after a wall collapsed, scattering debris across the road. The flooding was reportedly exacerbated when a tractor was driven through the flooded high street, causing a bow wave which broke windows and forced doors open. Louise Preston, 20, who owns a shop in the town, told PA: Our business, personally, has not suffered anywhere near as badly as it could have done. What has been really heart-warming to see is the community spirit. We\u2019ve had police support officers down, the firemen were marvellous yesterday, Tesco has been giving people free cleaning materials, the cafes - who themselves have suffered - have been donating free tea and coffee to everybody. Harriet Baldwin, the Conservative MP for West Worcestershire, has described the flooding hitting the town as \u201cabsolutely devastating.\u201d The environment secretary has said the UK\u2019s flood defences are in the \u201cworst condition on record\u201d and promised the new Labour government has committed \u00a32.4bn to upgrade them. PA Media quotes Steve Reed saying: This government inherited from the previous government flood defences that are in the worst condition on record. Now we\u2019ve allocated in the budget \u00a32.4bn to upgrade our flood defences, better maintain those we already have, build new flood defences to keep people safe. That will make a difference and that\u2019s what we need to do to cope much better with the impact of climate change that we\u2019re seeing with these floods. Earlier Green party of England and Wales co-leader Adrian Ramsay also linked the storm to climate change, issuing a challenge to politicians who oppose the UK\u2019s moves towards net zero. He posted to social media to say: MPs like Kemi Badenoch who want to stop the drive for net zero need to explain to those whose homes have been flooded during Storm Bert why they think climate action is a luxury. These storms are increasingly driven by climate breakdown. We need to act faster, not drag our feet. England still has one severe flood warning, 138 flood warnings, and 160 flood alerts in place. Wales has seven flood warnings and 19 flood alerts. Scotland has two flood alerts and three flood warnings. Flood warnings are not currently issued for Northern Ireland. Chippenham town centre has been inundated with water, and the BBC has spoken to Becky Lyons who runs a pet shop there, which is under water. She said \u201cIt\u2019s reached my storage area, so all the stock ready for Christmas, it\u2019s a bit disheartening to say the least. I feel a bit empty and numb. I\u2019ve put everything into this shop. Customers and people in the high street said they will come and help us clear out when we can get in. We have such a great community spirit.\u201d Here are some of the latest images from Northamptonshire, where there is still a severe flood warning in place for the River Nene at Billing Aquadrome and nearby business parks. The BBC reports that 57 children were rescued from a school bus that got stranded in floodwaters near Eckington Bridge over the River Avon. It says the Hereford and Worcester fire and rescue service used two boats to effect the rescue, and nobody was reported injured. The students were believed to be from Prince Henry\u2019s High School, which is in Evesham, Worcestershire. Our video team has put together this report featuring footage of the aftermath of Storm Bert in the UK and Ireland. People across England and Wales have been experiencing severe travel disruption due to flooding. Linda from Manchester who had been visiting York with family - one of whom is partially disabled, described the travel chaos caused by the weather at Leeds station on Sunday night, following their 9pm train being cancelled. \u201cA little panic set in but we managed to get to Leeds by 10.30pm and found it chaotic. The last train back was moved to two different platforms which had us running up and down stairs and lifts only for it to then be delayed and finally cancelled. \u201cBy 11pm platform 11D in Leeds was heaving. Staff said they\u2019d organise transport and herded us to the concourse \u2013 there was lots of confusion. Outside, a steady flow of taxis wound their way through cordoned off sections of highway with no-one knowing which was for whom. We eventually got one, getting home at 1.20am.\u201d Lucy, 19, who is a PPE student at the University of Oxford is stuck in Bristol after visiting a friend on the weekend. Her and two friends Fred and Livia tried to get a train back to Oxford at 6pm but it was cancelled. They then booked an Uber but only managed to get to the outskirts of Bristol before turning back due to flooded roads. \u201cLuckily we could stay overnight with our friend Anna but it meant there were four of us in one room. I ended up on the floor \u2013 thankfully I had a sleeping bag. Two of us have compulsory tutorials today that we will have to miss. Some tutors can be understanding and others believe you shouldn\u2019t leave uni during term time. Thankfully the tutor of the tutorial I\u2019ll be missing is quite understanding. We\u2019re getting an Uber now as it looks like the roads are OK but it\u2019s going to cost about \u00a3100.\u201d If you\u2019ve been affected by flooding from Storm Bert, you can share your experience here. In Wales there are seven flood warnings still in place, with 20 flood alerts. The River Monnow, River Towy, River Wye and River Dee are all affected. The flood warnings can be checked here. In England there is one remaining severe flood warning, for the Billing Aquadrome and nearby business parks near the River Nene in Northampton. The Environment Agency says \u201cdeep and fast flowing\u201d water may be a danger to life. Additionally in England there are 143 flood warnings where flooding is expected, and 180 flood alerts where flooding is possible. You can check the flood warnings for England here. The data was updated in the last ten minutes. In Scotland there are two flood alerts and three flood warnings. They affect Easter Ross and Great Glen, Wester Ross, and Strath Oykel, and can be checked here. Chippenham is flooded after the River Avon burst its banks. Drone imagery shows the centre of the town under water. There are a significant number of road closures in Wiltshire. Nick Smith, the Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney in south Wales, has said he will raise in parliament in Westminster additional support for the Welsh government to support those affected by flooding. In a post to social media he wrote: Following the devastating damage caused by Storm Bert yesterday, I\u2019d like to thank the emergency services and our council staff as well as all residents who stepped up to help out in their communities. My sympathies are with all those who have been affected. I know some have suffered terrible damage, and many will be concerned about the reported landslips. I spoke to many councillors yesterday who put in a shift in support of residents, and, as ever, our communities have come together to help one another. I intend to raise this matter in Parliament to ask for support for the Welsh government to help them deal with the impact the storm has had on our communities. Labour MP for Rhondda and Ogmore, Chris Bryant, was on Sky News this morning, saying that some people affected by the flooding were likely to lose everything. He told viewers: A lot of people, especially when finances are really, really tough, the last bill they pay is probably the insurance bill. So there are lots of people who will have lost everything. Now I hope that the Welsh government will be able to step in with some kind of financial support. He praised the local council in Pentre, which had been affected by flooding in Storm Dennis in February 2020. He said that following that incident, more than \u00a31m had been spent expanding a culvert there, and that seemed to have helped the area avoid flooding this time around from Storm Bert. Bryant said he had set up a fundraiser for local homes and businesses affected by flooding in Rhondda. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) have said they will investigate whether sufficient warnings of Storm Bert and the flooding it caused were given to people in advance. Sian Williams, head of operations north west for NRW, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday: That is a report that we\u2019ve had from a few different places, saying that their people didn\u2019t have enough warning yesterday morning, so absolutely that is something that we need to look at. Did something go wrong? Were the river levels that we use as triggers set in the wrong place? We don\u2019t know yet what the timeline was, but it is important that we review it, that we look at it, that we learn those lessons. If we need to do it sooner, then that\u2019s definitely something that we will look at doing. Jamie Grierson and Steven Morris report for the Guardian Forecasters and politicians have come in for strong criticism after hundreds of homes and business across the UK suffered devastating flooding in Storm Bert. There were complaints in south Wales, one of the areas most heavily hit, that the Met Office issued only a yellow warning rather than an amber or red one, and growing calls for more investment in flood defences. National Resources Wales (NRW) said that the flooding was so bad in some places because the storm got stuck rather than moving through, while the Welsh government said it could not stop every home and business being flooded during such \u201ctraumatic\u201d storms. Hundreds of homes were left underwater, roads were turned into rivers and winds of up to 82mph were recorded across parts of the country. Homes in the parish of Cwmtillery, Blaenau Gwent, were evacuated after a landslip. Here is a picture of passengers waiting at Paddington in London, where Great Western Railway has cancelled a significant number of services due to flooding in the west of England. D\u0175r Cymru has issued a \u201cboil water\u201d notice for ten areas in Wales after the Tynywaun Water Treatment Works in Treherber was affected by flooding. Water customers in Blaenrhondda, Blaencwm, Tynewydd, Treherbert, Treorchy, Cwm-parc, Pentre, Ton Pentre, Gelli, Tonypandy have been affected. In the notice, the water company says: We ask that all customers boil their water with immediate effect before using it for drinking purposes. We are sorry for the inconvenience this will cause but we are working to restore supplies back to normal as soon as possible. We have delivered bottled water to customers on our Priority Services Register and care homes while also working with key sites such as hospitals. There is a postcode checker to see if your suppply has been affected. D\u0175r Cymru serves about 1.4m households in total. Our community team would like to hear from you if you have been affected by Storm Bert. They are also interested in hearing from those experiencing travel disruption. You can get in touch with them here. PA Media reports National Highways has said the A5 in Northamptonshire is closed in both directions between the A43 (Towcester) and A422/A508 (Old Stratford) due to \u201csevere flooding\u201d in the area. Northamptonshire Police have warned people in the area \u201cwhile the flooding remains ongoing, please avoid all unnecessary travel and do not drive through floodwater of any depth \u2013 it is not worth the risk.\u201d In Yate in the west of England, BBC Bristol reports that about 100 properties were flooded overnight, and residents had to be evacuated. PA Media reports that the most severe flood warnings, meaning there is danger to life, have been issued for the River Monnow in south-east Wales for Monmouth and Skenfrith. In England, a severe flood warning has been issued for Billing Aquadrome and surrounding parks next to the River Nene in Northampton. Here are some pictures from Pontypridd this morning, where businesses are being protected with sandbags. A row is brewing in Pontypridd, where residents say they were not given enough warning of the impending storm, and that local services weren\u2019t prepared. One local person told the BBC \u201c there was no preemption of it by our council, our local authorities. We feel they\u2019ve really, really dropped the ball on this one.\u201d Welsh first minister Eluned Morgan said it had been \u201ca really difficult weekend.\u201d Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough council leader Andrew Morgan said in a press conference on Sunday he was \u201camazed\u201d that only a yellow warning had been given by the Met Office. The Met Office has said that, as with every named storm, it will carry out a review of its forecasts and warnings. Network Rail has advised passengers of severe disruption between Milton Keynes and Rugby due to flooding at Northampton, after the the River Nene burst its banks. Carole Bayliss, strategy director for Network Rail\u2019s West Coast South route, said: \u201cWe\u2019re very sorry to passengers disrupted by flooding in Northampton, which will mean major disruption on the West Coast Main Line today. While our teams monitor water levels and wait until it\u2019s safe to fully assess the extent of flood damage to the railway, we\u2019re urging passengers to check with National Rail Enquiries before travelling.\u201d In its most recent update, the Met Office has said \u201cimpacts from Storm Bert will continue to cause disruption as we go through today.\u201d Andy Page, Met Office chief meteorologist, is quoted as saying: Impacts from Storm Bert will continue to cause disruption as we go through today, and multiple warnings are in place for wind and rain. While the risk of any snowfall has now diminished, rainfall will affect much of the UK today, in particular some southwestern parts of England and South Wales, but the heaviest rain will ease from these areas through the day. The strong southerly winds continue today and warnings are in place for central, southern and eastern England, Northern Ireland and western Scotland where gusts could peak at 60 mph and could even reach more than 70 mph along some exposed coasts. He stated that \u201cwarnings could still be amended, possibly at short notice,\u201d and urged peopel to check the latest forecasts. Great Western Railway has \u201csuspended train services on all key routes\u201d, and advised people not to travel. The train operator says that \u201cflooding and fallen trees have blocked access at key locations\u201d, and says that tickets for today will be accepted on Tuesday and Wednesday \u201cincluding on peak-time services\u201d or claim a full refund. South Wales bore the much of the brunt of the flooding . A major incident was declared in the Rhondda Cynon Taf region on Sunday amid fears of a more significant impact than during Storm Dennis in 2020. Between 200 and 300 properties in the area were affected by flooding, with local leaders expressing surprise at the extent of the rainfall. Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan said it had been \u201ca really difficult weekend\u201d. I think this is the second time that many of those have suffered as a result of the storm. There\u2019s been huge investments since the last storm hit, so we\u2019ve managed to protect lots more properties than last time. But obviously this is absolutely devastating just before Christmas for those people who have been impacted.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our blog covering the impact of Storm Bert with the UK braced for further disruption on Monday after \u201cdevastating\u201d flooding over the weekend. As PA Media reports, the last of the Met Office\u2019s rain warnings ended at 11.59pm on Sunday but strong winds persist and rain from high ground will reach rivers, which could disrupt clean-up efforts. More than 200 flood alerts remain in place for England and Wales and travel issues are set to continue. Over the weekend, hundreds of homes were flooded, with roads turned into rivers and winds of up to 82mph recorded. At least five deaths have been reported in England and Wales since the storm hit.",

      "body": "<p>Every third woman across the EU has experienced physical violence, including threats, or sexual violence, a survey has revealed, in what one official described as an \u201cinvisible epidemic\u201d.</p> <p>The findings released on Monday <a href=\"https://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2024/one-three-women-eu-have-experienced-violence\">are based on responses from women</a> aged 18 to 74 from across the EU\u2019s 27 member states.</p> <p>The survey offered a glimpse of the wide-reaching impact that violence has had on the 229 million women who live across the bloc, said Sirpa Rautio, the director of the EU\u2019s Agency for Fundamental Rights. \u201cOne-third of them have been slapped, hit, kicked, raped or threatened with such violence,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the EU, in 2024, women\u2019s safety still cannot be guaranteed.\u201d</p> <p>In what she described as a \u201csad reality\u201d, the figures remained virtually unchanged from those published in a 2014 <a href=\"https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2014/violence-against-women-eu-wide-survey-main-results-report\">EU-wide survey</a> on violence against women. \u201cA decade later, we continue to witness the same shocking levels of violence that affect one in three women.\u201d</p> <p>The survey, released on the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/ending-violence-against-women-day\">International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women</a>, also found that one in six women in the EU had experienced sexual violence, including rape, during adulthood.</p> <p>About 19% of women said they had faced violence or threats of violence from a person living in their household. \u201cThe home is still a dangerous place for many women,\u201d said Rautio.</p> <p>The survey also polled women on their workplace experiences, finding that one in three had been sexually harassed, with reports ranging from inappropriate jokes to staring and sexual advances. For women aged 18 to 29, the figure climbed to 42% of respondents.</p> <p>Just 14% of women said they had reported the violence to police. Those who had chosen not to report cited worries about their safety, feelings of shame or a lack of trust in the authorities. \u201cThis underreporting means that we have an invisible epidemic of violence in Europe,\u201d said Rautio.</p> <p>Carlien Scheele, the director of the European Institute for Gender Equality, linked the low reporting rates to the \u201cshame and blame\u201d that continues to be associated with violence against women. \u201cThe troubling reality is not just how many women experience violence in the EU, it\u2019s also how many women don\u2019t report experiences of violence,\u201d she said, calling for the adoption of victim-centred and culturally sensitive approaches that would allow women to feel safer coming forward.</p> <p>Scheele described the findings as particularly worrying given the proliferation of misogynistic content on social media. \u201cWhat we do see in the European Union is that there is a rise of anti-gender, let\u2019s say, narratives, strategies, movements,\u201d said Scheele. \u201cAnd so, women are being ridiculed, and this anti-gender sentiment is being used to change things in society that I think is worsening the situation we live in.\u201d</p> <p>The stakes of the battle are high, as violence against women <a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-based-violence/costs-of-gender-based-violence?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=EIGE's%20new%20study%20indicates%20that,housing%20aid%20and%20child%20protection.\">costs the EU</a> an estimated \u20ac289bn (\u00a3240bn) a year, said Scheele, citing a figure <a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-based-violence/costs-of-gender-based-violence?language_content_entity=en#:~:text=EIGE's%20new%20study%20indicates%20that,housing%20aid%20and%20child%20protection.\">linked</a> to lost economic output and the cost of public services such as legal and housing aid. \u201cSo apart from the human suffering and the violation of human rights and women\u2019s rights, it also comes with huge economic costs for the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months, the issue of violence against women has catapulted to the top of the news agenda as 51 men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/23/pelicot-trial-it-is-gisele-name-that-will-be-remembered\">stand trial</a> in a mass rape case in France.</p> <p>Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, whose husband has admitted to drugging her and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her over the span of a decade, has been hailed as a feminist hero after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/20/gisele-pelicot-public-trial-force-debate-culture-lawyers\">she insisted that the trial be held in public</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have shame, it\u2019s for them,\u201d she has said, offering up a view that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/18/solidarity-for-gisele-pelicot-around-world-france-rape-trial\">galvanised conversations</a> about sexual violence around the world.</p> <p>Scheele said she was among the many who were closely following the trial. \u201cIs it going to change public opinion? I hope so,\u201d she said. \u201cI really hope that people sincerely see what is happening in our societies. It\u2019s a pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201chorrendous\u201d Pelicot case and the figures released on Monday were among the many signals that the level of violence against women was a \u201ccrisis\u201d, she added. \u201cIn a crisis situation, be it Covid or the energy crisis, the European Union got its act together at rapid speed.\u201d</p> <p>Now she wanted to see the same approach applied to women\u2019s safety across the bloc. \u201cI really sincerely hope that what we have published today, what we will publish in the future, what we have published in the past and cases like the one of Madame Pelicot, that it will change public opinion,\u201d said Scheele. \u201cAnd most importantly, it will change the attitude of perpetrators and possible perpetrators.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every third woman across the EU has experienced physical violence, including threats, or sexual violence, a survey has revealed, in what one official described as an \u201cinvisible epidemic\u201d. The findings released on Monday are based on responses from women aged 18 to 74 from across the EU\u2019s 27 member states. The survey offered a glimpse of the wide-reaching impact that violence has had on the 229 million women who live across the bloc, said Sirpa Rautio, the director of the EU\u2019s Agency for Fundamental Rights. \u201cOne-third of them have been slapped, hit, kicked, raped or threatened with such violence,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the EU, in 2024, women\u2019s safety still cannot be guaranteed.\u201d In what she described as a \u201csad reality\u201d, the figures remained virtually unchanged from those published in a 2014 EU-wide survey on violence against women. \u201cA decade later, we continue to witness the same shocking levels of violence that affect one in three women.\u201d The survey, released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, also found that one in six women in the EU had experienced sexual violence, including rape, during adulthood. About 19% of women said they had faced violence or threats of violence from a person living in their household. \u201cThe home is still a dangerous place for many women,\u201d said Rautio. The survey also polled women on their workplace experiences, finding that one in three had been sexually harassed, with reports ranging from inappropriate jokes to staring and sexual advances. For women aged 18 to 29, the figure climbed to 42% of respondents. Just 14% of women said they had reported the violence to police. Those who had chosen not to report cited worries about their safety, feelings of shame or a lack of trust in the authorities. \u201cThis underreporting means that we have an invisible epidemic of violence in Europe,\u201d said Rautio. Carlien Scheele, the director of the European Institute for Gender Equality, linked the low reporting rates to the \u201cshame and blame\u201d that continues to be associated with violence against women. \u201cThe troubling reality is not just how many women experience violence in the EU, it\u2019s also how many women don\u2019t report experiences of violence,\u201d she said, calling for the adoption of victim-centred and culturally sensitive approaches that would allow women to feel safer coming forward. Scheele described the findings as particularly worrying given the proliferation of misogynistic content on social media. \u201cWhat we do see in the European Union is that there is a rise of anti-gender, let\u2019s say, narratives, strategies, movements,\u201d said Scheele. \u201cAnd so, women are being ridiculed, and this anti-gender sentiment is being used to change things in society that I think is worsening the situation we live in.\u201d The stakes of the battle are high, as violence against women costs the EU an estimated \u20ac289bn (\u00a3240bn) a year, said Scheele, citing a figure linked to lost economic output and the cost of public services such as legal and housing aid. \u201cSo apart from the human suffering and the violation of human rights and women\u2019s rights, it also comes with huge economic costs for the European Union.\u201d In recent months, the issue of violence against women has catapulted to the top of the news agenda as 51 men stand trial in a mass rape case in France. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, whose husband has admitted to drugging her and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her over the span of a decade, has been hailed as a feminist hero after she insisted that the trial be held in public. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have shame, it\u2019s for them,\u201d she has said, offering up a view that has galvanised conversations about sexual violence around the world. Scheele said she was among the many who were closely following the trial. \u201cIs it going to change public opinion? I hope so,\u201d she said. \u201cI really hope that people sincerely see what is happening in our societies. It\u2019s a pandemic.\u201d The \u201chorrendous\u201d Pelicot case and the figures released on Monday were among the many signals that the level of violence against women was a \u201ccrisis\u201d, she added. \u201cIn a crisis situation, be it Covid or the energy crisis, the European Union got its act together at rapid speed.\u201d Now she wanted to see the same approach applied to women\u2019s safety across the bloc. \u201cI really sincerely hope that what we have published today, what we will publish in the future, what we have published in the past and cases like the one of Madame Pelicot, that it will change public opinion,\u201d said Scheele. \u201cAnd most importantly, it will change the attitude of perpetrators and possible perpetrators.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An ultranationalist, Moscow-friendly Nato critic is set to face a centre-right candidate in the runoff of Romania\u2019s presidential elections after a shock first-round result that has upended the country\u2019s politics and could jeopardise its support for Ukraine. With 99.98% of votes counted, C\u0103lin Georgescu, an independent who has praised Vladimir Putin as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d, was on 22.9%, with the reformist Elena Lasconi, of the Save Romania Union (USR), second on 19.17%. The result, one of the biggest electoral upsets in Romania\u2019s post-communist history, triggered the swift resignation as leader of the country\u2019s centre-left, pro-EU party of prime minister Marcel Ciolacu, the pre-ballot frontrunner, who finished third on 19.15%. The runoff \u2013 the first for three decades without a candidate from Ciolacu\u2019s Social Democrats (PSD) \u2013 is due on 8 December, after parliamentary elections next Sunday. Romania\u2019s president has a semi-executive role with significant decision-making powers over national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments. The race is being watched well beyond Romania, which shares a 400-mile border with Ukraine and is seen by western allies as playing a key strategic role, hosting a Nato military base, donating a Patriot air defence battery and providing a vital transit route for millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain. \u201cTonight, the Romanian people cried out for peace. And they shouted very loudly, extremely loudly,\u201d Georgescu, a 62-year-old university professor who was polling at 5% before the elections, said on Sunday night. \u201cWe are strong and brave, many of us voted, and even more will do so in the second round.\u201d Lasconi, a former war correspondent and TV news presenter, joined the centre-right USR in 2018 and became party leader this year. Twice elected as mayor of the small town of C\u00e2mpulung, she believes in boosting defence spending and helping Ukraine. Georgescu, who left the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) after it criticised his pro-Russia, anti-Nato stance, ran a viral TikTok campaign focused on reducing Romania\u2019s need for food and energy imports and ending aid for Ukraine. The election focused largely on Romania\u2019s soaring cost of living: the Black Sea country has the EU\u2019s biggest share of people at risk of poverty, as well as the bloc\u2019s highest inflation rate and largest budget deficit, at 8% of economic outlook. Georgescu said on Facebook after he had voted that he was standing \u201cfor those who feel they do not matter, and actually matter the most\u201d. Later, he said the results were \u201can extraordinary awakening\u201d of the people. \u201cThere was an expectation, a desire for a revenge vote, a protest vote, on the part of people with many frustrations, with revolt, with anger towards the system,\u201d international relations expert Valentin Naumescu told media outlet Digi24.ro. Social media had reached many voters who may not even have had a clear idea of who Georgescu was, Naumescu said, \u201cbombarding them with these ideas, that he is a true Romanian, a strong leader for Romania, that he has a plan, that it has solutions\u201d. Georgescu, a sustainable development consultant who has worked for several UN bodies, has called Nato\u2019s ballistic missile defence shield over Romania a \u201cshame of diplomacy\u201d and said the alliance would not protect its members from Russian attack. He has also described Corneliu Codreanu, the leader of Romania\u2019s 1930s fascist Iron Guard, and Ion Antonescu, who led its pro-German wartime government and was executed for his part in Romania\u2019s Holocaust, as national heroes. In other interviews, Georgescu has said Romania was not ready to independently handle diplomacy and strategy and that its best chance lay with \u201cRussian wisdom\u201d. He has refused to explicitly say he supports Russia in its war on Ukraine. Radu Magdin, a political analyst, said the difference between the far-right independent\u2019s single-digit poll popularity and the first-round result was without precedent since Romania emerged from communism in 1989. \u201cNever in our 34 years of democracy have we seen such a surge compared to surveys,\u201d Magdin told Reuters. Cristian P\u00eervulescu, a political scientist, told Agence-France Presse: \u201cThe far right is by far the big winner of this election.\u201d Unlike neighbouring Hungary and nearby Slovakia, Romania had largely resisted populist nationalism, but with the far-right AUR\u2019s George Simion finishing fourth, about one-third of voters on Sunday cast their ballots for far-right candidates. The result was also further confirmation of a global trend to oust incumbent parties: the leaders of Romania\u2019s two ruling parties, Ciolacu\u2019s Social Democrats (PSD) and the centre-right National Liberal party (PNL), were both eliminated in the first round. It is the first time in Romania\u2019s post-communist history that the PSD has not had a candidate in the second round of a presidential race. About 9.4 million people \u2013 52.5% of eligible voters \u2013 cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau. Simion is facing accusations of meeting Russian spies, a claim he has denied. Sergiu Mi\u0219coiu, a political scientist, said Russian meddling could not be ruled out given Georgescu\u2019s stance on Ukraine and the discrepancy between the polls and the result. The Kremlin said on Monday it was not well acquainted with Georgescu\u2019s views, although it \u201cclearly understood\u201d the stance of the current Romanian leadership, which its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said was hostile to Russia. Other analysts suggested Georgescu\u2019s shock success could have a contagion effect on the parliamentary elections scheduled on 1 December, meaning it may prove very difficult for the winning parties to form a stable new coalition government.

The change of government prompted celebrations from progressive Poles and relief in Brussels, where PiS had put Poland on a course of conflict with European bodies.</p> <p>But the PiS-aligned Duda still had more than a year left on his term and has been able to veto legislation the government puts forward. That turns next May\u2019s vote into essentially a referendum on whether Poles want Tusk\u2019s government to be able to rule freely or not.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still in an extended election cycle, and the presidential vote will be absolutely make or break for the government,\u201d said Wojciech Przybylski, of the Visegrad Insight thinktank in Warsaw. \u201cDepending on the result, the government will be able to effectively govern and reform, or it won\u2019t.\u201d </p> <p>On Saturday, Tusk\u2019s Civic Coalition announced that the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, would be its candidate in next spring\u2019s vote, after he won a primary inside the party against the foreign minister, Rados\u0142aw Sikorski.</p>    <p>\u201cI have a very strong mandate and a lot of energy, determination and courage to beat PiS,\u201d Trzaskowski said on Saturday. He narrowly lost the last presidential election to Duda in 2020, though faced a situation where many of the levers of state and the public media were stacked in Duda\u2019s favour.</p> <p>Poland remains deeply polarised, and next year\u2019s vote is also expected to be close-run. Other candidates are expected to stand in the vote, but a second-round runoff is likely to be required and will most probably be between Trzaskowski and the PiS candidate.</p> <p>At a ceremony in Krak\u00f3w on Sunday afternoon, PiS announced that its candidate would be Karol Nawrocki, who previously headed a government history institute. The party\u2019s powerful chair, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, decided on Nawrocki after pondering several possible options; Duda has served two terms and cannot stand again. Trzaskowski contrasted the PiS process with the brief but energetic primary campaign he fought with Sikorski. \u201cIn PiS, one vote matters, while we value every vote, and that\u2019s how we differ,\u201d he said.</p>    <p>Tusk won last year\u2019s vote on a platform that the election was the \u201clast chance\u201d to save Poland and claiming that another PiS term would mark the end of democracy in the country \u2013 succeeding with a template to beat populists that has often failed to work, notably in the US last month.</p> <p>In its first months, the new government made a few bold steps. The new justice minister, the respected law professor and rights defender Adam Bodnar, made enough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/new-polish-justice-minister-will-seek-any-niche-to-undo-rule-of-law-breaches\">positive noises</a> about improving the rule-of-law climate in Poland for Brussels to unblock billions of euros of funding frozen under the previous government. A new management <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/battle-over-polish-tv-station-donald-tusk-bid-to-remake-poland\">took over at public television</a> \u2013 which had functioned as a propaganda wing of the PiS government and spewed hate about migrants, LGBTQ+ people and other minorities \u2013 and promised to turn it into a neutral public broadcaster.</p> <p>But Tusk has managed to achieve precious few of the ambitious programme of 100 tasks he had set for the first 100 days of government. Partly this is down to Duda, as Tusk\u2019s coalition lacks the three-fifths of parliamentary votes that would be required to overturn his presidential veto.</p> <p>But the legislative paralysis cannot be blamed entirely on the president. Tusk\u2019s coalition, made up of a broad spectrum from leftists to staunch social conservatives, has also found it hard to find agreement within its own ranks. This has been most visible \u2013 and most disappointing for progressive Poles \u2013 when it comes to abortion rights, a huge mobilising issue for women and many young Poles.</p> <p>Several different draft bills have floated around parliament over the past year, but in an embarrassing moment for Tusk\u2019s government, one that had been expected to pass in July was defeated by three votes, with the more conservative MPs from the ruling coalition joining with PiS to vote against it. Earlier this month, MPs finally voted to send the bill forward, and it is now under review by a parliamentary committee, where further revisions are expected.</p> <p>The bill makes limited changes to the law \u2013 decriminalising abortion up to 12 weeks, but not legalising it, and restoring exceptions to the total abortion ban, for cases in which the mother\u2019s life is at risk or there are severe foetal abnormalities. Under PiS, these exemptions were removed from the law, leading to huge protests.</p> <p>The failure to liberalise the abortion law and also to make good on a promise to introduce same-sex civil partnerships has made many liberal Poles angry.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are really, really disappointed, especially in bigger cities,\u201d said Natalia Broniarczyk, who is part of the Abortion Dream Team organisation, which helps Polish women access safe abortion, and is also an adviser to the parliamentary committee working on the draft abortion law. She said the bill had been extremely watered down. \u201cTheir goal is to convince very conservative MPs to vote for this bill and they are willing to concede on almost everything,\u201d she said.</p>    <p>The education minister, Barbara Nowacka, said that \u201cas a citizen and as a feminist\u201d she was angry that the current parliament was not able to pass more meaningful legislation on abortion, but as a politician, she had to concede that the Polish public had voted for a parliament where conservative politicians had a blocking vote.</p> <p>Still, she said the change of tone in the debate at least counted for something. \u201cAlthough a still-restrictive abortion law exists, the procedures are so much more relaxed and changed that women are much more secure. It is not satisfying, but it\u2019s still a little bit better,\u201d she said, in an interview at the ministry building in central Warsaw.</p> <p>Nowacka said she would have liked the government to have achieved more in its first year, but pointed to steps taken by her ministry to reform the education sector. The government offered an immediate 30% pay rise to teachers after taking office, and has proposed a revision of parts of the school curriculum.</p> <p>Amid opposition from some rightwing Christian groups, her ministry has announced that sex education will be reintroduced to the curriculum, as part of broad \u201chealth education\u201d classes that will also tackle mental health issues. Religious classes run by the Catholic church will be cut from two hours to one a week. \u201cSociety is getting more and more secularised,\u201d she said, adding that even 30% of PiS voters supported cutting the religious lessons.</p> <p>Many within Tusk\u2019s party said progressive policies were likely to take a back seat in the presidential election campaign, however. With war in neighbouring Ukraine, Tusk has been keen not to cede ground to PiS on security matters. He has increasingly turned to rightwing rhetoric on migration, mirroring a shift in the debate on the issue across Europe. Last month, he even proposed that Poland would temporarily suspend the right to claim asylum for people attempting to cross from Belarus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/27/polish-border-pushbacks-pregnant-woman-donald-tusk\">a major migration route into Europe</a>.</p> <p>\u201cNobody wants abortion to be the focus of the campaign; it will be on security and economy,\u201d said the senator Tomasz Grodzki. He added that creating this kind of broad appeal would ensure that Trzaskowski won over 50% of the vote and could support the government\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be a crucial campaign for the future of Poland. We have to win if we want to finalise our return to democracy,\u201d Grodski said.</p>",

The government offered an immediate 30% pay rise to teachers after taking office, and has proposed a revision of parts of the school curriculum. Amid opposition from some rightwing Christian groups, her ministry has announced that sex education will be reintroduced to the curriculum, as part of broad \u201chealth education\u201d classes that will also tackle mental health issues. Religious classes run by the Catholic church will be cut from two hours to one a week. \u201cSociety is getting more and more secularised,\u201d she said, adding that even 30% of PiS voters supported cutting the religious lessons. Many within Tusk\u2019s party said progressive policies were likely to take a back seat in the presidential election campaign, however. With war in neighbouring Ukraine, Tusk has been keen not to cede ground to PiS on security matters. He has increasingly turned to rightwing rhetoric on migration, mirroring a shift in the debate on the issue across Europe. Last month, he even proposed that Poland would temporarily suspend the right to claim asylum for people attempting to cross from Belarus, a major migration route into Europe. \u201cNobody wants abortion to be the focus of the campaign; it will be on security and economy,\u201d said the senator Tomasz Grodzki. He added that creating this kind of broad appeal would ensure that Trzaskowski won over 50% of the vote and could support the government\u2019s agenda. \u201cIt will be a crucial campaign for the future of Poland. We have to win if we want to finalise our return to democracy,\u201d Grodski said.",

      "body": "<p>Less talk, more action? Having stepped out of Austrian football for the first time in his career, Christian Ilzer has taken the opposite approach as he seeks to establish himself and to find his feet at Hoffenheim. Appointed to the top job little more than a week ago, the new head coach took over an alarming situation, with his new European-qualified team teetering just above a weak-looking bottom three. Yet he immediately felt that making time to chat was the best start. \u201cOf course, it takes a lot of conversations to find out what makes the guys tick,\u201d Ilzer enthused. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with people, one of the most important skills is listening. That was one of my main jobs.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an era when a head coach\u2019s ability to create their own brand is still thought of as imperative, taking a moment to assess exactly why Pellegrino Matarazzo\u2019s reign fell apart needed to happen. Understanding, rather than recrimination. The degree of faith Ilzer has already fostered is evident. There were many moments when Hoffenheim could have shouldered arms on his Saturday debut against RB Leipzig, but they never did. Three times they came from behind and after the last of those, Jacob Bruun Larsen headed in a winner to inspire the closest you will get to delirium in the stands of the ProZero Arena.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/european-football-inter-thrash-verona-as-leverkusen-hammer-heidenheim\">European football: Celta fight back to stun Barcelona; Inter thrash Verona</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If there were cosmetic changes made to the lineup by Ilzer \u2013 switching from three at the back to four for example \u2013 it was clear the major change was mood. Hoffenheim reacted quickly to conceding the opener to Willi Orban but after Adam Hlozek\u2019s soft-shoe shuffle and delightful finish, they were losing again 105 seconds later when Antonio Nusa \u2013 who was again outstanding \u2013 pinged one into the top corner. They motored again, with the teenager Tom Bischof scoring a delicious free-kick, and when a Stanley Nsoki own goal edged the visitors in front for a third time, it was Hlozek\u2019s turn again.

Even before the title, Ilzer won the prestigious Bruno prize for best coach (and Sturm the prize for best team) in 2023 after their \u00d6FB-Pokal win. His team played daring football and as soon as Hoffenheim signed his partner-in-crime Andreas Schicker, appointed as managing director for sports a month ago, the path seemed set.</p> \n<p>And there is the expectation distilled, even before Saturday\u2019s hijinks. Ilzer has started spectacularly and will be expected to carry on. There may not be the fan pressure of other clubs of a similar status here, but the expectations in the boardroom are real, as Materazzo discovered. He is not the first to have the plug pulled on him after drifting into rocky territory. Sebastian Hoeness, the best coach in the Bundesliga apart from Xabi Alonso since he arrived at Stuttgart, never received the faith to build in the medium term. Despite Ilzer\u2019s hot start, he will be under no illusions that a steady upward incline is necessary to allow him the right to develop this team, whatever the good reputation he arrived with might be.</p> \n<p>His opposite number on Saturday Marco Rose could empathise.

      "bodyText": "Less talk, more action? Having stepped out of Austrian football for the first time in his career, Christian Ilzer has taken the opposite approach as he seeks to establish himself and to find his feet at Hoffenheim. Appointed to the top job little more than a week ago, the new head coach took over an alarming situation, with his new European-qualified team teetering just above a weak-looking bottom three. Yet he immediately felt that making time to chat was the best start. \u201cOf course, it takes a lot of conversations to find out what makes the guys tick,\u201d Ilzer enthused. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with people, one of the most important skills is listening. That was one of my main jobs.\u201d In an era when a head coach\u2019s ability to create their own brand is still thought of as imperative, taking a moment to assess exactly why Pellegrino Matarazzo\u2019s reign fell apart needed to happen. Understanding, rather than recrimination. The degree of faith Ilzer has already fostered is evident. There were many moments when Hoffenheim could have shouldered arms on his Saturday debut against RB Leipzig, but they never did. Three times they came from behind and after the last of those, Jacob Bruun Larsen headed in a winner to inspire the closest you will get to delirium in the stands of the ProZero Arena. If there were cosmetic changes made to the lineup by Ilzer \u2013 switching from three at the back to four for example \u2013 it was clear the major change was mood. Hoffenheim reacted quickly to conceding the opener to Willi Orban but after Adam Hlozek\u2019s soft-shoe shuffle and delightful finish, they were losing again 105 seconds later when Antonio Nusa \u2013 who was again outstanding \u2013 pinged one into the top corner. They motored again, with the teenager Tom Bischof scoring a delicious free-kick, and when a Stanley Nsoki own goal edged the visitors in front for a third time, it was Hlozek\u2019s turn again. A big-money signing from Leverkusen whose slow adaptation has been symptomatic of Die Kraichgauer\u2019s torpor so far this term, Hlozek\u2019s click into gear here underlined that Ilzer\u2019s ability to get into the heads of his players has been quick. \u201cI sense from the boys that everyone is really up for this,\u201d said Bruun Larsen. At 47, Ilzer has little time to waste \u2013 and a recent history of the transformative. That he was a double winner with Sturm Graz last season, taking the title away from another one of the Red Bulls in Salzburg and delivering his club to the Champions League proper for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century, is his headline but to not acknowledge what went before is to overlook the breadth of his achievements. Even before the title, Ilzer won the prestigious Bruno prize for best coach (and Sturm the prize for best team) in 2023 after their \u00d6FB-Pokal win. His team played daring football and as soon as Hoffenheim signed his partner-in-crime Andreas Schicker, appointed as managing director for sports a month ago, the path seemed set. And there is the expectation distilled, even before Saturday\u2019s hijinks. Ilzer has started spectacularly and will be expected to carry on. There may not be the fan pressure of other clubs of a similar status here, but the expectations in the boardroom are real, as Materazzo discovered. He is not the first to have the plug pulled on him after drifting into rocky territory. Sebastian Hoeness, the best coach in the Bundesliga apart from Xabi Alonso since he arrived at Stuttgart, never received the faith to build in the medium term.

Gukesh addressed that milestone, and what it means for the sport, in a virtual press conference on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice that this will be the first time there is no European in a world championship match,\u201d Gukesh said. \u201cAnd I hope in Asia it becomes even more popular, but I think we\u2019re already seeing some very nice growth, not only in India. China has also been a superpower for a few years, and Uzbekistan is also catching up. There\u2019s a lot of potential. Chess is most popular in India by a far margin. I hope it grows even bigger in India but also that other countries take it more seriously.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Additionally, Gukesh has been working with renowned mind coach Paddy Upton, the South African guru who was part of the backroom staff for the Indian cricket team when they won the 2011 World Cup and the Indian hockey team as they claimed bronze at the Paris Olympics. \u201cEverything can be right in the lead-up to the big moments of performance, but if the arrow is not sharp, it won\u2019t penetrate the bullseye,\u201d Upton<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/chess/gukesh-mentor-paddy-upton-world-chess-champonship-ding-liren-9643926/\"> told the Indian Express</a>. \u201cSimilarly, you might have a golfer whose game is perfect, but things go wrong if they\u2019ve got a limp wrist at the moment of impact.

Their most recent meeting happened in January at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in Wijk aan Zee, where Ding won playing as black.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ding v Gukesh at Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2024\"> <iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://lichess.org/study/embed/UhBk1nHS/qkYcyW1U\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Ding has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title amid a well-documented bout with depression. Since returning from a nine-month hiatus to prioritize his mental health, Ding suffered four consecutive losses and came in dead last at the Norway Chess tournament in May, finished third from bottom at August\u2019s Sinquefield Cup at St Louis after winning just 3\u00bd points from nine games, then failed to win a single game at September\u2019s Chess Olympiad in Budapest to drop out of the top 20. He enters the world title match on a 28-game winless streak in classical games dating back to January.</p> \n  <p>Most of the world\u2019s top players have expressed great pessimism about Ding\u2019s chances due to his sparse activity and unremarkable form. So too have the oddsmakers, who have installed him as a roughly 3-1 underdog. Carlsen says: \u201cObviously, Gukesh is a significant favorite, and if he strikes first he will win the match without any trouble.

He strengthened his claim as the greatest player of any era in 2021, when <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/sport/2021/dec/10/magnus-carlsen-retains-world-chess-championship-title-after-final-ian-nepomniachtchi-blunder\">he crushed Nepomniachtchi in Dubai</a> in the fourth defense of the title.</p> \n  <p>But Carlsen decided against defending it for a fifth time in 2023, citing a lack of motivation to go through the months-long slog of preparation that championship matches demand. It marked only the second time in the history of world title matchplay that a holder opted not to defend his crown after Bobby Fischer controversially forfeited the belt in 1975.</p> \n  <p>Instead, Ding defeated Nepomniatchi in a thrilling match for the vacant title, even if critics including longtime world champion Garry Kasparov branded it an \u201camputated\u201d event without the world\u2019s best player involved.</p> \n  <p>Kasparov has only doubled down on that sentiment ahead of this year\u2019s title match, saying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My hottest take is that I don\u2019t treat it as a world championship match. For me a world championship match was always the match for the title of the best player in the world. I think the history of the world championship matches, it started, by the way, here in St Louis, with Steinitz facing Zukertort back in 1886, has ended with Magnus Carlsen. There were 16 world champions, you could call them at every given moment the best players. It\u2019s those who took the title by beating the best player. With all due respect, Ding playing Gukesh, it\u2019s an important event, it\u2019s still a Fide event, it\u2019s an \u2018official title\u2019, but these days with all the modern technologies, with chess getting faster and faster, with our lives getting also faster, to keep an antiquated system of qualification, 18 months or longer, to select the challenger, it\u2019s not adequate. ... It\u2019s an event that has nothing to do with the main idea of the world championship \u2013 to decide, to define the best player on the planet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Well then!</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVBH7nWzfkI\"> <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VVBH7nWzfkI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6740bf7c8f08849211a42b58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T08:00:17.607Z\">8.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Hello and welcome to Singapore for day one of the world chess championship.</strong> Over the next few weeks, China\u2019s Ding Liren and the fast-rising Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju will compete in a scheduled best-of-14-games match for the winner\u2019s share of a $2.5m (\u00a31.98m) prize fund at the Resorts World Sentosa, an island resort off Singapore\u2019s southern coast.

Known for his solid and precise playing style based on creating small positional advantages from quiet openings, the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province is the highest-rated Chinese player of all time.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check out our look back at the 22 most memorable games from world championship history. Ding speaks about his choice to play the French Defense (1 e4 e6). It\u2019s only the third time it\u2019s been played in the opening game of a world championship match. \u201cBecause it was the first game I thought he might get nervous at the start of the match, so I tried to play something unusual which I haven\u2019t played for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it turned out to work perfectly.\u201d \u201cFor sure I was nervous,\u201d Gukesh says. \u201cAnd I think it would be surprising if I said I wasn\u2019t nervous. I was surely nervous, but after the game started I calmed down. I obviously surprised him in the opening. I was playing some good chess. But unfortunately then the momentum kind of slipped.\u201d \u201cI feel very good,\u201d Ding says. \u201cI haven\u2019t won a single classical game for a long time and today I managed to do that. But this game, I think to be fair, it\u2019s very lucky for me because I missed two tactics.\u201d Ding is asked why he spent 24 minutes on 7...a5. \u201cI analyzed it, but I couldn\u2019t remember what\u2019s a continuation,\u201d he says. I have to decide between playing the line I knew, but maybe I didn\u2019t know as carefully as I should have, or [whether] I needed to come up with a new idea in the game myself. And I chose the second one.\u201d Ding Liren entered the world title match on a 28-game winless streak in classical games dating back to January. He\u2019s ended that schneid in spectacular fashion, winning Game 1 with the black pieces against an Indian challenger widely regarded as the favorite. The 32-year-old never once led in his three-week match with Ian Nepomniachtchi to win the vacant title last year. Ding plays 42...Kh8 and Gukesh offers a handshake. He\u2019s resigned after 42 moves! The match enters its fifth hour. And Ding has left the board for the first time today. Gukesh will fight on 41...Qxa2 42 Be6+. Ding plays 40...Qc2+. They both have a half hour added to their clocks and Ding will have 30 extra minutes to convert his considerable winning advantage. Gukesh plays 41 Kg3 and Ding is back on the clock. Ding appears within touching distance of ending his 304-day winless streak in classical games. Gukesh makes it to the time control! And with only one second left after a flurry of moves: 33 Qe3 Rxf1+ 34 Bxf1 e5 35 Bxe5 Qxg4+ 36 Bg2 Bf5 37 Bg3 Be4 38 Kh2 h6 39 Bh3 Qd1 40 Bd6. Ding has two minutes to respond ... Gukesh plays 33 Qe3. He\u2019s got 45 seconds to make seven moves. Six seconds a move, give or take! Gukesh under two minutes. Gukesh under 90 seconds. Gukesh under 80 seconds. Gukesh under a minute \u2026 Ding finally castles 31...O-O. Then a pair of quick moves as Ding tries to keep the pressure on: 32 Bd4 Nd3. Ding with six and a half minutes and Gukesh already under three. Ding moves his queen across with 30...Qc4. Gukesh, under four minutes, avoids the exchange with 31 Qd2. Gukesh finally plays 30 Qc2. The evaluation bar really didn\u2019t like that one. Gukesh has 4min 27sec to make his next 10 moves. High drama in Singapore! Tick, tick, tick. Gukesh is down two pawns and has seven minutes to make 11 moves. Ding captures with 28...Qxe5. He\u2019s up two pawns. A knight exchange follows (29 Nxf4 Qxf4). Ding with 17 minutes on his clock, Gukesh with less than eight. What tension! Ding captures with 25...Rxc3. A quick rook exchange follows (26 Rxc3 Qxc3). Then a pawn exchange (27 fxe6 fxe6). Gukesh then plays 28 Ne2. Gukesh is in serious trouble. But he\u2019s made a move in 25 Qb1 that will require calculation from Ding and keep the pressure off at least momentarily. Gukesh plays 24 h4 and Ding plays 24...Bf4 instantly, keeping the time pressure on. Gukesh has about 15 minutes left (and counting) while Ding has 29min 47sec. Gukesh\u2019s 22 Qe1 appears to be the first big mistake of the match. The engines are going off like fire alarms. Ding threatens the rook with 22\u2026Bg5. Gukesh moves it out of harm\u2019s way with 23 Rc4 and Ding instantly plays 23\u2026Rc4. Ding has snatched the initiative! \u201cAggressor vs Counter Puncher!\u201d the Hungarian-American grandmaster Susan Polgar writes. \u201cGukesh is behind on time now. This is Ding\u2019s strategy. He believes that Gukesh will begin to play inacurrately in time pressure.\u201d Gukesh plays 21 f5. He\u2019s going all-in! \u201cHe\u2019s going for it,\u201d the English grandmaster David Howell says on the official Fide broadcast. \u201cThis is what we love to see. Great move, brave move. Did cost him a bit of time but at least now he has a clear plan. He\u2019s going to go for checkmate. He\u2019s going to go for the black king.\u201d Ding follows with 21...Qd3 and Gukesh avoids the immediate exchange with 22 Qe1. Gukesh plays 20 Rac1 and Ding answers with 20...Qc4. Improbably, Ding has caught up on time. He\u2019s on 32min 52sec while Gukesh is below 32min \u2026 and counting. Ding plays 19\u2026Rc8. He\u2019s got 33 minutes left while Gukesh is down to 37 minutes (and counting). Neither will get more time until he\u2019s played his 40th move. The position is heating up. Gukesh returns, waits a minute, then recaptures with the knight as expected (18 Nxd4). Then Ding wastes no time before playing 18...Nb2. Gukesh quickly responds with 19 Qd3. After more than 33 minutes of thinking, Gukesh opts for 17 Qe2. He immediately steps away from the table. Ding captures with 17...Nxd4. When Gukesh returns, he will almost certainly recapture with his knight. Gukesh is in the tank! The 18-year-old has been pondering his response to 16...Bd7 for more than 25 minutes now. But he\u2019s still more than 20 minutes ahead of Ding on time. This could get hairy for Ding. He has a little more than 36 minutes to make his next 24 moves. It\u2019s roughly an average of 90 seconds per move. Ding plays 16...Bd7. The Norwegian supercomputer Sesse evaluates the position as dead even. Gukesh castles kingside after a nine-minute think (15 O-O), then a couple of natural moves follow in quick succession: 15...Nc4 16 Bf2. The following moves will be critical for Ding. Ding plays 14...Nb6 after an 18-minute think. He\u2019s down to 39 minutes. Gukesh takes his seat and mulls his next move. The engines are evaluating this position as close to even, but black\u2019s lack of a clear plan is concerning. We are into the middlegame, both players out of their opening prep. Ding is mulling his response to 14 Nexd4. Gukesh is pacing around the room with twice as much time (1hr 31min) as the champion (roughly 45m). Gukesh blocks the diagonal with 13 b4. Ding retreats the queen (13...Qc7). Gukesh recaptures the pawn (14 Nexd4). Ding pushes his a-pawn (11...a3), Gukesh answers with 12 b3 and Ding captures 12...cxd4. Gukesh is going to take some time and think this one over. Will he immediately recaputure or put white\u2019s king in check with his bishop? Gukesh plays 11 Bg2 after a 20-minute think, then steps away from the board and playing hall. The challenger has 98 minutes to make his next 29 moves, while Ding has 66 minutes to make his next 30 moves. (After each player makes his 40th move, he will receive an extra 30 minutes with an 30-second increment.) Gukesh has been on the clock for more than 10 minutes, pondering his response to 10\u2026Qa5. Reader John Cox sends in a friendly correction for IM Lawrence Trent: Lawrence can\u2019t be right that 6 Nce2 isn\u2019t in the notes - this isn\u2019t some sideline or novelty; it\u2019s White\u2019s second most popular move and most ambitious try in the most popular GM line against Ding\u2019s chosen opening. It\u2019s hard to overstate how astonishing it is that Ding\u2019s apparently on his own already. Ding finally decides on 10...Qa5. And now Gukesh settles in for his first think of the game. The stat of the day comes from the mailbag. Longtime reader Sean emails to say that in 138 years of world championship matches, the French Defense (1 e4 e6) has only been played three times in the opening game. And all three of those games ended decisively. Some slightly worrying body language from Ding, who is more than 45 minutes behind on time before making his 10th move. The English IM Lawrence Trent doesn\u2019t like what he sees for Ding. \u201cHate to say it but don\u2019t see how Ding survives today,\u201d he writes. This just isn\u2019t his kind of position at all and he\u2019s already 30 minutes behind on the clock. I\u2019d also wager that 6.Nce2 isn\u2019t in his notes anywhere.\u201d We have a move! Ding goes with 7...a5. And Gukesh immediately develops a knight in response. The next few moves: 8 Nf3 a4 9 Be3 Be7. The teenage challenger then blitzes out the novelty 10 g4. Fearless. And Ding is already a half-hour behind on the clock. A 24-minute think (and counting) for Ding Liren on the seventh move of this world championship match. \u201cAt this point I\u2019m kind of a little bit worried about Ding that he\u2019s spending too much time on deciding and he\u2019s hesitating too much at this point,\u201d Polgar says on Chess24\u2019s broadcast. \u201cOr does he have a little fear about what will happen in Game 1 or how he should be handling this very special moment.\u201d Ding has been thinking for 17 minutes and counting. \u201cIt cannot be a solid game anymore,\u201d the Hungarian grandmaster Judit Polg\u00e1r says. \u201cThe knives are out. They are fighting.\u201d A huge decision that will dictate the next few moves looms. Ding finally plays 6...Nc6 and Gukesh immediately responds with 7 c3. Another long think for the champion. The French is a bit of a surprise from Ding. They go through their next moves quickly (2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 e5 Nfd7 5 f4 c5 6 Nce2), before Ding is the first person to stop and take a think. Gukesh opens with a king\u2019s pawn (1 e4) and Ding responds with a French Defense (1...e6). Ding and Gukesh have entered the playing hall. They have taken their seats as the American grandmaster Maurice Ashley goes through the introductions. Our Leonard Barden has filed his final dispatch ahead of today\u2019s opening game. Barden, who\u2019s written the Guardian\u2019s chess column every week since September 1955, doesn\u2019t divert from the general consensus in his assessment of the match. The preliminaries are nearly over: who will win? I expect Gukesh to be cautious in the first few games, then to probe and push hard in the middle of the match. Ding\u2019s 2024 form has been so wretched that it is difficult to see how he can keep his title. A 7.5-4.5 margin for Gukesh looks about right. Here\u2019s a review of the format for the world championship match. Ding and Gukesh will play up to 14 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches seven and a half points first will be declared the champion (and no further games will be played). The time control for each game is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves, then 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41. Players are not allowed to agree to a draw before black\u2019s 40th move. A draw claim before then is only permitted if a threefold repetition or stalemate has occurred. If the score is equal after 14 games, a series of tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played. The complete official regulations can be found here. A look inside the playing hall with 20 minutes to go. And Gukesh\u2019s imperial seating arrangement. Not much longer now. Lots of history on hand in Singapore. Not only is this year\u2019s world championship match the first in 138 years to feature two Asian men, it\u2019s also the first without at least one European player. Gukesh addressed that milestone, and what it means for the sport, in a virtual press conference on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that this will be the first time there is no European in a world championship match,\u201d Gukesh said. \u201cAnd I hope in Asia it becomes even more popular, but I think we\u2019re already seeing some very nice growth, not only in India. China has also been a superpower for a few years, and Uzbekistan is also catching up. There\u2019s a lot of potential. Chess is most popular in India by a far margin. I hope it grows even bigger in India but also that other countries take it more seriously.\u201d Additionally, Gukesh has been working with renowned mind coach Paddy Upton, the South African guru who was part of the backroom staff for the Indian cricket team when they won the 2011 World Cup and the Indian hockey team as they claimed bronze at the Paris Olympics. \u201cEverything can be right in the lead-up to the big moments of performance, but if the arrow is not sharp, it won\u2019t penetrate the bullseye,\u201d Upton told the Indian Express. \u201cSimilarly, you might have a golfer whose game is perfect, but things go wrong if they\u2019ve got a limp wrist at the moment of impact. I think there is now more recognition in the world of sport of how mental gains can reduce these moments.\u201d Ding and Gukesh have met only three times in classical games due to their age difference. Ding holds a 2\u00bd-\u00bd edge in their head-to-head with two wins and one draw, all since January 2023. Their most recent meeting happened in January at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in Wijk aan Zee, where Ding won playing as black. But Ding has played only 44 classical games in the 19 months since winning the world title amid a well-documented bout with depression. Since returning from a nine-month hiatus to prioritize his mental health, Ding suffered four consecutive losses and came in dead last at the Norway Chess tournament in May, finished third from bottom at August\u2019s Sinquefield Cup at St Louis after winning just 3\u00bd points from nine games, then failed to win a single game at September\u2019s Chess Olympiad in Budapest to drop out of the top 20. He enters the world title match on a 28-game winless streak in classical games dating back to January. Most of the world\u2019s top players have expressed great pessimism about Ding\u2019s chances due to his sparse activity and unremarkable form. So too have the oddsmakers, who have installed him as a roughly 3-1 underdog. Carlsen says: \u201cObviously, Gukesh is a significant favorite, and if he strikes first he will win the match without any trouble. However, the longer it goes without a decisive game, the better it is for Ding Liren, because he has the ability but he doesn\u2019t have the confidence.\u201d We\u2019ve gone through the 138-year history of the world championship and chosen 22 of the most memorable games. You can go move by move through each of them here. It\u2019s the perfect timesuck with roughly 45 minutes to go before today\u2019s first move. From the middle of the 16th century, there have come down to us the names of chess players who have been widely regarded as the strongest of their time. The earliest of these was the Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura, after whom one of the most popular openings of modern times is named. Others who followed include the Calabrese Gioachino Greco, Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor, Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, Alexander McDonnell, Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, Mikhail Chigorin and Paul Morphy, each of whom are lionized for their contributions to the development of theory and strategy as well as their dominance over their board during their respective eras. But not until Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort sat down in a small room at 80 Fifth Avenue in New York City on the afternoon of 11 January 1886 did a formal competition to determine the best player on the planet come to pass. Their first-to-10-wins encounter was held in three US cities over the next 78 days for a prize fund of $4,000. Since then, the world chess championship has provided the stage for countless unforgettable contests showcasing the precision, imagination and brilliance of the royal game at the highest level. The credibility of Ding\u2019s world title, of course, remains an open question. The absence of Magnus Carlsen continues to loom large over the sport\u2019s showcase event. The 33-year-old Norwegian has been ranked No 1 for more than 14 straight years and was considered the world\u2019s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the world championship in 2013. He strengthened his claim as the greatest player of any era in 2021, when he crushed Nepomniachtchi in Dubai in the fourth defense of the title. But Carlsen decided against defending it for a fifth time in 2023, citing a lack of motivation to go through the months-long slog of preparation that championship matches demand. It marked only the second time in the history of world title matchplay that a holder opted not to defend his crown after Bobby Fischer controversially forfeited the belt in 1975. Instead, Ding defeated Nepomniatchi in a thrilling match for the vacant title, even if critics including longtime world champion Garry Kasparov branded it an \u201camputated\u201d event without the world\u2019s best player involved. Kasparov has only doubled down on that sentiment ahead of this year\u2019s title match, saying: My hottest take is that I don\u2019t treat it as a world championship match. For me a world championship match was always the match for the title of the best player in the world. I think the history of the world championship matches, it started, by the way, here in St Louis, with Steinitz facing Zukertort back in 1886, has ended with Magnus Carlsen. There were 16 world champions, you could call them at every given moment the best players. It\u2019s those who took the title by beating the best player. With all due respect, Ding playing Gukesh, it\u2019s an important event, it\u2019s still a Fide event, it\u2019s an \u2018official title\u2019, but these days with all the modern technologies, with chess getting faster and faster, with our lives getting also faster, to keep an antiquated system of qualification, 18 months or longer, to select the challenger, it\u2019s not adequate. ... It\u2019s an event that has nothing to do with the main idea of the world championship \u2013 to decide, to define the best player on the planet. Well then! Hello and welcome to Singapore for day one of the world chess championship. Over the next few weeks, China\u2019s Ding Liren and the fast-rising Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju will compete in a scheduled best-of-14-games match for the winner\u2019s share of a $2.5m (\u00a31.98m) prize fund at the Resorts World Sentosa, an island resort off Singapore\u2019s southern coast. It\u2019s the first time in the 138-year history of world championship matchplay that two men from Asia will compete for the sport\u2019s most prestigious title. Ding became China\u2019s first men\u2019s world chess champion by defeating Ian Nepomniachtchi last year on tiebreakers in Kazakhstan. Known for his solid and precise playing style based on creating small positional advantages from quiet openings, the 32-year-old from Zhejiang province is the highest-rated Chinese player of all time. A graduate of Peking University Law School, he once went unbeaten in 100 straight classical games, a record streak broken only by Magnus Carlsen in 2019.

Still, no change from Labor.</p> <p>Then on Monday, the Greens announced they would pass it anyway. So, what happened?</p> <p>The Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, told reporters on Monday that the \u201conly thing that has changed\u201d between last year\u2019s stalemate and this year\u2019s is that \u201cLabor has decided they would rather have a fight with the Greens\u201d.</p> <p>In other words, the Greens blinked because they genuinely thought Labor would be bloody-minded enough not to offer them anything, and they didn\u2019t relish the prospect of voters being invited to blame them for the housing crisis.</p> <p>The Greens are trying to hold on to their base of older post-material voters who value their stance on social issues such as the environment, while also aggressively positioning the party as the party of renters.</p> <p>There are signs in recent elections that the balancing act is a difficult one. The party is treading water: forward a bit in the Northern Territory election, with their first pickup of a seat; back a bit in the Australian Capital Territory, with the loss of two; up a fraction in Queensland, but losing a seat due to loss of Liberal preferences.</p> <p>Labor believes the Greens\u2019 three inner-city Brisbane seats are all at risk at the federal election.</p> <p>On Monday the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, denied a vote decline, quoting positive results in NSW\u2019s Sydney and Richmond councils and Victoria\u2019s Merri-bek.</p> <p>But there have been other signs of moderation in the final parliamentary fortnight that point to jitters internally about whether extreme tactics will backfire on the party.</p> <p>The Greens also dropped their demand for a climate trigger in return for support on Nature Positive laws, instead asking only for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/18/greens-drop-climate-trigger-demand-in-attempt-to-restart-nature-positive-talks-with-labor\">ban on native forest logging in return for support on environment laws</a>.</p> <p>It feels like the party believes it has found the right issues to campaign on \u2013 the ends \u2013 but is not sure its voters support it on the means of holding government legislation hostage.</p> <p>In parliament, Labor and the Greens fight like cats and dogs. In the community, people can\u2019t understand why two notionally leftwing parties can\u2019t get along.</p> <p>And what a difference a year has made for Chandler-Mather personally.</p> <p>In 2023 he became the highest profile first-term MP this parliament, going toe-to-toe with the prime minister in question time in a form of asymmetric warfare, and winning billions in the process.</p> <p>He expressed wild-eyed idealism including <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2023/06/australia-labor-greens-housing-future-fund-affordability\">writing in Jacobin</a> that passing the Haff would \u201cdemobilise the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry\u201d about poverty and housing unaffordability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/25/emily-calandrelli-female-astronaut-sexism\">Female astronaut goes to space but can\u2019t escape online sexism by \u2018small men\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this year, not only did he come away with nothing, Bandt would have us believe that it was Chandler-Mather\u2019s recommendation to the party room to capitulate and pass both housing bills.</p> <p>If so, what an exercise in political power by Albanese this has been. What an education he has handed Chandler-Mather to turn the man he once accused of displaying a Maoist approach into a pragmatist. How humbling.</p> <p>Chandler-Mather appeared outraged and hurt on behalf of renters at Monday\u2019s press conference.</p> <p>One suspects that the Greens have decided that this time discretion is the better part of valour, in parliament.</p> <p>But in the electorate they will let their righteous anger burn because their only means to effect change now is out there, with the renters and other voters they say Labor has dudded.</p> <ul> <li><p>Paul Karp is Guardian Australia\u2019s chief political correspondent</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "When Anthony Albanese addressed Labor\u2019s national conference in August 2023, he had some choice words for progressive voters considering a vote for the Greens. \u201cThey are the blockers \u2013 we are the builders,\u201d he said. At that time the Albanese government was locked in negotiations with the minor party over the Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff) bill, and it wasn\u2019t going very well. The Greens had the temerity to team up with the Coalition to delay the bill, and got more credit than the prime minister would have liked for the $2bn for social and affordable housing he announced midyear. The Greens won another $1bn before finally relenting in September. This year, Albanese was determined negotiations would go differently when it came to the government\u2019s Help to Buy shared equity scheme. The Greens started with substantial demands including reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. In February, Albanese declared the Greens could vote for the bill or against it, signalling there would be no protracted negotiation \u2013 they should vote on its merits. And that\u2019s where Labor\u2019s position stayed all year as the Greens repeated their tactic of voting with the Coalition for delay, and Albanese stoked another round of double-dissolution election speculation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Before the final sitting fortnight, the Greens substantially reduced their demands: now they wanted 25,000 social and affordable homes, and guarantees that homeowners who tip over the income threshold wouldn\u2019t face stiff repayments. Still, no change from Labor. Then on Monday, the Greens announced they would pass it anyway. So, what happened? The Greens\u2019 housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, told reporters on Monday that the \u201conly thing that has changed\u201d between last year\u2019s stalemate and this year\u2019s is that \u201cLabor has decided they would rather have a fight with the Greens\u201d. In other words, the Greens blinked because they genuinely thought Labor would be bloody-minded enough not to offer them anything, and they didn\u2019t relish the prospect of voters being invited to blame them for the housing crisis. The Greens are trying to hold on to their base of older post-material voters who value their stance on social issues such as the environment, while also aggressively positioning the party as the party of renters. There are signs in recent elections that the balancing act is a difficult one. The party is treading water: forward a bit in the Northern Territory election, with their first pickup of a seat; back a bit in the Australian Capital Territory, with the loss of two; up a fraction in Queensland, but losing a seat due to loss of Liberal preferences. Labor believes the Greens\u2019 three inner-city Brisbane seats are all at risk at the federal election. On Monday the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, denied a vote decline, quoting positive results in NSW\u2019s Sydney and Richmond councils and Victoria\u2019s Merri-bek. But there have been other signs of moderation in the final parliamentary fortnight that point to jitters internally about whether extreme tactics will backfire on the party. The Greens also dropped their demand for a climate trigger in return for support on Nature Positive laws, instead asking only for a ban on native forest logging in return for support on environment laws. It feels like the party believes it has found the right issues to campaign on \u2013 the ends \u2013 but is not sure its voters support it on the means of holding government legislation hostage. In parliament, Labor and the Greens fight like cats and dogs. In the community, people can\u2019t understand why two notionally leftwing parties can\u2019t get along. And what a difference a year has made for Chandler-Mather personally. In 2023 he became the highest profile first-term MP this parliament, going toe-to-toe with the prime minister in question time in a form of asymmetric warfare, and winning billions in the process. He expressed wild-eyed idealism including writing in Jacobin that passing the Haff would \u201cdemobilise the growing section of civil society that is justifiably angry\u201d about poverty and housing unaffordability. But this year, not only did he come away with nothing, Bandt would have us believe that it was Chandler-Mather\u2019s recommendation to the party room to capitulate and pass both housing bills. If so, what an exercise in political power by Albanese this has been. What an education he has handed Chandler-Mather to turn the man he once accused of displaying a Maoist approach into a pragmatist. How humbling. Chandler-Mather appeared outraged and hurt on behalf of renters at Monday\u2019s press conference. One suspects that the Greens have decided that this time discretion is the better part of valour, in parliament. But in the electorate they will let their righteous anger burn because their only means to effect change now is out there, with the renters and other voters they say Labor has dudded.

It was raised by the attorney at one stage \u2026 To be completely clear, there was no request that I put anything in my annual report. There was no direction,\u201d Blight said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Dreyfus declined to comment.</p> <p>In Donaldson\u2019s letter, seen by Guardian Australia, the former INSLM was further incensed that Blight neither consulted nor notified him before publication.</p> <p>\u201cI am surprised that you purported to \u2018clarify\u2019 something in a report for which I was responsible,\u201d Donaldson wrote. \u201cI am unaware of an INSLM ever \u2018clarifying\u2019 something in the work of a predecessor.\u201d</p> <h2>A secret report</h2> <p>The issue centres on the Victorian supreme court\u2019s criticisms<strong> </strong>in 2022 and 2023 of both the former Liberal home affairs minister Peter Dutton and current Labor attorney general Dreyfus in relation to convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika.</p> <p>Benbrika\u2019s almost-20-year sentence for terrorism offences ended in 2020 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jun/22/australias-powers-to-detain-terrorist-offenders-after-jail-term-without-rehabilitation-under-review\">the government successfully applied for a continuing detention order</a>.</p> <p>The same year, Home Affairs under Dutton had commissioned and received a secret assessment of the process it was using to assess the risk individual terrorism offenders could pose if released.</p> <p>The report, by the Australian National University\u2019s Dr Emily Corner, cast serious doubt on the<strong> </strong>validity of that process, potentially undermining the government\u2019s legal justification for Benbrika\u2019s ongoing detention.</p> <p>The Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/24/home-affairs-withheld-serious-concerns-about-prediction-tool-during-benbrika-case-court-hears\">government failed to provide the report to</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/24/home-affairs-withheld-serious-concerns-about-prediction-tool-during-benbrika-case-court-hears\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/24/home-affairs-withheld-serious-concerns-about-prediction-tool-during-benbrika-case-court-hears\">Benbrika and his lawyers</a> during the detention application proceedings.</p> <p>Donaldson uncovered and revealed its existence two years later.</p> <p>By then, the 2022 federal election had occurred, the government had changed and Dreyfus was the minister responsible for defending the commonwealth\u2019s actions. Benbrika\u2019s lawyers then lodged a supreme court application for his release. During the hearings, Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth condemned the actions of the department and previous minister in not disclosing<strong> </strong>the report, and demanded it be provided.</p> <p>It was \u2013 but only in redacted form. The judge then demanded it be provided in full.</p> <p>Hollingworth directed her primary condemnation at the failure to disclose it which occurred under Dutton.

      "bodyText": "The former independent watchdog on Australia\u2019s national security laws has accused his successor of bowing to pressure from the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, in publishing a \u201cclarification\u201d to an old annual report that had criticised Dreyfus over a terrorism case. The current Independent Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM), Jake Blight, has confirmed to Guardian Australia that both Dreyfus and one of his staff separately raised concerns earlier this year about what they alleged was \u201cambiguity\u201d in the INSLM\u2019s 2022-23 report, written by his predecessor, Grant Donaldson. Three weeks ago, the former INSLM, Donaldson, wrote a blistering letter to Blight after discovering Blight had used his recently published 2023-24 annual report to \u201cclarify\u201d Donaldson\u2019s work from the year before. Donaldson accused Blight of acting at Dreyfus\u2019s behest and compromising the independence of the office by adding a clarification that he alleges changed the meaning of what he wrote \u2013 allegations Blight denies. \u201cI stand by my independence,\u201d Blight told Guardian Australia. \u201cI stand by the way I\u2019m going about the role.\u201d In his letter, Donaldson said that when he was INSLM, he had received requests from Dreyfus\u2019s office to change the language in the draft annual report. \u201cI refused to change what I had written because clarification was not required,\u201d Donaldson wrote to Blight. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Blight insists neither Dreyfus nor his adviser directly asked him for the clarification and the decision was his alone. \u201cI reject the suggestion that I\u2019ve acted at the behest of anyone,\u201d Blight told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe issue of the ambiguity in his report was raised with me by the attorney\u2019s office. It was raised by the attorney at one stage \u2026 To be completely clear, there was no request that I put anything in my annual report. There was no direction,\u201d Blight said. A spokesperson for Dreyfus declined to comment. In Donaldson\u2019s letter, seen by Guardian Australia, the former INSLM was further incensed that Blight neither consulted nor notified him before publication. \u201cI am surprised that you purported to \u2018clarify\u2019 something in a report for which I was responsible,\u201d Donaldson wrote. \u201cI am unaware of an INSLM ever \u2018clarifying\u2019 something in the work of a predecessor.\u201d A secret report The issue centres on the Victorian supreme court\u2019s criticisms in 2022 and 2023 of both the former Liberal home affairs minister Peter Dutton and current Labor attorney general Dreyfus in relation to convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika. Benbrika\u2019s almost-20-year sentence for terrorism offences ended in 2020 but the government successfully applied for a continuing detention order. The same year, Home Affairs under Dutton had commissioned and received a secret assessment of the process it was using to assess the risk individual terrorism offenders could pose if released. The report, by the Australian National University\u2019s Dr Emily Corner, cast serious doubt on the validity of that process, potentially undermining the government\u2019s legal justification for Benbrika\u2019s ongoing detention. The Morrison government failed to provide the report to Benbrika and his lawyers during the detention application proceedings. Donaldson uncovered and revealed its existence two years later. By then, the 2022 federal election had occurred, the government had changed and Dreyfus was the minister responsible for defending the commonwealth\u2019s actions. Benbrika\u2019s lawyers then lodged a supreme court application for his release. During the hearings, Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth condemned the actions of the department and previous minister in not disclosing the report, and demanded it be provided. It was \u2013 but only in redacted form. The judge then demanded it be provided in full. Hollingworth directed her primary condemnation at the failure to disclose it which occurred under Dutton. But she also strongly criticised the subsequent refusal to explain and reluctance to provide it in full, both of which occurred under Dreyfus. A different perspective At issue now is the way the consecutive INSLM annual reports have portrayed this criticism and whether they fairly apportion blame. In his 2022-23 annual report, Donaldson referred to Home Affairs having commissioned and not provided the Corner assessment \u2013 but did not refer specifically to the minister. Donaldson\u2019s report was based on the judge\u2019s comments in court and was published before her final judgment. He noted that the attorney general was the responsible minister during the proceedings before Hollingworth. Donaldson described the original failure to disclose the report as \u201cinexcusable\u201d and the later failure to explain as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. \u201cIt must have been obvious to those advising and representing the Attorney-General, if not the Attorney himself, that the failure to disclose the Corner Report to Mr Benbrika and to the court required frank, fulsome, forthright and complete explanation to the court,\u201d Donaldson\u2019s annual report said. \u201cThis did not occur.\u201d Blight said he believed it was not clear in Donaldson\u2019s wording that there had been a machinery-of-government change and therefore a change of minister. He believed it was \u201creasonable\u201d to clarify that. \u201cI reject that I\u2019ve done anything to skew what he said,\u201d Blight said. \u201cAll I\u2019ve really done is clarify which minister was responsible at which times because I didn\u2019t think that was clear \u2026 There is really nothing more to it.\u201d In his clarification, which took most of a page, Blight wrote that \u201cMr Donaldson was of the view that the report was exculpatory and should have been disclosed by the \u2018relevant Minister\u2019\u201d. In brackets, he added that \u201cthe judge later agreed with this characterisation\u201d. \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt it is noted that, at the time of those proceedings, the \u2018relevant Minister\u2019 was the Minister for Home Affairs (the Hon Peter Dutton MP and subsequently the Hon Karen Andrews MP),\u201d Blight wrote. The clarification did not mention the judge\u2019s unmet request for an explanation. Its reference to the judge having to press for the unredacted report was in a footnote, which Blight said reflects his usual practice. It did not mention the criticism she made in court of that initial reluctance. Donaldson told Guardian Australia he believes the \u201cclarification\u201d has changed the meaning of what he wrote. \u201cI think it does distort what should be a clear understanding of what I\u2019d written,\u201d he said. Blight said his clarification was not a criticism. \u201cI don\u2019t think it damages his reputation. I don\u2019t think it changes the meaning of his report at all.\u201d Donaldson told Guardian Australia he had decided to speak publicly about the letter because he had asked Blight to publish it on the INSLM website and was refused.",

Half of players surveyed by Professional Footballers Australia are dissatisfied with the performance of the APL, and a similar share (46%) have \u201clow trust\u201d that the league\u2019s management can develop a vision to improve the competition. The results come as the APL heralded the success of the Unite Round in Sydney over the weekend, which attracted a cumulative attendance of 71,000 including more than 30,000 for Saturday\u2019s double header \u2013 despite a build-up checkered with problems. PFA chief executive Beau Busch said the survey results \u2013 as part of the organisation\u2019s annual review of the ALM released on Tuesday \u2013 show the competition\u2019s potential and challenges. \u201cFour years post-separation, players have upheld their commitment on the pitch, yet their trust in the APL has eroded due to a governance model that is not fit for purpose and fails to establish a genuine partnership with the players,\u201d he said.

Mate has a grassy, herbaceous and slightly earthy taste with refreshing bitterness \u2013 the drier the leaf variety, the earthier the taste. </p> <p>He recommends brewing the mate leaves with 60C to 80C water for about five minutes \u2013 the hotter the water, the more intense the flavour.</p> <p>It can also be enjoyed iced, as it is in Paraguay, or cold brewed overnight with fruit and herbs.</p> <p>Mate leaves can be bought at Latin American grocers and specialty online stores, while yerba mate sodas can also be found at some supermarkets and bottle shops.</p> <h2>2. Gyokuro</h2> <p>Taka Kaneko, from tea shop EdoMatcha in Sydney, describes gyokuro as a well-kept secret and \u201cthe most luxurious green tea in Japan\u201d.</p> <p>Gyokuro translates to \u201cjewel dew\u201d and represents only 0.7% of Japan\u2019s total tea production, Kaneko says. Like matcha, it is grown in the shade \u2013 which gives it a \u201crich umami\u201d flavour and a mellow sweetness \u2013 and it has a slow caffeine release.</p> <p>To brew gyokuro, Kaneko recommends brewing 5g of gyokuro leaves with 50C to 60C water for two minutes in a teapot.

      "bodyText": "The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen has repeated her threat to back a censure motion that could topple the French prime minister, Michel Barnier, after the two met for talks on his government\u2019s budget. Barnier has been meeting party leaders to persuade them to back the budget in parliament amid speculation that the prime minister \u2013 appointed by the president, Emmanuel Macron, at the head of a minority government \u2013 may attempt to use a constitutional clause to force it through without a vote. The leftwing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), has already threatened to table a censure motion if Barnier uses the measure, known as the 49:3, to push through the 2025 budget. After Monday\u2019s meeting, Le Pen said she had reminded the prime minister of the far-right National Rally\u2019s (RN) \u201cred lines\u201d, which include dropping budget plans to increase taxes on electricity and the delaying of increases to certain pensions to cover inflation. \u201cWe will see if today\u2019s proposals are taken on board, but nothing is certain,\u201d Le Pen said. BFMTV reported that the RN is due to decide whether to lodge the censure motion at a meeting on 18 December, throwing doubt on whether Barnier could continue in his post. Le Pen, who is president of the RN parliamentary group in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, said Barnier was \u201ccourteous\u201d at Monday\u2019s meeting but appeared \u201cfixed on his position\u201d. If MPs for the NFP and RN all vote for the censure motion it will pass and the government will fall. Barnier has described any alliance of left and far right to overturn the government as a \u201ccoalition of opposites\u201d. Last week, during a conference of French mayors, he said: \u201cI know this is not what the French want. What they want is stability and serenity.\u201d Another RN source told BFMTV: \u201cHe [Barnier] listened to us but did not hear us. I don\u2019t have the feeling he has understood that things have changed.\u201d Barnier was made prime minister by Macron at the beginning of September after July\u2019s snap general election. Macron had hoped that the election would strengthen his position but the move backfired, forcing his centrist government to resign and leaving the lower house of parliament divided into three equal blocs \u2013 far right, left and centre \u2013 none of which has an absolute majority. Last week, leaders of the parties in the NFP coalition, including France Unbowed (LFI), the Socialists (PS), the French Communist party (PCF) and the Greens said in a statement they would attempt to bring the government down if the 49:3 was used. \u201cOur aim is simple: to protect our fellow citizens from the impact of a budget that will not open the way for a new future for the country but will prolong the social divide, ecological irresponsibility and democratic brutality,\u201d they wrote.",

Flood water had gushed through the back wall of the shop when the wall broke, and then more water entered through the front door, which was smashed open by the tractor. \u201cThey\u2019re the lowest person in Tenbury right now \u2013 look at the damage it has caused,\u201d said Harrold, gesturing to a broken lock on the doorframe. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly not flood damage is it, that\u2019s the impact of the tidal wave. It washed all the defence barriers away. \u201cIt\u2019s just total devastation, and possibly the end of the business. We couldn\u2019t get insurance, it was just too dear. And we paid \u00a315,000 of our own money to get it set up.\u201d \u201cWe just don\u2019t have the money to put back into the business,\u201d said Hopkins, as she flicked through photographs of the previously pristine shop, which they set up 18 months ago. Laura Jones stood assessing the \u00a320,000 worth of shop fittings and stock piled in a muddy heap outside her art supply and craft shop, Rainbow Crafts by Laura. \u201cOur dream is just gone. We won\u2019t be able to come back from this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were still in the shop on Sunday trying to get out as much as we could and the fireman just said, \u2018Get out quick, the wall has gone.\u2019 We had to run for it. \u201cThen with the other problem of the tractor going through, it forced the door open. The water was above my husband\u2019s waist when he tried to shut the door. It was just so stupid.\u201d",

But her vocals take off during the lesser-known You Wear It So Well: they spill out of the song itself, not for the last time resuming a cappella, and occasionally without amplification, after the band stop playing. By the time the set reaches Perfect Day, she\u2019s evidently in her element, taking risks with the song\u2019s melody and phrasing that justify the gig\u2019s appearance as part of the <a href=\"https://efglondonjazzfestival.org.uk/\">London jazz festival</a>: you\u2019re very aware of an artist pushing at the boundaries and structure of a song on the spot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/anohni-and-the-johnsons-my-back-was-a-bridge-interview\">Anohni on anger, empathy and trans rights: \u2018The UK is one of the most misogynist countries in the world\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a beautifully curated set that shifts easily between the songs you might expect, Femme Fatale and Pale Blue Eyes among them, and deep cuts: her voice is an oddly but appealingly serene presence during a tumultuous version of Shooting Star, from 1978\u2019s Street Hassle. There seems to be a particular focus on Reed\u2019s most nakedly personal songs \u2013 Kill Your Sons, Families \u2013 which fits with Anohni\u2019s between-song recollections: the Lou Reed she knew was clearly some distance from the disagreeable caricature that usually turned up to interviews. And sometimes, her reinterpretations seem faintly miraculous. She turns Follow the Leader \u2013 one of a number of will-this-do? tracks from 1976\u2019s Rock and Roll Heart that gave the distinct impression Reed had given up even pretending to try \u2013 into a potent hymn to Manhattan, extemporising new lyrics about Aids and 9/11 alongside the assurance that the city still contains \u201call the dreams I care about\u201d.

      "body": "<p>David de Gea said on day one that he wanted to \u201cmake history\u201d with Fiorentina. Three months later, you could make a case he has already succeeded. The Viola won their seventh consecutive Serie A game on Sunday, 2-0 away to Como. Only once before \u2013 back in 1960 \u2013 have they achieved such a run in the Italian top-flight.</p> \n<p>The Spaniard has been essential. De Gea collected his fifth clean sheet against Como, more than any other goalkeeper has managed since he made his league debut on 15 September. He is having to work for them, too.</p> \n<p>Fiorentina were defending a 1-0 lead at the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia when Edoardo Goldaniga tamed a long ball and jabbed goalwards from six yards out. De Gea blocked that attempt with his knee and a follow up from Federico Barba with his shin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWxiL0QgNP0&amp;t=46s\">before springing up to punch the ball away</a> before the first player could force home the second rebound.</p> \n<p>Como\u2019s manager, and De Gea\u2019s former international teammate, Cesc F\u00e0bregas, said he \u201chad not seen a save like it in years\u201d. Fiorentina\u2019s supporters debated whether it was even the best they had seen him make in their shirt. De Gea kept out a pair of penalties and plenty more shots besides during the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaMlmggcdWo\">2-1 win over Milan last month</a> that marked the start of this seven-game run. </p> \n<p>Who could have imagined this level of performance from a man who had been out of football for more than a year after he was released by Manchester United in 2023? De Gea was presumed to be easing into retirement, though he has said: \u201cI never thought about that. It was just difficult to find motivation for a new chapter after 12 years at a top club.\u201d</p> \n<p>He kept up his own personal training, doing one-on-one work with a goalkeeping coach as well as playing padel, but there is a big jump to competitive action. Before playing in Serie A, De Gea conceded three times in his actual Fiorentina debut \u2013 a Europa Conference League qualifier at home to Pusk\u00e1s Akad\u00e9mia, which ended 3-3.</p> \n<p>The omens for this season did not look good back then. Fiorentina barely scraped past the Hungarian side, requiring a penalty shootout after drawing both legs. They collected only one other win in their first nine competitive matches under the new manager Raffaele Palladino.</p> \n<p>Yet Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance, has since become a city where footballing careers are reborn. If De Gea\u2019s form has been remarkable, then so too has that of Moise Kean \u2013 who failed to score once in 20 games at Juventus last season but managed his 12th goal in 15 for Fiorentina on Sunday, wrongfooting the keeper as he met a cross from the left with a first-time shot into the near top corner.</p> \n<p>Throughout the team, there are stories like this. The left-back Robin Gosens, who joined Fiorentina on deadline day, loaned from Union Berlin, has played so well that he won back his place for Germany after a full year without being selected. Another loanee, Edoardo Bove \u2013 a graduate of the Roma academy who earned the nickname \u201csick dog\u201d from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho while struggling to establish himself with the first team \u2013 scored a brilliant goal in last month\u2019s 5-1 demolition of his parent club.</p> \n<p>Their collective improvement \u2013 together with the emergence of new players, such as the 19-year-old centre-back Pietro Comuzzo \u2013 owes much to the flexibility of Palladino, who started the season with a back three and a high press but adapted after initial poor results to a compact 4-2-3-1. The emphasis is no longer on winning the ball back in the opponent\u2019s half but on keeping a shape that is hard to push through and allows for rapid transitions.</p> \n<p>Even then, nothing is rigid. Fiorentina returned to a back three during the second half against Como, seeking to counter opponents who were making good use of width. Above all, Palladino gives a sense of being well attuned to the strengths and weaknesses of his players and building structures that get the best of them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/european-roundup-kylian-mbappe-and-jude-bellingham-on-target-as-real-cruise\">European football: Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Jude Bellingham on target as Real cruise</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Certainly, he is not one for mollycoddling. Invited after Sunday\u2019s game to explain which strings he had pulled to get such strong performances from Kean, Palladino replied: \u201cMoise did not play his best game today, from a technical standpoint, and I\u2019ve already spoken to him about it. Obviously from the outside, everybody just sees his goal.\u201d</p> \n<p>You could not blame him for wanting to keep feet on the ground. When Palladino was appointed to replace Vincenzo Italiano this summer, the question was whether he could fill the shoes of a man who took the team to consecutive Europa Conference League finals, not whether he could lead a Serie A title challenge.</p> \n<p>Fiorentina are not minnows, nor are they set up to compete at the very top of the table. Their wage bill is all at once the seventh-largest in the division, and less than half the size of those belonging to Internazionale or Juventus.</p> \n<p>Yet, with more than a third of the season gone, the table shows Fiorentina as one of four teams sitting one point behind the league leaders Napoli. Their plus-17 goal difference is joint-second best in the division.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2913097d-b62d-4220-8b79-1a68b632b447\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Verona 0-5 Inter, Milan 0-0 Juventus, Parma 1-3 Atalanta, Genoa 2-2 Cagliari, Como 0-2 Fiorentina, Torino 0-0 Monza, Napoli 1-0 Roma, Lazio 3-0 Bologna.

Fiorentina are not structurally built for flying, but they don\u2019t care and do it anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps the next league game, at home to Inter, will serve as a reality check. \u201cThe lads are very ambitious,\u201d said Palladino. \u201cWe need to be ambitious, and we also need to understand that it\u2019s a particular league this season, a strange league, with lots of teams in difficulty, lots of changes of manager, and so a lot of teams that haven\u2019t found those automatisms yet.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know this. And the thing we need to take from that is not to feel stronger than we are. We are a team that needs to work, that needs to stay switched on, work hard in training with a spirit of sacrifice and team \u2026 Then maybe down the line we\u2019ll look at the table and we can set

      "bodyText": "David de Gea said on day one that he wanted to \u201cmake history\u201d with Fiorentina. Three months later, you could make a case he has already succeeded. The Viola won their seventh consecutive Serie A game on Sunday, 2-0 away to Como. Only once before \u2013 back in 1960 \u2013 have they achieved such a run in the Italian top-flight. The Spaniard has been essential. De Gea collected his fifth clean sheet against Como, more than any other goalkeeper has managed since he made his league debut on 15 September. He is having to work for them, too. Fiorentina were defending a 1-0 lead at the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia when Edoardo Goldaniga tamed a long ball and jabbed goalwards from six yards out. De Gea blocked that attempt with his knee and a follow up from Federico Barba with his shin before springing up to punch the ball away before the first player could force home the second rebound. Como\u2019s manager, and De Gea\u2019s former international teammate, Cesc F\u00e0bregas, said he \u201chad not seen a save like it in years\u201d. Fiorentina\u2019s supporters debated whether it was even the best they had seen him make in their shirt. De Gea kept out a pair of penalties and plenty more shots besides during the 2-1 win over Milan last month that marked the start of this seven-game run. Who could have imagined this level of performance from a man who had been out of football for more than a year after he was released by Manchester United in 2023? De Gea was presumed to be easing into retirement, though he has said: \u201cI never thought about that. It was just difficult to find motivation for a new chapter after 12 years at a top club.\u201d He kept up his own personal training, doing one-on-one work with a goalkeeping coach as well as playing padel, but there is a big jump to competitive action. Before playing in Serie A, De Gea conceded three times in his actual Fiorentina debut \u2013 a Europa Conference League qualifier at home to Pusk\u00e1s Akad\u00e9mia, which ended 3-3. The omens for this season did not look good back then. Fiorentina barely scraped past the Hungarian side, requiring a penalty shootout after drawing both legs. They collected only one other win in their first nine competitive matches under the new manager Raffaele Palladino. Yet Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance, has since become a city where footballing careers are reborn. If De Gea\u2019s form has been remarkable, then so too has that of Moise Kean \u2013 who failed to score once in 20 games at Juventus last season but managed his 12th goal in 15 for Fiorentina on Sunday, wrongfooting the keeper as he met a cross from the left with a first-time shot into the near top corner. Throughout the team, there are stories like this. The left-back Robin Gosens, who joined Fiorentina on deadline day, loaned from Union Berlin, has played so well that he won back his place for Germany after a full year without being selected. Another loanee, Edoardo Bove \u2013 a graduate of the Roma academy who earned the nickname \u201csick dog\u201d from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho while struggling to establish himself with the first team \u2013 scored a brilliant goal in last month\u2019s 5-1 demolition of his parent club. Their collective improvement \u2013 together with the emergence of new players, such as the 19-year-old centre-back Pietro Comuzzo \u2013 owes much to the flexibility of Palladino, who started the season with a back three and a high press but adapted after initial poor results to a compact 4-2-3-1. The emphasis is no longer on winning the ball back in the opponent\u2019s half but on keeping a shape that is hard to push through and allows for rapid transitions. Even then, nothing is rigid. Fiorentina returned to a back three during the second half against Como, seeking to counter opponents who were making good use of width. Above all, Palladino gives a sense of being well attuned to the strengths and weaknesses of his players and building structures that get the best of them. Certainly, he is not one for mollycoddling. Invited after Sunday\u2019s game to explain which strings he had pulled to get such strong performances from Kean, Palladino replied: \u201cMoise did not play his best game today, from a technical standpoint, and I\u2019ve already spoken to him about it. Obviously from the outside, everybody just sees his goal.\u201d You could not blame him for wanting to keep feet on the ground. When Palladino was appointed to replace Vincenzo Italiano this summer, the question was whether he could fill the shoes of a man who took the team to consecutive Europa Conference League finals, not whether he could lead a Serie A title challenge. Fiorentina are not minnows, nor are they set up to compete at the very top of the table. Their wage bill is all at once the seventh-largest in the division, and less than half the size of those belonging to Internazionale or Juventus. Yet, with more than a third of the season gone, the table shows Fiorentina as one of four teams sitting one point behind the league leaders Napoli. Their plus-17 goal difference is joint-second best in the division. As Alex Frosio wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport, \u201cIt\u2019s like that theory about bumblebees. Fiorentina are not structurally built for flying, but they don\u2019t care and do it anyway.\u201d Perhaps the next league game, at home to Inter, will serve as a reality check. \u201cThe lads are very ambitious,\u201d said Palladino. \u201cWe need to be ambitious, and we also need to understand that it\u2019s a particular league this season, a strange league, with lots of teams in difficulty, lots of changes of manager, and so a lot of teams that haven\u2019t found those automatisms yet. \u201cWe know this. And the thing we need to take from that is not to feel stronger than we are. We are a team that needs to work, that needs to stay switched on, work hard in training with a spirit of sacrifice and team \u2026 Then maybe down the line we\u2019ll look at the table and we can set objectives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Diogo Dalot believes Ruben Amorim is precisely what Manchester United need as he talked up the clarity of the new head coach\u2019s messaging and his highly demanding nature. Amorim\u2019s first match was Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Ipswich. Had Erik ten Hag still been in charge, the inquest would have raged because of the level of the performance and the context. Ipswich are in the relegation places. They have not won at home in the Premier League since April 2002. As it was, there were mainly shrugs, an acceptance that United have fallen far and the transition to Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1 system will take time. He was able to deliver brutal truths without the fear of comeback, specifically the line about how United will have to \u201csuffer for a long period\u201d before their fortunes turn. It was a day when United had to look hard for the positives, although there was a glimpse of how Amorim wants to attack. When Amad Diallo surged up the right in the second minute, he had three options in the box for the cross. Marcus Rashford made the run to the near post but Alejandro Garnacho and Dalot \u2013 having sprinted up from left wing-back \u2013 were behind him. Amad picked out Rashford for 1-0. Dalot sought to highlight what Amorim had brought in the preparations, albeit they were short as a consequence of many of the players being involved with their countries during the international break. \u201cIt\u2019s gone really well,\u201d Dalot said. \u201cHe made an impact straight away in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play.

The school-bus-sized asteroid known as 2024 PT5 might actually be a huge boulder that broke from the moon after another space rock crashed into it centuries ago, astronomers say. Currently 2m miles (3.2m km) from Earth, about nine times farther than the distance to the moon, the asteroid never quite came close enough to be captured by the planet\u2019s gravity. But its farewell pass will bring it as close as 1.1m miles in January for a final look before the sun\u2019s gravitational pull hauls deeper into space. The mini moon\u2019s small size, about 33ft wide, and distance meant it was never visible to humankind\u2019s naked eye, only through powerful telescopes. Nasa has been tracking the asteroid through its deep space network since it was first spotted through a South African-based telescope belonging to the University of Hawaii in August.

      "body": "<p>Few people know the sea better than Guillaume Picard. He grew up on a boat moored in the port of Hy\u00e8res in southern France after his parents left 1960s Paris. His first job was on a sailing boat. Then he spent 30 years in the merchant navy before becoming a commercial captain, ferrying tourists and containers across the Mediterranean for more than two decades.</p> \n<p>Now aged 65, his grey hair in a ponytail, it is with no small note of sadness that he says, increasingly, it is the land that calls him. \u201cTo be completely honest, I want to go to sea less and less,\u201d he says. \u201cI go hiking a lot in the mountains with my wife, and we\u2019ve found an environment that is much more preserved. The mountains are beautiful wherever you go.\u201d</p> \n<p>Picard\u2019s beloved sea is being destroyed, he believes, by something uncomfortably close to home: cruise ships. Fifteen years ago they were a rare sight in Marseille. Now, France\u2019s second city is one of Europe\u2019s busiest cruise ports. Last year, 2.5 million passengers stopped off, <a href=\"https://www.marseille-port.fr/passagers-croisieres\">according to the port authority,</a> a million more than the year before.</p> \n<p>Faced with this new reality, Picard has decided to become the sea\u2019s protector, swapping his captain\u2019s whites for the all-black of a non-violent protester. His new crew is a growing group of activists known as Stop Croisi\u00e8res, or Stop Cruises. \u201cAt some point we will have to make a choice for our children, for our grandchildren,\u201d he says. \u201cDo we continue to make bigger and more energy-consuming ships with more and more people on board? Are we really going to be able to continue to live on this Earth like this?\u201d</p> \n<p>The group is part of a growing protest movement against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/oct/19/europe-ports-bear-brunt-of-cruise-ship-pollution\">cruise ship industry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/25/overtourism-in-europe-historic-cities-sparks-backlash\">overtourism across Europe\u2019s cities</a> more broadly. Throughout August, Extinction Rebellion <a href=\"https://www.ttgmedia.com/cruise/extinction-rebellion-calls-for-immediate-end-to-the-cruise-industry-as-new-ship-targeted-47925\">stopped cruise ships</a> entering ports in the Netherlands, and earlier in the year tourists were <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/travel/barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl/index.html\">targeted with water pistols</a> in Barcelona by campaigners demanding, among other things, the closure of cruise ship terminals.</p> \n<p>Some cities are implementing measures to limit the cruise industry\u2019s activity, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/13/italy-bans-cruise-ships-from-venice-lagoon-after-unesco-threat\">banning the ships from city centres</a>, reducing <a href=\"https://etias.com/articles/amsterdam-ban-cruise-ships-combat-overtourism#:~:text=A%20phased%20cruise%20ship%20reduction,ships%20in%20the%20city%20center\">the number that can visit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/cruise-ship-passengers-motorhomes-tourist-taxes-scotland-4771193\">introducing a tax</a> on passengers. But in Marseille the situation seems harder to change.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, the city\u2019s mayor, socialist Beno\u00eet Payan, <a href=\"https://www.marseille.fr/mairie/stop-pollution\">launched a petition</a> calling for limits on the number of cruise ships allowed to arrive during times of peak pollution, declaring: \u201cMarseille is suffocating.\u201d It attracted more than 50,000 signatures, but little further action. Instead, plans are going ahead for a new cruise terminal to open in 2026 in the Port of Marseille, which is controlled by President Macron\u2019s government in Paris.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I have a huge feeling of anger against the shipping companies</p> \n  <footer> <cite>Guillaume Picard</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe are not at all decision makers in Marseille, unlike other ports where there are more restrictions for local communities,\u201d says S\u00e9bastien Barles, deputy mayor for the environment. \u201cI think no one in Marseille, except for some merchants, can say cruises bring them a lot of money.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b2ade799-142f-4fc3-b952-1de82ff12c3e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZlgM_u4Ghg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Stop Croisi\u00e8res first attracted attention in 2020 when its members \u2013 the core of whom now number between 50 and 100, says Picard, including paramedics, lawyers and ecologists \u2013 unfurled a banner over a bridge in the northern neighbourhood of L\u2019Estaque, saying: \u201cIn Marseille, breathing kills.\u201d The group made the news again in 2022 when it carried out its first kayak stunt, holding up the <a href=\"https://www.alamy.com/marseille-france-14th-june-2022-general-view-of-the-wonder-of-the-seas-blocked-in-paca-marseille-activists-from-the-stop-cruises-collective-blocked-the-arrival-of-the-largest-liner-in-the-world-the-wonder-of-the-seas-in-the-port-of-marseille-by-canoe-kayak-credit-image-gerard-bottinosopa-images-via-zuma-press-wire-image472516907.html\">Wonder of the Seas</a>, then the world\u2019s largest cruise liner. Then last month <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240921-environmental-protesters-block-french-cruise-liner-port\">the group kayaked out</a> into the mouth of the port of Marseille and delayed three cruise liners for several hours before being arrested. After both the group\u2019s kayak stunts, its activists were arrested and then released.</p> \n<p>Picard, who has two daughters and grandchildren, has become a kind of father figure to the group. \u201cI\u2019m extremely touched by the commitment of all these young people I see at Stop Croisi\u00e8res,\u201d he says. \u201cThey could all be my children, almost. And I find them extremely motivated, well organised, and aware of the world in which we live.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Picard, the switch from boat captain to protester has been a long journey of self-education. When he started working on ships he knew they were \u201cmachines that pollute a lot\u201d, but little more than that, he says. He became increasingly aware of the impact of parking such \u201cbig monsters\u201d in the middle of a city, and when his first grandchild was born he decided he needed to act. He says some former colleagues now resent him, while others sympathise without daring to speak out. The captain of one of the liners the activists stopped last month was an old colleague who left him a voice message during the protest. \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to it,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>He has regrets about his former career as a commercial sailor, but is trying to share his knowledge of the maritime world with as many people as possible in the hope that it can be useful. \u201cI certainly feel guilty,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s guilt for having participated in the destruction of life. But maybe that is the engine that makes me an activist now.\u201d There is also something stronger than guilt driving his actions. \u201cI also have a huge feeling of anger against the shipping companies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite his disillusionment with the current state of play, he has not lost hope of rediscovering his love of the sea. \u201cFor the moment it\u2019s a bit like it\u2019s on standby, the sea. With Stop Croisi\u00e8res I interact with it in a different way.\u201d</p>",

Now aged 65, his grey hair in a ponytail, it is with no small note of sadness that he says, increasingly, it is the land that calls him. \u201cTo be completely honest, I want to go to sea less and less,\u201d he says. \u201cI go hiking a lot in the mountains with my wife, and we\u2019ve found an environment that is much more preserved. The mountains are beautiful wherever you go.\u201d Picard\u2019s beloved sea is being destroyed, he believes, by something uncomfortably close to home: cruise ships. Fifteen years ago they were a rare sight in Marseille. Now, France\u2019s second city is one of Europe\u2019s busiest cruise ports. Last year, 2.5 million passengers stopped off, according to the port authority, a million more than the year before. Faced with this new reality, Picard has decided to become the sea\u2019s protector, swapping his captain\u2019s whites for the all-black of a non-violent protester. His new crew is a growing group of activists known as Stop Croisi\u00e8res, or Stop Cruises. \u201cAt some point we will have to make a choice for our children, for our grandchildren,\u201d he says. \u201cDo we continue to make bigger and more energy-consuming ships with more and more people on board? Are we really going to be able to continue to live on this Earth like this?\u201d The group is part of a growing protest movement against the cruise ship industry and overtourism across Europe\u2019s cities more broadly. Throughout August, Extinction Rebellion stopped cruise ships entering ports in the Netherlands, and earlier in the year tourists were targeted with water pistols in Barcelona by campaigners demanding, among other things, the closure of cruise ship terminals. Some cities are implementing measures to limit the cruise industry\u2019s activity, such as banning the ships from city centres, reducing the number that can visit and introducing a tax on passengers. But in Marseille the situation seems harder to change. Two years ago, the city\u2019s mayor, socialist Beno\u00eet Payan, launched a petition calling for limits on the number of cruise ships allowed to arrive during times of peak pollution, declaring: \u201cMarseille is suffocating.\u201d It attracted more than 50,000 signatures, but little further action. Instead, plans are going ahead for a new cruise terminal to open in 2026 in the Port of Marseille, which is controlled by President Macron\u2019s government in Paris. \u201cWe are not at all decision makers in Marseille, unlike other ports where there are more restrictions for local communities,\u201d says S\u00e9bastien Barles, deputy mayor for the environment. \u201cI think no one in Marseille, except for some merchants, can say cruises bring them a lot of money.\u201d Stop Croisi\u00e8res first attracted attention in 2020 when its members \u2013 the core of whom now number between 50 and 100, says Picard, including paramedics, lawyers and ecologists \u2013 unfurled a banner over a bridge in the northern neighbourhood of L\u2019Estaque, saying: \u201cIn Marseille, breathing kills.\u201d The group made the news again in 2022 when it carried out its first kayak stunt, holding up the Wonder of the Seas, then the world\u2019s largest cruise liner. Then last month the group kayaked out into the mouth of the port of Marseille and delayed three cruise liners for several hours before being arrested. After both the group\u2019s kayak stunts, its activists were arrested and then released. Picard, who has two daughters and grandchildren, has become a kind of father figure to the group. \u201cI\u2019m extremely touched by the commitment of all these young people I see at Stop Croisi\u00e8res,\u201d he says. \u201cThey could all be my children, almost. And I find them extremely motivated, well organised, and aware of the world in which we live.\u201d For Picard, the switch from boat captain to protester has been a long journey of self-education. When he started working on ships he knew they were \u201cmachines that pollute a lot\u201d, but little more than that, he says. He became increasingly aware of the impact of parking such \u201cbig monsters\u201d in the middle of a city, and when his first grandchild was born he decided he needed to act. He says some former colleagues now resent him, while others sympathise without daring to speak out. The captain of one of the liners the activists stopped last month was an old colleague who left him a voice message during the protest. \u201cI haven\u2019t listened to it,\u201d he says. He has regrets about his former career as a commercial sailor, but is trying to share his knowledge of the maritime world with as many people as possible in the hope that it can be useful. \u201cI certainly feel guilty,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s guilt for having participated in the destruction of life. But maybe that is the engine that makes me an activist now.\u201d There is also something stronger than guilt driving his actions. \u201cI also have a huge feeling of anger against the shipping companies.\u201d Despite his disillusionment with the current state of play, he has not lost hope of rediscovering his love of the sea. \u201cFor the moment it\u2019s a bit like it\u2019s on standby, the sea. With Stop Croisi\u00e8res I interact with it in a different way.\u201d",

So I think we\u2019re just at a slightly leading edge of a policy that will become very common indeed in future. We\u2019ve not rushed at it. We\u2019re doing it carefully.

Drakeford said: \u201cI think people will think of it as a simple act of fairness, that you make a very small contribution to the costs that would have been incurred as a result of you visiting that area.\u201d Local authorities will be able to use the money to boost Cymraeg, the Welsh language. Drakeford said: \u201cIn some parts of Wales, the language is the reason that people visit. People visit not just for the physical fabric of the place, but for the cultural component as well. You come to Wales, you are coming to a different place. And the language and the culture is part of what makes it attractive. Keeping the character of the area as well as the physical fabric is part of what local authorities would be able to use the money they would have collected to do.\u201d Drakeford said he did not believe the levy would make Wales seem unwelcoming. \u201cThis is something that is happening around the world. So I think we\u2019re just at a slightly leading edge of a policy that will become very common indeed in future. We\u2019ve not rushed at it. We\u2019re doing it carefully. We\u2019re trying to take the industry with us, give people plenty of time to prepare for it, because that way we can make it a success.\u201d There will be exceptions. Homeless people staying in holiday accommodation that has been arranged for them by local authorities will be exempt and people with disabilities travelling with a carer will be eligible for refunds. People staying in holiday accommodation after an emergency, for example a flood, will not have to pay, not will anyone staying more than 31 nights. The bill is called the visitor accommodation (register and levy) etc. (Wales) bill. In other Welsh political developments, the government has updated plans for its sustainable farming scheme \u2013 its post-Brexit plan for funding the industry \u2013 after its earlier version triggered protest from farmers. One of the changes is that farmers will no longer be asked to have a minimum of 10% tree cover on their land. Instead, there will be a scheme-wide target for a tree-planting and hedgerow-creation opportunity plan. The details are still to be worked out. The deputy first minister, Huw Irranca-Davies, said: \u201cIt was clear changes were needed \u2013 we said we would listen \u2013 and we\u2019ve done just that.\u201d The final decision on the scheme will be made next summer.",

A productive author and educator, Barbauld held radical views on various topics; she supported the French Revolution and the abolition of slavery. But The Rights of Woman is not the call to revolution it may first appear. It might even be read as satire. Unlike Wollstonecraft, Barbauld stringently limits her vision of women\u2019s rights, while presenting them in supposedly triumphalist terms of war, perhaps even holy war. Her address to women \u2013 and, implicitly, men \u2013 is arguably a mockery of the complex issue of \u201crights\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cRise, assert thy right!\u201d is a command that simplifies rights by losing the plural, and thus the plurality of the concept. The imagery of national conquest dominates the earlier stanzas. Coronation is envisaged, and the \u201cbright artillery\u201d which is now at Woman\u2019s disposal is gleaming seductively in her direction. Yet the socially approved, restrictive feminine stereotypes enter early into these calls to power, fearless with references to the traditionally conceived sex-war weapons of \u201cmelting tones\u201d, \u201cblushes and fears\u201d, \u201cwit and art\u201d.</p> <p>The closing command of the first stanza to \u201cresume thy native empire o\u2019er the breast\u201d is the strongest hint of doubled intentions in the portrayal of conquest: there might be a suggestion that the imperial victory is connected to the wearing of a breast-plate, but it\u2019s more likely that women\u2019s true field of activity and power is being defined as the nursery, and, of course, that supposed nursery of tender feeling, the heart.</p> <p>In the cleverly argued fourth stanza, the object of attack is the too-easy acceptance of women\u2019s rights in terms of intuitive approval rather than rational discussion. Rights are not to be equated with \u201csacred mysteries\u201d. This is compelling. Unfortunately, the poem falls short elsewhere of its good advice concerning the discussion of female emancipation.</p> <p>The force of the feminine stereotype becomes clearer in stanzas five and six. \u201cThou mays\u2019t command, but never can be free\u201d asserts without explanation the impossibility of success for the woman who attains power. The last line of the next stanza gives aphoristic form to the risk traditionally considered to beset the female when male courtship is rejected: \u201cShe hazards all, who will the least allow.\u201d Barbauld\u2019s verse structure favours her talent for the ringing final line.</p> <p>The earlier verses of The Rights of Woman suggest an imagined, metaphorical transfiguration, in which \u201csoft power\u201d achieves social and political force. But since Barbauld establishes images of empowerment and equality through metaphors of military action and statecraft, there is little to deflect the rigid mockery of her presentation. When she comes to her concluding stanzas, it\u2019s less than surprising that she declares the \u201cproud eminence\u201d that represents women\u2019s victory, as the \u201ccourted idol of mankind\u201d, to be unsustainable. </p> <p>The last stanza, energised by the repetition of \u201cthen\u201d, begins by insisting on the abandonment of \u201ceach ambitious thought\u201d and subsequently re-reads gender equality from a romanticised \u2013 and biologised \u2013 perspective. Nature is responsible for women\u2019s presumed lack of desire for \u201cconquest\u201d, and this is all to the good. \u201cRights\u201d founded on rational and fair-minded construction become irrelevant. While the assertion that \u201cseparate rights are lost in mutual love\u201d sounds eloquent, it withdraws all credibility from the idea of vindication. As an independent woman such as Barbauld might have recognised, any lover worthy of the name would be first to resist such a loss of autonomy, either for themselves or for their partner. </p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br><br></p>",

The closing command of the first stanza to \u201cresume thy native empire o\u2019er the breast\u201d is the strongest hint of doubled intentions in the portrayal of conquest: there might be a suggestion that the imperial victory is connected to the wearing of a breast-plate, but it\u2019s more likely that women\u2019s true field of activity and power is being defined as the nursery, and, of course, that supposed nursery of tender feeling, the heart. In the cleverly argued fourth stanza, the object of attack is the too-easy acceptance of women\u2019s rights in terms of intuitive approval rather than rational discussion. Rights are not to be equated with \u201csacred mysteries\u201d. This is compelling. Unfortunately, the poem falls short elsewhere of its good advice concerning the discussion of female emancipation. The force of the feminine stereotype becomes clearer in stanzas five and six. \u201cThou mays\u2019t command, but never can be free\u201d asserts without explanation the impossibility of success for the woman who attains power. The last line of the next stanza gives aphoristic form to the risk traditionally considered to beset the female when male courtship is rejected: \u201cShe hazards all, who will the least allow.\u201d Barbauld\u2019s verse structure favours her talent for the ringing final line. The earlier verses of The Rights of Woman suggest an imagined, metaphorical transfiguration, in which \u201csoft power\u201d achieves social and political force. But since Barbauld establishes images of empowerment and equality through metaphors of military action and statecraft, there is little to deflect the rigid mockery of her presentation. When she comes to her concluding stanzas, it\u2019s less than surprising that she declares the \u201cproud eminence\u201d that represents women\u2019s victory, as the \u201ccourted idol of mankind\u201d, to be unsustainable. The last stanza, energised by the repetition of \u201cthen\u201d, begins by insisting on the abandonment of \u201ceach ambitious thought\u201d and subsequently re-reads gender equality from a romanticised \u2013 and biologised \u2013 perspective. Nature is responsible for women\u2019s presumed lack of desire for \u201cconquest\u201d, and this is all to the good. \u201cRights\u201d founded on rational and fair-minded construction become irrelevant. While the assertion that \u201cseparate rights are lost in mutual love\u201d sounds eloquent, it withdraws all credibility from the idea of vindication. As an independent woman such as Barbauld might have recognised, any lover worthy of the name would be first to resist such a loss of autonomy, either for themselves or for their partner.",

Now, how would this new Xanadu shape up when placed into the hottest kiln of public debate known to humankind? Forget geopolitics and burning social issues, forget even Donald Trump, the truest test is a Premier League weekend.</p> <p>The low-mood agony of an international break had heightened anticipation while allowing further time for social media migrants crossing the great divide. Did we revive the spirit of 2011, legacy Twitter\u2019s breakthrough year, those high times of Follow Friday, everyone cracking on famously, apart from the odd pile-on? Thinking back, those got pretty nasty, especially on football Twitter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/25/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\u2019s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So far, so friendly and cuddly, perhaps a little too antiseptic, though that seems a necessary step. Everyone\u2019s older, and if not wiser they know how things can turn. Reading X replies now is a glance into a seething well of bile and misinformation. On Bluesky right now there\u2019s the novelty of not having your appearance, hated profession and/or bias come up in the replies. The hidden reply that revealed either vile abuse or the Telegram address for a betting scam you still always clicked on will not be missed.</p> <p>Social media is best \u2013 and funniest \u2013 when feeding off events, and the footballing weekend duly delivered. Manchester City\u2019s latest defeat brought a smattering of Bluesky \u201cbald fraud\u201d jibes at under-pressure failure Pep Guardiola after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Saturday\u2019s 4-0 defeat by Tottenham</a>. \u201cI think Manchester got rid of the wrong bald fraud\u201d was one example; Erik ten Hag endures as a meme.</p> <p>Back to the old house where hysteria continues to reign and, in truth, much of the better material still resides. A fair few X-ers hit the mark with gags about legal challenges to City\u2019s five-game losing run. Meanwhile one aggregator account went fully off at the deep end, demanding Kyle Walker\u2019s exile to \u201cChina or Saudi\u201d, and declaring \u201c[Phil] Foden\u2019s decline should be studied at Oxford\u201d. Bluesky is not yet a battleground for City\u2019s actual legal issues, where X has become a happy place for those who get their kicks from associated party transactions and shareholder loans. Should that situation develop, as is expected with City\u2019s Premier League charges any day now, it can only be expected to blossom within the new surroundings.</p>    <p>Another dependable content driver is refereeing, tinfoil hats readily donned in the belief that every official is against <em>your</em> club. Musk\u2019s plaything features a number of specialists in this area, with one prolific account compiling a multi-tweet dossier on Adrian Holmes, the referee\u2019s assistant who denied Arsenal a goal in Saturday\u2019s \u2026 checks notes \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest</a>. Over on Bluesky, Holmes received no such mentions. Beyond a few grumbles over a Bukayo Saka booking, Arsenal fans were happy to celebrate an important win. For now, wild conspiracies remain largely confined to the mothership rather than the escape pod.</p> <p>Still, on Sunday, when Liverpool conceded a debatable penalty against Southampton, the name of Michael Oliver, the VAR decision-maker, was taken in vain on both platforms. One Blueskyer, rather inexplicably, screamed: \u201cI am 54 and have never seen a penalty like that given.\u201d Nobody went quite as far as the X user who declared penalty takers should not be allowed to score rebounds. Anyway, all was soon well among Liverpool fans. \u201cMo Salah is the best player in the world right now,\u201d hooted a Bluesky user, though complaints arose that the Egyptian King\u2019s yellow card for celebratory disrobing had cost Fantasy Premier League points.</p> <p>Which left Manchester United, faded grandeur repurposed in the last decade into a pathos-laden soap opera best depicted by a series of viral memes: the other Andrew Tate, Rio Ferdinand\u2019s \u201cMan Utd are back, man,\u201d any number of managerial mock-ups. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/manchester-uniteds-joyless-incoherence-will-destroy-any-illusions\">Ruben Amorim\u2019s bow at Ipswich</a> and United\u2019s 81-second opening goal brought much snark along the lines of United being \u201cback\u201d, and as performance levels dropped and Ipswich got a deserved draw sarcasm was further employed as a safety blanket: \u201cAmorim out\u201d. A series of earnest discussions over which players fit a 3-4-3 formation represented the cold wind of reality, before some old-fashioned \u2013 fully deserved \u2013 vitriol was retained for Ed Sheeran\u2019s leering cameo on Sky Sports\u2019 broadcast.</p> <p>So, a softish rollout. If the bite once enjoyed on the abandoned hellscape is missing, edges blunted, things will sharpen up soon enough. After all, what is social media other than a cracked mirror to humankind? Just go easy on those pile-ons.</p>",

Now, how would this new Xanadu shape up when placed into the hottest kiln of public debate known to humankind? Forget geopolitics and burning social issues, forget even Donald Trump, the truest test is a Premier League weekend. The low-mood agony of an international break had heightened anticipation while allowing further time for social media migrants crossing the great divide. Did we revive the spirit of 2011, legacy Twitter\u2019s breakthrough year, those high times of Follow Friday, everyone cracking on famously, apart from the odd pile-on? Thinking back, those got pretty nasty, especially on football Twitter. So far, so friendly and cuddly, perhaps a little too antiseptic, though that seems a necessary step. Everyone\u2019s older, and if not wiser they know how things can turn. Reading X replies now is a glance into a seething well of bile and misinformation. On Bluesky right now there\u2019s the novelty of not having your appearance, hated profession and/or bias come up in the replies. The hidden reply that revealed either vile abuse or the Telegram address for a betting scam you still always clicked on will not be missed. Social media is best \u2013 and funniest \u2013 when feeding off events, and the footballing weekend duly delivered. Manchester City\u2019s latest defeat brought a smattering of Bluesky \u201cbald fraud\u201d jibes at under-pressure failure Pep Guardiola after Saturday\u2019s 4-0 defeat by Tottenham. \u201cI think Manchester got rid of the wrong bald fraud\u201d was one example; Erik ten Hag endures as a meme. Back to the old house where hysteria continues to reign and, in truth, much of the better material still resides. A fair few X-ers hit the mark with gags about legal challenges to City\u2019s five-game losing run. Meanwhile one aggregator account went fully off at the deep end, demanding Kyle Walker\u2019s exile to \u201cChina or Saudi\u201d, and declaring \u201c[Phil] Foden\u2019s decline should be studied at Oxford\u201d. Bluesky is not yet a battleground for City\u2019s actual legal issues, where X has become a happy place for those who get their kicks from associated party transactions and shareholder loans. Should that situation develop, as is expected with City\u2019s Premier League charges any day now, it can only be expected to blossom within the new surroundings. Another dependable content driver is refereeing, tinfoil hats readily donned in the belief that every official is against your club. Musk\u2019s plaything features a number of specialists in this area, with one prolific account compiling a multi-tweet dossier on Adrian Holmes, the referee\u2019s assistant who denied Arsenal a goal in Saturday\u2019s \u2026 checks notes \u2026 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest. Over on Bluesky, Holmes received no such mentions. Beyond a few grumbles over a Bukayo Saka booking, Arsenal fans were happy to celebrate an important win. For now, wild conspiracies remain largely confined to the mothership rather than the escape pod. Still, on Sunday, when Liverpool conceded a debatable penalty against Southampton, the name of Michael Oliver, the VAR decision-maker, was taken in vain on both platforms. One Blueskyer, rather inexplicably, screamed: \u201cI am 54 and have never seen a penalty like that given.\u201d Nobody went quite as far as the X user who declared penalty takers should not be allowed to score rebounds. Anyway, all was soon well among Liverpool fans. \u201cMo Salah is the best player in the world right now,\u201d hooted a Bluesky user, though complaints arose that the Egyptian King\u2019s yellow card for celebratory disrobing had cost Fantasy Premier League points. Which left Manchester United, faded grandeur repurposed in the last decade into a pathos-laden soap opera best depicted by a series of viral memes: the other Andrew Tate, Rio Ferdinand\u2019s \u201cMan Utd are back, man,\u201d any number of managerial mock-ups. Ruben Amorim\u2019s bow at Ipswich and United\u2019s 81-second opening goal brought much snark along the lines of United being \u201cback\u201d, and as performance levels dropped and Ipswich got a deserved draw sarcasm was further employed as a safety blanket: \u201cAmorim out\u201d. A series of earnest discussions over which players fit a 3-4-3 formation represented the cold wind of reality, before some old-fashioned \u2013 fully deserved \u2013 vitriol was retained for Ed Sheeran\u2019s leering cameo on Sky Sports\u2019 broadcast. So, a softish rollout. If the bite once enjoyed on the abandoned hellscape is missing, edges blunted, things will sharpen up soon enough. After all, what is social media other than a cracked mirror to humankind? Just go easy on those pile-ons.",

      "body": "<p>Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of defense, has attacked several key US alliances such as Nato, allied countries such as Turkey and international institutions such as the United Nations in two recent books, as well as saying US troops should not be bound by the Geneva conventions.</p> <p>At the same time, the man who would head America\u2019s gigantic military has tied US foreign policy almost entirely to the priority of Israel, a country of which he says: \u201cIf you love America, you should love Israel.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Hegseth appears to argue that the US military should ignore the Geneva conventions and any international laws governing the conduct of war, and instead \u201cunleash them\u201d to become a \u201cruthless\u201d, \u201cuncompromising\u201d and \u201coverwhelmingly lethal\u201d force geared to \u201cwinning our wars according to our own rules\u201d.</p> <p>Hegseth\u2019s policy preferences may raise concerns about the future of Nato, the escalation of tensions with Israel\u2019s arch-foe Iran, and impunity for US war criminals, such as those who Hegseth persuaded Trump to pardon in his first term.</p> <p>Tom Hill, executive director of the Center for Peace and Diplomacy (CPD), told the Guardian that Hegseth\u2019s nomination reflected the fact that for Donald Trump, \u201cone of the bases of support he owes is the Christian nationalist evangelical movement\u201d.</p> <p>In Hegseth, \u201cwhat he is offering is Israel policy and a warping of foreign policy around Israel as a reward to this Christian nationalist base,\u201d said Hill.</p> <h2>\u2018Europe has already allowed itself to be invaded\u2019</h2> <p>While in the more distant past Hegseth was a foreign policy hawk aligned with neoconservatism, since what he has called his \u201cTrump conversion\u201d, he has written scathingly of multilateral institutions.</p> <p>In American Crusade (AC), published in 2020, Hegseth asks bluntly: \u201cWhy do we fund the anti-American UN? Why is Islamist Turkey a member of Nato?\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere in that book, Hegseth disparages the International Security Assistance Force, the UN security council\u2019s peacekeeping force sent to Afghanistan in 2006, with claims based on his own service in Afghanistan: \u201cOn my camouflage uniform, I wore an American flag on one shoulder and an Isaf patch on the other,\u201d he writes, adding: \u201cThe running joke of US troops in Afghanistan was that the Isaf patch actually stood for \u2018I Saw Americans Fighting\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Hegseth characterizes Nato allies as not paying their way: \u201cNato is not an alliance; it\u2019s a defense arrangement for Europe, paid for and underwritten by the United States.\u201d</p> <p>He also embeds criticisms of Nato in apocalyptic, \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d-style narratives of European immigration. Hegseth writes at one point in AC: \u201cEurope has already allowed itself to be invaded.

      "bodyText": "Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of defense, has attacked several key US alliances such as Nato, allied countries such as Turkey and international institutions such as the United Nations in two recent books, as well as saying US troops should not be bound by the Geneva conventions. At the same time, the man who would head America\u2019s gigantic military has tied US foreign policy almost entirely to the priority of Israel, a country of which he says: \u201cIf you love America, you should love Israel.\u201d Elsewhere, Hegseth appears to argue that the US military should ignore the Geneva conventions and any international laws governing the conduct of war, and instead \u201cunleash them\u201d to become a \u201cruthless\u201d, \u201cuncompromising\u201d and \u201coverwhelmingly lethal\u201d force geared to \u201cwinning our wars according to our own rules\u201d. Hegseth\u2019s policy preferences may raise concerns about the future of Nato, the escalation of tensions with Israel\u2019s arch-foe Iran, and impunity for US war criminals, such as those who Hegseth persuaded Trump to pardon in his first term. Tom Hill, executive director of the Center for Peace and Diplomacy (CPD), told the Guardian that Hegseth\u2019s nomination reflected the fact that for Donald Trump, \u201cone of the bases of support he owes is the Christian nationalist evangelical movement\u201d. In Hegseth, \u201cwhat he is offering is Israel policy and a warping of foreign policy around Israel as a reward to this Christian nationalist base,\u201d said Hill. \u2018Europe has already allowed itself to be invaded\u2019 While in the more distant past Hegseth was a foreign policy hawk aligned with neoconservatism, since what he has called his \u201cTrump conversion\u201d, he has written scathingly of multilateral institutions. In American Crusade (AC), published in 2020, Hegseth asks bluntly: \u201cWhy do we fund the anti-American UN? Why is Islamist Turkey a member of Nato?\u201d Elsewhere in that book, Hegseth disparages the International Security Assistance Force, the UN security council\u2019s peacekeeping force sent to Afghanistan in 2006, with claims based on his own service in Afghanistan: \u201cOn my camouflage uniform, I wore an American flag on one shoulder and an Isaf patch on the other,\u201d he writes, adding: \u201cThe running joke of US troops in Afghanistan was that the Isaf patch actually stood for \u2018I Saw Americans Fighting\u2019.\u201d Like Trump, Hegseth characterizes Nato allies as not paying their way: \u201cNato is not an alliance; it\u2019s a defense arrangement for Europe, paid for and underwritten by the United States.\u201d He also embeds criticisms of Nato in apocalyptic, \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d-style narratives of European immigration. Hegseth writes at one point in AC: \u201cEurope has already allowed itself to be invaded. It chose not to rebuild its militaries, happily suckling off the teat of America\u2019s willingness to actually fight and win wars.\u201d Hegseth is particularly incensed by the inclusion of Turkey in Nato. He argues that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, \u201copenly dreams of restoring the Ottoman empire\u201d and is \u201can Islamist with Islamist visions for the Middle East\u201d. \u201cThe defense of Europe is not our problem; been there, done that, twice,\u201d Hegseth writes, adding: \u201cNato is a relic and should be scrapped and remade in order for freedom to be truly defended. \u201cThis is what Trump is fighting for,\u201d he concludes. The UN, meanwhile, he calls \u201ca fully globalist organization that aggressively advances an anti-American, anti-Israel, and anti-freedom agenda. Here\u2019s one set of rules for the United States and Israel, another for everyone else.\u201d On Hegseth\u2019s characterization of Turkey as Islamist \u2013 the same descriptor he uses for militant non-state actors such as Isis \u2013 Hill said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremist rhetoric that\u2019s trying to paint literal treaty allies as illegitimate actors.\u201d \u2018If you love America, you should love Israel\u2019 Hegseth\u2019s belief in the UN\u2019s bias against Israel mirrors his deepest apparent commitments: that any vision of international cooperation is rooted in his support of Israel, which at times he couches in religious terms. In a striking passage in AC he presents his support for Israel as a renewal of medieval crusades. \u201cOur present moment is much like the 11th century,\u201d he writes in AC, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight, but, like our fellow Christians a thousand years ago, we must. We need an American crusade.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe Christians \u2013 alongside our Jewish friends and their remarkable army in Israel \u2013 need to pick up the sword of unapologetic Americanism and defend ourselves.\u201d Hegseth continues: \u201cFor us as American crusaders, Israel embodies the soul of our American crusade \u2013 the \u2018why\u2019 to our \u2018what\u2019.\u201d Hegseth concludes: \u201cFaith, family, freedom, and free enterprise; if you love those, learn to love the state of Israel. And then find an arena in which to fight for her.\u201d Hill said Hegseth\u2019s Christian nationalism, rooted in fundamentalist Christianity, is key to understanding his perspective on Israel. \u201cHe is centering Israel in everything because of theology,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an eschatology and a prophetic interpretation the Book of Revelations \u2013 the Second Coming, Armageddon, the return of Jesus that is really important, and Israel is central to that eschatology.\u201d The Guardian previously reported that Hegseth, who has a tattoo of the crusader motto \u201cDeus vult\u201d, similarly presented the struggle against \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cdomestic enemies\u201d as a \u201ccrusade\u201d or \u201choly war\u201d. In AC, he explicitly connects this domestic crusade with his support for Israel, writing that \u201cwe have domestic enemies, and we have international allies \u2026 it\u2019s time to reach out to people who value the same principles, relearn lessons from them, and form stronger bonds.\u201d Hegseth writes in AC that Israel, along with the European far right and Brexit, are among the overseas reservoirs of American values. \u201cAmericanism is alive in Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu boldly stands against international antisemitism and Islamism,\u201d he writes. Hegseth continues: \u201cAmericanism is alive in the hearts of Brexiters in the United Kingdom who yearn for national sovereignty. Americanism is alive in places such as Poland, which reject the globalist visions of leftist bureaucrats in old Europe.\u201d Israel, meanwhile, \u201ccontinues to vanquish its Islamist foes \u2013 thanks to the big, beautiful wall and big, beautiful army it has built,\u201d he writes. Earlier this week, the international criminal court issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu over the conduct of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u2018We will rip your arms off and feed them to hogs\u2019 In 2024\u2019s The War on Warriors, Hegseth argues at length that US forces should ignore the Geneva conventions and other elements of international law governing the conduct of war. In the book, Hegseth asks: \u201cThe key question of our generation \u2013 of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 is way more complicated: what do you do if your enemy does not honor the Geneva conventions? \u201cWe never got an answer.

And no victory.\u201d Hegseth\u2019s answer is that the conventions should be ignored. \u201cWhat if we treated the enemy the way they treated us?\u201d he asks. \u201cWould that not be an incentive for the other side to reconsider their barbarism? Hey, Al Qaeda: if you surrender, we might spare your life. If you do not, we will rip your arms off and feed them to hogs.\u201d He then writes: \u201cWe are just fighting with one hand behind our back \u2013 and the enemy knows it \u2026 If our warriors are forced to follow rules arbitrarily and asked to sacrifice more lives so that international tribunals feel better about themselves, aren\u2019t we just better off winning our wars according to our own rules?!\u201d He continues: \u201cWho cares what other countries think?\u201d Hill said Hegseth\u2019s rhetoric blamed \u201cliberal ideas\u201d for military defeat in a way that resembled the narratives far-right movements have historically used to scapegoat their political opponents for military defeats.

      "body": "<p>A Kentucky woman known by the pseudonym Mary Poe recently <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/documents/complaint-mary-poe-v-russell-coleman-et-al\">filed a lawsuit</a> against her state, seeking an abortion for what was once a banal reason: because she wanted one.</p> <p>Poe, who was about seven weeks pregnant at the time of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, has since had an abortion <a href=\"https://kentuckylantern.com/briefs/woman-challenging-kentucky-abortion-ban-has-ended-her-pregnancy-but-not-the-legal-challenge/\">out of state</a>. But her attorneys argue that she still has standing to sue to overturn <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/us/kentucky-abortion-lawsuit/index.html\">Kentucky\u2019s two abortion bans</a> \u2013 a six-week ban and a separate total ban \u2013 arguing that the laws violate the state constitution. This much, at least, is typical: lawsuits challenging abortion bans have sprung up across the country since Dobbs, with women and their families seeking to overturn bans, expand exceptions, or get some compensation from the state for the graphic, distressing, disabling or deadly outcomes that the bans have made them suffer.</p> <p>The US supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe in Dobbs <a href=\"https://ballsandstrikes.org/law-politics/brett-kavanaugh-dobbs-conurrence-lie-unraveling/\">cited</a> the surge in activist litigation around abortion \u2013 a product of conservative investment in anti-choice legal shops \u2013 as part of their reason for doing so. Surely this must be a contentious, controversial issue that the federal bench is ill equipped to resolve, the judges from the conservative legal movement reasoned \u2013 because look how many complaints the conservative legal movement has filed against it!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/14/abortion-ban-rights-trump\">We\u2019ll need to fight to protect US reproductive rights. Here\u2019s what to expect | Sophie Brickman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This rationale was always disingenuous, but it has also been proved flatly wrong: Dobbs has not got the courts out of the abortion business. Instead, lawsuits over abortion have exploded. The anti-choice camp has pounced, seeking to further restrict abortion by banning pills; targeting reproductive rights advocates, abortion funds and sexual health educators; claiming rights for fetuses or embryos; or by asserting that men who father pregnancies have a right to keep women from terminating them.</p> <p>But the pro-abortion rights side has been busy with litigation, too. Women who have been put at great health risk or made to suffer terrible, painful complications as a result of bans brought a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/31/texas-supreme-court-zurawski-abortion/#:~:text=The%20case%2C%20Zurawski%20v.,20%20women%20and%20two%20doctors.\">class-action lawsuit</a> in Texas. Bans <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/legal-challenges-to-state-abortion-bans-since-the-dobbs-decision/\">have been challenged</a> over and over again \u2013 on religious liberty grounds, on the grounds of state constitutional provisions securing the right to make individual healthcare decisions, under a federal law that guarantees emergency room treatment for patients needing stabilizing care, and under state constitutional clauses guaranteeing liberty, due process and privacy.</p> <p>The Kentucky lawsuit is part of this latter camp. Mary Poe has cited Kentucky\u2019s constitutional guarantees of individual rights to both privacy and self-determination, which she says have been violated by the bans. \u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state,\u201d she said in <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/kentucky-woman-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-two-abortion-bans-2\">a statement</a> delivered via her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cI am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the healthcare they need in our community.\u201d</p> <p>This kind of desire for an abortion \u2013 the dignified simplicity of it \u2013 has been missing from much of the post-Dobbs abortion rights discourse. After the ruling, as trigger bans shot into effect across the country, clinics shuttered their doors, and scared women tried to discern their options, there was no shortage of tragic stories highlighting the brutality, indignity and gendered bigotry of the laws. But as the dust settled and members of the Democratic party, the major reproductive rights advocacy groups and the liberal legal movement surveyed the national scene, a consensus emerged that the face of the mainstream pro-choice movement would be the patient who experienced a medical emergency.</p> <p>Women who had suffered horrific medical complications became lucid, moving and highly sought after tellers of their own stories, explaining how abortion bans has risked their health: <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/08/27/amanda-zurawksi-politics-democratic-national-convention-texas-abortion/\">Amanda Zurawski</a>, for example, was denied an emergency abortion at 18 weeks, subsequently went into septic shock twice, and one of her fallopian tubes was so scarred that it is now permanently closed, inhibiting her future fertility. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kate-cox-on-her-legal-fight-for-abortion-trisomy-18/\">Kate Cox</a> was denied an abortion after discovering that her fetus has trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition which is incompatible with life, and which, because of Cox\u2019s own medical history, also endangered her fertility and life.</p> <p>During her presidential run, Kamala Harris ran an ad featuring a woman identified <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNmmiYjDgQ&amp;ab_channel=KamalaHarris\">only as Ondrea</a>, who suffered a miscarriage at 16 weeks and was denied the standard care due to her state\u2019s abortion ban. She developed sepsis and almost died. The ad features a shot of Ondrea in a bathroom, staring at her body in a mirror wearing only a sports bra. Her belly bears the scars of the emergency surgery that eventually saved her life \u2013 the surgery that she never would have had to have if it weren\u2019t for the ban.</p> <p>It does not diminish these women\u2019s bravery, their suffering, or the wrongness of what was done to them to say that they are only one small fraction of those who need abortions in America. These are married, middle-class women with wanted pregnancies; Zurawski and Cox are both white. Cox has spoken movingly about her hopes to meet her future child, a girl; in the ad that features Ondrea, she and her husband hold a baby blanket. These are women whose suffering at the hands of abortion bans has nothing to do with a refusal or distaste for heterosexual, married, middle-class life. Their suffering can be made visible precisely because they are so acceptable.</p> <p>Not so with Mary Poe. Poe may well be married, middle-class and white; from her statement, in which she talks about the difficulty of finding childcare, we can infer that she, like most abortion patients, is already a mother. But Poe is not suffering a physical emergency; she is not enduring any pain or medical misfortune that she can use to purchase social license. She is not, in other words, a woman whose claim to an abortion is based on a plea for mercy. She is merely a woman who seeks to be in control of her own life, one who believes that things like privacy and self-determination apply to her, too.</p> <p>\u201cI have decided that ending my pregnancy is the best decision for me and my family,\u201d Poe writes in her public statement. \u201cThis is a personal decision, a decision I believe should be mine alone, not made by anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>This was not always a radical proposition. But in the post-Dobbs world, it has sadly become one.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "A Kentucky woman known by the pseudonym Mary Poe recently filed a lawsuit against her state, seeking an abortion for what was once a banal reason: because she wanted one. Poe, who was about seven weeks pregnant at the time of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, has since had an abortion out of state. But her attorneys argue that she still has standing to sue to overturn Kentucky\u2019s two abortion bans \u2013 a six-week ban and a separate total ban \u2013 arguing that the laws violate the state constitution. This much, at least, is typical: lawsuits challenging abortion bans have sprung up across the country since Dobbs, with women and their families seeking to overturn bans, expand exceptions, or get some compensation from the state for the graphic, distressing, disabling or deadly outcomes that the bans have made them suffer. The US supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe in Dobbs cited the surge in activist litigation around abortion \u2013 a product of conservative investment in anti-choice legal shops \u2013 as part of their reason for doing so. Surely this must be a contentious, controversial issue that the federal bench is ill equipped to resolve, the judges from the conservative legal movement reasoned \u2013 because look how many complaints the conservative legal movement has filed against it! This rationale was always disingenuous, but it has also been proved flatly wrong: Dobbs has not got the courts out of the abortion business. Instead, lawsuits over abortion have exploded. The anti-choice camp has pounced, seeking to further restrict abortion by banning pills; targeting reproductive rights advocates, abortion funds and sexual health educators; claiming rights for fetuses or embryos; or by asserting that men who father pregnancies have a right to keep women from terminating them. But the pro-abortion rights side has been busy with litigation, too. Women who have been put at great health risk or made to suffer terrible, painful complications as a result of bans brought a class-action lawsuit in Texas. Bans have been challenged over and over again \u2013 on religious liberty grounds, on the grounds of state constitutional provisions securing the right to make individual healthcare decisions, under a federal law that guarantees emergency room treatment for patients needing stabilizing care, and under state constitutional clauses guaranteeing liberty, due process and privacy. The Kentucky lawsuit is part of this latter camp. Mary Poe has cited Kentucky\u2019s constitutional guarantees of individual rights to both privacy and self-determination, which she says have been violated by the bans. \u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state,\u201d she said in a statement delivered via her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cI am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the healthcare they need in our community.\u201d This kind of desire for an abortion \u2013 the dignified simplicity of it \u2013 has been missing from much of the post-Dobbs abortion rights discourse. After the ruling, as trigger bans shot into effect across the country, clinics shuttered their doors, and scared women tried to discern their options, there was no shortage of tragic stories highlighting the brutality, indignity and gendered bigotry of the laws. But as the dust settled and members of the Democratic party, the major reproductive rights advocacy groups and the liberal legal movement surveyed the national scene, a consensus emerged that the face of the mainstream pro-choice movement would be the patient who experienced a medical emergency. Women who had suffered horrific medical complications became lucid, moving and highly sought after tellers of their own stories, explaining how abortion bans has risked their health: Amanda Zurawski, for example, was denied an emergency abortion at 18 weeks, subsequently went into septic shock twice, and one of her fallopian tubes was so scarred that it is now permanently closed, inhibiting her future fertility. Kate Cox was denied an abortion after discovering that her fetus has trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition which is incompatible with life, and which, because of Cox\u2019s own medical history, also endangered her fertility and life. During her presidential run, Kamala Harris ran an ad featuring a woman identified only as Ondrea, who suffered a miscarriage at 16 weeks and was denied the standard care due to her state\u2019s abortion ban. She developed sepsis and almost died. The ad features a shot of Ondrea in a bathroom, staring at her body in a mirror wearing only a sports bra. Her belly bears the scars of the emergency surgery that eventually saved her life \u2013 the surgery that she never would have had to have if it weren\u2019t for the ban. It does not diminish these women\u2019s bravery, their suffering, or the wrongness of what was done to them to say that they are only one small fraction of those who need abortions in America. These are married, middle-class women with wanted pregnancies; Zurawski and Cox are both white. Cox has spoken movingly about her hopes to meet her future child, a girl; in the ad that features Ondrea, she and her husband hold a baby blanket. These are women whose suffering at the hands of abortion bans has nothing to do with a refusal or distaste for heterosexual, married, middle-class life. Their suffering can be made visible precisely because they are so acceptable. Not so with Mary Poe. Poe may well be married, middle-class and white; from her statement, in which she talks about the difficulty of finding childcare, we can infer that she, like most abortion patients, is already a mother. But Poe is not suffering a physical emergency; she is not enduring any pain or medical misfortune that she can use to purchase social license. She is not, in other words, a woman whose claim to an abortion is based on a plea for mercy. She is merely a woman who seeks to be in control of her own life, one who believes that things like privacy and self-determination apply to her, too. \u201cI have decided that ending my pregnancy is the best decision for me and my family,\u201d Poe writes in her public statement. \u201cThis is a personal decision, a decision I believe should be mine alone, not made by anyone else.\u201d This was not always a radical proposition. But in the post-Dobbs world, it has sadly become one. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

      "body": "<p>The stink of excrement was the first thing the residents of Sitilpech noticed when the farm opened in 2017. It hung over the colourful one-storey homes and kitchen gardens in the Maya town in Yucat\u00e1n, and has never left. Next, the trees stopped bearing fruit, their leaves instead covered with black spots. Then, the water from the vast, porous aquifer emerged from the well with a horrible, overwhelming stench.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, we used that water for everything: for cooking, for drinking, for bathing. Now we can\u2019t even give it to animals. Today, we have to give the chickens purified water because otherwise they get diarrhoea,\u201d says one resident. \u201cThe radishes grow thin and the coriander often turns yellow. This has always been a quiet town, where life was very good until that farm started,\u201d they say.</p> <p>Sitilpech lies on the edge of the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5784/\">Ring of Cenotes</a>, a vast network of sinkhole lakes and underground rivers formed by a meteorite impact 66m years ago. The pig <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/18/rise-of-mega-farms-how-the-us-model-of-intensive-farming-is-invading-the-world\">mega-farm</a> is just under a kilometre from the first home in the town. It is part of a network of between <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/semarnat/documentos/dictamen-diagnostico-ambiental-de-la-actividad-porcicola-de-yucatan\">500</a> and <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.lat/blog/el-alarmante-impacto-de-la-industria-porcicola-en-yucatan/\">800</a> facilities that have appeared across the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in the past 20 years, often nestled in the middle of the internationally important <a href=\"https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/yucatan-moist-forests/\">Yucat\u00e1n moist forest</a>. A mega-farm can hold up to 50,000 pigs, packed tightly together in small pens. The urine and excrement, antibiotics and hormone treatments seep out beneath their corrals, and are then dried in open-air waste lakes in the tropical heat.</p>    <p>For those that live around them, the spread of the pig mega-farms is a human and ecological disaster. Some Maya villages in Yucat\u00e1n are outnumbered by pigs 100 to one. In the rainy season, the farms pump out the pig waste through sprinkler systems; it oozes into the porous limestone watershed which connects the Ring of Cenotes. Local people say that those who drink the tap water fall sick, and there are severe consequences for the area\u2019s biodiversity.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 90% of the 800 pig factories estimated to exist in Yucat\u00e1n operate without any type of environmental permit,\u201d claims Lourdes Medina Carrillo, an environmental lawyer. \u201cThese are projects without a record of prior Indigenous consultation, arising from the destruction of forests considered the second most important on the continent, without permits for changes in land use, and with impacts such as water contamination,\u201d she claims.</p>    <p>For many residents, the anger is directed at the Mexican pork brand Kek\u00e9n, the country\u2019s largest pork exporter. Animals supplied to the brand are sold all over the world, feeding markets in South Korea, Japan and the US. Kek\u00e9n is part of the Kuo Group conglomerate, which includes companies in the automotive and chemical industry. It generated <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/profile?s=KUOB:MEX\">revenue of more</a> than $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) last year, with <a href=\"https://kuo.com.mx/site/uploads/en/documents/quarterly_reports/KUO_4Q23.pdf\">half</a> coming from the pork division.</p> <p>The push into this region of Mexico started with the Nafta free trade agreement but accelerated in the early 2000s after the US health authorities declared Yucat\u00e1n a zone free of <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/09/30/02-24753/classical-swine-fever-status-of-mexican-states-of-campeche-quintana-roo-sonora-and-yucatan\">classical swine fever</a>. Export restrictions on pork were removed, and companies quickly moved to take advantage.</p> <p>As the impact of the mega-farms has grown, residents in Sitilpech have resisted them, forming protests in 2023 against the facilities. But in February 2023, they say they were violently repressed by police who <a href=\"https://genv.org/sitilpech-an-indigenous-mayan-village-confronts-the-ecocide/\">stormed a protest camp</a>, beating those present. Other Maya communities have launched legal disputes against Kek\u00e9n. At least one of those was <a href=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/supreme-court-confirms-suspension-of-yucatan-pig-farm/\">upheld by the supreme court</a>, after residents of Hom\u00fan brought a case detailing \u201cgrave and irreversible harm to human health and the environment\u201d caused by a 48,000-pig farm, including \u201ccontamination of water \u2026 emission of noxious air pollution; the spread of dangerous pathogens\u201d.</p>    <p>\u201cWhen the company came to settle, we saw how it sadly began to cut down the trees that we take care of so much for beekeeping. They left large areas of devastated land,\u201d allege members of a family from Kinchil, an hour from Yucat\u00e1n\u2019s capital M\u00e9rida. \u201cIt was very sad. They cut down trees that were more than 100 years old, which are the ones that benefit us the most when there is drought,\u201d they claim. </p> <p>At the beginning of last year, the federal Mexican environment ministry <a href=\"https://indignacion.org.mx/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Informe-Contaminaci%C3%B3n-Acu%C3%ADfero-Maya.pdf\">found that</a> the watershed around farms in Yucat\u00e1n was saturated with concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus from the pigs\u2019 excrement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/16/farmers-are-digging-their-own-graves-true-cost-of-growing-food-in-spains-arid-south\">\u2018Farmers are digging their own graves\u2019: true cost of growing food in Spain\u2019s arid south</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysis of water sample from cenotes, springs and wells in Yucat\u00e1n <a href=\"https://biorisk.pensoft.net/article/58455/#:~:text=A%20study%20determined%20faecal%20contamination,(%20Hoogesteijn%2DReul%20et%20al.\">by scientists</a>, the communities themselves and the <a href=\"https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2022/08/50-wells-and-cenotes-in-yucatan-at-a-yellow-traffic-light-with-poor-quality-water-conagua/#google_vignette\">Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris)</a> has found contamination by E coli and other bacteria.

The company says it uses biodigesters to ensure the most efficient water uses, adding that 90% of its facilities are in protected areas for the conservation of biodiversity. They said they provided a range of benefits for local people, including supporting farming in nearby Maya communities.</p>    <p>\u201cThe medications, the hormones they give to the pigs, in addition to their excrement, end up in the water. And that water that the industry uses then travels inside the caves, the caverns, the wells through the Ring of Cenotes. This is the common water that nature and communities use for their supply. This pollution breaks all ecological balances, impacts native fauna and flora, causes loss of biodiversity and even an excess of organic matter,\u201d says Medina Carrillo.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an extremely serious problem because the aquifer of the peninsula, the wells and cenotes, are interconnected,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Mexico\u2019s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, said during her campaign that she would not promote the closure of mega-farms in Yucat\u00e1n. \u201cI understand that there are regulations for pig farms, there is technology to avoid contamination \u2026 the issue is that the regulations are complied with,\u201d she declared in a press conference in March. \u201cThis idea that mega-farms must be closed because they pollute, no.

It is part of a network of between 500 and 800 facilities that have appeared across the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in the past 20 years, often nestled in the middle of the internationally important Yucat\u00e1n moist forest. A mega-farm can hold up to 50,000 pigs, packed tightly together in small pens. The urine and excrement, antibiotics and hormone treatments seep out beneath their corrals, and are then dried in open-air waste lakes in the tropical heat. For those that live around them, the spread of the pig mega-farms is a human and ecological disaster. Some Maya villages in Yucat\u00e1n are outnumbered by pigs 100 to one. In the rainy season, the farms pump out the pig waste through sprinkler systems; it oozes into the porous limestone watershed which connects the Ring of Cenotes. Local people say that those who drink the tap water fall sick, and there are severe consequences for the area\u2019s biodiversity. \u201cMore than 90% of the 800 pig factories estimated to exist in Yucat\u00e1n operate without any type of environmental permit,\u201d claims Lourdes Medina Carrillo, an environmental lawyer. \u201cThese are projects without a record of prior Indigenous consultation, arising from the destruction of forests considered the second most important on the continent, without permits for changes in land use, and with impacts such as water contamination,\u201d she claims. For many residents, the anger is directed at the Mexican pork brand Kek\u00e9n, the country\u2019s largest pork exporter. Animals supplied to the brand are sold all over the world, feeding markets in South Korea, Japan and the US. Kek\u00e9n is part of the Kuo Group conglomerate, which includes companies in the automotive and chemical industry. It generated revenue of more than $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) last year, with half coming from the pork division. The push into this region of Mexico started with the Nafta free trade agreement but accelerated in the early 2000s after the US health authorities declared Yucat\u00e1n a zone free of classical swine fever. Export restrictions on pork were removed, and companies quickly moved to take advantage. As the impact of the mega-farms has grown, residents in Sitilpech have resisted them, forming protests in 2023 against the facilities. But in February 2023, they say they were violently repressed by police who stormed a protest camp, beating those present. Other Maya communities have launched legal disputes against Kek\u00e9n. At least one of those was upheld by the supreme court, after residents of Hom\u00fan brought a case detailing \u201cgrave and irreversible harm to human health and the environment\u201d caused by a 48,000-pig farm, including \u201ccontamination of water \u2026 emission of noxious air pollution; the spread of dangerous pathogens\u201d. \u201cWhen the company came to settle, we saw how it sadly began to cut down the trees that we take care of so much for beekeeping. They left large areas of devastated land,\u201d allege members of a family from Kinchil, an hour from Yucat\u00e1n\u2019s capital M\u00e9rida. \u201cIt was very sad. They cut down trees that were more than 100 years old, which are the ones that benefit us the most when there is drought,\u201d they claim. At the beginning of last year, the federal Mexican environment ministry found that the watershed around farms in Yucat\u00e1n was saturated with concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus from the pigs\u2019 excrement. Analysis of water sample from cenotes, springs and wells in Yucat\u00e1n by scientists, the communities themselves and the Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris) has found contamination by E coli and other bacteria. Communities reported an increase in cases of intestinal infections in Yucat\u00e1n between 2012 and 2019, a period of pig farm expansion. In response, a spokesperson for Kek\u00e9n says it specialises in pork production of the highest quality and is one of the biggest employers in the Yucat\u00e1n region. The company says it uses biodigesters to ensure the most efficient water uses, adding that 90% of its facilities are in protected areas for the conservation of biodiversity. They said they provided a range of benefits for local people, including supporting farming in nearby Maya communities. \u201cThe medications, the hormones they give to the pigs, in addition to their excrement, end up in the water. And that water that the industry uses then travels inside the caves, the caverns, the wells through the Ring of Cenotes. This is the common water that nature and communities use for their supply. This pollution breaks all ecological balances, impacts native fauna and flora, causes loss of biodiversity and even an excess of organic matter,\u201d says Medina Carrillo. \u201cThis is an extremely serious problem because the aquifer of the peninsula, the wells and cenotes, are interconnected,\u201d she says. Mexico\u2019s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, said during her campaign that she would not promote the closure of mega-farms in Yucat\u00e1n. \u201cI understand that there are regulations for pig farms, there is technology to avoid contamination \u2026 the issue is that the regulations are complied with,\u201d she declared in a press conference in March. \u201cThis idea that mega-farms must be closed because they pollute, no. There is technology.\u201d The reporting for this story was supported by Brighter Green\u2019s Animals and Biodiversity Reporting Fund",

      "body": "<p>Polenta is occasionally known as <em>pulenda</em>. It\u2019s a reminder that both the name and the cooking method has its roots in antiquity and in the Latin word <em>puls, </em>a blanket term for a universal method: long-cooked, semi-liquid dishes, or \u201cmushes\u201d, based on cereals or legumes. Which leads us to another nice word-link: puls is also the root of the word pulses.

      "bodyText": "Polenta is occasionally known as pulenda. It\u2019s a reminder that both the name and the cooking method has its roots in antiquity and in the Latin word puls, a blanket term for a universal method: long-cooked, semi-liquid dishes, or \u201cmushes\u201d, based on cereals or legumes. Which leads us to another nice word-link: puls is also the root of the word pulses. But back to antiquity, where the nature of the mushes depended on where in the world they were made, and what was available. In Italy, that was farro, spelt, barley, broad beans, millet, chestnuts; puls or polenta were made from them all. Then, in the middle of the 16th century, mais (maize) arrived in the north of Italy from Mesoamerica (the earliest examples of the genius of Mesoamerican agriculture were found in Oaxaca, and tiny cobs of domesticated maize dated from about 4,300BC). By the 18th century, maize was acclimatised and established in many areas of Italy, as was a polenta made with its deep gold flour, which went on to become a vital staple food. It was also a problematic food until Italians learned what the Maya and Aztecs had discovered centuries earlier: that to be fully nutritious, as well as delicious, maize needs to be cleverly transformed, either by nixtamalization \u2013 that is, being ground to a finer flour and slow cooked \u2013 or balanced with other foods (beans especially). And polenta is delicious, particularly when it is cooked slowly; the grains of maize flour swell into a soft mush with a texture somewhere between porridge and very smooth mashed potato. Another useful thing about the word puls is its proximity to the word \u201cpull\u201d, which is what polenta does: it pulls away from the sides of the pan after about 40 minutes of stirring (although some stir it for much, much longer).

      "bodyText": "The crisis in special needs education has left children vulnerable to criminal and sexual exploitation, experts have warned, as parents of victims described years of failed attempts to get support. Last year, 7,432 children were referred to the national referral mechanism \u2013 the framework for identifying potential victims of trafficking and modern slavery in England and Wales. A \u201chigh proportion\u201d of such cases involve children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send), according to research funded by the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre (Modern Slavery PEC). Researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), working with the University of Portsmouth, said that with waits of up to four years for assessments and 75% of the 1.6 million children with Send without an education and health care plan, children with Send face higher rates of school exclusion, leaving them isolated and vulnerable to sexual predators and county lines gangs. One mother said her son, who had undiagnosed ADHD, tried to take his own life after being criminally exploited while out of mainstream school. Another described how her requests for Send help went unheard until after her daughter, who has autism, was sexually abused. \u201cIf she\u2019d [had] diagnoses, it might not have happened,\u201d she said. Speaking at the launch of the Institute for Children\u2019s Futures, an MMU-based policy unit, researcher Sarah Goff described a \u201cpipeline from school exclusion to criminal exploiters\u201d. \u201cParents were very clear that being out of school was the major problem. For many of them, they had not been heard when they had been noticing that their child growing up had special needs. \u201cLack of support staff for teachers \u2026 the lack of youth services, these omissions that have been created by an agenda of cuts have left huge holes \u2013 and perpetrators are very good at sniffing out kids who are lacking anchors.\u201d A mother whose son was made to sell drugs at a \u201ctrap house\u201d while out of mainstream school for two years was among those interviewed for the research. \u201cWe kept saying get him tested please\u201d, she said, but it wasn\u2019t until after he had made an attempt on his life, having been \u201cbadly abused\u201d by dealers, that he was diagnosed with ADHD. While statistics on child exploitation and Send are not routinely collected, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse has recognised that children with additional needs are at \u201csignificantly greater risk of sexual abuse\u201d. Practitioners interviewed for MMU\u2019s research reported up to 80% of their caseloads involved children and young people with diagnosed Send, reporting concerns that \u201chigh numbers\u201d of children subjected to modern slavery were awaiting diagnosis. The team, led by MMU\u2019s Prof Anita Franklin, calls in a study out this month, Opening Conversations, for \u201csupportive spaces\u201d where children can open up to \u201ctrusted adults\u201d. They also recommend government guidance on safeguarding disabled children is updated and call for national training to prevent their exploitation. Liz Williams, head of policy impact at Modern Slavery PEC said \u201curgent action was needed from schools to address children\u2019s needs to prevent their exclusion, and from the government to make sure schools have the resources.\u201d The Department for Education has said urgent work is under way to improve outcomes for Send children, and the education secretary Bridget Phillipson has said a focus on wellbeing in schools is key.",

No other asset class, be it property, gold or cash, will get you there. Only stocks and shares will.\u201d</p> <p>There is an old saying in financial circles that women save and men invest, and this continues to ring true.</p> <p>Of the women actively managing their money, the largest proportion used a regular savings account (61%) and one in three (35%) invested in cash Isas, according to <a href=\"https://www.aviva.com/newsroom/news-releases/2024/03/breaking-down-barriers-to-the-gender-investment-gap/\">research earlier this year by Aviva</a>.</p> <p>It also found that just over one in six (17%) women held a stocks and shares Isa, compared with 30% of men. There was the same imbalance when it came to a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), with men at 19% and women 8%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women are saving more: the problem is they are saving in cash</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The same research found 37% of women did not invest, versus 24% of men. Almost one in five women (18%) thought the risk was too high, while 10% said it was too complicated, with 6% saying they \u201cdon\u2019t know where to start\u201d. Given the potential that investments have to grow over the long term, women risk \u201cmissing out\u201d, says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. </p> <p>HMRC statistics show the higher your income, the more likely you are to have a stocks and shares Isa. </p> <p>Women favour cash for several reasons. \u201cThose on lower incomes tend to be busy building an emergency fund instead, so the gender pay gap plays a part here,\u201d says Coles. And Miller says her research, and anecdotes from clients, indicates women believe investing is a man\u2019s world \u2013 a view underlined by the fact that the wealth management industry itself is still male dominated.</p> <p>As a mother of two daughters, Miller is also worried that young women are bombarded on social media with retrograde ideas about what it is to be a \u201creal\u201d woman, as well as facing rising levels of misogyny.</p> <p>\u201cTeenage girls are targeted by this idea that they mustn\u2019t be independent,\u201d she says. \u201cMy experience of financial domestic abuse was 18 years ago, but it\u2019s terrifying to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d Even if you are in a successful partnership, financial independence is not just for the \u201cbad days\u201d, she says: \u201cThink of it as your freedom fund.\u201d</p> <p>If you want to know where to start, Coles suggests regular payments into a stocks and shares Isa, perhaps opting for a broad multi-asset fund or global tracker. \u201cIf you start with relatively low stakes, it can feel easier to tackle,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Investing doesn\u2019t have to become your hobby, Coles says: \u201cJust make sure you check in once a month, read one article about investing, watch one video, or put a podcast on in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Coles describes herself as a \u201csurvivor of economic abuse\u201d, which cemented her belief in having \u201cagency\u201d when it comes to money. \u201cThat means having savings, investments and pensions in your own name, and feeling a connection and engagement with it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense for couples to plan their finances together, but it\u2019s vital not to fall into the habit of one of you looking after a single area of your finances. All relationships will eventually end \u2013 either in a split, or in death \u2013 and both are terrible times to have to get to grips with your finances from scratch.\u201d </p>",

Given the potential that investments have to grow over the long term, women risk \u201cmissing out\u201d, says Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. HMRC statistics show the higher your income, the more likely you are to have a stocks and shares Isa. Women favour cash for several reasons. \u201cThose on lower incomes tend to be busy building an emergency fund instead, so the gender pay gap plays a part here,\u201d says Coles. And Miller says her research, and anecdotes from clients, indicates women believe investing is a man\u2019s world \u2013 a view underlined by the fact that the wealth management industry itself is still male dominated. As a mother of two daughters, Miller is also worried that young women are bombarded on social media with retrograde ideas about what it is to be a \u201creal\u201d woman, as well as facing rising levels of misogyny. \u201cTeenage girls are targeted by this idea that they mustn\u2019t be independent,\u201d she says. \u201cMy experience of financial domestic abuse was 18 years ago, but it\u2019s terrifying to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d Even if you are in a successful partnership, financial independence is not just for the \u201cbad days\u201d, she says: \u201cThink of it as your freedom fund.\u201d If you want to know where to start, Coles suggests regular payments into a stocks and shares Isa, perhaps opting for a broad multi-asset fund or global tracker. \u201cIf you start with relatively low stakes, it can feel easier to tackle,\u201d she says. Investing doesn\u2019t have to become your hobby, Coles says: \u201cJust make sure you check in once a month, read one article about investing, watch one video, or put a podcast on in the background.\u201d Coles describes herself as a \u201csurvivor of economic abuse\u201d, which cemented her belief in having \u201cagency\u201d when it comes to money. \u201cThat means having savings, investments and pensions in your own name, and feeling a connection and engagement with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense for couples to plan their finances together, but it\u2019s vital not to fall into the habit of one of you looking after a single area of your finances. All relationships will eventually end \u2013 either in a split, or in death \u2013 and both are terrible times to have to get to grips with your finances from scratch.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When I\u2019m in a truly bad mood, about the state of the world or just the state of myself, traditionally uplifting movies (or music, or TV) don\u2019t cut it for me. It\u2019s not the movies\u2019 fault, necessarily; it\u2019s the act of pressing play on even a feel-great movie like His Girl Friday or Toy Story 2 that nags at me as overly self-conscious. It\u2019s hard for the movie to have its desired effect when I\u2019m giving it such a personal, specific mandate to make me feel better \u2013 a truly impossible form of video on demand. Instead, I need something that activates my lizard brain, something that goes straight to the pleasure center of my imagination, rather than engaging directly with my emotions. In recent years, that movie is Alita: Battle Angel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/18/my-feelgood-movie-i-know-where-im-going\">\u2018Makes my heart beat faster\u2019: why I Know Where I\u2019m Going! is my feelgood movie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Part of it is probably a form of penance for slightly underrating Alita when it came out. I gave this Robert Rodriguez-directed, James Cameron-produced (and co-written!) manga adaptation a measuredly positive <a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/robert-rodriguez-teams-up-with-james-cameron-to-make-hi-1832245035\">review</a> back in early 2019, clearly still processing my surprise, even confusion, that it was so much better than most were expecting. Another half-dozen viewings later, many on sick days, have worn away my initial resistance to the movie\u2019s slightly distended shape, corny dialogue and jostled-together plot. The movie follows the reawakening of Alita (a digitally augmented Rosa Salazar), a cyborg whose body has been trashed and whose memory has been erased. Partially repaired by the kindly but overprotective Dr Ido (Christoph Waltz), Alita eventually explores the dystopian Iron City, takes up a violent cyborg sport called Motorball, becomes a well-paid bounty hunter, falls in love with a human who yearns to escape for a better life, and rediscovers her past as a powerful warrior.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lot, and also, in its way, just the right amount. At a time when sci-fi and fantasy films often feel stingy, holding back key characters or set pieces for sequels or budget restrictions, Alita boasts Cameron\u2019s characteristic generosity \u2013 like his better-loved Avatar movies, the frame is often filled with inventive digital characters and sets \u2013 and Rodriguez\u2019s boundless energy. Salazar\u2019s Alita is a plucky badass whose earnestness in both love and war makes her a lovable resident of the uncanny valley, anchoring the overstuffed action. She\u2019s also, <a href=\"https://estheronfilm.wordpress.com/2019/02/14/performance-and-selfhood-in-alita-battle-angel/\">as others have explored</a> with greater expertise than mine, readable as a trans hero \u2013 a woman who finds her agency by eventually switching to a different, better-fitting body.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7pYhpJaJW8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w7pYhpJaJW8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Maybe that\u2019s what makes this particular entry in the digital-cinema canon of gonzo sci-fi (fellow inductees: your Avatars, your Jupiter Ascendings, your Star Wars prequels) seem especially contemporary and vibrant, in addition to the excitement of its colors, designs and rapid pace. Released halfway through the first Trump term and rewatched heavily during a global pandemic, Alita has been accidentally battle-tested by real-world horrors. Like so much big-budget sci-fi, it predicts a bleak future while also making that future look, well, if not exactly fun, certainly a place where the pure-of-heart can still survive and find themselves, possibly through murderously extreme sports. Though some of the film\u2019s side characters will be brutally dispatched, there\u2019s something touching about how ridiculously extra they all are \u2013 and there\u2019s catharsis in seeing sweet-natured, curious, open-hearted Alita go absolutely nuts beating them down in a barfight (a Rodriguez specialty that gets a great sci-fi makeover here, complete with literal junkyard dogs). It\u2019s not as bloody or unsparing as an ultraviolent thriller, nor as gentle as a children\u2019s fantasy. It\u2019s something the inner child, outer adult and forever dork can all agree on \u2013 perfect for representing a character who occupies a liminal space between childlike wonder and embattled badass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/alita-battle-angel-review-robert-rodriguez\">Alita: Battle Angel review \u2013 lovestruck tweenies do battle in robot dystopia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So yes, my feelgood movie for when humanity lets me down is Alita: Battle Angel, a movie where much of humanity hangs out in a city-sized junkpile. And though I don\u2019t press play with this aspect particularly in mind, it\u2019s nice to imagine a future where things have gone terribly wrong (that just seems realistic at this point) yet unforeseen triumphs still emerge from the tech-nightmare garbage heap. There are plenty of more time-honored films that take a more direct path to temporary bliss, including sci-fi movies better-equipped to restore faith in humanity. (I know many people were appropriately moved by Arrival, opening days after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory; I love that one, to.) But for me, it\u2019s hard to beat the comfort of a weird, fantastical world populated by sci-fi creations that hustle and bustle with such clamor that they threaten to spill out of the widescreen frame. Alita may be cobbled together from the parts of other movies as well as its famous source material, but it\u2019s a beautiful salvage job. That\u2019s been a huge part of my life with movies: turning trash into treasured memories.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alita: Battle Angel is available to watch on Hulu in the US and on Netflix and Disney+ in the UK</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "When I\u2019m in a truly bad mood, about the state of the world or just the state of myself, traditionally uplifting movies (or music, or TV) don\u2019t cut it for me. It\u2019s not the movies\u2019 fault, necessarily; it\u2019s the act of pressing play on even a feel-great movie like His Girl Friday or Toy Story 2 that nags at me as overly self-conscious. It\u2019s hard for the movie to have its desired effect when I\u2019m giving it such a personal, specific mandate to make me feel better \u2013 a truly impossible form of video on demand. Instead, I need something that activates my lizard brain, something that goes straight to the pleasure center of my imagination, rather than engaging directly with my emotions. In recent years, that movie is Alita: Battle Angel. Part of it is probably a form of penance for slightly underrating Alita when it came out. I gave this Robert Rodriguez-directed, James Cameron-produced (and co-written!) manga adaptation a measuredly positive review back in early 2019, clearly still processing my surprise, even confusion, that it was so much better than most were expecting. Another half-dozen viewings later, many on sick days, have worn away my initial resistance to the movie\u2019s slightly distended shape, corny dialogue and jostled-together plot. The movie follows the reawakening of Alita (a digitally augmented Rosa Salazar), a cyborg whose body has been trashed and whose memory has been erased. Partially repaired by the kindly but overprotective Dr Ido (Christoph Waltz), Alita eventually explores the dystopian Iron City, takes up a violent cyborg sport called Motorball, becomes a well-paid bounty hunter, falls in love with a human who yearns to escape for a better life, and rediscovers her past as a powerful warrior. It\u2019s a lot, and also, in its way, just the right amount. At a time when sci-fi and fantasy films often feel stingy, holding back key characters or set pieces for sequels or budget restrictions, Alita boasts Cameron\u2019s characteristic generosity \u2013 like his better-loved Avatar movies, the frame is often filled with inventive digital characters and sets \u2013 and Rodriguez\u2019s boundless energy. Salazar\u2019s Alita is a plucky badass whose earnestness in both love and war makes her a lovable resident of the uncanny valley, anchoring the overstuffed action. She\u2019s also, as others have explored with greater expertise than mine, readable as a trans hero \u2013 a woman who finds her agency by eventually switching to a different, better-fitting body. Maybe that\u2019s what makes this particular entry in the digital-cinema canon of gonzo sci-fi (fellow inductees: your Avatars, your Jupiter Ascendings, your Star Wars prequels) seem especially contemporary and vibrant, in addition to the excitement of its colors, designs and rapid pace. Released halfway through the first Trump term and rewatched heavily during a global pandemic, Alita has been accidentally battle-tested by real-world horrors. Like so much big-budget sci-fi, it predicts a bleak future while also making that future look, well, if not exactly fun, certainly a place where the pure-of-heart can still survive and find themselves, possibly through murderously extreme sports. Though some of the film\u2019s side characters will be brutally dispatched, there\u2019s something touching about how ridiculously extra they all are \u2013 and there\u2019s catharsis in seeing sweet-natured, curious, open-hearted Alita go absolutely nuts beating them down in a barfight (a Rodriguez specialty that gets a great sci-fi makeover here, complete with literal junkyard dogs). It\u2019s not as bloody or unsparing as an ultraviolent thriller, nor as gentle as a children\u2019s fantasy. It\u2019s something the inner child, outer adult and forever dork can all agree on \u2013 perfect for representing a character who occupies a liminal space between childlike wonder and embattled badass. So yes, my feelgood movie for when humanity lets me down is Alita: Battle Angel, a movie where much of humanity hangs out in a city-sized junkpile. And though I don\u2019t press play with this aspect particularly in mind, it\u2019s nice to imagine a future where things have gone terribly wrong (that just seems realistic at this point) yet unforeseen triumphs still emerge from the tech-nightmare garbage heap. There are plenty of more time-honored films that take a more direct path to temporary bliss, including sci-fi movies better-equipped to restore faith in humanity. (I know many people were appropriately moved by Arrival, opening days after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory; I love that one, to.) But for me, it\u2019s hard to beat the comfort of a weird, fantastical world populated by sci-fi creations that hustle and bustle with such clamor that they threaten to spill out of the widescreen frame. Alita may be cobbled together from the parts of other movies as well as its famous source material, but it\u2019s a beautiful salvage job. That\u2019s been a huge part of my life with movies: turning trash into treasured memories. Alita: Battle Angel is available to watch on Hulu in the US and on Netflix and Disney+ in the UK",

The capital resembled a fortress of shipping containers, and the red zone, which includes all parliamentary buildings, was completely sealed off by barricades.</p> <p>According to PTI, Khan\u2019s supporters have been targeted with teargas and baton charges by police as they moved towards Islamabad and upwards of 5,000 PTI protesters and leaders, mainly coming from Khan\u2019s stronghold region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have already been arrested en route. PTI supporters responded by throwing stones at police and setting alight their vehicles.</p> <p>Bishra Bibi, Khan\u2019s wife, who was recently released from prison, is among those taking part in the march. \u201cUntil Imran is with us, we will not end this march, I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me,\u201d said Bibi, as she addressed supporters on Monday.</p> <p>Shaikh Waqas Akram, the PTI information secretary, said more than 70,000 people were marching on the capital from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone and they intended to enclose Islamabad from three sides.</p> <p>\u201cThe police in Punjab and other places have fired rubber bullets, expired shells and stun grenades at us. They are trying to stop a peaceful protest for the release of Khan,\u201d Akram said.</p> <p>However, Akram said the PTI was \u201cfully prepared\u201d, and had brought trucks with large fans to disperse teargas and rubber bullets fired by police. The timing of when the marchers would reach Islamabad \u201cdepends on how fast we can overcome the hurdles in our way\u201d, he added, but said it could take another day at least.</p> <p>He claimed that the military had requested that members of the senior leadership meet with Khan in Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala jail in an effort to get the former prime minister to call off the march. \u201cAll our demands are important but the only demand the government and establishment can fulfil immediately is to release all political prisoners including Khan,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Supporters and leadership of PTI have faced a sustained crackdown by the government for over a year, since Khan was arrested last August. Khan had governed until 2022, when his government was toppled after he fell out with the country\u2019s powerful army chief.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/pakistan-military-has-no-intention-of-cutting-deal-with-jailed-former-prime-minister-imran-khan-sources\">speaking from prison, Khan</a> said he would be willing to negotiate again with the military, but senior army leaders said they had no interest in striking a deal with the former prime minister to ensure his release.</p> <p>Analysts said Khan\u2019s decision to call the march now was likely a final attempt to bring the military establishment to the negotiating table and try to ensure he would not face trial in a military, rather than civilian, court. </p> <p>The Sharif government described the PTI march as a \u201cwell-thought out conspiracy\u201d as it coincides with a state visit by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, and vowed to arrest every PTI protester who tried to get into Islamabad.</p> <p>Ahsan Iqbal, the federal minister for planning, accused Khan of trying to circumvent the justice system by using force to demand his release from jail. \u201cHis release hinges on clearance from the courts. He will have to clear himself from the cases registered against him. Without this, the government cannot release him,\u201d said Iqbal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pakistan\u2019s capital was put under lockdown as the government shut down the internet, blocked highways and brought in thousands of police and paramilitaries in an attempt to prevent supporters of the former prime minister Imran Khan protesting in Islamabad. Khan, who has been in jail for more than a year facing hundreds of charges, had issued a \u201cfinal call\u201d for his supporters to descend on Islamabad to demand his release and protest against recent changes to the judiciary and constitution. The former prime minister has alleged his imprisonment is part of a political agenda by the military and the ruling government to keep him out of power. They have alleged there was widespread rigging in February\u2019s election, where his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party says it won the popular vote, and are now demanding free and fair polls take place. The lockdown of the city began on Friday as a convoy of tens of thousands of supporters of the PTI heeded Khan\u2019s call from inside prison and began to march towards Islamabad from regions across the country. The coalition government, led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and his Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) party, has been accused of a draconian response to the PTI protest, which is due to reach the capital by late Monday or Tuesday. Roadblocks were put in place across the country to try to halt their progress while mobile internet and access to messaging services such as WhatsApp was blocked in areas of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and tens of thousands of troops and police officers were deployed to restrict movement. The capital resembled a fortress of shipping containers, and the red zone, which includes all parliamentary buildings, was completely sealed off by barricades. According to PTI, Khan\u2019s supporters have been targeted with teargas and baton charges by police as they moved towards Islamabad and upwards of 5,000 PTI protesters and leaders, mainly coming from Khan\u2019s stronghold region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have already been arrested en route. PTI supporters responded by throwing stones at police and setting alight their vehicles. Bishra Bibi, Khan\u2019s wife, who was recently released from prison, is among those taking part in the march. \u201cUntil Imran is with us, we will not end this march, I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me,\u201d said Bibi, as she addressed supporters on Monday. Shaikh Waqas Akram, the PTI information secretary, said more than 70,000 people were marching on the capital from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone and they intended to enclose Islamabad from three sides. \u201cThe police in Punjab and other places have fired rubber bullets, expired shells and stun grenades at us. They are trying to stop a peaceful protest for the release of Khan,\u201d Akram said. However, Akram said the PTI was \u201cfully prepared\u201d, and had brought trucks with large fans to disperse teargas and rubber bullets fired by police. The timing of when the marchers would reach Islamabad \u201cdepends on how fast we can overcome the hurdles in our way\u201d, he added, but said it could take another day at least. He claimed that the military had requested that members of the senior leadership meet with Khan in Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala jail in an effort to get the former prime minister to call off the march. \u201cAll our demands are important but the only demand the government and establishment can fulfil immediately is to release all political prisoners including Khan,\u201d he said. Supporters and leadership of PTI have faced a sustained crackdown by the government for over a year, since Khan was arrested last August. Khan had governed until 2022, when his government was toppled after he fell out with the country\u2019s powerful army chief. In an interview with the Guardian this month, speaking from prison, Khan said he would be willing to negotiate again with the military, but senior army leaders said they had no interest in striking a deal with the former prime minister to ensure his release. Analysts said Khan\u2019s decision to call the march now was likely a final attempt to bring the military establishment to the negotiating table and try to ensure he would not face trial in a military, rather than civilian, court. The Sharif government described the PTI march as a \u201cwell-thought out conspiracy\u201d as it coincides with a state visit by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, and vowed to arrest every PTI protester who tried to get into Islamabad. Ahsan Iqbal, the federal minister for planning, accused Khan of trying to circumvent the justice system by using force to demand his release from jail. \u201cHis release hinges on clearance from the courts. He will have to clear himself from the cases registered against him. Without this, the government cannot release him,\u201d said Iqbal.",

I thought she was injured, but the blood was actually coming from my eye. \u201cIt was a painful journey to return home to my family. My life has been flipped upside down; everything is now going to change.\u201d She said her dream of being a dentist had been ruined by her injuries. \u201cI just feel confused and lost. I never thought I would return like this.\u201d Abu Izneid said the damage done to her eyes was \u201cpermanent\u201d and that that there was \u201cno hope\u201d for her to regain her vision. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the eye specialists and they have concluded that there is no hope for me to regain my vision. \u201cSo now what they\u2019re working on is mostly cosmetics wise. They\u2019re just trying to make sure it looks as normal as possible. And I also got shrapnel lodged in my face and my \u2026 side of my chest and they\u2019re still working to remove those. \u201cBut they might not be able to remove all the shrapnel from my face because they fear too much meddling could exacerbate the damage,\u201d she said. Her mother, Rana Abu Izneid, said she could not understand why this had happened. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Gaza, she is just a student. Why did this happen? She is innocent and now her life is permanently changed because of this.\u201d An Israel Border Police spokesperson confirmed officers entered Abu Dis that same day to rescue a citizen who was allegedly under attack. \u201cRioters at the place threw rocks and marble slates on the forces from the roofs of homes and, in that way, endangered their lives,\u201d the spokesperson told the ABC. \u201cIn response, the forces responded with live fire in order to neutralise the danger.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email But the ABC reported the border police had not accepted responsibility for Abu Izneid\u2019s injuries. The Israel Defense Forces has been contacted for comment. Abu Izneid was evacuated to Jordan after receiving initial hospital treatment in Jerusalem, and arrived in Melbourne on Sunday for more comprehensive care. She is calling on the Australian government to support her recovery so she can regain her vision and continue her dentistry studies. \u201cI want to be me again \u2026 I want to be able to see again, I want to be able to achieve my dreams again,\u201d Abu Izneid said. \u201cI want a transparent, full investigation on this situation. \u201cI am grateful for the help that I got from the Australian embassies, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network described Israeli forces\u2019 actions as reckless and demanded unequivocal condemnation and immediate action from the Australian government. \u201cThis heinous attack exposes the grim reality of living under Israel\u2019s illegal occupation, where even the sanctity of a student\u2019s home offers no protection from state-sanctioned brutality,\u201d network president Nasser Mashni said. The foreign minister Penny Wong\u2019s office has been contacted for comment. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it provided consular assistance to Abu Izneid in the West Bank and rejected criticism of its handling of the case. \u201cThe Australian government is seeking further information about the circumstances of the incident,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cConsular staff cannot provide medical services or medications, pay for medical costs or query treatment regimens on behalf of Australians overseas.\u201d On Monday, the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said the state government had reached out through the local Palestinian community to provide support to Abu Izneid and her family. The Australian government\u2019s official travel advice, last updated on 15 November, warns residents not to travel to the West Bank, except for East Jerusalem, describing the security situation as unpredictable. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the West Bank during military action or civil unrest, stay in a safe place indoors and away from windows,\u201d it reads.",

India in Perth on Monday had up their sleeve 522 runs and two bowling days to take seven wickets on a pitch already showing erratic bounce. The wickets would fall and the match would end, whatever the configuration. Travis Head slapping 89 runs and Mitchell Marsh launching some sixes on his way to 47 was great fun, but didn\u2019t change the calculus in the slightest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/nov/25/australia-vs-india-cricket-first-test-match-live-blog-updates-day-four-scores-results-start-time-optus-stadium-perth\">India beat Australia by 295 runs: first men\u2019s Test, day four \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Usman Khawaja was the only player with the pedigree to bat a day and a half late in a game, but he fell immediately to a pull without gauging the bounce. Steve Smith is thought of in the same category but has always had a mediocre record batting last, even during his deity years \u2013 70% of his career runs have come in the team\u2019s first innings. This time, he was out for 17. The lower order couldn\u2019t muster much, and as in the first innings, keeper Alex Carey looked the most controlled and confident ahead of his specialist batting colleagues. He was last out for 36 and his team went down by 295 runs.</p> <p>Australia have had some savage beatings in the past decade and change. They come easily to mind, needing nothing more than the name of the ground to retrieve the memories. Generally, though, they were games when the other team was always on top. Trent Bridge 2015 or Hobart 2016 saw Australia\u2019s batting knocked over right away, doomed thenceforth to trail in the game. Johannesburg in 2018 had South Africa go huge in their first innings. A queue of beatings in India had Australia make about 200 and India make 500 in reply. Cape Town in 2011 did have Australia collapse from a winning position, but at least that game wasn\u2019t too far from its end.</p> <p>This beating feels different, because after bowling first Australia were totally on top. South Africa at the Waca in 2016 is the closest equivalent, but even then the visitors made a halfway decent 242. This summer\u2019s visitors were all out for 150 within two sessions on day one. The postmortems that write off this Australian team as destined for the scrapheap will brush over the quality of that performance. It was as good as fast bowling in tandem gets, backed up by brilliant fielding. The batting to follow ruined the effect, but shouldn\u2019t diminish the effort.</p>    <p>In the end, though, it was a bizarre surrender from a position of such advantage. An overseas team in their first match of a series is not supposed to come back from 150 all out, let alone to an extent where they take a first-innings lead. Then to an extent where they bat almost three sessions without losing a wicket. Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul became the sixth opening pair to ever make a double century stand touring Australia. </p> <p>The grinding into the dirt that followed, six wickets in the best part of two days, would have hurt all the more because the Australians were not just toiling, they were confused. Being behind from minute one \u2013 that\u2019s sport sometimes, you can roll with that. But in this variation, as session after session of Indian batting drifted by, the expressions on the faces seemed to keep saying, \u201cHow the hell did this happen?\u201d </p> <p>How to deal with that question is what comes next. The current Australian camp is all about trying to stay calm, not overreacting to bad results; they did that with some success after two heavy losses in India last year. The broader public will be much less sanguine, with plenty of agitating for changes for Adelaide in the manner that you expect after a humiliating defeat. How it happened will be the initial question that turns into the question of how to prevent it happening again. </p> <p>And while Australians worry or ponder or call up talkback lines to vent, for India this is an epochal Test match result in a country that until 2018 had never seen Indian series success, and since 2019 has seen nothing but. Their last two Test tours of Australia have produced heartstoppers in Adelaide and Brisbane, and two excellent professional wins in Melbourne. They haven\u2019t produced an absolute beating like this, the sort of win that can send an opposing camp into disarray. </p> <p>India have a young opener with apparently boundless ability, a veteran champion in the middle order, a wicketkeeper whose comeback to the game is a miracle beyond even some of the innings he plays, the best fast bowler in the world, and a supporting cast of high class in both departments. They didn\u2019t bother picking two of the greatest spinners in their history and were not made to suffer for that choice. They have other serious players to bring back for the second Test, including their regular captain. One performance offers no guarantee about the next, especially with 10 days in between, but in eyeing off a vanishingly rare three in a row touring Australia, this team has given itself the best possible start.</p>",

Being behind from minute one \u2013 that\u2019s sport sometimes, you can roll with that. But in this variation, as session after session of Indian batting drifted by, the expressions on the faces seemed to keep saying, \u201cHow the hell did this happen?\u201d How to deal with that question is what comes next. The current Australian camp is all about trying to stay calm, not overreacting to bad results; they did that with some success after two heavy losses in India last year. The broader public will be much less sanguine, with plenty of agitating for changes for Adelaide in the manner that you expect after a humiliating defeat. How it happened will be the initial question that turns into the question of how to prevent it happening again. And while Australians worry or ponder or call up talkback lines to vent, for India this is an epochal Test match result in a country that until 2018 had never seen Indian series success, and since 2019 has seen nothing but. Their last two Test tours of Australia have produced heartstoppers in Adelaide and Brisbane, and two excellent professional wins in Melbourne. They haven\u2019t produced an absolute beating like this, the sort of win that can send an opposing camp into disarray. India have a young opener with apparently boundless ability, a veteran champion in the middle order, a wicketkeeper whose comeback to the game is a miracle beyond even some of the innings he plays, the best fast bowler in the world, and a supporting cast of high class in both departments. They didn\u2019t bother picking two of the greatest spinners in their history and were not made to suffer for that choice. They have other serious players to bring back for the second Test, including their regular captain. One performance offers no guarantee about the next, especially with 10 days in between, but in eyeing off a vanishingly rare three in a row touring Australia, this team has given itself the best possible start.",

The DIY and building supplies retailer said it had seen \u201csolid underlying trading in August and September\u201d but that had changed to a \u201cweak market and consumer in the UK and France in October, impacted by uncertainty related to government budgets in both countries\u201d. The new Labour government raised taxes in order to pay for higher spending in the budget at the end of October. Reeves, the chancellor, raised employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular as the main \u00a325bn fundraising measure.

However, the budget sparked a chorus of disapproval from large sections of industry, who said the NICs increase would lead to higher prices and job cuts.

The bad news is it offered nothing beyond a flexible payment plan after hitting LM with 10 months of gas bills in one go; but ain\u2019t it beautiful to know that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to learning from this case and enhancing the reliability and responsiveness of our systems\u201d!

The emphatic nature of India\u2019s victory was summed up by the final wicket, a delicious slower ball from Harshit Rana that bowled Carey neck and crop.</p> <p>Geoff\u2019s report will be on the site later but that\u2019s all for our live coverage of a memorable first Test.

Khawaja more likely was, but he played a bad shot early.</p> <p>Head has been entertaining and made it look easy, as he does when he\u2019s on, and Marsh might yet do the same in the second session.

Bumrah bowling in the high 130s as far as kilometres go. If you want miles you can ask at a museum. </p> <p>Another noey from Bumrah, that\u2019s his fourth overstep.

There\u2019s that bounce problem that will only keep getting worse. The wickets are coming, surely. But the Aussies are scrapping through it, for now. Head got of strike first ball, nudging away. He\u2019s done that so easily compared to everyone else. Marsh though does get off the mark with a sliced drive behind point for three. </p> <p>Back to the bouncer field for Head. One slip now, Kohli standing at about one and a half. Deep backward, deep third, fine leg, short backward, deep square, halfway back at midwicket, mid on, mid off. But Siraj is outside leg stump, and Head can tickle that finer of the fine leg for four.

Starts with a couple of runs flicked through leg, then plays an audacious little late steer with a horizontal bat, just touching the ball towards deep third. They have two fielders back for that, one fine and one square, and he puts it between them for two more. Bumrah pushes back a fly slip, then changes his mind and brings Rahul back into the cordon. </p> <p>So, two slips, two variations on dee third, plus a fine leg and a deep square. Set up for the short ball, but Bumrah bowls full. Head can\u2019t beat midwicket. That fielder, with mid off and mid on, are the only ones set for the fuller ball. Lots of space through cover, and Head goes there but only for one. And abruptly it\u2019s different for Marsh facing, a horrible lifter that he fends into a gap on the leg side.

He thrashes Siraj square, everyone expects it to reach the rope, but the slow outfield here sees it pull up short. That gives the batters time to get back. Next ball, nearly gets him, around the wicket angling in, Head thrashes at it, big inside edge into his knee, almost back onto the stumps. Siraj is rolling around on the ground in frustration.</p> <p>Following that, he\u2019s so pumped up that he demands, insists on an lbw dismissal when he crashes into Head\u2019s pad next ball. The ball looks like it\u2019s heading past the leg stump. Siraj though is heading for the slip cordon. He just takes off in a celebrappeal, ignores the umpire entirely and is throwing high fives with his fielders.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Head is standing there looking bemused, as is the umpire. Not out. India have to review after that malarkey, and they think the ball has straightened, which it has but not enough.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Geoff\u2019s report from Perth: India were always going to win today, it was just a matter of how and when. Usman Khawaja went early to Mohammed Siraj to leave Australia in disarray at 17 for 4. Steve Smith scrapped for an hour and a half without hitting a boundary before Siraj had him caught behind just before lunch. Travis Head decided attack was the best form of defence, hitting a rousing 89 from 101 balls before falling to the inevitable Jasprit Bumrah. Mitch Marsh (47) and Alex Carey (37) also played nicely but it was an exercise in futilty. The emphatic nature of India\u2019s victory was summed up by the final wicket, a delicious slower ball from Harshit Rana that bowled Carey neck and crop. Geoff\u2019s report will be on the site later but that\u2019s all for our live coverage of a memorable first Test. See you in Adelaide. We were put under pressure in the first innings and I\u2019m really proud of the way the team responded. [On choosing to bat first] I played here in 2018 so I remember that the wicket here can be soft and then get quicker and quicker. This wicket was a little less spicy than the last one. We were really well prepared so I told everyone to have faith in their ability because we have the opportunity to do something special. We can\u2019t ask for anything else from Jaiswal. He\u2019d has a great start to his Test career and I think that was his best innings so far. He\u2019s an attacking batsman by nature but he left the ball really well and batted long. I didn\u2019t see Virat out of form at all. Sometimes you play on challenging wickets and it\u2019s difficult to tell whether a batsmen is in form or not, but he\u2019s looked really good in the nets. Hopefully he can go from strength to strength. Fairly disappointing. We thought our prep was really good. It\u2019s just one of these games where not much went right so there\u2019s a fair bit to look at nbefore next week. After a loss you always want get back on the horse but we\u2019ll have a couple of days\u2019 rest and then prepare for Adelaide. We didn\u2019t really give ourserlves a chance with a few different facets. If we\u2019d got through that period late on day one, maybe the game looks different on day two. Obviously a couple of big partnerships when were bowling. There are a few areas we\u2019ve got to clean up. There\u2019s a lot of experience [in the top six]. This summer there\u2019s a sample size of one \u2013 I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty of conversations between us and plenty of work in the nets. Travis Head and Virat Kohli embrace on the outfield. Kohli looks quite emotional, presumably while reflecting on his century yesterday. Marnus Labuschagne and Ravichandran Ashwin are also having a chat, likewise KL Rahul and Nathan Lyon. They play ferociously hard but get on well off the field. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to work out India,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cEased past Bangladesh, totally outdone by New Zealand and now this, a simply magnificent performance in Perth. They certainly have the quality; now it\u2019s time to find the consistency. Looking forward to the rest of an intriguing series.\u201d The next BCCI executive to request a raging turner for a home Test should be sacked on the spot. India are so much better when they play on good pitches. WICKET! Australia 238 all out (Carey b Rana 38) That\u2019s a beautiful way to finish the job. Rana hits Carey in the ribs with a bumper that doesn\u2019t get up, then bowls him with a gorgeous slower ball. It completes a stunning victory for India, who were written off by many before the game after their 3-0 defeat at home to New Zealand. They were without their captain, their No3, their wristspinner and their second best fast bowler. They chose to leave out two spinners with a combined total of 855 Test wickets and nearly 7000 Test runs. Their XI included four players with only four caps between them \u2013 and they thrashed Australia\u2019s best XI, give or take, on the bounciest pitch in the country. It\u2019s India\u2019s fifth Test win in Australia since 2018; before that they had managed only five in 70 years. They are making a mockery of one the toughest challenges in cricket, often with a below-strength team. The stars were the remarkable pair of Yashasvi Jaiswal (0 and 161) and Jasprit Bumrah (8 for 62 in the match). But all 11 players contributed with bat, ball or in the field. In the circumstances, it\u2019s a win for the ages. 58th over: Australia 236-9 (Carey 34, Hazlewood 4) 57th over: Australia 235-9 (Carey 33, Hazlewood 4) Carey nods respectfully after swaying away from a sharp bumper by Rana. That was beautifully played, actually, as it heading straight for his grille until he snapped his head back at the last second. Carey punches a single off the penultimate delivery in an attempt to keep the strike. Rana bowls a no-ball and then thumps Hazlewood on the back of the head with a bouncer. That sounded nasty but Hazlewood stayed on his feet and seems okay. There\u2019s a break in play while he is checked for concussion. 56th over: Australia 233-9 (Carey 32, Hazlewood 4) Josh Hazlewood, who doesn\u2019t deserve to suffer such a heavy defeat after a majestic bowling performance, drives his second ball jauntily for four. His third spits extravagantly to beat the edge, probably the most Washington has turned a delivery in this game. 55th over: Australia 229-9 (Carey 32, Hazlewood 0) Carey almost runs himself out trying to get back on strike. Personally I\u2019d say he\u2019s earned a bit of red ink, especially as he needs to get that average up to something more befitting his ability. It currently sits at 32.37. Carey is not out. Too high, next! India review for LBW against Carey! The bowler Rana likes it; it looks high to me. It was a cracking delivery though, which straightened sharply off the seam to beat Carey\u2019s defensive stroke. 54th over: Australia 227-9 (Carey 30, Hazlewood 0) Lyon propped forward defensively, playing for turn. There was none and the ball zipped on to hit the off stump. \u201cI always remember reading that an England touring team were asked to tick their Visa cards with the purpose of their visit whilst on a flight to Australia,\u201d says Tom Kidd. \u201cThey all ticked \u2018leisure\u2019, Geoffrey Boycott ticked \u2018business\u2019. Think it was a Michael Parkinson book on his favourite cricketers.\u201d Bowled \u2018im! Nathan Lyon goes second ball for nought, cleaned up by a ball that skids straight past his defensive stroke. India are nearly there. The players go off for tea after that wicket with a couple of balls left in Washington\u2019s over. India are two wickets away from a quite stunning victory. A brilliant catch from Dhruv Jurel at short leg! Starc turned the ball firmly into the leg side, where Jurel threw up his right hand to take a blinding reaction catch. India can do nothing wrong. \u201cArrived in Brisbane last night en route to Christchurch for the England game this week,\u201d writes ShowbizGuru. \u2018Purpose of visit?\u2019 asked the immigration chap. \u2018Transiting through for the cricket. In New Zealand. Sorry to mention cricket,\u2019 I replied. \u201cTo be fair he managed to laugh. \u2018On your way mate.\u2019.\u201d That reminds me of Alec Stewart when he was England captain in 1998-99. On his immigration card, under \u2018Purpose of Visit\u2019, he wrote: \u2018To win back the Ashes.\u2019 53rd over: Australia 224-7 (Carey 27, Starc 12) Harshit Rana replaces Siraj and is slammed through extra cover for three by Carey. It would have been four but for the painfully slow outfield. Rana looks really promising, an aggressive hustler who hits the pitch like he wants to hurt it, although apparently his pace has been down in this innings. \u201cLooks like he\u2019s feeling the pinch to me,\u201d says Mike Hussey on commentary. 52nd over: Australia 218-7 (Carey 24, Starc 9) Carey laps Washington for a couple. He looks completely at peace with his game right now. Every attacking stroke has been clean and decisive. Washington\u2019s ends over with an LBW appeal when the ball skids on to hit Carey\u2019s pad Missing leg. 51st over: Australia 216-7 (Carey 22, Starc 9) Batting looks relatively comfortably against the old ball, at least when Bumrah isn\u2019t bowling. There\u2019s some occasional uneven bounce but very little sideways movement, so Siraj tries a zippy bouncer that Pant helps over the bar for a bye. He did well to take the pace off it and save three runs. Carey ends the over with a classy cover drive for three more. Just over ten minutes until the tea break. 50th over: Australia 211-7 (Carey 19, Starc 9) Washington Sundar replaces Reddy, who bowled a threatening spell of 4-0-21-1. I thought this game might end quickly after the wicket of Marsh but Starc is playing with almost exaggerated care. He\u2019s faced 135 balls in this game, the second highest of his Test career behind that match in Mohali when he scored 99. \u201cI just love this Indian bowling line-up,\u201d writes Bill Hargreaves. \u201cSome healthy batsmen, too. Any predictions for what will happen next in the series?\u201d Given the number of surprise victories in the last two months \u2013 Bangladesh in Pakistan, New Zealand in India, Pakistan v England \u2013 I\u2019d like to proudly announce that I haven\u2019t a clue. 49th over: Australia 210-7 (Carey 19, Starc 8) The second Test in Adelaide begins a week Friday. Hard to see Australia making any changes to the XI, though they will be concerned about the form of Marnus Labuschagne in particular. The commentators are discussing whether he should go and play club cricket next weekend to enjoy a change of scene and hopefully score some runs. Carey clips Siraj through midwicket for two more. How does he average only 32 in Tests? To my admittedly inexpert eye, he looks a class act. 48th over: Australia 205-7 (Carey 16, Starc 6) Carey takes Australia past 200 with a beautifully placed pull stroke for four off Reddy. Despite this battering, Australia\u2019s middle order looks fairly healthy; the concern, individually and collectively, is the top four. \u201cI live in Malta and left last Wednesday to come to a \u2018celebration of life\u2019 party for the wife of a friend (Yvonne Buller if you could give dearest Yvonne a shout),\u201d writes Steve Ditchburn. \u201cNot exactly the best weekend to be in Torquay!! Left Malta it was 24 degrees, arrived in London Wednesday morning and it was 6 and then Thursday 4. Got a lift down to Torquay Friday and came back yesterday. Back to Malta today! Whoopee.\u201d On the plus side, you avoided the worst of Storm Bert. My feet are still wet from yesterday morning. 47th over: Australia 197-7 (Carey 9, Starc 5) Carey takes a tight single to mid-on off Siraj. He would been home but Rana\u2019s throw missed anyway. Later in the over he times a short-arm pull for four; he\u2019s one of the few Australian batters who looks in good nick. 46th over: Australia 189-7 (Carey 4, Starc 4) Starc fences at Reddy and is beaten. The speedgun says 127 kmh but he looks sharper than that. Reddy oversteps, his third no-ball in as many overs. That\u2019s about all he\u2019s done wrong in this spell. 45th over: Australia 183-7 (Carey 3, Starc 0) Siraj replaces Bumrah, who is saving his legs for the rest of the series. You\u2019d expect a quick kill from here. Starc, who batted very watchfully in the first innings, starts in a similar fahsion by leaving as many deliveries as possible from Siraj. 44th over: Australia 182-7 (Carey 2, Starc 0) Including this game five of Australia\u2019s last six home defeats have been against India. Replays confirm that Marsh was undone by some low bounce. Nitish Kumar Reddy gets his first Test wicket! Marsh, who played two or three false strokes in the previous over, drags an attempted cut back onto the stumps. I think it kept a bit low but Reddy deserves that wicket after starting his spell with ferocious purpose. Marsh goes for a hard-hitting 47. 43rd over: Australia 179-6 (Marsh 46, Carey 1) Marsh softens the hands to ensure a thick edge off Bumrah falls well short of gully. The ball bounces past the fielder and away for four, then he square drives the next delivery for three more. He loves batting in Perth and has scored just under 22 per cent of his Test runs at the Waca and the Optus Stadium. Time for drinks. 42nd over: Australia 172-6 (Marsh 39, Carey 1) Nitish Kumar Reddy replaces Washington Sundar. His first ball pops nastily from a length to beat Marsh\u2019s defensive push. It was only 125kph but it really spat off the pitch. The commentators are comparing Reddy\u2019s run-up and action to Dennis Lillee. \u201cGet the long hair, the yellow headband, shirt buttoned down, few words to the batsman\u2026\u201d says Ravi Shastri. His pace is nowhere near Lillee\u2019s but he\u2019s causing problems. Marsh gets a thick inside-edge, then Carey fences outside off and is beaten. That\u2019s an outstanding first over. 41st over: Australia 168-6 (Marsh 36, Carey 0) Bumrah has never taken a ten-for in Tests, which is hard to fathom. He\u2019s two away here, almost one when an inside-edge from Marsh misses the stumps. \u201cWhen I read \u2018Head down on one knee\u2026\u2019 (37th over) my thoughts went to Ann Boleyn with her head tucked underneath her arm,\u201d writes Tom Lewis. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d Well, the great West Indies side used to say \u2018cut off the head and the body will follow\u2019 when they targeted the opposition captain. And Pat Cummins hasn\u2019t had his finest game. 40th over: Australia 166-6 (Marsh 36, Carey 0) Head drags an inelegant but effective sweep round the corner for four. 39th over: Australia 161-6 (Marsh 31, Carey 0) Bumrah has 3 for 33 in the innings and 8 for 63 in the match. Never mind superlatives; we\u2019re running out of words full stop to describe his greatness. That was a brilliant, typical fearless innings from Head: 89 from 101 balls. India\u2019s captain turns to his go-to bowler: himself. And he strikes immediately to deny Travis Head a century! It was a fine delivery, just back of a length and straightening off the seam. Head launched into a back-foot drive but was fractionally late on the shot and snicked it through to Rishabh Pant. Bumrah clenches his fist and screams with delight in Head\u2019s general direction. It\u2019s old news, but it bears repeating: Jasprit Bumrah is a bona fide genius. 38th over: Australia 154-5 (Head 87, Marsh 31) Cheers Geoff, hello everyone. Time will tell whether this partnership means everything or nothing in the context of the series, but it never hurts to put credit in the bank \u2013 even when you\u2019re heading for a huge defeat. Head slashes Washington for two and then one to bring the partnership up to 75 from only 82 balls. Defiance comes in many forms. 37th over: Australia 151-5 (Head 84, Marsh 31) That is a rude cricket shot. Head down on one knee, proposing to wallop Harshit Rana through the covers. Angled bat, huge swing, leathered. He\u2019s so audacious, yet somehow makes it work. Goes again later in the over, off the back foot this time and slapped down the ground, hauled in to keep the scoring to three. So that\u2019s 383 to win, 16 runs for a Head century, and a bit more cheer for Australian supporters who would have started the day very glumly. I\u2019m off for today and for this Test, please be nice to Rob Smyth, and whatever happens here I\u2019ll see you in Adelaide. 36th over: Australia 141-5 (Head 76, Marsh 30) Sundar bowling away, three singles, they\u2019re very comfortable against him still. 35th over: Australia 139-5 (Head 74, Marsh 29) The partnership went to 56 in that last over, by the by. The runs keep coming, singles here and there, Head cutting two to deep point. The field is less extreme than it was for Head facing fast bowling before lunch. Slip, gully, deep third, deep backward, cover, mid off mid on, deep square, long leg. Rana bowls him a good short ball though, a perfume variety, Head swaying back. Later he dabs to deep third, the position where he was caught in both innings during the India Test here in 2018. 34th over: Australia 135-5 (Head 71, Marsh 28) The lead has come down quickly, but it\u2019s still\u2026 407. Just that. Marsh pushes a run square from the spinner, Head plays into the ground and past his stumps! Whoops. Into the ground, over the bails. Gets him a run, and gets Marsh the chance to lamp six over long off. Bosh. 399 to win. 31 runs in four overs since lunch. 33rd over: Australia 126-5 (Head 70, Marsh 20) Rana trying the short ball approach again, but Head pulls a single, then Marsh crashes a pull and is dropped! Similar to the last big shot, similar cannon sound off the bat, but doesn\u2019t get the elevation, and with hands above his hand, Padikkal at midwicket fingertips it up in the air and away towards long on for a couple. Marsh isn\u2019t concerned, seeing a fuller length very next ball and crashing it through cover for four! Then a dodgy single, and again Padikkal can\u2019t effect a dismissal, where a direct hit from midwicket would have got Marsh. Huge smile on Mitch\u2019s face at the end of the over 32nd over: Australia 118-5 (Head 69, Marsh 13) Mighty appeal from Washington Sundar, slanting a straight ball in at Head\u2019s pad, but maybe outside the line. No review in the end. The Australians settle into one-day rhythm, working four singles before Head slaps a fifth down the ground with power. 31st over: Australia 113-5 (Head 66, Marsh 11) Straight after lunch, and Head is straight back into it. A clip for two, a steer for one. Turns over the strike, and now Marsh is into it! Six! Harshit Rana drops short, Marsh drops the hammer. Into the stands, that wide stance he has where his weight doesn\u2019t even have to shift that far back to clear the very long square boundary. Second session, on we go. Not too bad a session for Australia, you\u2019d have to say, losing two wickets in the session. That\u2019s compared to their previous batting sessions, which have\u2026 uh\u2026 all been bad. People will tell you the Smith one was big, but he\u2019s never made a fourth-innings ton, made precious few fifties, and averages about 30. So he wasn\u2019t likely the player to take Australia through the day and into tomorrow. Khawaja more likely was, but he played a bad shot early. Head has been entertaining and made it look easy, as he does when he\u2019s on, and Marsh might yet do the same in the second session. We\u2019ll see. Back with you in a bit. 30th over: Australia 104-5 (Head 63, Marsh 5) Last over before lunch. Marsh is crouching forward to defend, normal field for him. Two slips, gully, point now, so he makes use of the cover gap with a drive for two. Bumrah bowling in the high 130s as far as kilometres go. If you want miles you can ask at a museum. Another noey from Bumrah, that\u2019s his fourth overstep. But Marsh blocks out the rebowl, and we\u2019re done for the session. 29th over: Australia 101-5 (Head 63, Marsh 3) Siraj is flapping his arms again, trying the albatross take-off, as he goes past Marsh\u2019s edge with a ball that keeps low. There\u2019s that bounce problem that will only keep getting worse. The wickets are coming, surely. But the Aussies are scrapping through it, for now. Head got of strike first ball, nudging away. He\u2019s done that so easily compared to everyone else. Marsh though does get off the mark with a sliced drive behind point for three. Back to the bouncer field for Head. One slip now, Kohli standing at about one and a half. Deep backward, deep third, fine leg, short backward, deep square, halfway back at midwicket, mid on, mid off. But Siraj is outside leg stump, and Head can tickle that finer of the fine leg for four. That\u2019s funny. 28th over: Australia 93-5 (Head 58, Marsh 0) Bumrah continues, and Head hasn\u2019t had too many problems with him. Starts with a couple of runs flicked through leg, then plays an audacious little late steer with a horizontal bat, just touching the ball towards deep third. They have two fielders back for that, one fine and one square, and he puts it between them for two more. Bumrah pushes back a fly slip, then changes his mind and brings Rahul back into the cordon. So, two slips, two variations on dee third, plus a fine leg and a deep square. Set up for the short ball, but Bumrah bowls full. Head can\u2019t beat midwicket. That fielder, with mid off and mid on, are the only ones set for the fuller ball. Lots of space through cover, and Head goes there but only for one. And abruptly it\u2019s different for Marsh facing, a horrible lifter that he fends into a gap on the leg side. Still yet to score. 27th over: Australia 88-5 (Head 53, Marsh 0) Fifty up, and in good time too. Style points like Jaiswal, too, as he lifts a Siraj short ball over the keeper\u2019s head for four! Follows it with three through midwicket. Nobody else has hit a four yet in this innings. Marsh isn\u2019t trying yet, though surely he will before long. 26th over: Australia 81-5 (Head 46, Marsh 0) Bumrah comes on, sensing the moment. Break this last top-six partnership (even if it\u2019s for the sixth wicket), get into the keeper and remaining bowlers. Head takes a run to leg. Cordon waiting for the right-handed Marsh. Nasty from Bumrah, in at the gloves. Then past the edge, Marsh forcing his hands at that ball. Overstep from Bumrah. Doesn\u2019t matter, give him another shot at the batter. Rising at the body again! Hits him. Marsh responds as he does to most things, with a smile. Leaves the next ball, defends the last. 25th over: Australia 79-5 (Head 45, Marsh 0) Well, the surface had seemed to be easing with a halfway older ball. Three slips and a gully for Marsh, Bumrah has dispensed with the point he had for Smith. Cover, mid off, mid on, midwicket, long leg \u2013 very conventional. Marsh blots out the last two balls. Against the run of play! The partnership to 62, the deficit down to 454, but Siraj makes the difference. A fuller length, a little extra bounce perhaps, Smith trying to cover his pads, edges wide of the keeper and Pant takes it brilliantly diving in front of first slip. Massive for India. Smith has a poor fourth-innings record across his whole career, and it continues today. 24th over: Australia 78-4 (Smith 17, Head 44) Sundar continues, Head goes back and cuts, but they have a deep cover sweeper so he only gets one run. Sundar probably happy to have him off strike. A bit of lift for Sundar, Smith has to defuse a ball that jumps from outside off stump. Then walks at the spinner to block the next to midwicket. Still no appreciable turn for Washington Sundar, if he gets wickets today it\u2019ll have to be with flight or bounce. 23rd over: Australia 77-4 (Smith 17, Head 43) Siraj back, and Head smashes him first ball too! Flays it square of the wicket. Then drives one, and hands over the strike. Smith defends the rest. 22nd over: Australia 72-4 (Smith 17, Head 38) Not far from short leg as Smith works Sundar behind square. Head cuts a run through point. 21st over: Australia 70-4 (Smith 16, Head 37) Schhhhmmmacked! Travis Head is raring to go no. Leans back and slams the first ball of Rana\u2019s over through cover for four. Even that power and timing sees the ball slow up inside the rope, but it does make it. He tries angling a drive square next ball, but plays under the bounce. A solid drive third ball, past mid off for two. Then Rana has had enough, top bouncer, nasty and Head fends it away, but the pace takes it over the cordon for two runs. Next, another square drive, this one connecting for two more. So that\u2019s three twos in a row, after the four, and Rana\u2019s closing ball is a wild bouncer and an overstep, so that\u2019s one more to the total. Short down the leg side to finish, and Head can\u2019t connect with a glance. 11 from the over. 20th over: Australia 59-4 (Smith 16, Head 27) Washington round the wicket to Head, too short, cut for a couple in that muscular, heaving Head fashion, heaving at the shot so it goes through cover rather than backward point. Now then, perfect sweep shot! Powerfully struck, along the ground, out through backward square. Fourrrr. Then goes back and cuts behind point for one. He\u2019s liking the non-spinning spin, and he does like making runs against India. 19th over: Australia 52-4 (Smith 16, Head 20) Ric Finlay on the ABC doing the stats on Smith\u2019s last 18 months in terms of modes of dismissal: leg before wicket is substantially up, but bowled is down, and the combination is about even. Read into that what you will. Rana is still targeting the pads, but not every ball, and Smith in between defensive efforts manages to drive two through cover point. 18th over: Australia 50-4 (Smith 14, Head 20) Washington after drinks, uneventful again. A single and a leg bye to raise the Australian 50. Small wins. \u201cHope you have remote access to enable the Snooze button on Rob Smyth\u2019s alarm, he can likely sleep in today,\u201d writes James Cahill. Well, Smith and Head are threatening to make him wake up in the cold early northern hemisphere morning. 17th over: Australia 48-4 (Smith 13, Head 20) India lose a review! Smith is smashed on the pad again, angling in at the stumps. Rana is turned down, and the review is missing the umpire\u2019s call designation by a whisker, green light on impact. So a review down, but it\u2019s another missed flick from Smith, who commits himself to keeping out the next few balls, then does connect with a flick through wide mid on for a run. Head takes another easily to square leg. Andrew Benton writes in. \u201cI\u2019m sure this test is just a blip for Australia, they\u2019ll be back. No team with a series against Australia in the next year or two should be feeling smug, in fact they should be watching warily for the response next test. But India are just amazing.\u201d Drinks. 16th over: Australia 46-4 (Smith 12, Head 19) Spin time, Washington Sundar with his offies. Pretty quick, pretty flat, pretty innocuous first over. 15th over: Australia 45-4 (Smith 11, Head 19) Scorched through cover again by Head! The last one was on the bounce, that one might have been airborne, but it has the pace and the direction to again reach the fence. Rana follows up with a beauty that beats the outside edge. This is fun cricket. Paul Moody writes in. Any relation to Long Tom, who\u2019s on ABC radio this week? \u201cGosh this is so exciting. Imagine if Oz were 6 or 7 down at the end of play today. I\u2019m following by your words, but will go to Southern Cross in Kampot to watch a bit too.\u201d I\u2019ve deduced that this means a bar in Cambodia. Have a cold Angkor for me. 14th over: Australia 38-4 (Smith 10, Head 13) Bumrah is back. That was quick. Replacing Siraj, changing ends from the end where he took those wickets last night. And Head drives him through the covers! Into the ground and bouncing away past Washington the fielder, but smashed hard enough that this one does, finally, make the boundary. The first of the innings! Narshan emails in. \u201cAnyone ever seen a slower outfield in Australia? More grass than in Pattaya!\u201d You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t recall one slower. Bumrah bowls a no-ball with his sixth, and has to re-deliver it. No run. 13th over: Australia 33-4 (Smith 10, Head 9) Runs still coming, Head drives one, Smith glides a couple using Rana\u2019s pace. Then a shot that might make Smith feel better, his old faithful flick through the leg side, timed nicely and speeding away for two runs. That\u2019s the shot that has been deserting him the last few years as he\u2019s been lbw more and more often. No comfort from the following ball though, short and into his stomach! Smashes into the solar plexus. That\u2019s hurt Smith. He\u2019s down on the ground, rocking on his back, taking a minute to catch his breath. Badly winded. That\u2019s uncomfortable, but he gets back to his feet eventually to see out the over. 12th over: Australia 28-4 (Smith 6, Head 8) Four for Head, but all run! He thrashes Siraj square, everyone expects it to reach the rope, but the slow outfield here sees it pull up short. That gives the batters time to get back. Next ball, nearly gets him, around the wicket angling in, Head thrashes at it, big inside edge into his knee, almost back onto the stumps. Siraj is rolling around on the ground in frustration. Following that, he\u2019s so pumped up that he demands, insists on an lbw dismissal when he crashes into Head\u2019s pad next ball. The ball looks like it\u2019s heading past the leg stump. Siraj though is heading for the slip cordon. He just takes off in a celebrappeal, ignores the umpire entirely and is throwing high fives with his fielders. Meanwhile, Head is standing there looking bemused, as is the umpire. Not out. India have to review after that malarkey, and they think the ball has straightened, which it has but not enough. Umpire\u2019s call, possibly grazing the leg stump. Head gets off strike cutting a single. 11th over: Australia 23-4 (Smith 6, Head 3) Bumrah is off. Surprisingly early, but he\u2019s captain, and he asks Harshit Rana to come on and fire it down. He does, fires it down the leg side in terms of angle, though Smith\u2019s pad gets in the way. The appeal is turned down. No run from the over. 10th over: Australia 23-4 (Smith 6, Head 3) This is top bowling from Siraj. Gets a ball to cut back in, Smith has to jab at it to keep it out. Then one holding the line, past the outside edge. Smith is happy to pull, taking a single. 9th over: Australia 22-4 (Smith 5, Head 3) Smith goes off to side against Bumrah here, dropping a run towards cover, before Head clips two through square leg. Odd that the runs are coming from Bumrah, and not the other end. Good from Australia to look to score against him though, carefully, rather than panicking and treating him like he\u2019s impossible to face. Bumrah is around the wicket to Head, in at the stumps and the pads, with a short midwicket in place. He wants Head to fall over to the off side, flicking a catch there. 8th over: Australia 19-4 (Smith 4, Head 1) A maiden for Siraj, bowling to Head, who is playing just about everything to the leg side, hopping about a bit just to keep the ball out. 7th over: Australia 19-4 (Smith 4, Head 1) A couple of singles from the Bumrah over, both batters nudging to the leg side, keeping out the threat. 6th over: Australia 17-4 (Smith 3, Head 0) Travis Head to the middle. How does he play it? Australia with counter-attackers at 5 and 6, having just lost their premier long-innings merchant for a very short innings. Ohh, Usman Khawaja. What is that. Do you need to be taking on the short ball second over of the day, with the new ball that bounces more? He says he does. Pull shot, top edge straight up, and Pant trots back to catch it. Poor, poor dismissal. 5th over: Australia 17-3 (Khawaja 4, Smith 3) Hit on the pad first ball! Bumrah goes up! All the Indians go up! But it\u2019s a no ball. The umpire wasn\u2019t into it anyway, too high. Smith survives, then thrives, with a nice cover drive for three. That\u2019s confident. Khawaja tucks a run around the corner, moving across to the off side. Runs from Bumrah? Huh. Here we go\u2026 Interesting little bit from Alex Carey on SEN radio this morning, saying that the main thing the remaining batters had to do was look at this as an opportunity to make runs rather than worrying about the result. Have as long a session in the middle as possible for the sake of their own games, knowing that can be beneficial for the remaining matches. Seems sensible, even if it\u2019s not the flag-waving, save-the-day talk that some would favour. So it will be Usman Khawaja to resume in quarter of an hour or so, having scored 3 from 9 balls, along with Steve Smith who will be on a king pair. Got out first ball in the first innings. After that, Head, Marsh, Carey, and three of the four bowlers, with Cummins already done. There\u2019s always so much attention on Virat Kohli. It feels as though Australian cricket is almost as obsessed with him as Indian cricket. Well, here\u2019s yesterday\u2019s century report, with a fair bit of Yashasvi Jaiswal too. Good morning from Perth, good day or afternoon or evening or witching hours wherever else in the world you may be. It\u2019s sunny, it\u2019s wildly windy, and it\u2019s not going to get too hot today, and India will be bowling for victory with everything stacked on their side. Here\u2019s the equation. Australia are 522 runs behind. Three wickets down. And they have two full days to try to survive on a wicket that has already started demonstrating the erratic bounce associated with this Perth Stadium pitch on days four and five. Buckley\u2019s and none. Yes, that margin was 522, five hundred and twenty two. That\u2019s after Jaiswal and Kohli made centuries yesterday while some teammates batted and then clattered around them. Australia, done in, then lost three wickets by stumps: first the makeshift opener McSweeney, then the captain Cummins trying to protect his first drop Labuschagne, then Labuschagne himself. Things have gone very badly indeed in that Australian side since they bowled out India for 150 on day one. India, meanwhile, can go into a five-Test series one-up, unless something truly bizarre happens. What\u2019s in it for Australia? Try to get some good time in the middle against India\u2019s bowlers, figure out a method against Bumrah, make the opposition toil and hurt for their win. That\u2019s about it. The recriminations will come later, but they may be tempered or intensified by the manner in which today plays out. Let\u2019s see.",

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re under the impression that NFL special teams this season have been especially wonky, you are completely and utterly correct.</p> <p>Still, as weird as it special teams had been through the first 11 weeks of the season, nothing could quite compare to what happened on Sunday. Kicker misses and miscues have been legion, but Sunday saw far more blunders than usual.</p> <p>Most prominent of all was Austin Seibert of the Washington Commanders. The seven-year veteran came into Sunday perfect on extra-points, and 25 of 27 on his field goal attempts, this season.</p> <p>And then came the utter disaster Seibert put himself in against the Dallas Cowboys in <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay/_/gameId/401671715\">a 34-26 Commanders loss</a>. With 48 seconds left in the first quarter, Seibert missed a 51-yard field goal. No surprise there, as his only two misses this season had come from 50 or more yards. Then, after Jayden Daniels scored a touchdown on a 17-yard run with 9:59 left in the third quarter, Seibert missed his first extra-point attempt of the season. It didn\u2019t seem a huge deal: Washington still led 9-3 against a Dallas team who have been woeful all season.</p> <p>Seibert suffered another blow when his kickoff was returned <a href=\"https://x.com/NFL/status/1860791043286778108\">99 yards for a touchdown</a> by KaVontae Turpin to give the Cowboys a 27-17 lead late in the fourth. That was bad news for a Commanders team in the playoff hunt, but the touchdown had much more to do with Turpin\u2019s skills than Seibert\u2019s deficiencies. Seibert even booted a 51-yard field goal with 1:40 left to narrow the deficit to seven points and give the Commanders a faint whiff of hope. And there\u2019s always hope against these Cowboys. First, Dallas recovered Seibert\u2019s onside kick but were forced to punt. Then, with 33 seconds left, Daniels hit Terry McLaurin on a miraculous 86-yard touchdown in which Dallas, as has become routine this season, forgot how to tackle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1860794916630413776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">COMMANDERS 86-YARD TOUCHDOWN WOW<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DALvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DALvsWAS</a> on FOX<br>\ud83d\udcf1: <a href=\"https://t.co/waVpO909ge\">https://t.co/waVpO909ge</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/apaNEKNCkh\">pic.twitter.com/apaNEKNCkh</a></p>&mdash; NFL (@NFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1860794916630413776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 24, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The score was 27-26 and all Seibert had to do was make the extra point and almost certainly send the game into overtime.

He tried an onside kick on the very next play after his miss, and Cowboys safety Juanyeh Thomas returned the darned thing for a 34-yard touchdown to put the game completely out of reach.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re under the impression that NFL special teams this season have been especially wonky, you are completely and utterly correct. Still, as weird as it special teams had been through the first 11 weeks of the season, nothing could quite compare to what happened on Sunday. Kicker misses and miscues have been legion, but Sunday saw far more blunders than usual. Most prominent of all was Austin Seibert of the Washington Commanders. The seven-year veteran came into Sunday perfect on extra-points, and 25 of 27 on his field goal attempts, this season. And then came the utter disaster Seibert put himself in against the Dallas Cowboys in a 34-26 Commanders loss. With 48 seconds left in the first quarter, Seibert missed a 51-yard field goal. No surprise there, as his only two misses this season had come from 50 or more yards. Then, after Jayden Daniels scored a touchdown on a 17-yard run with 9:59 left in the third quarter, Seibert missed his first extra-point attempt of the season. It didn\u2019t seem a huge deal: Washington still led 9-3 against a Dallas team who have been woeful all season. Seibert suffered another blow when his kickoff was returned 99 yards for a touchdown by KaVontae Turpin to give the Cowboys a 27-17 lead late in the fourth. That was bad news for a Commanders team in the playoff hunt, but the touchdown had much more to do with Turpin\u2019s skills than Seibert\u2019s deficiencies. Seibert even booted a 51-yard field goal with 1:40 left to narrow the deficit to seven points and give the Commanders a faint whiff of hope. And there\u2019s always hope against these Cowboys. First, Dallas recovered Seibert\u2019s onside kick but were forced to punt. Then, with 33 seconds left, Daniels hit Terry McLaurin on a miraculous 86-yard touchdown in which Dallas, as has become routine this season, forgot how to tackle. The score was 27-26 and all Seibert had to do was make the extra point and almost certainly send the game into overtime. You can guess how that went. But there was more to pain to come for Seibert. He tried an onside kick on the very next play after his miss, and Cowboys safety Juanyeh Thomas returned the darned thing for a 34-yard touchdown to put the game completely out of reach. Two successive plays from Seibert had cost his team victory over a detested enemy in a season where they had started to reverse their recent reputation as a hapless franchise. It also doomed the 7-5 Commanders to a third straight defeat just as their NFC East rivals, the 9-2 Philadelphia Eagles, are on a seven-game win streak. It\u2019s hard to think of a passage of play being more painful for a single player in NFL history. Seibert\u2019s haunted expression told the story in a single image. Give Seibert credit \u2013 some players would rather drop something heavy on their foot than face the media after so many debacles, but he was a standup guy. He refused to blame the bad snap on the second missed extra point, and he refused to blame the hip injury that had caused him to miss the Commanders\u2019 two previous games. In a season where special teams have been anything but, Seibert will become the unfortunate personification of those struggles with one of the most agonizing games any kicker has ever had. MVP of the week Saquon Barkley, RB, Philadelphia Eagles. As if things weren\u2019t bad enough for the 2-9 New York Giants (more on them in a minute). Barkley, the running back they deemed expendable this offseason, rolled right over a highly competent but very young Los Angeles Rams defense on Sunday night for 255 rushing yards and two TDs as the Eagles boat-raced the Rams, 37-20. Pending the results of Monday night\u2019s game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Los Angeles Chargers, Barkley leapfrogged Baltimore\u2019s Derrick Henry for the NFL\u2019s lead in rushing yards with 1,392 yards to Henry\u2019s 1,185. Barkley had touchdown runs of 70 and 72 yards, and put up the ninth-most rushing yards in a single game in NFL history. Before Giants fans wonder where this was before, there\u2019s no way to imagine this version of Barkley in New York \u2013 or most anywhere else. He\u2019s playing behind the best offensive line he\u2019s ever had by far, and he has a quarterback in Jalen Hurts who amplifies Barkley\u2019s rushing threat with his own mobility. It\u2019s a prime example of the perfect player in the perfect situation, and yet another personnel hit for Big Blue. Video of the week The Carolina Panthers played the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs much closer than anyone might have expected. In fact, the game was 27-27 with 1:49 left after Carolina converted a two-point attempt. So, the Panthers gave the ball back to the Chiefs and hoped that Patrick Mahomes wouldn\u2019t do something ridiculous. That hope, of course, was in vain. With 48 seconds left, Mahomes trucked for a 33-yard run that took the ball to the Carolina 22-yard line, and set up Spencer Shrader\u2019s game-winning field goal as time expired. If you think you\u2019ve seen something like that before \u2026 well, you pretty much have. In last season\u2019s Super Bowl, the score was 22-19 in the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 favor before Mahomes\u2019 19-yard scramble set up his game-winning touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman three plays later. As was the case with most of the Chiefs\u2019 10 victories this season, it wasn\u2019t pretty \u2026 but a win is a win. Stat of the week There were several kicking malfeasances on Sunday besides those of Seibert, and that\u2019s been the case all season (along with a few heroics). But before you think that it\u2019s happening at an unusual rate in 2024, let\u2019s not let recency bias trip things in the wrong direction.

Elsewhere around the league -- Late in the third quarter of Minnesota\u2019s 30-27 win over the Chicago Bears, Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold appeared to hit Jordan Addison on what became a 69-yard play. The question was whether Addison stepped out of bounds before he completed his after-catch trek.

Morley\u2019s main motivation for going was so that his nephew could meet Rossi, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/10/paolo-rossi-quick-feet-world-cup-joy-lives-on-tribute\">won the Golden Boot at the World Cup</a>.</p> <p>When they arrived they were told Rossi was in a team meeting and would be down in a minute. Two hours later came another update: Rossi was not feeling well and the photoshoot was cancelled. \u201cI didn\u2019t get home till about 10 o\u2019clock,\u201d says Morley. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big thing but you have your routine the night before a game.

I should have come off but in those days you wanted to play through the pain, especially in such a big game.

While Juventus were the better side, Villa had their moments. After Colin Gibson headed nervously against his own bar, Ken McNaught had an emphatic header ruled out for \u2026 well, nobody knows to this day. It was a clear and painfully obvious error, but the Villa players accepted the decision without complaint.</p> <p>The pace of the game was ferocious, but most of the decisive moments involved players who had their bodies in the oven and<em> </em>their brains in the fridge. In the 51st minute, after a flurry of tackles in the inside-right channel, Gordon Cowans calmly danced away from Massimo Bonini and curved the ball out to the left-back, Gibson. He looked, as Villa always did, for the abundant head of Peter Withe at the far post, but the ball did not reach him. Cowans arrived late in the box and planted a joyous flying header past Dino Zoff.</p> <p>Cowans is adored at Villa Park. In March, his family announced he had entered a care facility due to a deterioration in his Alzheimer\u2019s. In an era of all-action midfielders who oozed testosterone, Cowans was a symbol of understated class. \u201cWhat a player,\u201d says Blair. \u201cHis energy, his ability with right or left foot, his awareness and ability to pick a pass. He was tenacious; he had everything. He\u2019d be a great player in any system, in any era. He\u2019s the best player I ever played with and a great person. It\u2019s so sad.

      "body": "<h2>Diallo thrives in unfamiliar role</h2> <p>For the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford\u2019s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United\u2019s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. <strong>Taha Hashim</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/ipswich-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Delap shows stomach for Ipswich\u2019s fight</h2> <p>Towards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich\u2019s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by Andr\u00e9 Onana, who saved twice from close range \u2013 the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm \u2013 denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn\u2019t tripped up just yet. <strong>TH</strong></p> <h2>Spurs should follow Kulusevski\u2019s lead</h2> <p>At 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">scintillating performance at Manchester City</a> ranks. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s the best result ever in my career, it\u2019s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it\u2019s not a turning point,\u201d said the forward. \u201cWe have to be better in other games.\u201d The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. \u201cI have something that no other player has. So you can\u2019t compare me to any other player \u2013 this is what I\u2019m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart \u2013 I don\u2019t get tired \u2013 I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can\u2019t let anybody outwork me. That\u2019s the plan. That\u2019s how I play and how I train.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Hope for Saints in latest loss</h2> <p>Southampton had only six shots against Liverpool \u2013 they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. \u201cWhat was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,\u201d Arne Slot said. \u201cToday they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I\u2019m sure they will win some games.\u201d As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/24/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Southampton 2-3 Liverpool</a></em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Nwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option</h2> <p>Every week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling\u2019s low cross to wrap up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/arsenal-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal\u2019s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest</a>; Cesc F\u00e0bregas is Arsenal\u2019s only younger league scorer.

Cole Palmer is now a target for opposition players. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez took him out during Chelsea\u2019s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday. It was cynical from Ndidi, who showed no regard for a fellow professional when he raked his studs down Palmer\u2019s achilles. The Chelsea playmaker easily could have been injured. He stayed down for a while and there was an argument that Ndidi should have been sent off. The Leicester midfielder only saw yellow, though, and there has to be a valid concern over whether Palmer needs more protection from referees. Chelsea experienced similar with Eden Hazard, who often came in for heavy challenges from opposition defenders desperate to slow him down. The dangers are clear. Mart\u00ednez and Ndidi both escaped red cards but at some point one of the best attackers in England is going to get hurt. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/leicester-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 1-2 Chelsea</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Lemina helps sweep Wolves to victory</h2> <p>Necessity \u2013 an injury crisis within a relegation battle \u2013 bred invention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/23/fulham-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">for Wolves at Fulham</a>.

Under Fabian H\u00fcrzeler, two years his junior, Welbeck has started every league game this season, which must provide great joy considering the injuries he encountered at Arsenal. A while back, his narrative was of a gifted forward tied up in misfortune, a career that took in trophies and major tournaments but never really advanced past his early-to-mid-20s.

The question was not impertinent. It was, worryingly for the manager, a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw from his team\u2019s stagnant efforts against a Brentford side that had not kept a clean sheet or gained an away point all season before arriving at Goodison Park. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working endlessly since I\u2019ve been here to attack better,\u201d Dyche replied with a touch of incredulity. \u201cWe have got very good players here and it is my responsibility to make them better or, if I can\u2019t make them better, make them as a unit win.\u201d The problem for Dyche \u2013 aside from the league table, a daunting December fixture list and the prospect of working for new owners \u2013 is that individuals are not improving and the collective is not winning.

      "bodyText": "Diallo thrives in unfamiliar role For the established full-back, a wing-back role must be liberating, permission granted to embark on an adventure in the other half. Amad Diallo was faced with the less desirable situation against Ipswich, a forward forced to track back as he slotted in on the right of Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1. Diallo retained his attacking aggression, immediately rampaging forward and evading challenges to set up Marcus Rashford\u2019s early opener. He was responsible in defence and one of United\u2019s brightest performers in a mostly bleak display, even threatening to deliver a late winner when cutting inside into the box to let fly. Diallo is most likely just a stopgap in the position but his adaptability has some worth as Amorim searches for his best XI. Taha Hashim Match report: Ipswich 1-1 Manchester United Delap shows stomach for Ipswich\u2019s fight Towards the end of the first half against Manchester United, Ipswich\u2019s Liam Delap opted for the unnecessary. With the ball travelling out for a throw, the forward charged into Noussair Mazraoui, prompting a square up between the two. Delap was fortunate to avoid a yellow but his need for a scrap is what makes him a player. He hassled United when dropping deep, using his flicks and dinks to muster space and drive into the box. His evening was ruined, though, by Andr\u00e9 Onana, who saved twice from close range \u2013 the first a stunner with an outstretched right arm \u2013 denying Delap from improving an already impressive goalscoring record in the Premier League. The 21-year-old has acquired seven yellows this season for his club and England Under-21s. He plays on the edge but hasn\u2019t tripped up just yet. TH Spurs should follow Kulusevski\u2019s lead At 24, and five years into his senior career, Dejan Kulusevski has no doubt where Tottenham\u2019s scintillating performance at Manchester City ranks. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s the best result ever in my career, it\u2019s a big night for the whole club, for the coach [Ange Postecoglou], for the players but it\u2019s not a turning point,\u201d said the forward. \u201cWe have to be better in other games.\u201d The Swede, who impressed throughout, was also bullish about his own abilities. \u201cI have something that no other player has. So you can\u2019t compare me to any other player \u2013 this is what I\u2019m looking for. Of course, I watch other players. I take the best stuff from them, but with my engine, you know, with my heart \u2013 I don\u2019t get tired \u2013 I feel like I can still do a lot in my career. I can\u2019t let anybody outwork me. That\u2019s the plan. That\u2019s how I play and how I train.\u201d Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester City 0-4 Tottenham Hope for Saints in latest loss Southampton had only six shots against Liverpool \u2013 they have managed more than that in 11 of their 14 previous games in all competitions this season, and at least doubled that number on five occasions. As they continue to play themselves into trouble at the back and remain marooned at the bottom of the table there are not many straws around for them to clutch, but if they could discover a clinical touch it would certainly help. \u201cWhat was a bit unlucky for them I think is normally they play much better and create much more chances and hardly score,\u201d Arne Slot said. \u201cToday they created few chances and scored two. If they combine these things, so the style of play they had in other games with the effectiveness they had today, then I\u2019m sure they will win some games.\u201d As his team had just demonstrated, if a team can play quite poorly and still score a few goals, they just might be on to something. Simon Burnton Match report: Southampton 2-3 Liverpool Nwaneri offers vital new Arsenal option Every week, it feels, brings a new landmark for Ethan Nwaneri. When he was 15 years and 181 days old, he became the youngest player ever to play in the English top flight. On 25 September this year, at the grand old age of 17, he got his first senior goals, scoring twice in a Carabao Cup win over Bolton. And on Saturday, he sidefooted home Raheem Sterling\u2019s low cross to wrap up Arsenal\u2019s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest; Cesc F\u00e0bregas is Arsenal\u2019s only younger league scorer. He\u2019d been on the field less than two minutes, yet already his energy and invention had enlivened a game that was drifting towards its conclusion. Whether he\u2019s at his best wide or through the middle remains to be seen, but Nwaneri is clearly a player of enormous gifts. Arsenal, after years of slightly uninspiring back-up options off the bench, suddenly have a forward of genuinely thrilling potential.

Lisandro Mart\u00ednez took him out during Chelsea\u2019s draw with Manchester United early this month and there was more rough treatment from Leicester\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi on Saturday.

      "body": "<p>One hundred years ago last month, the 28-year-old poet Andr\u00e9 Breton penned the Surrealist Manifesto, shucking off \u201cthe reign of logic\u201d, calling out \u201cthe pretence of civilisation and progress\u201d and heralding \u201cthe omnipotence of dream\u201d. Breton wanted nothing less than a new reality \u2013 one that might overturn a world shaped by religion, schools and governments \u2013 by seeking truths within the self: \u201cThe future resolution of these two states, dream and reality [\u2026] into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality.\u201d To create it, he and his evolving gang of Parisian writers and artists turned to the unconscious, spontaneity, automatic creation and collagist games.</p>    <p>Two exhibitions mark the manifesto\u2019s centenary in Britain this month, giving some sense of just how&nbsp;playful and diffuse the fruits of&nbsp;Breton\u2019s rallying cry have been. At&nbsp;Forbidden Territories: 100 Years of Surreal Landscapes at the Hepworth Wakefield, you can encounter young artists still flying the flag for the movement alongside some of its signature historical works. These include the eerie wastelands Salvador Dal\u00ed filled with random phones, shape-shifting rocks and melting clocks, and the classic philosophical game by Ren\u00e9 \u201cbowler hat\u201d Magritte, where a painted landscape within a painted landscape riffs on Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave. There\u2019s also Max Ernst\u2019s painting using floorboard rubbings to suggest tangled woods haunted by his childhood fears and fantasies, and his one-time partner Leonora Carrington\u2019s fairytale-esque animal-human fusions.</p>    <p>Not far from the Hepworth, The Traumatic Surreal at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds will probe how German-speaking feminist artists used surrealism to address fascism and gender in the decades after the second world war. Here, violent undercurrents and animal urges erupt&nbsp;in disturbing psychosexual hybrid creations. Alongside the postwar cohort, it includes work by M\u00e9ret Oppenheim, one of a number of&nbsp;women to join the movement\u2019s boys\u2019 club in the 1930s and the creator&nbsp;of that early surrealist icon,&nbsp;the&nbsp;feral furred teacup.</p>    <p>These follow a slew of global exhibitions celebrating surrealism\u2019s heavy-hitters such as Imagine! <a href=\"https://fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/imagine\">100 Years of Surrealism</a>, the huge survey that opened at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in collaboration with the Pompidou Centre in Paris earlier this year, as well as its diverse flowerings, be it surrealist artists from&nbsp;the African diaspora at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth or&nbsp;the movement\u2019s importance for film&nbsp;like the recent season at Dundee Contemporary Arts. All these exhibitions contend in some way with&nbsp;the question: \u201cWhat do we want&nbsp;to look at in surrealism today?\u201d as Eleanor Clayton, curator of Forbidden Territories, says.</p> <p>Plenty of unpalatable comparison points between Breton\u2019s world and our&nbsp;own give these retrospectives an urgency. Like other writers and artists of his generation, Breton wanted to cut ties with a society that had sent young men to be blown apart or lose their minds in the trenches. His particular revolutionary spirit was set alight when he worked with shellshock victims in a psychiatric hospital and switched on to Freud\u2019s new psychoanalytic theories. As with the absurdist Dada movement that surrealism followed, his emphasis on chance and illogic was a response to&nbsp;a world gone mad. Now, as then, we are dealing with epic upheavals, with climate breakdown added to the horrors of war, the aftermath of a&nbsp;pandemic and a sharpened awareness of mental health crises.</p>    <p>Environmental issues are one focus of Forbidden Territories, prompted in part, as Clayton explains, by the surrealist outlier, Leonora Carrington\u2019s writings on \u201cWhat constitutes life, and what differentiates plant and animal, human and non-human? What are our responsibilities towards the planet?\u201d The feminist anti-fascist perspective in The Traumatic Surreal is especially pressing too, given that the far-right views that blighted Europe in the 1930s have again been thrust upon mainstream politics while attacks on&nbsp;women\u2019s reproductive rights in the&nbsp;US threaten freedoms.</p>    <p>There is one major difference, though, that makes the movement\u2019s longevity all the more remarkable. Today, surrealism\u2019s jolts \u2013 the businessmen raining from the sky, the&nbsp;lobster phone \u2013 no longer have&nbsp;the&nbsp;shock of the new. Instead, made-you-look surrealist weirdness saturates everything from kids\u2019 TV to&nbsp;commercials and pop videos. This&nbsp;shift began as far back as the 1930s when dreamy visions and fetish&nbsp;objects were taken up in fashion, with&nbsp;designs such as Elsa Schiaparelli\u2019s shoe hat, advertising like Zero\u2019s \u201chead in the clouds\u201d poster for Shell oil, and furniture, beginning with Dal\u00ed\u2019s Mae West lips sofa.</p>    <p>It\u2019s thanks to Dal\u00ed\u2019s efforts most of&nbsp;all that surrealism is the only modernist movement to have gone truly mainstream. In the 1940s US, he&nbsp;gleefully embraced mass culture designing magazine covers, creating that spooky dream sequence in Hitchcock\u2019s Spellbound, and fashioning himself into a media personality with a trademark wacky moustache. In the intervening years, his endlessly reproduced signature tropes such as the clocks and burning giraffes have been reduced to cliche. While Breton abhorred Dal\u00ed\u2019s commercialisation, he&nbsp;wasn\u2019t solely responsible for the original movement losing its edge. Breton also fled embattled Europe to the US in 1941, following Ernst, Andr\u00e9 Masson and others. With surrealism\u2019s prominent artists dispersed, the movement failed to provide a coherent&nbsp;response to the war.</p>    <p>And yet aspects of early surrealism still speak loudly to young artists. As Mark Polizzotti has underlined in his recent book Why Surrealism Matters, the focus has moved away from the&nbsp;original surrealism bros to \u201cnon-western surrealisms, gender-fluid surrealisms, racially diverse surrealisms\u201d. Within Forbidden Territories, Clayton is using landscape as a way to map the evolution from the&nbsp;first explorations of uncanny psychic hinterlands to how surrealist strategies are now being used to probe issues ranging from sexual identity to animal and plant rights. \u201cSurrealism opened the door on challenging the status quo,\u201d the curator reflects. \u201cParticularly in landscape, which was traditionally meant to be a faithful document of objective reality. It\u2019s saying maybe there is no objective reality! That was very freeing to artists in the past and it remains so today.\u201d</p>    <p>Early surrealism such as Yves Tanguy\u2019s interest in biomorphism, swirling organic forms that might pour&nbsp;intuitively from a&nbsp;maker\u2019s hand and suggest collapsing physical and mental boundaries, echoes across the decades. An outlier among 1940s and 50s British surrealists, the occultist painter Ithell Colquhoun for instance, made bodily landscapes with a confusion of internal and external organs, psychedelic thrumming coastal geologies, botanical and underwater worlds. These have been put in communion with the non-binary Cornwall-based artist Ro&nbsp;Robertson\u2019s fluid steel sculptures, evoking the shifting inbetweenness of&nbsp;shore and sea. For both artists, landscape is a way to explore how gender is built and blurred.</p> <p>The show also probes geopolitical questions. Included in a selection of Lee Miller\u2019s Egyptian photography, her celebrated 1937 image of the desert seen through a ripped tent wall, Portrait of Space, transforms the arid vista into a threshold zone. It\u2019s typically read as a&nbsp;comment on the division between consciousness and unconsciousness, but its political implications are brought out by its pairing with Wael Shawky\u2019s The Gulf Project of 2019, sculptures and drawings fusing Middle Eastern architecture with the bodies of fantastical creatures. Both suggest how a place\u2019s significance is slippery, acquired through what human imagination imposes on it, including in Shawky\u2019s work, our histories and&nbsp;myths.</p>    <p>The Traumatic Surreal offers one of&nbsp;the most succinct examples of later generations using surrealism to their own ends. The movement\u2019s first wave&nbsp;brought out a distinctly male viewpoint, be it Dal\u00ed\u2019s phallic piles of&nbsp;rocks or Hans Bellmer\u2019s headless double-ended dolls. Here, the fetish objects and sublimations get a feminist rethink, as with the Austrian artist Renate Bertlmann\u2019s heart-shaped bust of a woman\u2019s breasts with&nbsp;a surgical razor shooting from a&nbsp;nipple, or the Luxembourgish Bady&nbsp;Minck\u2019s video in which a woman sticks out a literally furred tongue.</p> <p>For its curator, the art historian Patricia Allmer, this work is also clearly anti-fascist and born of the recent Nazi history within the countries that the exhibition\u2019s artists hail from. \u201cWomanhood and motherhood was really important for&nbsp;National Socialist ideology,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen women make a feminist protest in these countries, it\u2019s always already a protest against fascism.\u201d</p>    <p>That surrealism\u2019s relevance did not&nbsp;end when its original figureheads fizzled out or its tropes went stale should perhaps be no surprise.

      "bodyText": "One hundred years ago last month, the 28-year-old poet Andr\u00e9 Breton penned the Surrealist Manifesto, shucking off \u201cthe reign of logic\u201d, calling out \u201cthe pretence of civilisation and progress\u201d and heralding \u201cthe omnipotence of dream\u201d. Breton wanted nothing less than a new reality \u2013 one that might overturn a world shaped by religion, schools and governments \u2013 by seeking truths within the self: \u201cThe future resolution of these two states, dream and reality [\u2026] into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality.\u201d To create it, he and his evolving gang of Parisian writers and artists turned to the unconscious, spontaneity, automatic creation and collagist games. Two exhibitions mark the manifesto\u2019s centenary in Britain this month, giving some sense of just how playful and diffuse the fruits of Breton\u2019s rallying cry have been. At Forbidden Territories: 100 Years of Surreal Landscapes at the Hepworth Wakefield, you can encounter young artists still flying the flag for the movement alongside some of its signature historical works. These include the eerie wastelands Salvador Dal\u00ed filled with random phones, shape-shifting rocks and melting clocks, and the classic philosophical game by Ren\u00e9 \u201cbowler hat\u201d Magritte, where a painted landscape within a painted landscape riffs on Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave. There\u2019s also Max Ernst\u2019s painting using floorboard rubbings to suggest tangled woods haunted by his childhood fears and fantasies, and his one-time partner Leonora Carrington\u2019s fairytale-esque animal-human fusions. Not far from the Hepworth, The Traumatic Surreal at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds will probe how German-speaking feminist artists used surrealism to address fascism and gender in the decades after the second world war. Here, violent undercurrents and animal urges erupt in disturbing psychosexual hybrid creations. Alongside the postwar cohort, it includes work by M\u00e9ret Oppenheim, one of a number of women to join the movement\u2019s boys\u2019 club in the 1930s and the creator of that early surrealist icon, the feral furred teacup. These follow a slew of global exhibitions celebrating surrealism\u2019s heavy-hitters such as Imagine! 100 Years of Surrealism, the huge survey that opened at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in collaboration with the Pompidou Centre in Paris earlier this year, as well as its diverse flowerings, be it surrealist artists from the African diaspora at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth or the movement\u2019s importance for film like the recent season at Dundee Contemporary Arts. All these exhibitions contend in some way with the question: \u201cWhat do we want to look at in surrealism today?\u201d as Eleanor Clayton, curator of Forbidden Territories, says. Plenty of unpalatable comparison points between Breton\u2019s world and our own give these retrospectives an urgency. Like other writers and artists of his generation, Breton wanted to cut ties with a society that had sent young men to be blown apart or lose their minds in the trenches. His particular revolutionary spirit was set alight when he worked with shellshock victims in a psychiatric hospital and switched on to Freud\u2019s new psychoanalytic theories. As with the absurdist Dada movement that surrealism followed, his emphasis on chance and illogic was a response to a world gone mad. Now, as then, we are dealing with epic upheavals, with climate breakdown added to the horrors of war, the aftermath of a pandemic and a sharpened awareness of mental health crises. Environmental issues are one focus of Forbidden Territories, prompted in part, as Clayton explains, by the surrealist outlier, Leonora Carrington\u2019s writings on \u201cWhat constitutes life, and what differentiates plant and animal, human and non-human? What are our responsibilities towards the planet?\u201d The feminist anti-fascist perspective in The Traumatic Surreal is especially pressing too, given that the far-right views that blighted Europe in the 1930s have again been thrust upon mainstream politics while attacks on women\u2019s reproductive rights in the US threaten freedoms. There is one major difference, though, that makes the movement\u2019s longevity all the more remarkable. Today, surrealism\u2019s jolts \u2013 the businessmen raining from the sky, the lobster phone \u2013 no longer have the shock of the new. Instead, made-you-look surrealist weirdness saturates everything from kids\u2019 TV to commercials and pop videos. This shift began as far back as the 1930s when dreamy visions and fetish objects were taken up in fashion, with designs such as Elsa Schiaparelli\u2019s shoe hat, advertising like Zero\u2019s \u201chead in the clouds\u201d poster for Shell oil, and furniture, beginning with Dal\u00ed\u2019s Mae West lips sofa.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Mayors of the areas home to Sydney\u2019s supersized housing precincts have been left \u201cblindsided\u201d after the NSW government announcing major zoning changes without first telling them.</p> \n  <p>Six precincts were up for consideration and all had at least 1,000 additional homes added to their expected housing density in new zoning announced on Monday \u2013 except for the Kellyville and Bella Vista area, which had its total cut by three-quarters.</p> \n  <p>The premier, Chris Minns, told reporters he thought that was a \u201creasonable compromise\u201d:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The number of new homes being built in the Blacktown local government area is massive, far, far higher than Macquarie Park and Hornsby.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The mayor of Blacktown, Brad Bunting, said the decision was \u201ca win for common sense\u201d and praised the government\u2019s decision.</p> \n  <p>However, that precinct also reaches into the Hills shire, where the mayor, Michelle Byrne, was unhappy to have learned about the rezoning via morning media reports:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s disappointing that the minister has steamrolled council with this announcement. There are a lot of issues with this half-baked proposal that need to be addressed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Byrne said the finalised proposal had wiped housing growth from Blacktown and put all of the increase into the Hills.</p> \n  <p>The City of Ryde initially issued a statement thanking the government for its consultative approach but in a subsequent statement said staff had been \u201cblindsided by today\u2019s announcement\u201d and had found \u201cmajor discrepancies\u201d between the government\u2019s announcement and departmental master-planning documents.</p> \n  <p>The North Sydney mayor, Zo\u00eb Baker, also said she had not been notified ahead of the announcement for the Crows Nest precinct, slamming the ruled 3% minimum for affordable housing as \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d, while a Hornsby shire council spokesperson said the new development plan included a number of changes made without consulting the council.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T07:38:11.436Z\">at 7.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-67441d1e8f087ff7bcc44f0a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T06:49:52.729Z\">6.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Innisfail child dies after being found unresponsive in vehicle</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland police are investigating the death of a child in Innisfail this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Officers responded to reports of a child found unresponsive in a vehicle about 1pm.</p> \n  <p>Upon arrival, emergency services provided medical assistance, however the child was declared deceased.</p> \n  <p>Investigations are continuing, and a report will be prepared for the coroner.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T07:09:47.179Z\">at 7.09am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674419e28f086501868e90f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T06:43:24.179Z\">6.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Man dies at swimming hole in Royal national park</strong></p> \n  <p>A man has died after being pulled unresponsive from a swimming hole in the Royal national park in NSW.</p> \n  <p>Emergency services were called to Winifred Falls at about 2.35pm after reports of a drowning.</p> \n  <p>Officers attached to Sutherland shire police area command attended alongside NSW ambulance paramedics and found a man had been pulled from the water.</p> \n  <p>The man was treated at the scene by paramedics, but he could not be revived.</p> \n  <p>The man, who is yet to be formally identified, is believed to be aged in his 20s.</p> \n  <p>Police established a crime scene and commenced inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the man\u2019s death.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T06:50:22.153Z\">at 6.50am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674417f68f087ff7bcc44efa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/josh-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T06:24:39.164Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Liberal MP apologises for staffer filming in ministerial wing of Parliament House</strong></p> \n  <p>The Liberal MP Tony Pasin has apologised for a staff member filming in the corridor of Parliament House\u2019s ministerial wing, saying \u201cunbeknownst to me\u201d his employee filmed inside the infrastructure minister Catherine King\u2019s office.</p> \n  <p>King made claims of \u201cdiscourtesy\u201d from Pasin in an interaction last week, where she alleged filming inside her office when Pasin and a staffer attended for a \u201cdrop-in\u201d session.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/catherine-king-tony-pasin-gopro-filming-allegation-infrastructure-minister-ntwnfb\">Liberal backbencher denies Catherine King\u2019s parliamentary claim he filmed conversation between them on GoPro</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Pasin was not in parliament on Thursday but a spokesperson said in a statement last week he \u201cdenies the accusations levelled against him by minister King\u201d.

That looks more likely to be Friday, as the heatwave stalls a bit over the region.</p> \n  <p>Penrith, in Sydney\u2019s west, can expect tops of 39C and 40C on Tuesday and Wednesday, with each daily update nudging the forecast higher it seems. Sea breezes should keep Sydney\u2019s CBD to maximums of 31C and 33C for those two days, the <strong>Bureau of Meteorology </strong>said.</p> \n  <p>The mercury on Thursday, though, will still be nudging 30C in Sydney and 33C in Penrith.</p> \n  <p>One consequence is that the power grid will be strained for a bit longer, particularly in NSW, although Queensland will be hoping its generators don\u2019t have any unplanned outages.</p> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Energy Market Operator</strong> had been forecasting the potential for blackouts on Wednesday afternoon in NSW, dubbed a lack of reserve level 3. That forecast was cancelled a little while ago, only for an LOR to be issued for Thursday afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Now, it\u2019s likely the market will respond (that\u2019s the point of these alerts), but moving target, from Tuesday to Thursday, is a reminder of the limited spare generation capacity there is in the grid.</p> \n  <p>Some will say \u201cnet zero policies are to blame\u201d. The fact that about 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants are facing planned or unplanned maintenance this week in eastern Australia seems to be the real culprit.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T06:35:58.456Z\">at 6.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-674410728f087ff7bcc44eb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-11-25T05:52:26.878Z\">5.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>An Australian injured in a West Bank shooting has called for an investigation into the incident.

a speech in the House of Representatives calling for the parliament to give \u201cunanimous\u201d support to his government\u2019s bid to ban under-16s from social media, after Guardian Australia this morning reported a simmering concern among some Coalition MPs about the rushed legislation.</p> \n  <p>The Nationals MP <strong>Keith Pitt</strong> and some colleagues are raising issues about the fact children can work at age 14, but wouldn\u2019t be able to go on Facebook until 16 \u2013 as well as concerns about the legislation being rammed through parliament within a week with only a token Senate inquiry. The Nine newspapers also reported the Liberal MP <strong>Garth Hamilton</strong> had voiced concerns.</p> \n  <p>In an address to the house just now, Albanese claimed world leaders in North America, Europe and New Zealand had recently told him \u201cthey are all looking at what we are doing, and they are applauding what we are doing in showing leadership in this area\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/25/conservative-opposition-to-social-media-age-limit-grows-ahead-of-lower-house-vote\">Conservative opposition to Australia\u2019s social media age limit grows before lower house vote</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Defending the decision to set the age limit at 16, Albanese said the restriction was in place because \u201cas we develop and mature, we\u2019re better at spotting the fakes and the dangers\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We build up the mental resilience to ignore the worst of the nastiness.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today, thanks for reading. Here are the main stories: The deputy prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, is suing her boss and the government after it failed to resolve the employment stalemate that has seen her locked out of her office since May. The independent senator David Pocock called Labor \u201cgutless\u201d for delaying gambling ad reform. A recovering gambling addict who testified before a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm also criticised the government\u2019s decision to delay advertising reforms. At the short hearing on the federal government\u2019s social media ban bill, mental health groups and experts were asked whether the good outweighs the ban on social media for under-16s. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, made a speech in the House of Representatives calling for the parliament to give \u201cunanimous\u201d support to his government\u2019s bid to ban under-16s from social media, saying world leaders were \u201capplauding\u201d the push. The government also said its digital ID won\u2019t be used to assure ages on social media, but when pressed could not point out in the under-16s ban legislation where it was specifically prohibited. Elon Musk\u2019s X warned the bill to ban under-16s from social media may not be lawful, and the company is reserving its legal rights. Julie Inman Grant, the Safety Commissioner said it was her role to \u201cenforce the laws\u201d, not endorse, and the under-16 social media age ban was a matter for the parliament. The Greens said they would wave through Labor\u2019s housing plan so they can \u201cfocus on campaigning for renters and against Peter Dutton at the next election\u201d. The expected power crunch has shifted to Thursday as a heatwave lingers over eastern Australia. The NSW Council of Civil Liberties says an \u201cextraordinary\u201d number of people were arrested at the Riding Tide climate protest in Newcastle yesterday, because of \u201cdraconian anti-protest laws\u201d in the state. A man has been charged after cars and buildings were damaged or vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney\u2019s east last week. Mayors of the areas home to Sydney\u2019s supersized housing precincts have been left \u201cblindsided\u201d after the NSW government announcing major zoning changes without first telling them. Six precincts were up for consideration and all had at least 1,000 additional homes added to their expected housing density in new zoning announced on Monday \u2013 except for the Kellyville and Bella Vista area, which had its total cut by three-quarters. The premier, Chris Minns, told reporters he thought that was a \u201creasonable compromise\u201d: The number of new homes being built in the Blacktown local government area is massive, far, far higher than Macquarie Park and Hornsby. The mayor of Blacktown, Brad Bunting, said the decision was \u201ca win for common sense\u201d and praised the government\u2019s decision. However, that precinct also reaches into the Hills shire, where the mayor, Michelle Byrne, was unhappy to have learned about the rezoning via morning media reports: It\u2019s disappointing that the minister has steamrolled council with this announcement. There are a lot of issues with this half-baked proposal that need to be addressed. Byrne said the finalised proposal had wiped housing growth from Blacktown and put all of the increase into the Hills. The City of Ryde initially issued a statement thanking the government for its consultative approach but in a subsequent statement said staff had been \u201cblindsided by today\u2019s announcement\u201d and had found \u201cmajor discrepancies\u201d between the government\u2019s announcement and departmental master-planning documents. The North Sydney mayor, Zo\u00eb Baker, also said she had not been notified ahead of the announcement for the Crows Nest precinct, slamming the ruled 3% minimum for affordable housing as \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d, while a Hornsby shire council spokesperson said the new development plan included a number of changes made without consulting the council. Queensland police are investigating the death of a child in Innisfail this afternoon. Officers responded to reports of a child found unresponsive in a vehicle about 1pm. Upon arrival, emergency services provided medical assistance, however the child was declared deceased. Investigations are continuing, and a report will be prepared for the coroner. Man dies at swimming hole in Royal national park A man has died after being pulled unresponsive from a swimming hole in the Royal national park in NSW. Emergency services were called to Winifred Falls at about 2.35pm after reports of a drowning. Officers attached to Sutherland shire police area command attended alongside NSW ambulance paramedics and found a man had been pulled from the water. The man was treated at the scene by paramedics, but he could not be revived. The man, who is yet to be formally identified, is believed to be aged in his 20s. Police established a crime scene and commenced inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the man\u2019s death. Liberal MP apologises for staffer filming in ministerial wing of Parliament House The Liberal MP Tony Pasin has apologised for a staff member filming in the corridor of Parliament House\u2019s ministerial wing, saying \u201cunbeknownst to me\u201d his employee filmed inside the infrastructure minister Catherine King\u2019s office. King made claims of \u201cdiscourtesy\u201d from Pasin in an interaction last week, where she alleged filming inside her office when Pasin and a staffer attended for a \u201cdrop-in\u201d session. Pasin was not in parliament on Thursday but a spokesperson said in a statement last week he \u201cdenies the accusations levelled against him by minister King\u201d. On Monday, the House of Representatives speaker, Milton Dick, said he had considered the matter but would not be referring it to the privileges committee. Pasin told the chamber that a new staff member of his had filmed him around Parliament House, \u201cincluding in the ministerial corridor\u201d. The MP conceded the filming was done \u201cin error\u201d but were \u201cin no way covert\u201d. \u201cI acknowledge the error. I note that I apologised to you, and through you to all occupants of this building. I have re-familiarised myself with the rules for media-related activities,\u201d Pasin said. But Pasin went on to deny that he filmed in King\u2019s ministerial suite, or that he downloaded the footage to a laptop. He maintained that, \u201cunbeknownst to me\u201d, his staffer continued filming as he entered King\u2019s office. \u201cOn returning to my office, and having been made aware of that footage, the member of my staff was directed to delete it,\u201d Pasin said. \u201cI have apologised to Minister King. Filming in her suite should not have occurred, and I accept responsibility for my staff member\u2019s error.\u201d King gave a short statement in response, saying \u201cAustralians do expect and deserve to see parliamentarians conduct themselves in a manner befitting this place. That goes to respect for each other.\u201d As we flagged last week \u2013 and updated here today \u2013 eastern Australia will face a pretty warm end to spring, with temperatures soaring. A few days ago, the forecasts had pointed to relief coming to eastern New South Wales at least by Wednesday. That looks more likely to be Friday, as the heatwave stalls a bit over the region. Penrith, in Sydney\u2019s west, can expect tops of 39C and 40C on Tuesday and Wednesday, with each daily update nudging the forecast higher it seems. Sea breezes should keep Sydney\u2019s CBD to maximums of 31C and 33C for those two days, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The mercury on Thursday, though, will still be nudging 30C in Sydney and 33C in Penrith. One consequence is that the power grid will be strained for a bit longer, particularly in NSW, although Queensland will be hoping its generators don\u2019t have any unplanned outages. The Australian Energy Market Operator had been forecasting the potential for blackouts on Wednesday afternoon in NSW, dubbed a lack of reserve level 3. That forecast was cancelled a little while ago, only for an LOR to be issued for Thursday afternoon. Now, it\u2019s likely the market will respond (that\u2019s the point of these alerts), but moving target, from Tuesday to Thursday, is a reminder of the limited spare generation capacity there is in the grid. Some will say \u201cnet zero policies are to blame\u201d. The fact that about 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants are facing planned or unplanned maintenance this week in eastern Australia seems to be the real culprit. An Australian injured in a West Bank shooting has called for an investigation into the incident. Watch the video here: Ranem Abu Izneid was studying in her room on 15 November at Al-Quds University in Abu Dis, in the West Bank east of Jerusalem, when she was hit by shrapnel after Israeli forces allegedly fired live rounds in her direction. The shrapnel caused severe injuries to her right eye, neck and chest. \u201cI want a transparent, full investigation on the situation,\u201d the Australian citizen says. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the help that I got from the Australian embassies, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d The Greens have released a statement saying they have waved through Labor\u2019s housing plan so they can \u201cfocus on campaigning for renters and against Peter Dutton at the next election\u201d. They said renters should grant them the balance of power at the next election if they \u201cwant to end tax handouts for property investors and an end to unlimited rent increases\u201d. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the party had \u201cpushed as far\u201d as it could: There comes a point where you\u2019ve pushed as far as you can. We tried hard to get Labor to shift on soaring rents and negative gearing, but we couldn\u2019t get there this time. We\u2019ll wave the housing bills through and take the fight to the next election, where we\u2019ll keep Peter Dutton out and then push Labor to act on unlimited rent rises and tax handouts to wealthy property investors. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day\u2019s news. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I\u2019ll hand over to Mostafa Rachwani to take you through the rest of today\u2019s news. The Greens are expected to give a press conference any minute now on their decision to help pass Labor\u2019s Help to Buy bill \u2013 stay tuned for all the details. \u2018We have to stamp out racism,\u2019 Thorpe says The independent senator Lidia Thorpe was also on Afternoon Briefing just now, discussing the racism inquiry she is moving in the Senate alongside the Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi. Thorpe said she had experienced racism in the workplace, and the Senate chamber, and \u201cprocedures do not know how to deal with the racism in the chamber\u201d. Asked if there were any prime offenders, Thorpe said: \u201cAbsolutely, there\u2019s quite a few.\u201d If it was any other workplace, this [wouldn\u2019t] be acceptable. We want the Senate through the vote we\u2019ll see this afternoon \u2013 and hopefully Labor does support this \u2013 if they want to change the behaviours in the Senate, it needs to be fair for everybody \u2026 I think that everyone needs to be held accountable for any racist slur in this workplace, whether it be this place or any other. We have to stamp out racism. It\u2019s a sickness. It makes people sick. And we are only complicit and we\u2019ll only continue to have a divided country if we don\u2019t deal with racism, and we have to stamp it out at all levels. King expects critical minerals collaboration with US to continue under Trump Just earlier, the resources minister, Madeleine King, was on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, asked about the future of critical minerals under a second Trump presidency. She said the work done on critical minerals has been \u201cextensive\u201d \u2013 and that Australia\u2019s geology is \u201cirrefutable\u201d. The other thing to remember is the work between Australia and the US on critical minerals began under the former Trump administration \u2026 It started with Donald Trump, it continued under President Joe Biden and I expect it to continue under the new Trump administration. If we can speak to the new US administration about how it affects other parts of our economy, well, we\u2019ll do that as it comes. Karen Andrews makes valedictory speech In parliament, the LNP MP Karen Andrews has been giving her valedictory speech. She was first elected to the lower house in 2010 and served as a cabinet member from 2018 to 2022. In April last year, Andrews quit the shadow frontbench and announced she would retire at the next election. This afternoon, she has told the parliament: As I leave parliament, I do so with a deep sense of pride in what has been accomplished and with enormous gratitude for the opportunity to serve. The work that we do in this place matters, it matters a lot, and the impact that we have on the lives of Australians is something that I have always taken seriously and will never, ever forget. Andrews says that when was appointed to cabinet, she \u201cbecame the first female federal cabinet minister from Queensland\u201d. Earlier this afternoon, the Labor MP Brian Mitchell gave his valedictory speech. Also expected to deliver their valedictory speeches this afternoon are the Liberal MP Gavin Pearce, Nationals MP David Gillespie and LNP MP Warren Entsch. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, and housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, have called a press conference for 4.30pm. Guardian Australia understands the Greens will announce they have decided to help the government pass its Help to Buy bill establishing a federal shared equity scheme. The scheme allows the government to contribute 30% of the purchase price of a home for those who earn under the income threshold, or 40% for a new-build \u2013 reducing the cost for the homebuyer. This follows months of Labor refusing to negotiate with the Greens. On one view, the minor party\u2019s decision rewards the Albanese government\u2019s take it or leave it approach. On another view, it avoids walking into Labor\u2019s trap of painting the Greens as blockers. Last Friday the Greens substantially reduced their demands, abandoning calls to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax in favour of calling for an extra 25,000 social and affordable homes. The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, refused. It appears the Greens have blinked. Heatwave breaks a few records across the country\u2019s south-east, BoM says Energy authorities, as we\u2019ve noted in today\u2019s article and on this fine blog, face a nervous couple of days in NSW and Queensland as searing temperatures look set to strain the power grid. We\u2019ll keep an eye on temperature records (can\u2019t be many times Penrith in western Sydney has had seven days in a row above 30C in November, as is forecast) but the present heatwave already has the Bureau of Meteorology dusting off a few records. Coonawarra in south-east South Australia had a November maximum temperature record (40 years of records), with its 37.9C on Friday pipping the previous high by 0.1C. Essendon airport, meanwhile, clocked up two days (37.1C and 37.5C) on Friday and Saturday, the first time that site had two November days in a row above 37C. (It\u2019s got 54 years of records.) More generally, Melbourne had its first back-to-back November days above 35C since 2009, BoM said. Mount Gambier in south-east South Australia was among the sites to set their highest minimum November temperatures, with 23.4C on Saturday eclipsing a previous high-low (so to speak) of 22.7C. That site has 80 years of records. Ballarat aerodrome, with 67 years of records, similarly set a record high minimum for November with 22.9C, about 0.8C above the previous high. Behind the heatwave, meanwhile, came some heavy falls. A BoM spokesperson said: A number of stations stretching from central South Australia to north-west Victoria had their wettest two-day rainfall total in November for at least 10 years. Bob Katter marks half-century as a politician A missile shield across northern Australia and training school kids in how to use rifles are just a couple of Bob Katter\u2019s policy ideas that may never see the light of day. As AAP reports, the renegade veteran MP is celebrating 50 consecutive years in public office. He spent 20 years as a Queensland state MP before serving the past three decades in federal parliament as the MP for the regional electorate of Kennedy. Katter spent six years at university without a degree, was expelled twice from one school, remained qualified to move from a sergeant to an officer in the army reserves for 10 years without doing so and was the longest-serving Queensland parliament backbencher. He thanked his wife, Suzie, who attended a ceremony at federal parliament today, alongside his five children and several grandchildren. Anthony Albanese and the speaker, Milton Dick, gifted the Queensland MP a book of all his speeches from parliament. Katter\u2019s father was also the member for Kennedy between 1966 and 1990, while his son Robbie was first elected to the Queensland state parliament in 2012. Question time concludes With that, question time has wrapped up for today. PM asked why the blanket ban on gambling ads has been abandoned The independent MP Allegra Spender has asked why the government has abandoned its promise to put a ban on gambling advertisements? The prime minister responds that \u201cwe have done more in two years to tackle gambling harms than any other government since federation\u201d. We have also made it very clear that the status quo is untenable, but we continue to engage with stakeholders on our response to what is an important issue. Anthony Albanese instead points to a number of measures the government has taken \u2013 including mandatory customer ID verification for online wagering, banning the use of credit cards for online wagering, taglines in gambling advertising, funding for specialist financial counselling and nationally consistent staff training. Digital ID framework will not be used for age assurance, Rowland says Back at question time, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, takes a dixer on the under-16s social media ban bill, and says: We have made clear the digital ID framework is not in scope and would not be used for age assurance. The government is also providing additional resources to the information commissioner to ensure that it is equipped to oversee this legislation when it comes to privacy. Elon Musk\u2019s X has warned the bill to ban under-16s from social media may not be lawful, and the company is reserving its legal rights. In a written submission to the one-day inquiry on the bill, X said: We have serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill, including its compatibility with other regulations and laws, including international human rights treaties to which Australia is a signatory. The social media platform, which has already had successful legal tussles with the eSafety commissioner in recent years, said while it was examining age assurance options for X, the bill would have negative impacts on the rights of children and young people, and would also not be effective. The bill is vague and lacks fundamental definitions which are necessary to provide certainty and clarity to those providers that it seeks to regulate, especially alarming in the context that the Bill is setting up a punitive regime. Musk last week posted on X that the bill was a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to control all Australians\u2019 access to the internet. Snapchat\u2019s parent company, Snap, said the bill wasn\u2019t backed by experts: Many experts have highlighted the significant unintended consequences of this legislation, notably that it could deny young people access to valuable mental health and wellbeing resources, while potentially driving them toward less regulated and more dangerous online spaces than the mainstream, highly regulated platforms covered by the bill. Guardian Australia understands the committee received more than 15,000 submissions in the one day the committee was accepting submissions. So far just 73 have been published online. \u2018I hope that the member for Sturt has apologised to his constituents for voting against energy relief,\u2019 PM says The Liberal MP James Stevens has asked a question about increasing energy prices. Anthony Albanese responds that the \u201cquestion for the member for Sturt, is why [he] voted against energy price relief not once, but twice\u201d. I hope that the member for Sturt has apologised to his constituents for voting against the energy relief scheme \u2026 Your party policy is to invest unknown billions of their taxpayer dollars in publicly owned nuclear reactors sometime in the 2040s, and between [then], there is no plan whatsoever to secure security of energy supply. Labor \u2018tinkering around the edges\u2019 on online gambling ban, Hanson-Young says The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has accused the Labor government of \u201ctinkering around the edges\u201d almost 18 months after a parliamentary report recommended a complete ban on online gambling. Yesterday, Labor revealed it would not release its online gambling legislation, with Penny Wong telling Senate question time the government has a \u201cvery full agenda\u201d and is focusing on legislation it can pass. Hanson-Young then asks: Will the government rule out taking donations or having more dinners, lunches, birthday celebrations with the gambling lobby before you act on banning the ads? Wong looks confused. The Senate president, Sue Lines, jumps in to confirm the question does not fall into Wong\u2019s ministerial responsibility. Wong gives it a shot anyway: I don\u2019t know who is having birthday celebrations, but I don\u2019t think people having birthday celebrations with lobbyists would be anyone\u2019s idea of fun, to be honest with you \u2026 What I would say is in relation to donations, Senator Farrell has worked tirelessly across the parliament on this, and I would invite Senator Hanson-Young to support the legislation in the parliament which deals with donations. Officials working with families to bring Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles home, PM says The independent MP for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, has asked a question about the death of Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles \u2013 and what the government is doing to help the families in bringing their bodies home. The prime minister says Australians are \u201cdevastated\u201d at the \u201ctragic loss of these two young women\u201d. I know all Australians think of their families at this moment who are facing the grief which is every parent\u2019s nightmare. There is no crueller arithmetic than adding up the years not lived, the potential not fulfilled, the dreams not lived or that might have been. My government continues to support Holly and Bianca\u2019s families, just as we continue our efforts with local authorities on investigations into this tragedy. Officials are working closely with Bianca and Holly\u2019s family to bring them home. He says Australian officials in Laos and Thailand are working closely with local authorities, including an offer of assistance from the Australian federal police. Our officials have also brought together representatives from other countries who [have] citizens impacted \u2026 We want to work with other governments based upon this experience to see whether any action can be taken. Cop29 agreements have zero cost, Bowen says The shadow climate minister, Ted O\u2019Brien, has asked the PM how much taxpayer money the government has committed to spend on agreements arising from Cop29. Chris Bowen gets up to respond, and answers: \u201cZero.\u201d Last week, the government was requested by other governments to enter into certain agreements and arrangements, which we did agree to. We joined, for example, the global energy and storage pledge, which is a very good thing to do. We joined the call to action for no new coal at the request of and suggestion of the United Kingdom government, and we signed the Australia-UK climate and energy partnership \u2026 We work with governments across the board on renewable energy, agreements those opposite could not [sign and] enter into, and the member for Fairfax implies there was a cost \u2013 there was zero cost. Coalition \u2018delivers nothing but slogans\u2019 on energy prices, Bowen says The Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh has asked how small businesses are \u201cmeant to survive under this energy and cost-of-living crisis\u201d? The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, responds that the government has delivered two rounds of energy bill relief \u201copposed by those opposite\u201d. We\u2019re getting on with the job of practical projects to small businesses, as well as [the] energy bill relief we deliver, while the opposition delivers nothing but slogans. Coalition \u2018wants to press the pause button\u2019 on renewables, PM says The Nationals MP Sam Birrell has asked about a promised $275 reduction in power bills, and says the government has broken a promise by not delivering on this. Anthony Albanese says the government is delivering on its commitment to renewable energy \u2013 and \u201cwe know that those opposite want to have a debate about our plan for renewables firmed by gas [compared] with their plan for, I don\u2019t know what, between now and the 2040s when nuclear will come in\u201d. When we\u2019re talking about a plan to go forward as the world, that plan is being driven by renewables and the shift that\u2019s happening with the transition to clean energy, that is what is happening \u2026 The United States added 39 gigawatts of new renewables last year and no nuclear. And last year, China added 217 gigawatts of new renewables and only one gigawatt of new nuclear. The reason why the world is transitioning to clean energy is because they understand not only is that good for the environment, it is also good for their economies, and that is why Australia is a part of that global transition that is occurring. Those opposite wants to press the pause button \u2026 \u2018Quite outrageous\u2019: claims shoppers charged more for unpacked fruit and vegetables than for plastic-wrapped produce The independent MP Monique Ryan has asked the environment minister about claims supermarkets have been found charging more for unpacked fruit and vegetables than for plastic-wrapped produce. How is the government holding supermarkets to account for this? Tanya Plibersek responds that it is \u201cquite outrageous that the supermarkets are actually making it more expensive for families to do the right thing when they\u2019re doing their shopping\u201d. Bananas come in their own packaging, and oranges, in their own packaging, they do not need to be wrapped in plastic as well. Plibersek says the supermarkets have been too slow to reinitiate the collection of soft plastics as well. We\u2019re also \u2026 working with state and territory governments on packaging regulation. We need to create less of this waste in the first place. We need to make sure we\u2019re making demands on packaging makers, like upping the level of recycled content and packaging, reducing unnecessary packaging, getting rid of those particularly bad additives. The minister points to the plastics treaty being negotiated in South Korea at the moment, and says talks are in their final stages. Australia has been advocating very strongly for an ambitious treaty that restricts the production of new plastic and focuses much more on recycling the plastic that we\u2019ve already got in circulation globally. We are absolutely determined to reduce the amount of plastic being used. The manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher, has asked how the public can take the government seriously on climate change when emissions have gone up? The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, takes aim at the opposition for \u201cpresid[ing] over 10 years of denial and delay [and not telling] the Australian people what [its] 2030 target is [and saying] we should rely more on coal and gas while we wait decades for nuclear to come forward\u201d. As the prime minister has foreshadowed, this week we will release the annual climate change statement in accordance with the act. That is the best practice in terms of transparency and accountability when it comes to emission reductions. I will release the Climate Change Authority annual progress report, which I have received, and will table in the house \u2026 I look forward to the opposition\u2019s detailed policy response, which will outline \u2013 no doubt \u2013 full costings of their nuclear plan, no doubt, the emissions impact of their nuclear plan \u2026 Coalition quizzes Labor\u2019s future plans on misinformation bill Over in the Senate, Coalition senators are pressing the federal government over whether it plans to revive the recently dumped mis- and disinformation bill after the next election. The Senate\u2019s government leader, Penny Wong, is asked by the Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie whether Labor would count on support from the Greens to pass it in the future. Wong says she is advised Labor will not be proceeding with the bill due to a lack of support in the upper house and has no plans to reintroduce it. McKenzie then asks: Given the Albanese Labor government can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, say whether it will pursue this bill again or if it would do a deal with the Greens following the next election, how [are] the thousands of Australians who oppose this bill meant to think anything other than it being a delaying tactic by Labor rather than a genuine withdrawal? Wong responds: There has been more misinformation \u2026 you are desperate for a scare campaign, aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t want to listen to what I have to say. But what I would say to you, Senator McKenzie, is there is an issue \u2026 disinformation and misinformation in our democracy, and those of us who care about democratic institutions, including the few on [the opposition side] who do care about democratic institutions, should work with the government working out how we protect our democracy against disinformation and misinformation. That would be the responsible thing to do. Sussan Ley questions government\u2019s 2035 emissions reduction target The acting opposition leader, Sussan Ley, gets up to ask the first question, on emissions reduction targets. She asks why the government is keeping its 2035 target a secret? Anthony Albanese says that when the target of 43% by 2030 was passed, one provision was that the Climate Change Authority needed to provide advice on future targets. That is the law \u2026 For those opposite, who do not have a 2030 target, to actually stand up and say what is your target for 2035? That is after 2030, it is just extraordinary \u2026 We are on track to achieving the targets we have established. The O\u2019Connor MP Rick Wilson is sent out under 94a, just minutes into question time. The PM is back on his feet and goes on to say: \u201cThe short answer is I\u2019m complying with the law.\u201d Those opposite don\u2019t have a target for 2030, opposed net zero by 2050, and have a nuclear plan sometime in the 2040s, and no idea how you keep the reliability of energy supply in the meantime. None. No idea, no costing, no plan. The speaker, Milton Dick, says that Parliament House will be illuminated in orange at 7.30pm tonight to mark 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. Ley marks International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women The acting opposition leader, Sussan Ley, is also saying a few words to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. She speaks of Isla Bell, and says: [She] was just 19 and had her whole life ahead of her. It is alleged that she was bashed to death in an apartment in Melbourne. Her body was [allegedly] loaded into a fridge and moved several times before being dumped. On the day that [she] should have been celebrating her 20th birthday, Isla Bell\u2019s body was [allegedly] being hidden from view by men seeking to hide their crimes. The sad fact is that these events, the killing of women and girls, has been a constant presence for as long as I can remember. Countless women and girls have been killed, attacked and coerced and manipulated \u2026 Women should feel safe everywhere, always. They should feel safe in their homes and where matters of domestic violence arise, they should feel safe and supported in their decision-making, including when leaving a violent relationship. Question time has begun in the House of Representatives, where the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, is representing Peter Dutton \u2013 who is absent today for family reasons. Anthony Albanese has begun by marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women: We think of every woman robbed of the future she had every right to live, every death is its own universe of devastation. We think of all who live or grow up in the shadow of violence. We think of those who live with abuse, with fear, and we think of all the First Nations women and children who have been murdered or disappeared. This is a stain upon the soul of our nation [that] cannot stand \u2026 We all feel anger [at] all stories we read on the page. But rather than let this overwhelm us, we must be energised to keep acting and working to change. The prime minister says that the \u201cfear of violence should not be a normal nor accepted part of womanhood\u201d. Labor\u2019s three migration bills, explained The Albanese government has a trio of migration bills before parliament to facilitate the removal of non-citizens from Australia, including paying third countries to take them and creating powers to confiscate mobile phones in detention. The bills are listed to be debated on Wednesday and Guardian Australia understands that the Coalition and Labor are closing in on a deal to pass all three. What is in them, and what new powers would the government gain? You can read the full explainer below: Question time to begin shortly Today seems to have just flown by \u2013 it\u2019s nearly 2pm, which means question time in the House of Representatives is due to begin in about 10 minutes. Grab a coffee, and get ready \u2013 we\u2019ll bring you all the key developments as they happen. Russian ambassador claims Russian media more liberal than Australia\u2019s The Russian ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, was on ABC radio earlier this morning, where he made a number of eyebrow-raising claims, including that Russian media was more liberal than Australia\u2019s. The Moscow envoy told the ABC Radio National host Steve Cannane that responsibility for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine lay \u201csquarely on the west\u201d. On credible claims of torture by Russians on Ukrainians in detention found by the UN, Pavlovsky said it was \u201cpropaganda\u201d and claimed, without evidence, the UN\u2019s reports were \u201cbiased\u201d. Asked whether he believed Russian forces were torturing Ukrainians in occupied territory, Pavlovsky said he didn\u2019t \u201caccept it as a yes or no question\u201d. I don\u2019t accept it, because reality is much more complicated than the ABC wants to make it. Cannane said Pavlovsky couldn\u2019t spread \u201cfalse information\u201d about the Russian military without being charged with criminal offences under Russian law. The ambassador added Russia was \u201cmuch more liberal\u201d than Australia, referencing Labor\u2019s recent dumping of the mis- and disinformation bill. Pavlovsky said: The world needs responsible and reasonable politicians. Unfortunately, Australian politicians do not qualify. Read more from our colleagues in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Greens and Labor both accuse each other of working with Dutton on housing The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, gave a doorstop this morning about housing legislation, after the government rejected the Greens\u2019 latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy legislation (see earlier post). According to a transcript from his office, Bandt argued that Labor is \u201cmore interested in picking a fight with the Greens than working with us to tackle the rental and housing crisis\u201d. Going into the final week of parliament, Labor\u2019s approach is to pick a fight with the Greens and do deals with Peter Dutton. That is very distressing. Labor has also been accusing the Greens of working with Dutton over housing. Bandt argued that for Labor, it is \u201ctheir way or the highway\u201d. We put forward some food faith proposals to the government. Our proposals were based on the government\u2019s own model. We\u2019ll have a look now at what to do about the legislation when it comes up tomorrow, but what\u2019s clear is that Labor has given up on the millions of renters who are struggling with soaring rent increases. Claim and counterclaim on 25,000 extra social and affordable housing units Labor is sticking by the housing minister Clare O\u2019Neil\u2019s claim that directing the Housing Australia Future Fund to invest in 25,000 social and affordable homes would be unlawful. The basis for that claim is that the Greens\u2019 demand was to fund providers of a particular 25,000 units that had applied to the Haff in an earlier round. On that view, it is no answer for the Greens to note a general ability to set the Haff\u2019s strategy and direction. Tink targets Labor for phone ban in detention The independent MP Kylea Tink has also detected some slippage on the Labor side when it comes to banning phones in detention. In a statement she just sent out, Tink noted that in 2020 Labor\u2019s Andrew Giles said there was \u201cno justification for blanket prohibitions\u201d, while Josh Burns said Peter Dutton\u2019s 2020 bill was \u201cnot about a proportionate response from government but about cruelty and politics\u201d. Tink said: What has changed, other than Labor running scared of Peter Dutton? While Labor has been inching closer to the Coalition on immigration policy, they are no longer trying to hide the fact that their immigration policies are a \u2018cut and paste\u2019 of Peter Dutton\u2019s. Mobile phones are a lifeline for people in immigration detention helping them to communicate with family, friends and the outside world. This is an attempt by Labor to silence a Peter Dutton scare campaign on immigration while silencing any criticism from detainees \u2013 preventing them from speaking to journalists, or advocates. Although, given Dan Tehan has said the Coalition supports the bill, it will pass easily \u2013 no need to convince the crossbench now. What\u2019s stopping children from using VPNs to bypass social media age ban? The communications department has hinted at lawsuits against tech companies if teen users are using virtual private network connections to bypass the age assurance law by making their connection to the platform appear to be coming from outside Australia, where the age assurance requirement would not apply. The LNP senator Matt Canavan asks the social media inquiry: Will kids just be able to use a VPN? What\u2019s stopping someone just using a VPN? Department first assistant secretary for digital platforms, Sarah Vandenbroek, says: Well, that comes back to questions of extraterritoriality and ensuring that the [eSafety] commissioner continues to be supported in any litigation that\u2019s undertaken. The department deputy secretary, James Chisholm, says platforms would also be expected to check against information on the platform, such as if a user purporting to be outside Australia is posting photos from Bondi beach. The shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, has revealed the Coalition will support Labor\u2019s bill creating powers to confiscate drugs and mobile phones in detention. The phone ban bill, along with the migration amendment bill and Labor\u2019s first deportation bill are all listed for debate on Wednesday. Guardian Australia understands that the parties are close to a deal on all three. But Tehan said the Coalition would support the phone ban bill without amendment. In his remarks, he targeted Andrew Giles, Peter Khalil and Josh Burns for comments they made in 2020 opposing a similar bill proposed by the Coalition, such as Giles describing it as a solution in search of a problem. However, Labor\u2019s bill has greater safeguards including requiring immigration detainees be given alternative means of communication if their phones are confiscated. It\u2019s a good development that the Coalition hasn\u2019t tried to toughen this up in a way that makes the law vulnerable to challenge \u2013 as occurred on the ankle bracelet and curfew visa conditions. More context on claim Greens\u2019 proposed housing concession \u2018unlawful\u2019 Earlier this morning, the housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, said that the Greens\u2019 proposed concessions on the Help to Buy bill (which the government didn\u2019t agree to) were \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d. She argued that one of the Greens\u2019 proposals would have required her to direct Housing Australia to fund homes it has decided not to fund, \u201cand that is against the law\u201d. For a bit more context on those claims: While the minister cannot direct Housing Australia on particular projects, the minister can give direction about strategy and policy \u2013 including undertaking further funding rounds. The Greens\u2019 proposal was for the government to provide additional funding to Housing Australia to unlock more social and affordable homes. Forrest calls for \u2018plastic tax\u2019 as global treaty to end plastic pollution negotiated The Australian businessman Andrew Forrest has called for a \u201cplastic tax\u201d as more than 175 countries \u2013 including Australia \u2013 negotiate a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution in Busan, South Korea. A \u201cpolymer premium\u201d applied as a small price per tonne on plastic production could be used to fund waste management and further research as well as cleaning up past pollution, Forrest wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald. Environmental group WWF Australia said the treaty was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a global solution to the worsening crisis, with plastic pollution expected to triple by 2040. Kate Noble, the WWF plastic policy manager, said: Plastic pollution is a global scourge but its impact across Oceania \u2013 a large continent that is predominantly oceans, and home to some of the world\u2019s most incredible biodiversity and pristine marine environments \u2013 is particularly horrific. WWF has urged governments to include explicit text in the treaty to ban and phase out the most harmful plastic products, mandatory product design requirements to ensure remaining products are safe and easy to reuse and recycle, and funding and mechanisms for strengthening the treaty over time. Negotiations conclude on 1 December. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has made a speech in the House of Representatives calling for the parliament to give \u201cunanimous\u201d support to his government\u2019s bid to ban under-16s from social media, after Guardian Australia this morning reported a simmering concern among some Coalition MPs about the rushed legislation. The Nationals MP Keith Pitt and some colleagues are raising issues about the fact children can work at age 14, but wouldn\u2019t be able to go on Facebook until 16 \u2013 as well as concerns about the legislation being rammed through parliament within a week with only a token Senate inquiry. The Nine newspapers also reported the Liberal MP Garth Hamilton had voiced concerns. In an address to the house just now, Albanese claimed world leaders in North America, Europe and New Zealand had recently told him \u201cthey are all looking at what we are doing, and they are applauding what we are doing in showing leadership in this area\u201d. Defending the decision to set the age limit at 16, Albanese said the restriction was in place because \u201cas we develop and mature, we\u2019re better at spotting the fakes and the dangers\u201d. We build up the mental resilience to ignore the worst of the nastiness. We learn the difference between online followers and true and real friends, we learn not to measure ourselves and our lives against impossible standards or a fake image of perfection. If children don\u2019t have that chance to learn, if they don\u2019t have the grounding of real experiences and real friendships to support, if they fall into the vortex of thinking what happens online is all that matters, then we know the consequences can be devastating. The PM went on to say his bill was \u201cworthy of the unanimous support of this parliament\u201d. NSW\u2019s forecast power shortfall reduced but conditions remain \u2018tight\u2019 Earlier this morning, we noted that the Australian Energy Market Operator had issued an alert for a pretty big potential supply gap in NSW on Wednesday afternoon, and it was seeking a response from the market. Well, it has received some of that desired response. So instead of 1700 megawatts (about the size of the now closed Liddell power station when it was having a good day), the forecast supply gap has been cut to 351MW. And instead of an eight-hour stint when supply might not meet demand (aka \u201cblackouts\u201d), the period has shrunk to five hours from 4pm (Aedt) to 9pm. Aemo said in a statement: High temperatures and strong electricity demand, combined with some generation outages, are causing tight electricity supply forecasts in New South Wales tomorrow and Wednesday afternoon. \u201cAemo has alerted the energy industry and is working with power station operators and transmission businesses to boost electricity availability,\u201d adding that if the market\u2019s response is inadequate, it will take \u201cactions\u201d to ensure supply. And, as we noted, Queensland also faces \u201ctight electricity reserves\u201d on Wednesday afternoon. Hopefully they don\u2019t get tighter too. NSW holding off any official call for power use reduction as mercury climbs As noted in an earlier post, the electricity grid in parts of eastern Australia faces strains this week as a low- to severe-intensity heatwave sweeps eastwards. NSW\u2019s energy minister Penny Sharpe told a media conference in Sydney (mostly about the fire dangers of lithium batteries) that the \u201cfirst thing\u201d is for people to take care of themselves in the coming heat. (Parts of western Sydney are expected to reach 38C-39C tops tomorrow and Wednesday.) You should drink water, you should check in on neighbors, and you should think about whether you need to walk out in the middle of the day in the beating hot sun. Sharpe, though, said the Australian Energy Market Operator was making the call on strains to the power grid although \u201cwe\u2019re obviously keeping a close eye on it\u201d. While not giving \u201cany official advice at this point,\u201d the minister said people consider \u201con really hot days\u201d whether every single light needed to be in the house or whether air conditioner really needed to be set at 19C say. There are some big gaps for Aemo to fill, though, so we\u2019ll be watching closely too. Meanwhile, fire danger risks in NSW will be elevated in some regions early this week as the mercury climbs. The likelihood of light winds and the fact the landscape hasn\u2019t dried out - yet - will spare the state more severe fire conditions this time around. Mis- and disinformation bill withdrawn in the Senate Just earlier this morning, the government\u2019s mis- and disinformation bill was officially withdrawn in the Senate. The opposition leader Peter Dutton welcomed the move in a post to X, saying this is \u201ca win for free speech for our democracy\u201d. He also called on Labor to \u201crule out bringing this legislation back, now or after the next election.\u201d Nationals senator Matt Canavan wrote that it was \u201cthe most anti-democratic law ever introduced to the Australian parliament.\u201d Greens senator David Shoebridge also wrote on X that it was a good outcome: Good outcome. Now do the social media age ban. A man has been charged after cars and buildings were damaged or vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney\u2019s east last week. Just after midnight on Thursday, emergency services responded to reports of a vehicle on fire on Wellington Street in Woollahra. This vehicle and a further nine vehicles parked along Wellington Street, Tara Street, Fullerton Street and Ocean Street were also allegedly graffitied. Another vehicle allegedly received minor damage as a result of the fire. Police estimate the total value of the damage to be in excess of $70,000. Three buildings on Ocean Street and Fullerton Street were also allegedly graffitied. At this time, the total estimated value of the damage is between $20,000 to $30,000. Following an investigation under Strike Force Mylor, a 20-year-old man from Mascot was arrested at around 3:50am this morning at Sydney airport. He was taken to Mascot police station and charged with 21 offences: Fourteen counts of destroying or damaging property. Three counts of entering a building or land with intent to commit an indictable offence. One count of destroying property in company using fire to the value of more than $5,000. One count of destroying property in company using fire to the value of less than $2,000. One count of having a blackened or disguised face with the intent to commit an indictable offence. One count of behaving in an offensive manner in or near a public place or school. He was refused bail and is due to appear in the Downing Centre local court today. Hanson-Young: \u2018You\u2019re asking us to ram through a piece of legislation without any evidence\u2019 A theme of hearing on the proposed under-16s social media ban is around the short timeframe the government is expecting the Senate to review the bill. Today\u2019s hearing is just three hours long and is the only examination of the legislation. The comms department\u2019s deputy secretary James Chisholm was asked by the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young why the government had not released the review into the Online Safety Act given it goes to many of the issues that the age ban bill aims to address. Chisholm said the timing of the release was a matter for the minister. Hanson-Young said: This is why this is such a joke. A piece of legislation is being rammed through that relates directly to the issues that were raised in this review.... You\u2019ve just said a whole lot of recommendations. It\u2019s been kept secret from the public, secret from the Senate, and you\u2019re asking us to ram through a piece of legislation without any evidence. The federal government has said its digital ID won\u2019t be used to assure ages on social media, but when pressed could not point out in the under-16s ban legislation where it was specifically prohibited. The infrastructure department\u2019s first assistant secretary for digital platforms Sarah Vandenbroek said: I know there have been questions raised in a few areas about whether there\u2019s any linkage here to the government\u2019s digital ID system. And to be clear, there is no linkage. That is not the intention. The trial will look at the different methodologies and assess not just their accuracy, but also their security and privacy settings to see which of those technologies might be considered a reasonable step. But when asked by Nationals senator Matt Canavan about where specifically the legislation rules it out, the department indicated there was no specific exclusion in the bill. Canavan: Can you point me to the bid in the legislation which restricts the eSafety commissioner from designating digital ID as a means of age verification ... Once it goes through the Senate, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t get to touch it again. Is there anything in the law that says that? Department deputy secretary James Chisholm: Nothing in this law that says that. The NSW Council of Civil Liberties says an \u201cextraordinary\u201d number of people were arrested at the Riding Tide climate protest in Newcastle yesterday, because of \u201cdraconian anti-protest laws\u201d in the state. Almost 200 people were arrested yesterday after pausing activity at the Newcastle port, the world\u2019s biggest coal port. In a statement, the council president, Timothy Roberts, said the NSW government\u2019s \u201cefforts to stop protests and criminalise and demonise protesters at all costs should be of deep concern to all\u201d. Where to deploy police resources is a decision for the NSW government and the police. They have chosen to use these resources against peaceful protesters in defence of the fossil fuel industry. Paddling a kayak in the Port of Newcastle is not an offence, people do it every day safely without hundreds of police officers. A decision was made to protect the safe passage of the vessels over the protection of people exercising their democratic rights to protest. We are living in extraordinary times. Our democracy will not irrevocably be damaged in one foul swoop \u2013 it will be a slow bleed, a death by a thousand tranches of repressive legislation, and by thousands of arrests of people standing up in defence of their civil liberties. Watch: More from the under-16s social media ban inquiry Here\u2019s another video from the inquiry this morning into the bill to ban under-16s from social media. Questions over which platforms will be included in social media ban for children The digital industry group Digi says it is a \u201cserious flaw\u201d in the under-16s social media ban bill that it\u2019s not clear which platforms it will apply to, including YouTube. The detail over which platforms are covered is determined by the minister through legislative instrument, and allows a lot of discretion over what is included and what is not. Digi\u2019s policy director Dr Jennifery Duxbury said this was a serious flaw in the bill: The bill doesn\u2019t make it clear who is in or out of scope. And that\u2019s, you know, to us, that is a really serious flaw in the bill, but it is absolutely unclear who is in or out, and we don\u2019t know what criteria will be used to determine these exemptions. The explanatory memorandum suggests that some services will be out of scope, but that will occur until a future date, and that date is unknown. Platforms can\u2019t provide teens mental health support, inquiry told Here\u2019s a video from the inquiry into the under-16s social media age ban this morning: Industry group cops heat at inquiry in absence of social media platforms Meta, TikTok, X and other platforms are not at the inquiry on the social media ban for under-16s today, so industry group Digi is copping the heat from politicians on their behalf. Here\u2019s a flavour of that today. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson: Grieving families such as Matt and Kelly Howard, whose daughter Charlotte took her own life, and Rob Evans, whose daughter Liv was only 15 when she died, have been campaigning for social media age limits. Can you please explain to those parents and to other parents who\u2019ve lost their children why you are right and they are wrong? Digi managing director Sunita Bose: These are absolutely tragic events, and as a parent of two myself, I cannot imagine anything worse. We must remain focused on how we protect young people online without cutting them off from the connection and the mental health support that previous witnesses have discussed today, we do this by teaching young people how to safely navigate online spaces, how to seek help. One of the risks we\u2019re concerned about is that while the mainstream digital platforms are far from perfect, we have to remember that these are the services that do have safety guard rails. They do work with the eSafety Commissioner, and in young people\u2019s determination to get online and to connect with others, there is a risk that they will go to darker, less safe, less regulated online spaces where they won\u2019t be able to seek that help, and they may be unwilling to share with a parent that they\u2019ve done so. The deputy prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, is suing her boss and the government, after it failed to resolve the employment stalemate that has seen her locked out of her office since May. Tarnawsky has filed a claim for adverse action under the Fair Work Act, naming the Commonwealth, her boss Richard Marles and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff Tim Gartrell as respondents. The claim alleges victimisation for having complained about bullying. Tarnawsky has said the alleged bullying did not involve Marles himself. Tarnawsky is alleging that Gartrell was involved in the commonwealth\u2019s contraventions. She is not alleging Gartrell was involved in bullying. Making a statement at Parliament House this morning, six weeks after she went public about her employment situation, Tarnawsky said \u201cgood exits\u201d from senior jobs in politics \u201care possible\u201d. It should not be unreasonable for any of us to expect to depart with dignity, to walk away better from our time working in this building. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed Tarnawsky had not had direct contact with Marles since May, after she raised allegations with him about bullying within his office and he told her to find another job. Marles told parliament in October that Tarnawsky was \u201ca wonderful person\u201d, he felt \u201cdeeply sad\u201d about the situation but because of legal processes, he could not comment further. Those processes were formalised today though Tarnawsky\u2019s court action. Tarnawsky\u2019s lawyer, Marque Lawyers managing partner Michael Bradley, said Tarnawsky would be seeking compensation. He alleged she was \u201cpunished \u2026 in a state of limbo, frozen out for more than 200 days now\u201d. A recovering gambling addict who testified before a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm has also criticised the government\u2019s decision to delay advertising reforms. Mark Kempster has banned himself for being directly contacted by bookies, but over the last two years, some have still encouraged him to return to gambling. He now works with the Alliance for Gambling Reform: It\u2019s been 20 months since I gave evidence to this inquiry. The Albanese government has had that entire time to try and regulate a completely broken, predatory industry that is ruining Australians every day. It\u2019s unfathomable this has now been delayed again. Every week I get messages and calls from people falling into addiction and every one of them feels utterly trapped by the industry. They all feel they can not get away from the advertising of online gambling. Kempster has called on the government to honour the legacy of the late Labor MP, Peta Murphy, who led a bipartisan parliamentary inquiry that recommended a total ban. Murphy died in late 2023. Peta Murphy provided the government with an overwhelming comprehensive guide on how to help and protect people like me. Yet her party is doing everything they can to dismiss her legacy by continually kicking the can down the road. Earlier (see post), Nationals leader David Littleproud said it was \u201cdangerous to conflate digital ID\u201d with the under-16s social media ban. But Nationals senator Matt Canavan has argued in a post to X that there is \u201cnot an OUTRIGHT ban on social media companies retaining the information they collect to verify your age\u201d in the bill. He wrote: Keep in mind, ALL users will have to verify the age even though the ban only applies to children under 16. But as long as they have your \u201cconsent\u201d, they can use your identity docs for other purposes or even to disclose to others. There are some constraints, the consent must be voluntary, informed, current, specific and unambiguous. But this could possibly be just a checkbox that many will not understand the implications of. Inquiry hears that children will work around social media ban, as concerns raised about age assurance and privacy The committee examining the under-16s social media ban bill has heard that children will work around the ban, and it will mean every Australian will have to have their age checked. Project Rockit CEO Lucy Thomas said requiring age assurance for all Australians raises privacy concerns. Nationals senator Matt Canavan warned that age assurance could potentially push older people off social media if forced to grapple with age assurance technology. Sunita Bose, managing director of Digi \u2013 the industry group for the platforms including Meta and Snapchat, said the assurance process would affect everyone: To verifiably know whether someone is 14 or 40, young people and adults alike will need to take regular actions like providing an ID, an image of their face, or link to myGovID. The community needs to be consulted on their willingness to provide more personal information every time they use one of these services. Thorpe and Faruqi to ask Senate to investigate alleged racism and sexism in parliament Overnight, Josh Butler reported exclusively that Lidia Thorpe and Mehreen Faruqi will ask the Senate\u2019s procedure committee to investigate racism and sexism in federal parliament \u2013 raising concerns about \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and how women of colour are treated in politics. Thorpe and Faruqi are expected to give a press conference on this at 11am AEDT \u2013 we\u2019ll bring you the latest on this shortly. In the meantime, you can read Josh\u2019s story in full below: Project Rockit CEO Lucy Thomas has been using her time in the under-16s social media ban hearing to read out quotes from young people given they are \u201cnot in the room\u201d to speak about the impact the ban will have on young people. Some of those include: Reece from Tamworth: Social media has helped me figure out and become comfortable with my sense of self. There is a large community that is able to connect me with people all over the world living in a regional area. It\u2019s difficult to find people dealing with the same personal developments and social media really helped. Lamisa from Western Sydney University: Social media has given me creators who are people of colour, and I think it has really allowed me to learn that I don\u2019t have to justify my existence, that I\u2019m allowed to have an opinion, and that I\u2019m allowed to have a voice about who I am. Nationals leader on Newcastle protests: \u2018I actually think we should just ignore them\u2019 Speaking to Sky News, David Littleproud also weighed in on the Rising Tide protests in Newcastle and said \u201ceveryone has to be angry these days and have a cause\u201d. I get it, but there\u2019s a way to do it \u2026 Do they really think that that\u2019s wise to go and put themselves in harm\u2019s way, in front of a tanker and think that \u2026 makes a point? I actually think we should just ignore them \u2026 Littleproud said he understood \u201cwe\u2019re all moving towards that [energy] transition\u201d but argued \u201cyou can\u2019t destroy [the] economy on that journey\u201d. The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, spoke with Sky News just a moment ago about the under-16s social media age limit bill. As Josh Butler flagged earlier, several Nationals MPs have raised concerns about the bill, and as the Nine papers report, there is a growing pushback inside the Liberal party too. Asked about this pushback, Littleproud said there is \u201cconflation and confusion\u201d on what the bill is about: This isn\u2019t around digital identification \u2026 and this isn\u2019t about trying to hand over people\u2019s personal identity and their forms \u2013 their driver\u2019s license, their passports \u2026 I think there\u2019s some elements that have tried to criticise that to whip up hysteria in the community, when the reality is that\u2019s not that at all. Littleproud pointed to TiKTok as an example, and said it has the technology to ban users that are too young without needing to obtain ID. I think you\u2019ll find that we\u2019re having further discussions and negotiations with the government, and the principle still comes back to protecting young children, and protecting young girls who are the subject of abuse and offence \u2026 It\u2019s not a perfect fix, but it\u2019s another tool that that parents can have. And I just think it\u2019s dangerous to conflate digital ID, we didn\u2019t support that. Resources minister says Greens and Coalition are \u2018populist, vote-grabbing\u2019 The resources minister, Madeleine King, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning about the critical minerals production tax incentive bill, due to be put to parliament today \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have majority support, so why put it forward? She said it\u2019s about putting forward the position of government and industry, and \u201cif Peter Dutton and the Coalition choose not to support the resources sector, well people should know about that.\u201d The important thing about this incentive is that it drives further investment into an emerging industry that does face a lot of challenges from international markets. So people, whether it be the Greens, the independents, but particularly the Coalition \u2013 who really should know better \u2013 need to step up and [give broad] support. As the West Australian reports, the incentive would refund 10% of the processing and refining costs for projects that start between 2027/28 and 2039/40 \u2013 for up to 10 years per project \u2013 plus tax credits of $2 per kg made available for the production of renewable hydrogen from 2027/28. The minister also took aim at the Greens and Coalition amid the final sitting week, labelling them \u201cpopulist, vote-grabbing parties\u201d. We\u2019re trying to do the right thing for the Australian community, whereas they want to block this to be able to put out another TikTok \u2026 It\u2019s absolutely disgraceful. At the kick off of the short hearing on the federal government\u2019s social media ban bill, mental health groups and experts were asked whether the good outweighs the ban on social media for under-16s. Dr Danielle Einstein said no: I do not see any benefits for mental health from social media. I\u2019ve looked really hard at the evidence. And even if there, if there were to be some, I think they are far outweighed by their disadvantage. But for mental health, I do not see any benefits. Headspace\u2019s head of clinical leadership, Nicola Palfrey, warned of the risk of the ban: The thing that headspace is concerned about with the social media ban is what we do from young people, and research does indicate is that there\u2019s help seeking that goes online. There\u2019s seeking out of information with regards to mental health and wellbeing, and definitely with regards to connection, particularly for those young people that there may be risk of being disenfranchised, so remote rural communities belonging to minority groups and so forth, so places where they find connection online that otherwise they can\u2019t find in real life. Project RockIt\u2019s CEO, Lucy Thomas, said there were risks and harms online but said any ban should be approached carefully, otherwise \u201cwe risk dialling back young people\u2019s rights and pushing them into more isolated and less supported spaces online\u201d. The Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce also spoke with Sunrise about the Rising Tide protest, taking aim at the protesters and labelling them \u201cselfish\u201d: Look around your house. Your television, watch, clothes, car, fuel in the car \u2013 comes from overseas. Somebody somewhere has been putting something on the boat and sending it in the other direction \u2026 That dear folks is things such as coal, gas, iron ore, wool, wheat, cotton \u2013 a lot of the evil things you don\u2019t like. What these people are doing is going out in the harbour [and saying] I want Australia to be poor. They never suggest what pensions they would [want] removed or schools they don\u2019t want built. They go out and say I want Australia to be poor because I have a selfish desire I can inflict on you \u2026 without accepting the consequences financially of what that means. Plibersek questioned on coal approvals and Newcastle protest The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, spoke with Sunrise earlier about the number of coal mine developments or extensions approved under her watch, Responding, Plibersek, said: Well, I\u2019ve approved 10 times more renewable energy projects than coal projects \u2013 65 renewable energy projects. I\u2019m the first environment minister to stop a coalmine, because of the impact it could have had on water going on to the Great Barrier Reef \u2026 She turned to the Rising Tide protests in Newcastle, and said: Of course, in Australia you have a right to peacefully and safely express your view. But if you\u2019re breaking the law, if you\u2019re endangering others, if you\u2019re diverting police resources, then I think you need to face the consequences of that \u2026 O\u2019Neil says government supporting families of Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning and was asked about the Australian teenagers Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, who are among six tourists who have died from a suspected methanol poisoning event in Laos. Asked how the government would be supporting both families, O\u2019Neil said: This is an unmitigated tragedy and I\u2019m a parent \u2013 it\u2019s a rite of passage for young people to travel throughout Asia and have fun, and it\u2019s just heartbreaking what\u2019s happened here. I really want to extend my condolences to that family. Dfat is working with the two families here and I know we\u2019ll be doing everything we can as a government to support them both in the grieving that they need to do here, and in the work that they\u2019re trying to do to get some of the problems they see that have occurred overseas addressed. O\u2019Neil said the government has \u201cundertaken education campaigns around methanol poisoning\u201d and would continue to \u201cwork with the families to see what we can do\u201d. Australia urged to do more on climate crisis as activists rue trillion-dollar Cop29 funding gap Here\u2019s the latest from Adam Morton this morning, who is in Baku for Cop29: The Australian government has been urged to \u201cstep up\u201d and do more to address the climate crisis, after it played a role in a contentious deal on global finance to help poor countries deal with the problem. You can read the full story below: Eastern Australia heatwave could strain power grid The early-season heatwave that began searing southern Australia late last week is making its way east, as forecast a few days ago. Inland parts of Sydney, for instance, are in the midst of a week of days with temperatures reaching the 30C. Penrith is expected to reach 38C tomorrow and 39C on Wednesday as the heat peaks. It looks like the power grid will be strained as air conditioners are switched on and stay on. The crunch, for NSW at least, has shifted back to Wednesday from Tuesday. The Australian Energy Market Operator has forecast a so-called level 3 lack of reserve for the state over a considerable period on Wednesday, from 12.30pm Aedt to 8.30pm. \u201cThe maximum load (other than interruptible loads) forecast to be interrupted is 1731 megawatts\u201d at 3.30pm, local time, it said. Aemo is seeking a market response. Aemo can intervene if the market doesn\u2019t respond, but it hasn\u2019t set the time for an intervention. It may need to order generators to switch (assuming they can) or seek big power users (eg Tomago aluminium smelter) to switch off. Queensland, as it happens, is also facing some lower level (2) lack of reserve forecasts for stints of Wednesday afternoon. Those alerts from Aemo suggest the northern state won\u2019t have much electricity spare (if any) to sending to its southern neighbour. Growing pushback within Liberal party to social media ban, Nine newspapers report As we reported earlier, several Nationals MPs have raised concerns about the under-16s social media ban, citing potential unintended consequences and the lack of a proper Senate inquiry into the world-first legislation. The Nine newspapers have also reported a growing pushback inside the Liberal party too. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan, one of the first Coalition MPs to raise public issue with the bill, said the \u201cinquiry\u201d into the bill \u2013 lasting just a few hours today \u2013 was a \u201cjoke.\u201d He wrote on X this morning: The ban on social media for under 16s is subject to just a 5 day senate inquiry. It\u2019s a bad joke but I will be at the 3 hour senate hearing this morning from 9am. The hearing will feature witnesses including youth mental health advocates, the Digi group representing tech companies, and officials from the communications department. It begins at 9am and we\u2019ll bring you more when it kicks off. Lambie says fast-tracked Senate inquiry on social media age ban is \u2018shameful\u2019 Jacqui Lambie also weighed in on the under-16 social media ban, and described the fast-tracked Senate inquiry as \u201cshameful\u201d. There is a Senate inquiry on that this morning, which is shameful in itself. I mean the bloody thing doesn\u2019t start for 12 months, and yet they\u2019re trying to ram something else down our throats instead of getting it right. So I will be sitting in that inquiry this morning, I\u2019ll be very interested to see the unintended consequences that are coming out of that. Lambie said it was \u201creally quite difficult up here at the moment between the Greens and the Coalition, to be brutally honest with you\u201d. \u2018Yes, we\u2019re going to support you. And then a day beforehand says, no, we\u2019re not [going to support you] on certain things.\u2019 I mean, it\u2019s getting beyond the point of ridiculous. I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll sit again either in the new year, so if the Coalition and the Greens want to go [away] empty handed and go, \u2018well, actually we could have supported this, but we didn\u2019t\u2019 just to make things difficult, then good luck with their votes. Lambie says Senate a \u2018mess\u2019 this week Senator Jacqui Lambie says that it is a \u201cmess\u201d in the Senate, as the final sitting week of parliament begins. She spoke on the Today Show earlier, and said: [The government has] just got a list of stuff, you\u2019ve got no idea really what they\u2019re going to list each day. It\u2019s an absolute mess up in the Senate, to be honest with you. But I will say one thing \u2013 we need that housing deal ticked off because people need roofs over their heads. So if anything, can they please get that done? Last week, Labor said it was looking at gambling ad response this year Just quickly circling back to Clare O\u2019Neil on RN talking about gambling advertising and the government\u2019s long-awaited response to the Peta Murphy report \u2013 she said the government\u2019s plans to tackle gambling ads would come \u201cearly next year\u201d. It\u2019s worth recalling that just days ago, communications minister Michelle Rowland \u2013 in whose patch the gambling rules sit \u2013 said the government was looking at a response this year. What a difference a week makes. Yesterday the lines out of the government were only that the legislation wouldn\u2019t arrive this week. Of course, this is the final sitting week of the year, so no legislation this week means no legislation being introduced into parliament this year \u2013 but the government could detail its legislation in a press conference or media release outside of parliament. Rowland unveiled the broad details of the under-16s social media ban, for instance, in a press conference with Anthony Albanese when parliament was not sitting. On ABC Afternoon Briefing on 19 November, last Tuesday, host Greg Jennett asked Rowland: Time is, of course, running out this year. Michelle Rowland, you\u2019ve got this bill to negotiate, social media ban for teens and the outstanding online gambling advertising restrictions. You did promise a, quote, comprehensive response this year. Will that be done by legislation this calendar year? Rowland responded: We are aiming to have it done this year. Jennett went on to ask if it would be legislation, as opposed to codes of practice. Rowland responded: Well, we\u2019ll take advice on that, but the government has made no decisions in this regard. We\u2019ve been consulting widely and it is our intention to reach a conclusion on that as expeditiously as possible. Obviously, this is an area that has been of high concern, but we do want to make sure our response is comprehensive and robust and we get it right. Will Greens block housing bills in the Senate this week? If it comes down to it, are the Greens willing to block these bills in the Senate this week? Larissa Waters said: Well, we\u2019ll now have those discussions about what we should do and what will best help renters and people who are trying to get a roof over their heads. But we\u2019re just extraordinarily disappointed that the prime minister seems to have dug his heels in and won\u2019t help people in the way that they need helping. Greens senator Larissa Waters spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier, asked about the government\u2019s decision to reject the Greens\u2019 compromises on housing (as Josh Butler flagged earlier). She said that the government has shut the Greens down \u201cat every opportunity\u201d, saying: We came back what we thought was a really moderate offer which would still help about 60,000 people by just funding an additional 25,000 homes, and I\u2019m incredulous that overnight we had the government say that they won\u2019t even do that \u2026 I think renters and people who are trying to [buy] their own home will be astounded that it seems like the prime minister\u2019s ego is getting in the way of people having the homes that they need. I can\u2019t quite understand the psychology there. Pocock says Labor\u2019s housing bills are \u2018important pieces of the puzzle\u2019 Moving to housing, David Pocock was asked if the Greens should be supporting the government\u2019s legislation. He said most Australians would support what the Greens are proposing in principle \u2013 more housing being delivered. But he says the bills are \u201cimportant pieces of the puzzle\u201d. In a housing crisis, I think we have two bills that are not going to solve everything but are important pieces of the puzzle \u2026 These are really good steps forward. And so if the government\u2019s willing to amend the legislation, I think it\u2019s a real goal. Pocock on social media ban: \u2018I really support this in principal \u2026 but this seems like policy on the run\u2019 On the under-16 social media age ban, David Pocock is still undecided on whether he will support the bill. What more does he need to know? He told ABC RN: I\u2019m keen to see how they propose it\u2019s actually going to work. Again, I really support this in principle. This is something that we have to confront as a society \u2026 But this seems like policy on the run \u2026 This is a big problem, but we actually need an ecosystem approach. We need a ban to go hand-in-hand with the digital duty of care \u2026 And what I\u2019ve seen in the misinformation and disinformation bill, which has now been been shelved, is an unwillingness to actually tackle some of the root causes of social media harm, and that is around the algorithm, where these big social media companies don\u2019t want us to know how they\u2019re actually running their businesses. Asked about the three-day inquiry, and whether you can adequately look into these issues in such a short amount of time, Pocock said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you can\u201d. The usual process is that the questions you don\u2019t get to ask, you then put on notice. It\u2019s pretty hard seeing how you get questions back on notice if the committee\u2019s meant to report tomorrow. The independent senator David Pocock says it is \u201cgutless\u201d the government hasn\u2019t brought forward legislative gambling ad changes this year. Asked if it was reasonable that the legislation is too complex to complete this year, he responded: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d He told ABC RN: This is absolutely gutless from the Albanese government, and it\u2019s a huge win for Peter V\u2019landys and the gambling industry, that really betrays Peta Murphy and and her legacy. As you put to the housing minister, the recommendations were very clear. The work had been done in that report. We know partial bans don\u2019t work. That\u2019s why they were they were advocating for a phased-in ban over three years, and the government seems to have bolted under pressure from the gambling companies and from free TV. Is it really about pressure from lobbying groups? Pocock responded: Well, you just have to look at what\u2019s happening in the parliament in these last two sitting weeks. 400 pages of electoral reform \u2026 they\u2019re going to be rammed through both houses of Parliament by the major parties \u2026 At the same time, the social media ban, which I really support in in principle, but there\u2019s been no scrutiny of this. They\u2019re willing to have a sham three day Senate committee hearing and just get it through and be able to point to it and say, \u2018Well, this is the silver bullet that\u2019s going to solve everything\u2019. So I don\u2019t accept it all \u2026 I think both major parties need to be asking themselves on this: who do they actually work for? Who are they sent to this building to work for? O\u2019Neil on the surviving Bali Nine inmates Moving to other news, Clare O\u2019Neil was asked about reports that negotiations between Australia and Indonesia are ongoing regarding the surviving Bali Nine members being repatriated to Australia. O\u2019Neil said she doesn\u2019t have any further information on the negotiations: What I do know is that the prime minister has made a request, as many previous prime ministers have made, that mercy be shown to these young Australians. They committed a horrible crime, a crime that hurt lots of people, and no one should lose sight of that. But [they\u2019ve] now spent 20 years in Indonesian jails, two of them have already paid with their life. So I think it\u2019s absolutely appropriate that the prime minister do as previous prime ministers have done, and advocate for those people who are Australian citizens who are stuck overseas. Does the delay on gambling ad restrictions have anything to do with the demands of lobbyists? Clare O\u2019Neil said it wasn\u2019t about lobbying, but \u201cabout making sure that we get this right\u201d. And the minister has pointed to previous attempts to scale back gambling advertising that have actually resulted in more gambling advertising. This is a delicate area, and we\u2019ve got to get the balance right, and that\u2019s what the minister is seeking to do. Gambling ad legislation expected \u2018early next year\u2019: O\u2019Neil The government is not planning to introduce legislation around gambling ad restrictions this year, despite previous commitments. Clare O\u2019Neil was asked about this \u2013 and why the government can pull legislation together on social media so quickly, but not this, despite the report being handed down nearly 18 months ago \u2013 and responded: These complicated matters, they just are. You know, if this was a really simple problem to fix, then it would have been fixed a long time ago. I would say our government deserves credit for stepping up and saying we\u2019re going to take action on this, and the minister [Michelle Rowland] is doing what is appropriate, which is diligently working through what the proposals will look like. O\u2019Neil said the government is \u201cfiercely committed to making sure that this occurs\u201d. The minister is working with people, experts, stakeholders, others who will be affected by this legislation, and the government has said will come forward with \u2026 proposals early next year. O\u2019Neil asked if government has failed to find workable solution on housing Q: You\u2019re blaming the Greens for blocking progress on housing, but isn\u2019t this a failure on the government\u2019s part to find a workable solution? You don\u2019t have the majority in the Senate, isn\u2019t getting their approval or the approval of the Coalition part of your job in delivering more houses? Housing minister Clare O\u2019Neil said the government had \u201ctried to work with parties around the parliament to address these issues\u201d \u2013 and again accused the Greens of \u201cconsistently coming in to back in Peter Dutton\u2019s approach on these things\u201d. O\u2019Neil said the time of negotiation and conversations was six months ago, saying: The Greens are going to go to the next election either as an ineffective party of protests that has blocked and delayed action on things they say are important to them, or a party that lets the government get on with addressing the housing needs of Australia. The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, is speaking with ABC RN about the housing legislation due to go before the parliament this week. She said the Help to Buy scheme would come before the Senate tomorrow, and its second housing bill \u201ca little bit later in the week.\u201d Asked about the Greens\u2019 proposed concessions, which the government didn\u2019t agree to, O\u2019Neil accused the Greens of working with Peter Dutton to \u201cblock and delay everything that our government has tried to do on housing\u201d. It is a consistent approach of the Greens \u2026 It was yet another political stunt. O\u2019Neil said the government \u201cseriously\u201d looked at the Greens\u2019 proposal and got advice from treasury, but described the proposals as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d. One of the proposals put forward would have required me as minister to direct Housing Australia to fund homes that Housing Australia has \u2026 looked at and decided not to fund, and that is against the law. That is against the Housing Australia Act. So this is just one of a whole range of serious problems with what was put forward. Is the eSafety commissioner concerned about role of Musk in Trump administration? Julie Inman Grant was also asked about the role that X owner Elon Musk is going to play in the incoming Trump administration? She responded: Well, my job is not to be concerned with what Elon Musk is doing, unless he is hurting the safety of Australians, and that is why we will continue to regulate without fear or favour and to make sure that we\u2019re safeguarding Australians online safety, and that has always been my focus. Julie Inman Grant, the eSafety Commissioner, says it is her role to \u201cenforce the laws\u201d, not endorse, and that the under-16 social media age ban was a matter for the parliament. She was asked about the legislation while speaking to ABC RN earlier this morning, and said: There\u2019s an inquiry happening today, and what I have continued to say is that it\u2019s really, really important that any bill like this is nationally consistent, and that this is just one piece of an interlocking set of provisions \u2013 including the digital duty of care that minister [Michelle] Rowland has announced \u2013 and the education, digital literacy work that we\u2019ve been doing for years. So all of these need to work in tandem together, and we\u2019ll see what the outcomes of the inquiry are. And of course, we will enforce and carry out what the will of the parliament is. She said it had been an \u201cimportant national debate\u201d, particularly around the \u201caddictive design features\u201d of social media platforms, and \u201cwe understand the ideas behind this\u201d. We also need to make sure that particularly vulnerable and marginalised kids still have a way to connect and to create and explore. So whatever we do, when we implement what will become the law, we\u2019ll try to do this in a way that is really protective of the range of children\u2019s rights, including their ability to communicate and express themselves online. More on the NSW housing announcement: larger proposals to get fast-tracked Continuing from our last post: the rezoning will come into effect on Wednesday and development applications will then be able to be lodged to build new homes. Proposals that are more than $60m will get fast-tracked. The government also has a 3% affordable housing rate for all new developments across the eight stations, though it is higher in some areas. In a statement, Paul Scully said: The finalisation of the TOD Accelerated Precincts means development applications can be submitted and assessed, so that housing construction can start as quickly as possible. Elements of the planning pathway have been streamlined for the assessment of proposals in these locations, which will allow for greater speed without compromising the quality of the assessment or the final result. We made an election commitment to rebalance Sydney\u2019s housing growth around existing transport infrastructure and today we\u2019re delivering the blueprint for those homes. More than 58,000 homes will be built on land around eight train stations across Sydney, according to the New South Wales government, who will today release their master plans for the precincts. Last year, the government announced the rezoning of land within 1.2kms of stations at Bankstown, Bays West, Bella Vista, Crows Nest, Homebush, Hornsby, Kellyville and Macquarie Park, as part of their signature housing policy, called the Transport Oriented Development Program. The program also includes $520m to improve community infrastructure in the areas. Following a six-week consultation period, the planning minister, Paul Scully, will today announce the final plans for each area. He said the rezoning will allow for: 18,000 homes for Homebush, accompanied by new open spaces and active transport links. 6,000 homes in Hornsby plus a new library, community and culture centre and road, walking and cycling upgrades. There are also plans to increase the local tree canopy by \u201cup to 50%\u201d. 4,600 homes in Bella Vista and Kellyville, with new playing fields and active transport links to be created. 14,000 homes in Bankstown, with plans to \u201cencourage the delivery of a new bus interchange\u201d near the shopping centre. 9,600 homes in Macquarie Park, to be accompanied by the creation of 14 hectares of \u201cnew and improved parks, plazas and open spaces\u201d. Some 3.15m square metres of commercial floor space will also be opened up, which the government says provides capacity for about 100,000 jobs. 5,900 homes in Crows Nest and new road and public open space upgrades and increased tree canopy. The government has rejected the Greens\u2019 latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy housing bill, continuing the long-running stand-off into the parliament\u2019s final week for 2024. Government sources said the Greens\u2019 demands would be variously unlawful, unhelpful or require spending Labor saw as wasteful. The government is now challenging the Greens to back the Help to Buy bill anyway, still not budging on any demands \u2013 with a final vote in the Senate scheduled for tomorrow. Clare O\u2019Neill has today said: This continuous charade from the Greens has to stop. You get the distinct impression the Greens want Australians to continue to be in housing distress, so Adam Bandt can try to harvest those grievances into votes. It\u2019s the crassest form of politics there is, straight out of the Peter Dutton playbook. After initially demanding changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, among other requests, the Greens last week backed down and gave a revised list of compromises for their support. They included the government funding more homes under the Housing Australia Future Fund within the next year, increasing the number of affordable tenancies under the Build to Rent legislation, and altering settings around Help To Buy. Greens housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather said yesterday: The Greens are offering Labor an opportunity to announce the construction of 25,000 social and affordable homes, helping over 60,000 people into affordable homes in the middle of a housing crisis, why on earth would Labor block that? But the government has rejected the updated offer, claiming the Greens\u2019 ideas won\u2019t work and that they would go against legislation banning the minister from making specific funding decisions. The employment minister, Murray Watt, a senior government voice in the Senate, said yesterday that passing Help to Buy was the government\u2019s biggest priority this week. O\u2019Neil said: Consistently throughout this Parliament, the Greens have blocked and delayed action on the housing crisis, looking for every excuse to vote down legislation which is clearly good for the country. The Build to Rent saga continues ahead of the vote coming this week. It remains to be seen how the Greens will vote. Good morning and welcome back to the Australian politics live blog, as we begin the final sitting week of the year. There is a raft of legislation the government is still hoping to pass, with MPs and senators not due to return until February \u2013 and possibly not until the other side of an election if Anthony Albanese calls one in late January. So, can Labor pass its legislative agenda? Paul Karp has written this analysis, a must-read for the week ahead. On the Help to Buy housing bill, the government has rejected the Greens\u2019 latest compromise offer to pass the legislation, continuing the long-running stand-off. Josh Butler will have all the details in a moment. The under-16 social media age ban \u2013 likely to pass with the backing of the opposition \u2013 remains the topic of much discussion after the three-day inquiry only opened submissions for a single day. The eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant spoke with ABC RN earlier and said it was her role to \u201cenforce the laws\u201d, not endorse, and that it was a matter for the parliament. We\u2019ll bring you more of her comments in a moment. And in New South Wales politics, more than 58,000 homes will be built on land around eight Sydney train stations, with the state government expected to release their master plans for the precincts today. I\u2019m Emily Wind and I\u2019ll be taking you through our rolling coverage today. You\u2019ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest \u2013 Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers. Let\u2019s get started.",

If you want it the way it was intended 7 is the way.\u201d</p> <p>His comment refers to sound levels for the Dolby audio systems, used by many major cinema chains and independent movie theatres worldwide.</p> <p>Universal Pictures\u2019 adaptation of the Tony award-winning Broadway smash, based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s novel of the same name, is already proving popular with audiences, taking $114m in North America and an additional $50.2m internationally over the weekend, bringing its global total to $165m \u2013 the fourth-largest start in history for a musical.</p> <p>But while reviews for Wicked have been overwhelmingly positive, some have taken to social media to complain about the sound.</p> <p>Among the hundreds of replies to Chu\u2019s post were many individuals who said the volume was too low at the screening they attended, or that they could not hear all of the lyrics under the orchestral score, though others reported no issues.</p> <p>Dolby even <a href=\"https://x.com/Dolby/status/1860412603933294932\">responded</a> to Chu\u2019s post, writing, \u201cWe\u2019ve got you covered\u201d \u2013 though some commenters disagreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do.

      "bodyText": "Wicked director Jon M Chu is encouraging audience members to ask their cinema to turn up the volume on his blockbuster musical, as some viewers have begun reporting sound issues. Posting on X on the evening of Wicked\u2019s US opening, Chu wrote: \u201cTell your movie theater to turn it up to a 7 \u2026 I\u2019ve gone to a couple screenings and they are more like a 6.4. If you want it the way it was intended 7 is the way.\u201d His comment refers to sound levels for the Dolby audio systems, used by many major cinema chains and independent movie theatres worldwide. Universal Pictures\u2019 adaptation of the Tony award-winning Broadway smash, based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s novel of the same name, is already proving popular with audiences, taking $114m in North America and an additional $50.2m internationally over the weekend, bringing its global total to $165m \u2013 the fourth-largest start in history for a musical. But while reviews for Wicked have been overwhelmingly positive, some have taken to social media to complain about the sound. Among the hundreds of replies to Chu\u2019s post were many individuals who said the volume was too low at the screening they attended, or that they could not hear all of the lyrics under the orchestral score, though others reported no issues. Dolby even responded to Chu\u2019s post, writing, \u201cWe\u2019ve got you covered\u201d \u2013 though some commenters disagreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do. We were at a theatre with Dolby and the sound was super quiet,\u201d posted one frustrated viewer. Alex Temesvari, general manager of the Hayden Orpheum movie theatre in Sydney, which uses Dolby audio systems, said there hadn\u2019t been any requests so far from audience members wanting the volume turned up on Wicked. \u201cThere are no issues on our end with bumping the levels up when we occasionally get this request from a director or studio,\u201d Temesvari said, adding that sound bleed was not an issue in the six-screen complex. \u201cOur levels are tested by our tech team and we have invested heavily in our presentation over the last few years so [there are] rarely any issues with sound or picture.\u201d Imax Melbourne, which features the cinema chain\u2019s proprietary 12-channel sound system, said there had been no requests for higher volume from Wicked audience members so far. \u201cBut we are different from that mainstream cinema experience, in that the sound is always one of the things we pride ourselves on,\u201d Imax general manager Jeremy Fee told the Guardian. \u201cWe are generally louder than a commercial or suburban cinema.\u201d Neither Hoyts or Event cinema chains in Australia, both of which use Dolby sound, had responded to a request for comment by time of publication.

At extreme pace, in line with other people\u2019s creative vision, they must devise high-intensity fights that can be repeated without injury night after night while retaining the aggressive bite required to convince an audience. \u201cThe actor\u2019s safety hangs on the slender thread of the fight director\u2019s knowledge and experience,\u201d says D\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, who always aims to make the audience fear for the character, never the actor.&nbsp;\u201cIf you get it wrong, people get&nbsp;badly hurt.\u201d</p> <p>When Laurence Olivier was performing Romeo and Juliet, an accident left his opponent\u2019s thumb hanging by a thread. Another production of the same play saw Greg&nbsp;Hicks stabbed in the eye; and Damian Lewis suffered a gash to the face that required stitches when a duel with Ralph Fiennes went awry in a production of Hamlet. The last death from a stage fight that D\u2019Orl\u00e9ans is aware of occurred in the late 1990s at a trade show, where a broadsword broke mid-move. Naturally, every possible step is taken to mitigate risks&nbsp;to performers, but the room for&nbsp;error is devastatingly small. One&nbsp;tiny slip, in this field, can be excruciatingly painful.</p>    <p>\u201cPeople think we\u2019re just health and safety officers,\u201d says Kate Waters, also known as Kombat Kate. \u201cWhile it is of course important, creating a fight is also about storytelling. The secret to success is knowing the play so well that it becomes part of your soul.\u201d This&nbsp;is the fight director who recently honed Fiennes\u2019s sword fighting skills&nbsp;for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/nov/30/macbeth-review-ralph-fiennes-the-depot-liverpool\">Simon Godwin\u2019s Macbeth</a>. \u201cAnyone can strangle someone on stage,\u201d Waters shrugs, unimpressed. \u201cBut it\u2019s about why. How. Helping the actor believe it.\u201d The skill of a fight director is in choreographing a fight that tells you something new about the people fighting.</p> <p>Choreography is the word for it: this&nbsp;is a dance with violent intention. \u201cEvery hand is placed,\u201d Waters says. \u201cEvery step, every look, every moment is put together like a dance. It may not&nbsp;be set to music, but it has its own&nbsp;tempo.\u201d Waters\u2019s job is to work out what fighting techniques might fit&nbsp;each individual body, in a way that&nbsp;comfortably slots into the world of&nbsp;the&nbsp;play. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take people\u2019s natural movement away from&nbsp;them,\u201d she says. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The actor\u2019s safety hangs on the slender thread of the fight director\u2019s experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This winter, Waters is directing the fights for plant-rock musical Little Shop of Horrors at Sheffield\u2019s Crucible theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun show but it has a real darkness to it,\u201d she says. Director Amy Hodge asked Waters to come on board to ensure the show\u2019s moment of domestic abuse resonated with the audience and sat right within the action. \u201cIt lies with me and the director to make sure the room feels safe,\u201d Waters says. \u201cSo many conversations go into a scene that could last three or four seconds.\u201d</p> <p>With the introduction over the past decade or so of intimacy coordinators, the responsibility of care in physical scenes is now increasingly shared with another person. \u201cFights and intimacy put performers in vulnerable places,\u201d explains Bethan Clark, who holds the&nbsp;roles of fight director and intimacy director. \u201cBoth build from consent, open communication, and are about physical storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>Clark recently orchestrated a hectic 42-shot shootout \u2013 for which the reloading of guns backstage required its own complex choreography \u2013 and a&nbsp;water-bound queer sex scene for Charlie Josephine\u2019s rootin\u2019-tootin\u2019 show Cowbois, which played at the RSC before transferring to the Royal Court.</p>    <p>Clark is soon to start as fight director for Inside No 9\u2019s West End show, Stage/Fright, and is supporting intimacy work for Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s youth production of Cinderella. For both intimacy and fight&nbsp;direction, she says, \u201cit\u2019s about advocating for people\u2019s comfort levels in the room\u201d. That might be about working with other crew members to&nbsp;organise padding, modesty garments, blood packs or other effects. It might be about talking to a whole cast about consent.</p> <p>It might also mean speaking up for&nbsp;performers when they feel uncomfortable with anything they\u2019re being asked to do. \u201cIn the way a rehearsal room can be structured, there is a certain power dynamic that may mean people feel they have to say&nbsp;yes to things,\u201d Clark says. As an outside eye, D\u2019Orl\u00e9ans adds, a fight or intimacy director can be \u201ca voice for the actor\u2019s safety\u201d.</p> <p>In rehearsals, scenes of intimacy and violence require similar building blocks, with Clark working to establish a common language to navigate different types of touch with actors. \u201cWe might talk about skin, muscle or bone,\u201d she says, indicating different levels of intensity, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll navigate how comfortable people feel with contact on a one-to-10 scale. So when you\u2019re grabbing somebody, intimately or violently, the scale creates an easy way of communicating and understanding physical interactions.\u201d</p> <p>For an actor, a scene of intense physical proximity is a little like playing a piano. It requires them to take on unnatural postures, for instance, deftly pulling back from someone\u2019s throat while they make it look as if they are squeezing it tight. \u201cThey need to have beautifully relaxed hands while fully embodying the rage of the character,\u201d says D\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. \u201cIt\u2019s&nbsp;like having the face of a demon but the hands of an angel.\u201d</p>    <p>Physiologically, Clark says, our body struggles to tell the difference between a real scene of intimacy or&nbsp;violence and a pretend one. \u201cWith a&nbsp;mouth-to-mouth kiss, certain endorphins can be released by your body. When playing a character in a&nbsp;heightened state of rage, our body is&nbsp;going through some of those processes of anger.\u201d</p> <p>In staging scenes of sexual violence in particular, these tools for breath and vocalisation are vital, giving an actor a&nbsp;way to create a realistic scene without taking on its emotional weight. Working on breath and voice like this is a core part of a fight director\u2019s toolbox. \u201cHumans leak sound in violent confrontation,\u201d D\u2019Orl\u00e9ans says. It is a lot to think about at once: the action, the sound, the weapons, blood packs, the partner or partners you\u2019re grappling with. \u201cEvery part of the body is engaged,\u201d Waters says of a fight scene, \u201cfrom the little toe to the&nbsp;last hair on your head.\u201d</p> <p>Fight directors are one of the few&nbsp;roles still ignored by awards ceremonies, yet their role is multifaceted and takes on more risk than most. \u201cIn the same way you have a&nbsp;lighting designer or a set designer, we are specialists,\u201d says Clark. \u201cWe have the tools to make a scene sustainable for the actors, physically and emotionally, and to make it believable and effective for the audience.\u201d</p> <p>It is a role that requires a sturdy disposition, D\u2019Orl\u00e9ans explains as I&nbsp;reluctantly hand back the rapier and&nbsp;dagger after our practice session. \u201cI\u2019m&nbsp;loving working on The Three Musketeers,\u201d he says, \u201cbut for the next three months, every night when I read that show report, I\u2019m going to be holding my breath.

      "body": "<p>On the slopes up to the ridge, the snow is deep and fresh. Long frozen arms of it hug the trees. Behind us the tracks of our skis gleam with a strange blue light, and in front, delicately drawn into the snow, is the perfect feathery imprint of a bird \u2013 like a pale icy fossil. My guide, Jens<strong> </strong>Sarlin, from Next Step Nature, stops. \u201cCapercaillie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was feeding on pine needles up top and has landed here, then dug a burrow in the snow. It may still be there.\u201d</p> <p>We edge forwards. A trail of bird footprints lead to a hole, but it\u2019s empty except for some droppings. \u201cThey dig down and then sideways to fool the foxes,\u201d says Jens. We move forwards again, silent on our hunters\u2019 skis, antique wooden heirlooms that slip easily over deep soft snow. What we are hunting, with cameras only, is something rarely seen \u2013 the wolverine \u2013 and Jens knows the best places to find them.</p>    <p>A few nights earlier, I\u2019d arrived in Sweden just in time for a massive late winter snow dump. The drive west into the central Scandinavian mountains had seemed like winter adventure enough for me: the road disappearing before my eyes, the car\u2019s back end doing alarming lindy hop swingouts on the downhill sections. I&nbsp;pulled into St\u00f6ten ski resort long after the projected arrival time.</p> <p>My plan was to see the Swedish winter in all its contemporary glory, then dive back in time and sample the old ways, picking out the best aspects of all the ages. I was starting, very clearly, at the contemporary end. At breakfast, the overheard conversations are about infrared saunas, heliski adventures and the latest developments in snow production.</p> <p>Outside, Nature, oblivious to such human concerns, is dumping so much snow that the ski lifts aren\u2019t working. The dozens of new cottages are quiet. But there are traditional Scandinavian elements too, things that don\u2019t change: cheerful children playing without smartphone assistance, superlative food, the gentle friendliness and willingness to share information. Swedish ski stations have&nbsp;their own ambience.</p>    <p>I\u2019m at the St\u00f6ten ski resort to try something that is so cutting edge that we are using a prototype \u2013 an electric snowmobile. Simon Klaar runs a <a href=\"https://moreactivities.se/en/\">snowmobile experience</a> up here and is planning to have a fleet of them once the developmental stage is finished. Like many locals, Simon is multi-talented: carpenter, woodsman, builder, back-country skier and cyclist. He knows how essential snowmobiles have become. \u201cHave you ridden a petrol version?\u201d he asks, as we inspect what is a fully electric prototype.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Behind us the tracks of our skis gleam with a strange blue light, and in front, delicately drawn into the snow, is the perfect feathery imprint of a bird \u2013 like a pale icy fossil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How to be polite? As someone who has never had to rely on the machine, I&nbsp;can categorically say I hate them. They are noisy, smelly, one-trick petrol ponies designed to carve filthy ring roads into every pristine winter landscape, sending any wildlife into hiding for miles around. What makes things even worse is that they are fun.</p> <p>I climb aboard. \u201cHow do I switch it&nbsp;on?\u201d</p> <p>Simon grins. \u201cIt\u2019s already on. Just press the throttle.\u201d</p> <p>A second later I am silently gliding forward. I take a trail out into the birch and spruce forest. The caterpillar track does make some sound, but not much. Best of all, no smell. Simon clatters up&nbsp;on his&nbsp;petrol version. \u201cLike it?\u201d</p>    <p>We pull up at a shelter in the forest and Simon lights a fire to make coffee. On my own, I make a silent circuit of a&nbsp;frozen lake. \u201cThese machines will change everything,\u201d I say when back at the hut.</p> <p>Simon is grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to do silent safaris.\u201d</p> <p>After such a glimpse of the future, I\u2019m keen to get back where I\u2019m more comfortable: the past. In Mora town on Lake Siljan, I visit the <a href=\"https://zorn.se/en/\">Zorn house</a>, a 19th-century fantasy of a Scandi cabin full of antiques and impeccable carpentry collected by the artist <a href=\"https://zorn.se/en/about-us/anders-zorn/\">Anders Zorn</a>. He was a local farm boy with talent who rose to become one of the most celebrated portrait painters of his time. His sitters included three US presidents: Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt.</p> <p>Afterwards, I head out for a horse-drawn sleigh ride with Emelie Eriksson on Soller\u00f6n island. As we slither along, Emelie lets slip a little snippet of local news that sums up the character of rural Sweden: \u201cWe had a bear on the island last summer and it became a problem and sadly had to be shot.\u201d She makes a sad face, then smiles. \u201cBut silver-lining: the hunters donated it to the primary school and the kids all had bear-meat for lunch.\u201d The horse jogs on through the snow and the sleigh bells jingle merrily. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;trying to imagine such a lunch in&nbsp;a British primary school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We are approaching an open area, a\u00a0frozen bog, when Jens stops and points excitedly. Ahead I\u00a0see a curve of bristly hair in the snow. Wolverine? </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Suitably immersed in traditional Swedish pragmatism,<strong> </strong>I go to meet Jens, our back-country guide. His garage is filled with wooden skis and sleds; his kitchen boasts an impressive array of&nbsp;handmade hunting knives and birchbark containers. Jens, however, is&nbsp;no antique collector; his garage has plastic skis, too, and the kitchen has all mod-cons. His philosophy is to use what is best. \u201cOn days like this, with deep snow and no tracks, traditional wooden skis work better.\u201d</p> <p>We drive to a clearing in the forest. The plan is to ski up into <a href=\"https://www.visitdalarna.se/en/do/attractions/gyllbergen-nature-reserve\">Gyllbergen nature reserve</a>, a vast wilderness of birch and spruce forest interspersed with frozen bogs, lakes and ridges. \u201cThere\u2019s bear, wolf, lynx, wolverine, moose, fox, hares,\u201d says Jens as we set off. \u201cLet\u2019s go quietly and look for tracks.\u201d</p>    <p>His particular love is for black grouse and capercaillie. In spring, he seeks out their mating grounds and sets up tented hides, but now the birds are intent on survival.</p> <p>After a few hours, as darkness falls, we reach our cabin, a simple wooden hut with log burner in the middle. These mountain huts are run on donations and can vary in upkeep and condition. Anyone who arrives is accommodated, but midweek Jens is confident we will have it to ourselves, and so it proves. As the temperature plummets, we tuck into moose and chanterelle stew, then burrow down into our sleeping bags.</p> <p>The dawn is crystalline sunshine sparkling through the trees. We take a trail south, then branch off, picking our way up ridges and across frozen bogs. Jens keeps to the blue shadows, preferring the harder, faster going. His sixth sense about snow is ultra-sensitive and we move quickly. When we stop, we whisper. \u201cThis area is good for wolverine,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe\u2019ll explore around and stay alert.\u201d</p> <p>Our first success is the capercaille track, then lots of hare spoor, black grouse, raven, ermine and pine marten. But all the time we see nothing moving. All is silent. We descend, dodging the trees. The skis are now sticky with snow and often work like long snow shoes. I\u2019m relieved: I have never conquered that feeling of panic when I&nbsp;start moving downhill at anything faster than a brisk walking pace.</p>    <p>We are approaching an open area, a&nbsp;frozen bog, when Jens stops and points excitedly: 100 metres ahead I&nbsp;see a curve of bristly hair in the snow. Wolverine? But there is no movement. We move forward and find a moose leg, its haunch protruding to mimic the shape of a wolverine\u2019s back. There are tufts of moose hair scattered around and the ghostly imprints of raven touchdowns. There is no sign of the rest of the animal. Jens inspects the scene carefully, then strings all the tiny signs into a plausible narrative: \u201cI think it was a wolf kill that a wolverine raided and dragged here \u2013 before this recent snowfall.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>As the sun sets, the night comes down with brutal chilling force and we retreat to the cooking shelter, and the fire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We reach the hut in late afternoon sun and I sit on the stoop whittling with local Mora knives and linden wood. Jens lights a fire in the nearby cooking shelter and then he shouts that <em>fika</em> is ready,<strong> </strong>I am astonished to find that two hours have passed and it\u2019s almost dark. \u201cThat\u2019s the pleasure of spoon-carving,\u201d says Jens. \u201cThat\u2019s why we teach it in school, along with ecology and hunting skills.\u201d Swedish rural schools sound like fun.</p> <p>Fika is instant coffee and homemade <em>kan</em><em>elbull</em><em>ar</em>, traditional cinnamon buns. As the sun sets, the night comes down with brutal chilling force and we retreat to the cooking shelter, and the fire. We agree that an entire winter here would be perfect.</p> <p>Next day, Jens skis down the mountain with a sledge, but I prefer to roll, slide, and finally walk, holding the skis over my shoulder. All my learning and skills having deserted me at the end. Fortunately, Jens has saved the final treat: the village <a href=\"https://boka.se/lisskasbastu\">sauna</a> in Syrholn, a thoroughly old-fashioned cabin with a handy hole in the ice covering Lake Flosj\u00f6n right outside the door.

When I tell restaurant owner, Anna, that we found a wolverine kill, she raises an eyebrow. \u201cOh, they are so common here. Every winter we all go out in the woods and leave the weakest person behind for the wolverine.\u201d</p> <p>Only a twinkle in her eye gives the&nbsp;joke away, but when I reflect back on that marathon journey down the mountain, I\u2019m not so sure.

      "bodyText": "On the slopes up to the ridge, the snow is deep and fresh. Long frozen arms of it hug the trees. Behind us the tracks of our skis gleam with a strange blue light, and in front, delicately drawn into the snow, is the perfect feathery imprint of a bird \u2013 like a pale icy fossil. My guide, Jens Sarlin, from Next Step Nature, stops. \u201cCapercaillie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was feeding on pine needles up top and has landed here, then dug a burrow in the snow. It may still be there.\u201d We edge forwards. A trail of bird footprints lead to a hole, but it\u2019s empty except for some droppings. \u201cThey dig down and then sideways to fool the foxes,\u201d says Jens. We move forwards again, silent on our hunters\u2019 skis, antique wooden heirlooms that slip easily over deep soft snow. What we are hunting, with cameras only, is something rarely seen \u2013 the wolverine \u2013 and Jens knows the best places to find them. A few nights earlier, I\u2019d arrived in Sweden just in time for a massive late winter snow dump. The drive west into the central Scandinavian mountains had seemed like winter adventure enough for me: the road disappearing before my eyes, the car\u2019s back end doing alarming lindy hop swingouts on the downhill sections. I pulled into St\u00f6ten ski resort long after the projected arrival time. My plan was to see the Swedish winter in all its contemporary glory, then dive back in time and sample the old ways, picking out the best aspects of all the ages. I was starting, very clearly, at the contemporary end. At breakfast, the overheard conversations are about infrared saunas, heliski adventures and the latest developments in snow production. Outside, Nature, oblivious to such human concerns, is dumping so much snow that the ski lifts aren\u2019t working. The dozens of new cottages are quiet. But there are traditional Scandinavian elements too, things that don\u2019t change: cheerful children playing without smartphone assistance, superlative food, the gentle friendliness and willingness to share information. Swedish ski stations have their own ambience. I\u2019m at the St\u00f6ten ski resort to try something that is so cutting edge that we are using a prototype \u2013 an electric snowmobile. Simon Klaar runs a snowmobile experience up here and is planning to have a fleet of them once the developmental stage is finished. Like many locals, Simon is multi-talented: carpenter, woodsman, builder, back-country skier and cyclist. He knows how essential snowmobiles have become. \u201cHave you ridden a petrol version?\u201d he asks, as we inspect what is a fully electric prototype. How to be polite? As someone who has never had to rely on the machine, I can categorically say I hate them. They are noisy, smelly, one-trick petrol ponies designed to carve filthy ring roads into every pristine winter landscape, sending any wildlife into hiding for miles around. What makes things even worse is that they are fun. I climb aboard. \u201cHow do I switch it on?\u201d Simon grins. \u201cIt\u2019s already on. Just press the throttle.\u201d A second later I am silently gliding forward. I take a trail out into the birch and spruce forest. The caterpillar track does make some sound, but not much. Best of all, no smell. Simon clatters up on his petrol version. \u201cLike it?\u201d We pull up at a shelter in the forest and Simon lights a fire to make coffee. On my own, I make a silent circuit of a frozen lake. \u201cThese machines will change everything,\u201d I say when back at the hut. Simon is grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to do silent safaris.\u201d After such a glimpse of the future, I\u2019m keen to get back where I\u2019m more comfortable: the past. In Mora town on Lake Siljan, I visit the Zorn house, a 19th-century fantasy of a Scandi cabin full of antiques and impeccable carpentry collected by the artist Anders Zorn. He was a local farm boy with talent who rose to become one of the most celebrated portrait painters of his time. His sitters included three US presidents: Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt. Afterwards, I head out for a horse-drawn sleigh ride with Emelie Eriksson on Soller\u00f6n island. As we slither along, Emelie lets slip a little snippet of local news that sums up the character of rural Sweden: \u201cWe had a bear on the island last summer and it became a problem and sadly had to be shot.\u201d She makes a sad face, then smiles. \u201cBut silver-lining: the hunters donated it to the primary school and the kids all had bear-meat for lunch.\u201d The horse jogs on through the snow and the sleigh bells jingle merrily. I am trying to imagine such a lunch in a British primary school. Suitably immersed in traditional Swedish pragmatism, I go to meet Jens, our back-country guide. His garage is filled with wooden skis and sleds; his kitchen boasts an impressive array of handmade hunting knives and birchbark containers. Jens, however, is no antique collector; his garage has plastic skis, too, and the kitchen has all mod-cons. His philosophy is to use what is best. \u201cOn days like this, with deep snow and no tracks, traditional wooden skis work better.\u201d We drive to a clearing in the forest. The plan is to ski up into Gyllbergen nature reserve, a vast wilderness of birch and spruce forest interspersed with frozen bogs, lakes and ridges. \u201cThere\u2019s bear, wolf, lynx, wolverine, moose, fox, hares,\u201d says Jens as we set off. \u201cLet\u2019s go quietly and look for tracks.\u201d His particular love is for black grouse and capercaillie. In spring, he seeks out their mating grounds and sets up tented hides, but now the birds are intent on survival. After a few hours, as darkness falls, we reach our cabin, a simple wooden hut with log burner in the middle. These mountain huts are run on donations and can vary in upkeep and condition. Anyone who arrives is accommodated, but midweek Jens is confident we will have it to ourselves, and so it proves. As the temperature plummets, we tuck into moose and chanterelle stew, then burrow down into our sleeping bags. The dawn is crystalline sunshine sparkling through the trees. We take a trail south, then branch off, picking our way up ridges and across frozen bogs. Jens keeps to the blue shadows, preferring the harder, faster going. His sixth sense about snow is ultra-sensitive and we move quickly. When we stop, we whisper. \u201cThis area is good for wolverine,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe\u2019ll explore around and stay alert.\u201d Our first success is the capercaille track, then lots of hare spoor, black grouse, raven, ermine and pine marten. But all the time we see nothing moving. All is silent. We descend, dodging the trees. The skis are now sticky with snow and often work like long snow shoes. I\u2019m relieved: I have never conquered that feeling of panic when I start moving downhill at anything faster than a brisk walking pace. We are approaching an open area, a frozen bog, when Jens stops and points excitedly: 100 metres ahead I see a curve of bristly hair in the snow. Wolverine? But there is no movement. We move forward and find a moose leg, its haunch protruding to mimic the shape of a wolverine\u2019s back. There are tufts of moose hair scattered around and the ghostly imprints of raven touchdowns. There is no sign of the rest of the animal. Jens inspects the scene carefully, then strings all the tiny signs into a plausible narrative: \u201cI think it was a wolf kill that a wolverine raided and dragged here \u2013 before this recent snowfall.\u201d We reach the hut in late afternoon sun and I sit on the stoop whittling with local Mora knives and linden wood. Jens lights a fire in the nearby cooking shelter and then he shouts that fika is ready, I am astonished to find that two hours have passed and it\u2019s almost dark. \u201cThat\u2019s the pleasure of spoon-carving,\u201d says Jens. \u201cThat\u2019s why we teach it in school, along with ecology and hunting skills.\u201d Swedish rural schools sound like fun. Fika is instant coffee and homemade kanelbullar, traditional cinnamon buns. As the sun sets, the night comes down with brutal chilling force and we retreat to the cooking shelter, and the fire. We agree that an entire winter here would be perfect. Next day, Jens skis down the mountain with a sledge, but I prefer to roll, slide, and finally walk, holding the skis over my shoulder. All my learning and skills having deserted me at the end. Fortunately, Jens has saved the final treat: the village sauna in Syrholn, a thoroughly old-fashioned cabin with a handy hole in the ice covering Lake Flosj\u00f6n right outside the door. Down the lane are Dala-Floda V\u00e4rdshus hotel and a restaurant, Byns Skafferi, both oozing traditional Swedish winter charm, seasoned with a dash of impish humour.

Sehwail, 37, sees the prospect of a Gaza Biennale as a chance of a fresh start as an artist. \u201cContinuing to create art in the midst of war and oppression in Gaza is not just a creative act, it is an act of resistance and survival in itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile Israel focuses on erasing life and culture in Gaza, my continuity in art proves that life is still going on, and that the Palestinian identity will not be erased.\u201d In a manifesto launching the Gaza Biennale, the artists said it represented \u201ca creative step outside the traditional frameworks of exhibitions. It reflects the sensitivity and specificity of our situation, making it an urgent and exceptional event. At the heart of the artistic purpose is the struggle of a people to survive.\u201d The Gaza Biennale project is in its early stages and depends on the intervention of an art gallery or national museum abroad to make it a reality. But Shatat is optimistic. \u201cAll the artists\u2019 works will come out,\u201d she predicted. \u201cThey will see the light, and they will cross barriers, borders, and laws, and the whole world will see them. This is the power of art.\u201d",

Known as \u201cthe Movement\u201d, its members include Johnson\u2019s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, the ex-MP Michael Gove, and a shadowy Conservative prime ministerial aide called Dougie Smith, of whom only one photograph exists and<strong> </strong>about whom details are scarce. Why did these men commit this act of what she calls regicide? Was it because Johnson was a liability? No, and you should put all those lockdown parties from&nbsp;your mind. According to Dorries, they were working, for reasons that remain foggy, at the behest of a mysterious character she referred to only as Dr No, after the Bond villain.</p> <p>Dorries\u2019s new book is styled as a sequel to <em>The Plot</em>, and thus promises quite a lot to anyone who was even vaguely interested in the above. \u201cI have to finish the story!\u201d she writes, as she prepares once again to Zoom with some excitable Westminster snouts (this time, her subject is the disastrous occupation of Number 10 by Rishi Sunak). Will Nadine track Dr No to his private island, and attempt to do something&nbsp;awful to him using a drug-laced cigarette and a tarantula? Or will she just tell us his real name at last?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Even she\u2019s shocked when she checks her phone and finds \u2018a screenshot photograph no amount of mind bleach will ever expunge from my brain\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And what of Dougie Smith? Will she clandestinely photograph this terrifying beast (otherwise known as the Wolf) and send a clear shot of his visage to the <em>Daily Mail</em>\u2019s picture desk? At this point, after all, Smith isn\u2019t only responsible for Johnson\u2019s political expiration; according to Dorries, he\u2019s also the co-creator, with Gove, and possibly the Mossad, of Kemi Badenoch, a woman whose \u201csecrets\u201d he knows and will likely deploy at some moment in the perma-chaos of the future.</p> <p>But, alas, the promise comes to naught. In <em>Downfall</em>, Dr No appears to have been usurped in the baddie stakes by the likes of Alicia Kearns, the MP for Rutland and Stamford (her principal crime is ambition), and the \u201cGollum-like\u201d William Wragg, the former MP for Hazel Grove (more of him later). And while her contacts tell her that the great achievement of <em>The Plot </em>was to convince Tory MPs of the existence of Smith \u2013 before this, it seems, he was like Big Foot, Nessie&nbsp;or the ghost of Margaret Thatcher, and spotted only late at night in the&nbsp;bars&nbsp;of the House of Commons&nbsp;\u2013 in her new book, we\u2019re no closer to&nbsp;grasping his motivations, let alone who his true paymaster might&nbsp;be. All she can tell us is that Smith, a \u201cshuffling\u201d, gout-stricken figure, uses a \u201cgrid of shit\u201d to spread&nbsp;\u201cbad juju\u201d wherever he goes.</p> <p>Dorries, a former nurse, tells us repeatedly that she is a woman of the world. But researching <em>Downfall</em> was a grubby business, parliament a hotbed of decadence. Even she\u2019s shocked when she checks her phone and finds, courtesy of two helpful Westminster insiders, \u201ca screenshot photograph no amount of mind bleach will ever expunge from my brain\u201d. No, it\u2019s not an image of Sunak using highlighter pens (the mark, for her, of a hopeless political case). It is a picture of an MP in his office at Portcullis House, \u201cproudly holding a large erection in his hand\u201d. To whom might it belong, this large erection? Dorries doesn\u2019t say. Her eye is drawn to another large erection in the form of the London Eye, \u201crevolving happily\u201d behind him. How she hopes its passengers can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on across the river.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/12/the-plot-the-political-assassination-of-boris-johnson-by-nadine-dorries-review-the-treachery-of-oddjob-the-wolf-and-dr-no\">The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson by Nadine Dorries review \u2013 the treachery of \u2018Oddjob\u2019, \u2018The Wolf\u2019 and \u2018Dr No\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The photo is not a one-off. More follow. One man, she notes, has briefs that are \u201cvery full\u201d, which is a whole new twist on the concept of red boxes. There\u2019s also talk of scandalous allegations involving Wragg, the MP who was at the centre of the Grindr honeytrap scandal earlier this year (though, oddly, this is not half so suspicious-making in her eyes as the fact that his home had a <em>landline</em>). How does all this connect to her wider theories&nbsp;and the so-called Movement? It has, I think, something to do with the Chris Pincher scandal, which also played a&nbsp;part in Johnson\u2019s downfall (in 2022, Pincher, the then deputy chief&nbsp;whip, groped a man; Johnson later admitted he knew of allegations against him before appointing him). But after reading several pages&nbsp;devoted to Pincher\u2019s victim \u2013 or \u201cvictim\u201d, as Dorries likes to have it \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m any the&nbsp;wiser.</p> <p>On and on the book goes, like some half-crazed filibustering MP in the dead of night. Dorries has written a number of novels \u2013 I call them \u201cnovels\u201d \u2013 but nonfiction seems to be beyond her. <em>Downfall </em>comprises little more than a series of unedited interviews with her \u201csources\u201d, occasionally punctuated with some scene-setting in which she orders coffee or a slimline tonic (assignations take place in restaurants that she first checks out, like a spy).</p> <p>She is, she tells us, highly diligent; nothing gets past her, for all that, as she puts it, \u201ceven Caligula and his horse would struggle\u201d to understand the story she has to tell (not a high bar, admittedly). But in the end, the result is rather boring for the reader. Where, oh where, is Dougie? If the man does indeed exist, not even Westminster\u2019s platinum blonde Carl Bernstein can find him. For the time being, his \u201cgrid\u201d \u2013 whatever it\u2019s made of \u2013 remains the stuff of legend.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Downfall</em><em>: The Self-Destruction of the Conservative Party</em> by Nadine Dorries is published by HarperCollins (\u00a325).

Dorries\u2019s new book is styled as a sequel to The Plot, and thus promises quite a lot to anyone who was even vaguely interested in the above. \u201cI have to finish the story!\u201d she writes, as she prepares once again to Zoom with some excitable Westminster snouts (this time, her subject is the disastrous occupation of Number 10 by Rishi Sunak). Will Nadine track Dr No to his private island, and attempt to do something awful to him using a drug-laced cigarette and a tarantula? Or will she just tell us his real name at last? And what of Dougie Smith? Will she clandestinely photograph this terrifying beast (otherwise known as the Wolf) and send a clear shot of his visage to the Daily Mail\u2019s picture desk? At this point, after all, Smith isn\u2019t only responsible for Johnson\u2019s political expiration; according to Dorries, he\u2019s also the co-creator, with Gove, and possibly the Mossad, of Kemi Badenoch, a woman whose \u201csecrets\u201d he knows and will likely deploy at some moment in the perma-chaos of the future. But, alas, the promise comes to naught. In Downfall, Dr No appears to have been usurped in the baddie stakes by the likes of Alicia Kearns, the MP for Rutland and Stamford (her principal crime is ambition), and the \u201cGollum-like\u201d William Wragg, the former MP for Hazel Grove (more of him later). And while her contacts tell her that the great achievement of The Plot was to convince Tory MPs of the existence of Smith \u2013 before this, it seems, he was like Big Foot, Nessie or the ghost of Margaret Thatcher, and spotted only late at night in the bars of the House of Commons \u2013 in her new book, we\u2019re no closer to grasping his motivations, let alone who his true paymaster might be. All she can tell us is that Smith, a \u201cshuffling\u201d, gout-stricken figure, uses a \u201cgrid of shit\u201d to spread \u201cbad juju\u201d wherever he goes. Dorries, a former nurse, tells us repeatedly that she is a woman of the world. But researching Downfall was a grubby business, parliament a hotbed of decadence. Even she\u2019s shocked when she checks her phone and finds, courtesy of two helpful Westminster insiders, \u201ca screenshot photograph no amount of mind bleach will ever expunge from my brain\u201d. No, it\u2019s not an image of Sunak using highlighter pens (the mark, for her, of a hopeless political case). It is a picture of an MP in his office at Portcullis House, \u201cproudly holding a large erection in his hand\u201d. To whom might it belong, this large erection? Dorries doesn\u2019t say. Her eye is drawn to another large erection in the form of the London Eye, \u201crevolving happily\u201d behind him. How she hopes its passengers can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on across the river. The photo is not a one-off. More follow. One man, she notes, has briefs that are \u201cvery full\u201d, which is a whole new twist on the concept of red boxes. There\u2019s also talk of scandalous allegations involving Wragg, the MP who was at the centre of the Grindr honeytrap scandal earlier this year (though, oddly, this is not half so suspicious-making in her eyes as the fact that his home had a landline). How does all this connect to her wider theories and the so-called Movement? It has, I think, something to do with the Chris Pincher scandal, which also played a part in Johnson\u2019s downfall (in 2022, Pincher, the then deputy chief whip, groped a man; Johnson later admitted he knew of allegations against him before appointing him). But after reading several pages devoted to Pincher\u2019s victim \u2013 or \u201cvictim\u201d, as Dorries likes to have it \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m any the wiser. On and on the book goes, like some half-crazed filibustering MP in the dead of night. Dorries has written a number of novels \u2013 I call them \u201cnovels\u201d \u2013 but nonfiction seems to be beyond her. Downfall comprises little more than a series of unedited interviews with her \u201csources\u201d, occasionally punctuated with some scene-setting in which she orders coffee or a slimline tonic (assignations take place in restaurants that she first checks out, like a spy). She is, she tells us, highly diligent; nothing gets past her, for all that, as she puts it, \u201ceven Caligula and his horse would struggle\u201d to understand the story she has to tell (not a high bar, admittedly). But in the end, the result is rather boring for the reader. Where, oh where, is Dougie? If the man does indeed exist, not even Westminster\u2019s platinum blonde Carl Bernstein can find him. For the time being, his \u201cgrid\u201d \u2013 whatever it\u2019s made of \u2013 remains the stuff of legend. \u2022 Downfall: The Self-Destruction of the Conservative Party by Nadine Dorries is published by HarperCollins (\u00a325).

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer is under renewed pressure over electoral reform after dozens of newly elected Labour MPs signed up to a parliamentary group calling for the UK to move to a proportional voting system. More than half of the nearly 100 MPs who have joined the new all-party parliamentary group on fair elections are from Labour, with 43 from the intake elected in 2024. The group, formed in September, says it is growing all the time. It has released a report, Free But Not Fair, which argues that a change from the distortions of the first-past-the-post electoral system, under which Labour won more than 60% of Commons seats with just a third of the votes cast in July, would help restore trust to politics. A number of Labour MPs, including many from the 2024 intake, are known to be sympathetic to the idea of electoral reform, an idea to which the party is officially committed after a vote to embrace PR was passed overwhelmingly at its 2022 conference. While Starmer has previously expressed at least some support for electoral reform, his leadership team have ruled out any immediate action, at least in the first term of a Labour government. One new MP who has signed up to the group said electoral reform was a common concern among the 2024 intake. \u201cWe perhaps have a greater sense of how relevant and salient it is as an issue, how much it is seemingly connected to this growing sense of apathy, of disengagement from politics for many people,\u201d they said. \u201cI get the argument that we don\u2019t necessarily have the bandwidth to do everything, but much as you\u2019d want to sort out the finances or the buses in a first term, there is also a responsibility to make sure the democratic system is working properly.\u201d The report, released alongside poll findings by Survation showing that 64% of people believe there is a need to address the electoral system before the next general election, calls for a \u201cnational commission for electoral reform\u201d to be set up in 2025 with the task of recommending a replacement for first past the post. It also calls for new measures to prevent murky campaign financing and to counter disinformation. With Labour officially committed to PR, the all-party group argues this means that in the new parliament about 500 of the 650 MPs represent parties in favour of change. Among what it calls the corrosive effects of first past the post, the report notes that despite a high turnover of seats in the July election, any constituencies not being specifically targeted by opposition parties were in effect ignored, giving local voters no meaningful choice. It points out that it took on average 24,000 votes to elect each Labour MP, 49,000 per Lib Dem, 56,000 for every Conservative MP, 486,000 votes per Green, and 824,000 for every Reform UK MP. Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds Central and Headingley and a former shadow minister, said: \u201cThe popular vote a party needs to win a majority has been steadily falling for decades, and now first past the post has delivered a landslide on just a third of the vote. \u201cAre we really comfortable with a situation where a party \u2013 even an extreme party \u2013 can win a thumping majority with, say, just three out of 10 votes?

      "body": "<p>Swedes are generally not known to panic or overreact. But many of us are feeling a little shaken after a booklet with a soldier in camouflage holding a machine gun, with a fighter jet tearing through the sky in the background, landed on our door mats recently.</p> <p>The government booklet, titled \u201cIn case of crisis or war\u201d, was sent to every Swedish household as the threat of attack from Russia escalates. It signals the beginning of a new era in our country, with a bleak message about threats from war, natural disasters and pandemics.</p> <p>\u201cIf Sweden is attacked, everyone must do their part to defend Sweden\u2019s independence \u2013 and our democracy. We build resilience every day, together with our loved ones, colleagues, friends, and neighbours,\u201d <a href=\"https://rib.msb.se/filer/pdf/30874.pdf\">it states</a>.</p> <p>For more than two centuries Sweden maintained a policy of military non-alignment, but earlier this year the country joined Nato and the booklet was produced in response.</p>    <p>It was written by the <a href=\"https://www.msb.se/en/\">Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency,</a> which is responsible for issues concerning emergency management, public safety and civil defence. And many of its 30 pages contain practical advice in the event of war or disaster, including a checklist of things to have at home, such as a week\u2019s worth of drinking water (three litres a person a day) in storage containers, warm clothing and blankets, non-perishable food for people and pets, and a radio that isn\u2019t reliant on mains electricity. It also lists places to seek shelter if there is an air raid, such as cellars, underground garages and metro stations, and the different sirens to listen out for that will indicate the level of emergency.</p> <p>But primarily, it tells the citizens of Sweden to prepare for hard times, effectively saying: don\u2019t ask what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.</p> <p>The booklet\u2019s bleak message stunned some of our European neighbours, where Sweden might still be known mainly for centuries of neutrality and peace. The French news magazine Le Point had news of the pamphlet on the top of its website, highlighting the contrast between its stark language and the lingering image of Sweden as peaceful, while a British tabloid claimed that the government\u2019s message \u2013 along with similar instructions on how to prepare for emergencies recently issued by <a href=\"https://www.sikkerhverdag.no/globalassets/din-beredskap/brosjyrer-alle-sprak/dsb-egenberedskap-engelsk-web.pdf\">Norway </a>and <a href=\"https://www.suomi.fi/guides/preparedness/how-do-i-prepare-for-incidents-and-crises/military-conflict\">Finland</a> \u2013 caused <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1977482/sweden-survival-booklet-war-russia\">\u201cpanic\u201d across Europe</a>, which is an absurd exaggeration.</p> <p>The challenge for the Swedish government is not that citizens might panic, but that many citizens have lost a sense of civic duty, in an increasingly atomised country.</p> <p>\u201cIf you take seriously what is written in this booklet, then you have made an act of solidarity for your country,\u201d Carl-Oskar Bohlin, the minister for civil defence who is responsible for the booklet, said <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/direkt/2024-10-08/nya-upplagan-av-om-kriget-eller-krisen-kommer/\">in a recent interview</a>.</p> <p>For many decades, Sweden has gradually moved away from precisely these ideas of solidarity and personal sacrifice for the common good. Instead, Swedish governments promoted a more self-centred, individualist society, with a narrative of personal success, rather than a strong nation.</p> <p>\u201cThe ambition to get everyone prepared for war runs counter to the individualist ideals that dominated Swedish politics the last 40 years. We\u2019ve come a long way from that idealistic spirit, where everyone sits in the same boat,\u201d says Torbj\u00f6rn Nilsson, co-author of <a href=\"https://www.albertbonniersforlag.se/forfattare/8273/torbjorn-nilsson/\">High Above the Sea</a>, a critically acclaimed book on Sweden\u2019s Nato membership. </p> <p>He points out that after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Nyamko Sabuni, the then-leader of the centre-right Liberal party and a former minister in the rightwing government, suggested fleeing the country if Russia invaded. In a filmed conversation, <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/ledare/a/z7jbmK/blir-det-krig-drar-sabuni-till-norge\">Sabuni said</a>: \u201cIf it gets any worse, we will drive over to Norway.\u201d</p> <p>She had to leave her job shortly after the comments surfaced, but it probably captured a broadly shared sentiment in Sweden, where the idea of personal sacrifice for a common purpose has fallen out of favour.</p> <p>Since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, many voices in Sweden\u2019s national security establishment have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/01/sweden-nato-unprepared-vulnerable-attack\">raised concerns</a> over the shortcomings of the country\u2019s civic defence. As a result, in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-to-bring-back-military-service-military-defense/\">compulsory military service was reintroduced</a> for men and women born in or after 1999.</p> <p>But decades of austerity and deregulation still leaves Sweden with a lack of preparedness and civic infrastructure. For example, thousands of apartment buildings in Sweden that were once public are now privately owned, and their old bomb shelters have been converted into flats or basement gyms to maximise profits.</p> <p>This is not the first time the Swedish government has sent out a \u201cprepare for war\u201d booklet. A slimmer version appeared in 2018. Then it was widely criticised as an <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/swedish-government-accused-of-poor-war-communication-causing-anxiety-in-children/\">alarmist message that frightened children</a>, but six years later it seems rather prescient. A global pandemic has killed millions, the frequency of severe natural disasters caused by climate change has escalated dramatically, and there\u2019s no end in sight for Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in November, the US elected a Putin-friendly president, awkwardly timed with Sweden\u2019s entry into Nato.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/18/joe-biden-missile-decision-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy\">Joe Biden\u2019s last-gasp missile decision is momentous for Ukraine \u2013 but Putin will retaliate | Simon Tisdall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sweden has seen a series of ideological shifts over the past half-century. As a country, it tends to move quite uniformly between political doctrines. In the 1970s Sweden wanted to become the most social democratic country in the world, and more or less succeeded. French economist Thomas Piketty, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_Ideology\">in a recent book</a>, described Sweden in 1980 as a model for an egalitarian democracy.</p> <p>In the 1990s Sweden swung rapidly towards free-market reforms, deregulation and privatisation, and in the past decade the country has embraced authoritarian nationalism. This applies not just to the rightwing governing coalition, but also the Social Democrats, who increasingly <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/socialdemokraterna-vill-punktmarkera-unga-pa-vag-in-i-gangkriminalitet\">try to mimic</a> their Danish sister party by positioning themselves as tough on immigration and crime. </p> <p>But the problem for the government, and its attempt to raise awareness of the risks we face and to build domestic civic defence, is that Sweden\u2019s surge of nationalism doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into patriotism or civic solidarity.</p> <p>The new government booklet has an urgent message and often employs the rhetorical flourishes of Winston Churchill and John F Kennedy to convey it. \u201cWe live in uncertain times. Armed conflicts are currently being waged in our corner of the world. Terrorism, cyber attacks, and disinformation campaigns are being used to undermine and influence us,\u201d it warns. \u201cTo resist these threats, we must stand united.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is that Swedish citizens may no longer be particularly interested in unity or solidarity.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Gelin writes for the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter</p></li> </ul>",

But many of us are feeling a little shaken after a booklet with a soldier in camouflage holding a machine gun, with a fighter jet tearing through the sky in the background, landed on our door mats recently. The government booklet, titled \u201cIn case of crisis or war\u201d, was sent to every Swedish household as the threat of attack from Russia escalates. It signals the beginning of a new era in our country, with a bleak message about threats from war, natural disasters and pandemics. \u201cIf Sweden is attacked, everyone must do their part to defend Sweden\u2019s independence \u2013 and our democracy. We build resilience every day, together with our loved ones, colleagues, friends, and neighbours,\u201d it states. For more than two centuries Sweden maintained a policy of military non-alignment, but earlier this year the country joined Nato and the booklet was produced in response. It was written by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, which is responsible for issues concerning emergency management, public safety and civil defence. And many of its 30 pages contain practical advice in the event of war or disaster, including a checklist of things to have at home, such as a week\u2019s worth of drinking water (three litres a person a day) in storage containers, warm clothing and blankets, non-perishable food for people and pets, and a radio that isn\u2019t reliant on mains electricity. It also lists places to seek shelter if there is an air raid, such as cellars, underground garages and metro stations, and the different sirens to listen out for that will indicate the level of emergency. But primarily, it tells the citizens of Sweden to prepare for hard times, effectively saying: don\u2019t ask what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. The booklet\u2019s bleak message stunned some of our European neighbours, where Sweden might still be known mainly for centuries of neutrality and peace. The French news magazine Le Point had news of the pamphlet on the top of its website, highlighting the contrast between its stark language and the lingering image of Sweden as peaceful, while a British tabloid claimed that the government\u2019s message \u2013 along with similar instructions on how to prepare for emergencies recently issued by Norway and Finland \u2013 caused \u201cpanic\u201d across Europe, which is an absurd exaggeration. The challenge for the Swedish government is not that citizens might panic, but that many citizens have lost a sense of civic duty, in an increasingly atomised country. \u201cIf you take seriously what is written in this booklet, then you have made an act of solidarity for your country,\u201d Carl-Oskar Bohlin, the minister for civil defence who is responsible for the booklet, said in a recent interview. For many decades, Sweden has gradually moved away from precisely these ideas of solidarity and personal sacrifice for the common good. Instead, Swedish governments promoted a more self-centred, individualist society, with a narrative of personal success, rather than a strong nation. \u201cThe ambition to get everyone prepared for war runs counter to the individualist ideals that dominated Swedish politics the last 40 years. We\u2019ve come a long way from that idealistic spirit, where everyone sits in the same boat,\u201d says Torbj\u00f6rn Nilsson, co-author of High Above the Sea, a critically acclaimed book on Sweden\u2019s Nato membership. He points out that after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Nyamko Sabuni, the then-leader of the centre-right Liberal party and a former minister in the rightwing government, suggested fleeing the country if Russia invaded. In a filmed conversation, Sabuni said: \u201cIf it gets any worse, we will drive over to Norway.\u201d She had to leave her job shortly after the comments surfaced, but it probably captured a broadly shared sentiment in Sweden, where the idea of personal sacrifice for a common purpose has fallen out of favour. Since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, many voices in Sweden\u2019s national security establishment have raised concerns over the shortcomings of the country\u2019s civic defence. As a result, in 2017 compulsory military service was reintroduced for men and women born in or after 1999. But decades of austerity and deregulation still leaves Sweden with a lack of preparedness and civic infrastructure. For example, thousands of apartment buildings in Sweden that were once public are now privately owned, and their old bomb shelters have been converted into flats or basement gyms to maximise profits. This is not the first time the Swedish government has sent out a \u201cprepare for war\u201d booklet. A slimmer version appeared in 2018. Then it was widely criticised as an alarmist message that frightened children, but six years later it seems rather prescient. A global pandemic has killed millions, the frequency of severe natural disasters caused by climate change has escalated dramatically, and there\u2019s no end in sight for Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in November, the US elected a Putin-friendly president, awkwardly timed with Sweden\u2019s entry into Nato. Sweden has seen a series of ideological shifts over the past half-century. As a country, it tends to move quite uniformly between political doctrines. In the 1970s Sweden wanted to become the most social democratic country in the world, and more or less succeeded. French economist Thomas Piketty, in a recent book, described Sweden in 1980 as a model for an egalitarian democracy. In the 1990s Sweden swung rapidly towards free-market reforms, deregulation and privatisation, and in the past decade the country has embraced authoritarian nationalism. This applies not just to the rightwing governing coalition, but also the Social Democrats, who increasingly try to mimic their Danish sister party by positioning themselves as tough on immigration and crime. But the problem for the government, and its attempt to raise awareness of the risks we face and to build domestic civic defence, is that Sweden\u2019s surge of nationalism doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into patriotism or civic solidarity. The new government booklet has an urgent message and often employs the rhetorical flourishes of Winston Churchill and John F Kennedy to convey it. \u201cWe live in uncertain times. Armed conflicts are currently being waged in our corner of the world. Terrorism, cyber attacks, and disinformation campaigns are being used to undermine and influence us,\u201d it warns. \u201cTo resist these threats, we must stand united.\u201d The problem is that Swedish citizens may no longer be particularly interested in unity or solidarity.

      "body": "<p>Good morning. Cop29 in Baku <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/23/cop29-agrees-13tn-climate-finance-deal-but-campaigners-brand-it-a-betrayal\">finally finished at 5.31am local time yesterday</a>, more than 35 hours after it was due to conclude \u2013 and the extra time did not lead to a triumphant outcome.</p> <p>On the biggest issue under discussion, the transfer of climate finance from the developed to the developing world, the headline figure in the agreement was $1.3tn (\u00a31tn) by 2035. But that masked much smaller commitments in direct finance, mostly in the form of grants and low-interest loans, which amounted to only $300bn. Nor is the outcome an injustice whose impact is limited to the global South, of course: if the money isn\u2019t there to support a green energy transition in developing economies, temperatures will rise all over the world.</p> <p>Last night, as negotiators flew home from Azerbaijan, there was clear consensus among developing nations: \u201c$300bn by 2035 is a joke,\u201d one Nigerian delegate said. \u201cWe do not accept this.\u201d But with limited leverage to force any change and the Azeri presidency\u2019s gavel down on the deal, it is not obvious what other option there might be, at least for now.</p> <p>Inadequate though the deal is, nothing at a Cop summit is ever final. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the Guardian\u2019s environment editor <em><strong>Fiona Harvey</strong></em> in Baku, is about the significant reasons to view this summit as a failure \u2013 and the small seeds of hope that remain. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>UK weather </strong></em>| Storm Bert is expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/25/storm-bert-floods-uk-wales-england-updates\">cause further disruption</a> on Monday after torrential downpours caused \u201cdevastating\u201d flooding over the weekend and a major incident in Wales. At least five people have died in England and Wales since the storm hit.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Economy</strong></em> | A defiant Rachel Reeves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/25/rachel-reeves-rebuke-budget-critics-cbi\">will rebuke critics of her tax-raising budget on Monday</a>, telling disgruntled business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry that they have offered \u201cno alternatives\u201d. CBI director-general Rain Newton-Smith will meanwhile accuse Reeves of jeopardising economic growth, saying: \u201cTax rises like this must never again be simply done to business.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Britons detained abroad </strong></em>| Families of prominent British prisoners detained abroad have urged the foreign secretary to deliver on pledges to help secure their release with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/24/david-lammy-urged-promise-envoy-help-free-britons-held-abroad\"> signs of growing resistance from diplomats</a>. There are fears that they are resisting a plan to appoint a special envoy on those detained abroad without a fair trial lest it affect trade deals.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East </strong></em>| A Guardian investigation has found that Israel used a US munition to target and kill three journalists and wound three more in a 25 October attack in south Lebanon which legal experts have called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/25/killing-of-journalists-in-israeli-strike-could-be-a-war-legal-experts-say\">a potential war crime</a>. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Europe </strong></em>| A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, and will probably face leftist prime minister Marcel Ciolacu in a runoff in two weeks, an outcome that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/25/calin-georgescu-romania-election-hard-right-candidate\">rocked the country\u2019s political landscape</a>. Calin Georgescu led the polls with about 22% of the vote after nearly 93% of votes were counted.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: Why $300bn isn\u2019t anything like enough</h2>    <p>The strongest point in favour of the deal struck in Baku is that it is better than the alternative \u2013 that is, the summit ending without an agreement, meaning no increase to climate finance to the developing world. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d Fiona Harvey said. \u201cBut it is also less bad than nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Carbon Brief <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop29-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-baku/\">has an excellent, exhaustive summary</a> of Cop29\u2019s vexed final days. Tina Stege, the climate envoy of the Marshall Islands, summed up the mood in the most vulnerable countries. \u201cWe are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t nearly enough, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p> <p>Here are some pointers on what the deal looks like.</p> <p>***</p> <p>How much are developed countries offering?</p> <p>With many world leaders absent from Baku \u2013 only 80 heads of state, against 154 last time \u2013 there was early pessimism about the prospects for meaningful action. Countries in the developing world had called for $1.3tn a year by 2035 in financing to help them adapt to the consequences of climate change and transition away from fossil fuels.

As much as $300bn sounds, it is about 10% of what is invested in global energy infrastructure each year.

Meanwhile, many of those same nations are paying huge sums in debt service that severely hamper their ability to invest in climate mitigation projects \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-climate-finance-at-world-bank-and-imf-spring-meetings-2024/\">$443.5bn in 2022</a>, with China now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/06/china-worlds-biggest-debt-collector-as-poorer-nations-struggle-with-its-loans\">the world\u2019s biggest bilateral lender</a> even as it is responsible for about a third of the world\u2019s current emissions.</p> <p>Any concept of reparations is off-limits at Cop summits, considered unachievable and likely to close down negotiations \u2013 which adds to the sense of injustice in the developing world.

But there are reasons to be sceptical. Individual countries have not yet been required to set out their national commitments towards meeting the overall goal, and past experience suggests that they will probably fall short. Meanwhile, new taxes and private sector investment need to be widely introduced to be effective, and are vulnerable to local political and economic crises.</p> <p>\u201cNone of it really exists yet,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cA lot of these things are not that difficult to put in place, and it is very important to keep talking about things like a modest wealth tax so that it is understood as a reasonable idea. But there is a danger that they will be pie in the sky.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Are there any grounds for optimism?</p> <p>You can find some, but they\u2019re pretty scant. The deal at least reaches the $1.3tn figure in theory, and developing countries have secured a commitment to a \u201croadmap to 1.3tn\u201d that will act as a yardstick for future progress. And although carbon markets have failed in the past, new rules agreed in Baku could do a better job of funding climate mitigation projects and capping emissions, as Patrick Greenfield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/cop29s-new-carbon-market-rules-offer-hope-after-scandal-and-deadlock?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">explains here</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one major source of anger at Cop29 was how the summit was managed by the Azeri hosts, who were widely viewed as falling short. The next round is in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, where there are hopes that the organisers will prove more effective. \u201cThey wanted a relatively straightforward Cop focused on national plans to reduce emissions,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cNow they have to clean up a bit of a mess.\u201d</p> <p>It is also true that the Baku summit was in danger of failing totally \u2013 leading to the collapse of the least-bad mechanism available for international cooperation against the climate crisis.

As things stand, most climate scientists consider the goal of limiting temperature increases to 1.5C above preindustrial levels as already out of reach. Even if every country on earth honoured their current commitments, the world would warm by about 2.7 degrees. \u201cIf countries don\u2019t have serious commitments to keeping below 1.5 in Bel\u00e9m, we will be toast,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cIt will be too late.\u201d</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>It\u2019s always weirdly satisfying to learn what <strong>great chefs</strong>, like Abby Lee pictured above, eat when they\u2019re off duty, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/23/cocktails-kebabs-and-instant-gravy-what-10-top-chefs-really-eat-in-a-day\">Saturday magazine\u2019s cover story</a> \u2013 with great pictures by Jay Brooks \u2013 more than does the job.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Cop29 in Baku finally finished at 5.31am local time yesterday, more than 35 hours after it was due to conclude \u2013 and the extra time did not lead to a triumphant outcome. On the biggest issue under discussion, the transfer of climate finance from the developed to the developing world, the headline figure in the agreement was $1.3tn (\u00a31tn) by 2035. But that masked much smaller commitments in direct finance, mostly in the form of grants and low-interest loans, which amounted to only $300bn. Nor is the outcome an injustice whose impact is limited to the global South, of course: if the money isn\u2019t there to support a green energy transition in developing economies, temperatures will rise all over the world. Last night, as negotiators flew home from Azerbaijan, there was clear consensus among developing nations: \u201c$300bn by 2035 is a joke,\u201d one Nigerian delegate said. \u201cWe do not accept this.\u201d But with limited leverage to force any change and the Azeri presidency\u2019s gavel down on the deal, it is not obvious what other option there might be, at least for now. Inadequate though the deal is, nothing at a Cop summit is ever final. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the Guardian\u2019s environment editor Fiona Harvey in Baku, is about the significant reasons to view this summit as a failure \u2013 and the small seeds of hope that remain. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK weather | Storm Bert is expected to cause further disruption on Monday after torrential downpours caused \u201cdevastating\u201d flooding over the weekend and a major incident in Wales. At least five people have died in England and Wales since the storm hit. Economy | A defiant Rachel Reeves will rebuke critics of her tax-raising budget on Monday, telling disgruntled business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry that they have offered \u201cno alternatives\u201d. CBI director-general Rain Newton-Smith will meanwhile accuse Reeves of jeopardising economic growth, saying: \u201cTax rises like this must never again be simply done to business.\u201d Britons detained abroad | Families of prominent British prisoners detained abroad have urged the foreign secretary to deliver on pledges to help secure their release with signs of growing resistance from diplomats. There are fears that they are resisting a plan to appoint a special envoy on those detained abroad without a fair trial lest it affect trade deals. Middle East | A Guardian investigation has found that Israel used a US munition to target and kill three journalists and wound three more in a 25 October attack in south Lebanon which legal experts have called a potential war crime. Europe | A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, and will probably face leftist prime minister Marcel Ciolacu in a runoff in two weeks, an outcome that has rocked the country\u2019s political landscape. Calin Georgescu led the polls with about 22% of the vote after nearly 93% of votes were counted. In depth: Why $300bn isn\u2019t anything like enough The strongest point in favour of the deal struck in Baku is that it is better than the alternative \u2013 that is, the summit ending without an agreement, meaning no increase to climate finance to the developing world. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d Fiona Harvey said. \u201cBut it is also less bad than nothing.\u201d Carbon Brief has an excellent, exhaustive summary of Cop29\u2019s vexed final days. Tina Stege, the climate envoy of the Marshall Islands, summed up the mood in the most vulnerable countries. \u201cWe are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t nearly enough, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d Here are some pointers on what the deal looks like. *** How much are developed countries offering? With many world leaders absent from Baku \u2013 only 80 heads of state, against 154 last time \u2013 there was early pessimism about the prospects for meaningful action. Countries in the developing world had called for $1.3tn a year by 2035 in financing to help them adapt to the consequences of climate change and transition away from fossil fuels. That figure is in line with a target published by the authoritative Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance. And it does feature in the final text. But, as Fiona notes in this analysis piece, the deal says that: The money could come not just in the form of the grants and very low-interest loans that developing countries need, but \u2026 from a \u201cwide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral and alternative sources\u201d. Money will be \u201cmobilised\u201d rather than provided \u2013 a nice distinction that allows for the inclusion of private sector co-investing to be counted alongside public money from government budgets and development banks. The direct commitment from the rich industrialised world is much lower: $300bn. That may be a significant increase on the existing $100bn a year goal, but that was set in 2009 and not reached until 2022, two years after the target date. While it will largely be provided in grants and loans, the text also allows for the counting of private co-investing \u2013 and while in practice this will only be a small share of the total, it is viewed by some developing nations as a loophole. There is no allowance for the impact of inflation, further eroding the financing\u2019s real value. Some delegates from rich countries acknowledged the inadequacy of the offer. But they note that the prevailing mood in the west \u2013 with the impact of inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the impending Trump presidency among other political and economic crises \u2013 is not conducive to a more ambitious figure. \u201cIn their defence, for developed countries to be able to stump up this cash requires them to sell it to their people,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cAnd even though most people in most countries want to see serious climate action, the success of right-wing parties at the ballot box makes it very difficult to achieve. We\u2019re living in an Alice in Wonderland situation in which almost everyone agrees what is good for the planet, and yet the people who disagree are in the ascendant.\u201d *** Why is the money important? Headlines about billions in commitments from wealthier countries may understandably lead to a perception that this is about charity, or reparations. But while it is true that some of the money will be spent on protecting people living in the global South from the worst impacts of the climate crisis, a large proportion of the finance provided will be spent on transitioning to green sources of energy like solar farms and wind turbines. That means it is also crucial to blunting global temperature rises that will ultimately devastate western economies and lives as well. As UN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres put it: \u201cFinance is not a handout. It\u2019s an investment against the devastation that unchecked climate chaos will inflict on us all.\u201d *** Is $300bn a year a fair figure? Absolutely not. As much as $300bn sounds, it is about 10% of what is invested in global energy infrastructure each year. And even the $1.3tn overall figure falls well short of any just accounting of which countries did the damage. An LSE study last year estimated that countries in the global South would be entitled to about $192tn by 2050 on the basis of the share of the global \u201ccarbon budget\u201d consumed by the global North. \u201cIf there was any justice in the world, developing countries would be receiving many trillions a year from the countries that emitted so much for so long,\u201d Fiona said. Meanwhile, many of those same nations are paying huge sums in debt service that severely hamper their ability to invest in climate mitigation projects \u2013 $443.5bn in 2022, with China now the world\u2019s biggest bilateral lender even as it is responsible for about a third of the world\u2019s current emissions. Any concept of reparations is off-limits at Cop summits, considered unachievable and likely to close down negotiations \u2013 which adds to the sense of injustice in the developing world. As Samoa\u2019s natural resources minister Cedric Schuster asked: \u201cIs this how we treat the countries with the moral high ground in the process, who stand to lose the most and have already lost so much?\u201d *** Is it enough? That\u2019s a slightly different, and even more complicated, question. \u201cThe estimate of the core finance needed to leverage other forms of investment provided by the high level expert group was about $300bn a year,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cThat would need to come with about $500bn a year from private sector investment, and the remainder would be new forms of finance \u2013 a whole mixture of things, from carbon trading to taxes on fossil fuels and frequent flyer levies.\u201d In theory, $300bn could be enough to kickstart that wider investment and get somewhere close to the overall figure. But there are reasons to be sceptical. Individual countries have not yet been required to set out their national commitments towards meeting the overall goal, and past experience suggests that they will probably fall short.

      "bodyText": "A museum dedicated to the flamboyant British poet and satirist Lord Byron is due to open in the northern Italian city of Ravenna, housed in the same building where he pursued an intense affair with the wife of an aristocrat and completed some of his most famous works. Byron unabashedly moved in 1819 into Palazzo Guiccioli, owned by the husband of Countess Teresa Guiccioli, whom he met at a party in Venice. The sprawling residence in the heart of the city has been restored by the Cassa di Risparmio di Ravenna Foundation and from 29 November visitors will be able to wander through the rooms where the romance took place and where he knuckled down to complete masterpieces including Don Juan, Sardanapalus, The Prophecy of Dante and the final canto of Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage. One of the rooms contains tokens of love kept by the countess, including letters, jewellery, locks of the poet\u2019s curly hair and shards of his sunburned skin. The museum will partly be dedicated to the Risorgimento, the 19th-century Italian movement for unification, owing to Byron\u2019s connections to figures involved with the Carbonari, an informal network of secret revolutionary societies that played a role in the unification process. \u201cThe idea is to link three aspects of who Lord Byron was \u2013 the poet, the lover, and the person oriented towards freedom,\u201d said a spokesperson for the museum. Byron died in 1824 in what is now Greece. He had several affairs during his life but the countess was his final great love. \u201cThe love for Teresa led Byron to transform himself and, without becoming a saint, he changed his life,\u201d said Antonio Patuelli, the president of the foundation. Visitors to the museum, which the foundation said was the only one in the world specifically dedicated to Byron, will also be able to relive the poet\u2019s experiences in Italy and learn what it was about the country that inspired him, thanks to interactive virtual reality technology. Byron fled England for mainland Europe in 1816, leaving behind a trail of scandalous affairs and debt, never to return.

The euro sank below $1.04 against the dollar, the weakest level since November 2022, last Friday after a survey of European purchasing managers showed eurozone private sector output has fallen this month. The threat of new US tariffs on imports from Europe has pushed the euro lower since the US election \u2013 it was worth $1.09 on 5 November but has since dropped against the dollar for three weeks running. It ended last week at $1.041, but could have further to fall once Donald Trump\u2019s new administration lays out its economic plans. Trump has floated the idea of imposing a 60% to 100% levy on Chinese products and a 10% to 20% levy on goods from the rest of the world, which would make European exports to the US less competitive and could damage economic growth. Deutsche Bank analyst George Saravelos has calculated that the full impact of Trump imposing new tariffs, clamping down on immigration and increasing net fiscal spending by extending tax cuts is only 30% \u201cpriced in\u201d by financial markets, indicating that the currency could experience a significant sell-off if the measures are implemented. Saravelos told clients last week that \u201cthe bottom line is the market is still not pricing a lot of Trump\u201d. \u201cWe remain bullish on the dollar and would view euro-to-dollar levels of 1.00 as pricing the intensity of the Trump policy mix at closer to 50%, with potential for even greater downside depending on what happens next year,\u201d Saravelos added. Last Friday\u2019s dire PMI survey showed eurozone business activity moved back into contraction in November, sparking a flurry of bets on steep cuts to interest rates in the single currency bloc next month. Money market pricing suggests investors now price a 50% chance of a half-point, or 50-basis point, rate cut at the European Central Bank\u2019s December meeting, with a smaller quarter-point cut now fully priced in. The eurozone deposit rate is 3.25%, following a cut last month. The fortunes of several key eurozone economies are in the spotlight with Germany, traditionally the engine of the bloc, expected to hold a general election fought against the backdrop of a stagnating economy and France forecast to experience a slowdown in growth. \u201cThe composite eurozone PMI slumped to 48.1, thanks to an unexpected dive to 49.2 in the services sector that has hugely increased the odds of a 50bp rate cut in September,\u201d said foreign exchange market analyst Kyle Chapman at Ballinger Group. \u201cThe euro is decisively breaking through key levels, falling below 1.04 for the first time since the energy crisis in late 2022. Having crossed this threshold, parity is no longer a huge leap,\u201d Chapman added. However, Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary could possibly offer the euro a reprieve. The nomination of Bessent, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, is \u201cexpected to receive a tick of approval from global markets\u201d, predicted Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, due to his \u201cexpertise\u201d and previously stated preference that \u201ctariffs be layered in gradually\u201d. Bessent told Bloomberg TV this month that falling inflation would lead to lower interest rates, and \u201ca market-based dollar depreciation\u201d. However, economists expect new US trade tariffs to be inflationary, leading to higher interest rates and a strong dollar. In this scenario, the US Federal Reserve keeps US interest rates high to fight inflation, while the ECB cuts borrowing costs sharply to fight off a eurozone recession.

It has a licence to extract 1.59bn litres of water a year from boreholes in Sidcup, Kent for its soft drinks. On top of that, it has the right to take 377m litres for its bottled water brands Glaceau Smartwater and Abbey Well from Morpeth in Northumberland.</p> <p>The French company Sources Alma is one of the biggest players in the UK water market, supplying bottled water to Tesco and Asda as well as producing its own Aqua Pura brand. Through its British subsidiary Roxane, it has the right to extract 1.5bn litres annually from Armathwaite in Cumbria, where it bottles Tesco\u2019s Ashbeck water.

Coca-Cola extracts the largest amount of freshwater of any drinks company in England, the data obtained through freedom of information legislation shows. It has a licence to extract 1.59bn litres of water a year from boreholes in Sidcup, Kent for its soft drinks. On top of that, it has the right to take 377m litres for its bottled water brands Glaceau Smartwater and Abbey Well from Morpeth in Northumberland. The French company Sources Alma is one of the biggest players in the UK water market, supplying bottled water to Tesco and Asda as well as producing its own Aqua Pura brand. Through its British subsidiary Roxane, it has the right to extract 1.5bn litres annually from Armathwaite in Cumbria, where it bottles Tesco\u2019s Ashbeck water. It also bottles large quantities of water in Staffordshire, where it produces Tesco\u2019s Elmhurst brand, but this spring water is supplied by a third company \u2013 South Staffordshire Water plc \u2013 so the quantities are not publicly available.

      "body": "<p>The day that wokeness died. That has been one of the primary analyses of Donald Trump\u2019s resounding election victory: that it was a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4981585-america-rejects-woke-democrats/\">resounding rejection</a> of the \u201cwoke\u201d left and the casting off of the shackles of political correctness. According to sections of the media and political establishment<em>,</em> people are tired of being harangued and scolded for not using the right language, annoyed by a constant focus on race and identity, and alarmed by a new orthodoxy of radical politics eager to please individual groups at the expense of common sense. \u201cThe era,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/us-election-donald-trump-woke-blm-latinx-pronouns-critical-race-theory-defund-police-b1192637.html\">summarised one British journalist</a>, \u201cof Black Lives Matter, Latinx, critical race theory, pronouns and defunding the police is over.\u201d It\u2019s a neat conclusion \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to see this result as a rejection of <em>something</em>. But was that something \u201cwoke\u201d values in particular?</p> <p>As a starting point, it is worth looking at Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign rather than the assumptions about it. In reality, she seemed to avoid any focus on identity and \u201cwokeness\u201d. She didn\u2019t make much of her race, or even her gender, choosing instead to ground her identity in her background as a middle-class person raised in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kamalaharris/p/DAWaWizNxgQ/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">rental household</a> by a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1203659107501105\">hardworking mother</a>. Her <a href=\"https://wordinblack.com/2024/09/how-kamala-harris-talks-about-race/\">position on race</a> softened from when she was running in 2019: she previously backed \u201csome form\u201d of reparations but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/03/kamala-harris-reparations/\">did not stake out</a> a position as part of her bid. Trump wanted Harris \u201cto say something to turn off white voters. She was wise not to take the bait,\u201d wrote the author Keith Boykin. She was hardline on immigration, keen to show that she is a gun owner (memorably telling Oprah Winfrey: \u201cIf someone breaks into my house they\u2019re getting shot\u201d). And she was <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/23/five-takeaways-from-harris-interview/75807424007/\">evasive on gender-affirming care</a> for transgender Americans.</p> <p>And so this narrative of succumbing to \u201cBig Woke\u201d, according to the American journalist Jack Mirkinson, \u201cbears virtually no resemblance to the actual campaign we all just suffered through\u201d. Woke talking points were a key part not of Harris\u2019s campaign but of Trump\u2019s \u2013 he said that Harris suddenly \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/06/kamala-harris-is-mixed-race-im-mixed-race-and-donald-trump-is-a-dusty-old-relic\">became a Black person</a>\u201d to capitalise on her race, and his campaign <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/g-s1-28932/donald-trump-transgender-ads-kamala-harris\">spent millions</a> on ads about transgender rights. Welcome to the culture war \u2013 where only the right is really fighting, and the other side is helping it out by punching itself in the face.</p> <p>So why are progressives so keen to take on this narrative, one that has even now migrated to the UK, where the US election result is seen as a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/i-take-jaguars-woeful-woke-rebrand-personally-mtc8f3gdg\">cautionary tale</a>? One reason is that it offers a simple culprit \u2013 and a mistake easy to avoid next time. It\u2019s far more straightforward to blame an abstract \u201cwokeness\u201d than to reckon with the fact that Harris ran a broadly right-of-centre campaign and still lost. It also conjures up a convenient voter, one who is more offended by language than by the promise of mass deportations. That then makes these voters retrievable rather than subject to big shifts, both of <a href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-democrats-big-and-failed-bet/\">class dealignment</a> and the transformation of parties formerly supported by the working classes into ones that attract higher-income voters.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a big tell. The readiness to repudiate all forms of identity politics and group them under the \u201cbad woke\u201d umbrella is less about policy than about perception \u2013 social justice is seen as somehow tainting the liberal cause because, well, social justice is the stuff of scruffy radical activism, not upper-class power. Some of this is a broader backlash to a near-decade of breakthrough movements such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>. But it also shows how these never really found a home in the Democratic party in a meaningful way and are seen only as a way to appeal to certain voting blocs. When those voters don\u2019t show up, this is seen as the fault of identity politics itself rather than the fact that it is pursued in ways that are shallow and entirely divorced from voters\u2019 lives.</p> <p>There is an irony to all this. Because central to the lack of appeal of identity politics is its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/olufemi-o-taiwo-identity-politics-and-elite-capture/\">elite capture</a>\u201d by exactly the sort of people who are now distancing themselves from it. Black Lives Matter is a case study. \u201cAllyship\u201d and \u201cdoing the work\u201d, buzzwords of the early 2020s, produced a frankly mortifying era in which white liberal politicians took the knee and this symbolic act took up an unbelievable amount of space in public discourse <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12326827/england-players-being-booed-for-taking-a-knee-considered-a-racist-act-by-officials-according-to-senior-football-administrator\">from sports</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/16/gb-news-pulls-guto-harri-off-air-taking-the-knee-row\">the media</a>. \u201cDoing the work\u201d focused on interpersonal dynamics of racism rather than on structural ones. Diversity became about the visibility of people of colour and \u201cfirsts\u201d separate from \u2013 and I apologise for this now fatally unfashionable synopsis \u2013 the broader systemic impact of this on poverty, poor public housing, unequal policing and access to health care. (Not that visibility and institutional reform are necessarily in competition, but only one pays dividends to white people.) Anything more gnarly, and crucially anything that engaged with demands and needs as expressed by Black activists who had been doing their own \u201cwork\u201d for years, was roundly rejected. Discussions on policing became reduced to scoffing at the unrealistic ask of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defunding the police</a>\u201d rather than what that demand actually entailed, which, as even a cursory glance shows, is not to abolish policing but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/04/radical-police-not-fit-for-purpose\">invest in preventive measures</a> at the community level.</p> <p>Even then, I am not sure that this diluted vision has turned off voters to such an extent that it would drive them into the arms of Trump. But it does act as a reflection of a superficial and flaccid approach that has no edge or universal vision.

      "bodyText": "The day that wokeness died. That has been one of the primary analyses of Donald Trump\u2019s resounding election victory: that it was a resounding rejection of the \u201cwoke\u201d left and the casting off of the shackles of political correctness. According to sections of the media and political establishment, people are tired of being harangued and scolded for not using the right language, annoyed by a constant focus on race and identity, and alarmed by a new orthodoxy of radical politics eager to please individual groups at the expense of common sense. \u201cThe era,\u201d summarised one British journalist, \u201cof Black Lives Matter, Latinx, critical race theory, pronouns and defunding the police is over.\u201d It\u2019s a neat conclusion \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to see this result as a rejection of something. But was that something \u201cwoke\u201d values in particular? As a starting point, it is worth looking at Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign rather than the assumptions about it. In reality, she seemed to avoid any focus on identity and \u201cwokeness\u201d. She didn\u2019t make much of her race, or even her gender, choosing instead to ground her identity in her background as a middle-class person raised in a rental household by a hardworking mother. Her position on race softened from when she was running in 2019: she previously backed \u201csome form\u201d of reparations but did not stake out a position as part of her bid. Trump wanted Harris \u201cto say something to turn off white voters. She was wise not to take the bait,\u201d wrote the author Keith Boykin. She was hardline on immigration, keen to show that she is a gun owner (memorably telling Oprah Winfrey: \u201cIf someone breaks into my house they\u2019re getting shot\u201d). And she was evasive on gender-affirming care for transgender Americans. And so this narrative of succumbing to \u201cBig Woke\u201d, according to the American journalist Jack Mirkinson, \u201cbears virtually no resemblance to the actual campaign we all just suffered through\u201d. Woke talking points were a key part not of Harris\u2019s campaign but of Trump\u2019s \u2013 he said that Harris suddenly \u201cbecame a Black person\u201d to capitalise on her race, and his campaign spent millions on ads about transgender rights. Welcome to the culture war \u2013 where only the right is really fighting, and the other side is helping it out by punching itself in the face. So why are progressives so keen to take on this narrative, one that has even now migrated to the UK, where the US election result is seen as a cautionary tale? One reason is that it offers a simple culprit \u2013 and a mistake easy to avoid next time. It\u2019s far more straightforward to blame an abstract \u201cwokeness\u201d than to reckon with the fact that Harris ran a broadly right-of-centre campaign and still lost. It also conjures up a convenient voter, one who is more offended by language than by the promise of mass deportations. That then makes these voters retrievable rather than subject to big shifts, both of class dealignment and the transformation of parties formerly supported by the working classes into ones that attract higher-income voters. It\u2019s also a big tell. The readiness to repudiate all forms of identity politics and group them under the \u201cbad woke\u201d umbrella is less about policy than about perception \u2013 social justice is seen as somehow tainting the liberal cause because, well, social justice is the stuff of scruffy radical activism, not upper-class power. Some of this is a broader backlash to a near-decade of breakthrough movements such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. But it also shows how these never really found a home in the Democratic party in a meaningful way and are seen only as a way to appeal to certain voting blocs. When those voters don\u2019t show up, this is seen as the fault of identity politics itself rather than the fact that it is pursued in ways that are shallow and entirely divorced from voters\u2019 lives. There is an irony to all this. Because central to the lack of appeal of identity politics is its \u201celite capture\u201d by exactly the sort of people who are now distancing themselves from it. Black Lives Matter is a case study. \u201cAllyship\u201d and \u201cdoing the work\u201d, buzzwords of the early 2020s, produced a frankly mortifying era in which white liberal politicians took the knee and this symbolic act took up an unbelievable amount of space in public discourse from sports to the media. \u201cDoing the work\u201d focused on interpersonal dynamics of racism rather than on structural ones. Diversity became about the visibility of people of colour and \u201cfirsts\u201d separate from \u2013 and I apologise for this now fatally unfashionable synopsis \u2013 the broader systemic impact of this on poverty, poor public housing, unequal policing and access to health care. (Not that visibility and institutional reform are necessarily in competition, but only one pays dividends to white people.) Anything more gnarly, and crucially anything that engaged with demands and needs as expressed by Black activists who had been doing their own \u201cwork\u201d for years, was roundly rejected. Discussions on policing became reduced to scoffing at the unrealistic ask of \u201cdefunding the police\u201d rather than what that demand actually entailed, which, as even a cursory glance shows, is not to abolish policing but invest in preventive measures at the community level. Even then, I am not sure that this diluted vision has turned off voters to such an extent that it would drive them into the arms of Trump. But it does act as a reflection of a superficial and flaccid approach that has no edge or universal vision. This is particularly dangerous when there is no vividly defined unified and unifying policy for change, rendering a rightwing version of wokeness sharper and more compelling. In Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump, the academic Asad Haider identifies the power of this missing universalism, one that is \u201ccreated and recreated in the act of insurgency\u201d against a system in which there are interlocking oppressions but only one common enemy.

In short, the universal problem facing people of all identities in the US and the UK is hostility to those who lack capital in all it forms. To greater and lesser extents, our economies are based around social mobility rather than the ability to live in dignity without it, while ever-higher barriers to prosperity are erected and our public infrastructure is inadequate at almost every level.

      "bodyText": "The Northern Territory government has been told it must overhaul its response to family violence to stop women and children being killed. The NT coroner on Monday handed down inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women, making 35 recommendations. Coroner Elisabeth Armitage, who became emotional while delivering the findings, made clear that the wide-ranging recommendations should be implemented in full to save lives. The inquest was held into the deaths of Miss Yunupi\u014bu, Ngeygo Ragurrk, Kumarn Rubuntja and Kumanjayi Haywood. All four women reported fears for their safety to authorities or loved ones in the weeks, months and even years before they were killed. Their killers had histories of family violence and were known to police. The recommendations included that the NT government should fund a peak body to tackle family and sexual violence, increase investment in alcohol and drug rehabilitation and the Aboriginal Interpreter Service, expand a specialist family and sexual violence court, commit to developing alternatives to custody for perpetrators, and increase its core baseline funding for crisis services. The NT police were also told it should commit to a \u201csignificantly expanded and appropriately resourced\u201d domestic, family and sexual violence command in Alice Springs and Darwin, which would be headed by an assistant commissioner and include permanent positions and a training unit that would ensure the force was aware of best practice in response to the issue.

These included the ongoing impacts of colonisation, including the impact of intergenerational trauma, systemic disadvantage and discrimination, cultural dislocation and removal of children, entrenched community attitudes towards violence, the expense of service delivery and challenges of recruiting and retaining skilled labour, geographical distance and remoteness of some areas, and a lack of basic infrastructure. She said the gross overrepresentation of Aboriginal women in the territory\u2019s domestic and family violence statistics must mean there were factors that contributed \u201cto their unique vulnerability\u201d. This included trauma, loss and grief in families and communities, and chronic disadvantage in many forms including poverty, housing instability and mental illness. Armitage also noted, however, the muted response to the deaths of Aboriginal women at the hands of violent men. \u201cThe shocking rate of Aboriginal women being killed as a result of domestic violence in the NT has largely been met with silence from the broader territory and Australian communities, and a persistent inadequate allocation of resources to address this complex issue. \u201cI take judicial notice of the public outpourings of grief and outrage following the deaths of non-Aboriginal women, most often in other parts of Australia, and the political and legislative responses triggered by these deaths. \u201cThat the deaths of Aboriginal women in the NT does not evoke the same reaction is indicative of systemic racism in the way their voices go unheard: the belief that these women are somehow less deserving of our grief, outrage and our collective response.\u201d Armitage said that while she had heard evidence about the failures of individual police officers in responding to specific family violence cases, she had decided against naming these officers as her focus was on \u201csystemic failings and necessary systemic change\u201d.",

Parts of western Sydney are forecast to approach 40C on Tuesday and Wednesday during a pre-summer hot spell spanning a week of 30C-plus days. Heatwave conditions in eastern parts of NSW will be in the low- to severe-intensity range, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The Australian Energy Market Operator on Monday issued multiple so-called lack of reserve alerts for the two states, including the highest level-3 forecast for NSW on Wednesday afternoon. That alert was later cancelled, only to be replaced by an LOR3 warning for Thursday afternoon, as one indication of the lingering heatwave. As of Monday afternoon, NSW faced the possibility of an \u201cinterrupted supply\u201d, or blackouts, reaching as much as 205 megawatts at 3.30pm (AEDT) on Thursday. The period when supply may not meet demand \u2013 without further market responses \u2013 was from 3pm to 4pm AEDT. \u201cHigh temperatures and strong electricity demand, combined with some generation outages, are causing tight electricity supply forecasts in NSW tomorrow and Wednesday afternoon,\u201d Aemo said in a statement on Monday morning. \u201cAemo has alerted the energy industry and is working with power station operators and transmission businesses to boost electricity availability,\u201d it said.

Indications that south-eastern Australia is facing its most extensive belt of heat have been clear for days. As of this morning, almost six gigawatts of coal-fired power stations were unavailable because of planned and unplanned maintenance, according to Dylan McConnell, an energy specialist at the University of NSW. McConnell said about half of the unavailable coal capacity was because of scheduled maintenance, noting that such outages were typical in the lead-up to summer. \u201cThe period [for] maintenance windows might be getting shorter because these hot days are stretching later into March and earlier in November, and you need availability over winter as well,\u201d he said. Even without any blackouts, both NSW and Queensland could expect volatile pricing in the wholesale power market later this week, McConnell said. The NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, said the state government was holding off any official call to reduce power to conserve supplies at this point, although \u201cwe\u2019re obviously keeping a close eye on it\u201d. She said the \u201cfirst thing\u201d, though, was for people to take care of themselves in the coming heat. \u201cYou should drink water, you should check in on neighbours and you should think about whether you need to walk out in the middle of the day in the beating hot sun.\u201d The public should consider whether \u201cevery single light needed to be on\u201d in the house or whether air-conditioners needed to be set at 19C, Sharpe added. Separately, fire danger risks in NSW were likely to remain in the \u201cmedium\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d category in coming days. The likelihood of light winds and the fact the landscape hasn\u2019t dried out \u2013 yet \u2013 will spare the state more severe fire conditions for now, according to the Rural Fire Service. Similar moderate fire danger risks also apply for Queensland. A few temperature records have already fallen. Coonawarra in south-east South Australia had a November maximum temperature record, with its 37.9C on Friday eclipsing the previous high by 0.1C, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Essendon airport, meanwhile, clocked up two days (37.1C and 37.5C) on Friday and Saturday, the first time in its 54 years of records that site had had two November days in a row above 37C. For Melbourne, it was the city\u2019s first back-to-back November days above 35C since 2009, the BoM said. Mount Gambier in south-east South Australia, meanwhile, was among the sites to set their highest minimum November temperatures. Its 23.4C on Saturday exceeded the previous record of 22.7C at a site with 80 years of data. Ballarat Aerodrome, with 67 years of records, similarly set a record high minimum for November, with 22.9C about 0.8C above the previous high. Behind the heatwave came some heavy fall, with a bureau spokesperson saying: \u201cA number of stations stretching from central South Australia to north-west Victoria had their wettest two-day rainfall total in November for at least 10 years.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Morning fog has reduced the visible landscape to a few tens of metres, and it takes the rhythm of my strides \u2013 up, two-three-four; down, two-three-four \u2013 to remind me that beneath the sward, this pasture is still rippled like a ribcage from the till and turn of long-ago strip farming. Post-enclosure, most of these riggs and furrows were lost to plough or plantation, leaving just these few in areas of lightly grazed and assiduously picturesque pasture. Elsewhere, the terrain became one of fields and hedges.</p> <p>But change is coming again. Adjacent to the tellingly named Bog&nbsp;Hall, an area comparable to that inside York city walls is almost&nbsp;a year into <a href=\"https://www.castlehoward.co.uk/Display.aspx?iid=11289\">a nature restoration scheme</a>.</p>    <p>The fields are looking predictably scruffy, hedges are expanding, old ruts have filled with water. There will be much more of that when the long-awaited habitat engineers arrive. While most authorised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/27/country-diary-darth-vader-soundalike-an-ungrateful-beaver-north-yorkshire\">beaver reintroductions</a> in the UK have been in small enclosures, here&nbsp;the plan is to give them 450&nbsp;acres to work with, alongside pigs and large grazers that will churn and prune and trample and further invigorate ecological processes. I&nbsp;cannot wait to see it.</p> <p>The core of the site is a damp woodland, an already diverse mixture of trees including birch, oak, ash, hornbeam, hazel, elder and holly. Most are young, with skinny, race-for-the-light stems, but among them are some significantly girthier oaks, with spreading branches. Trees are eloquent teachers if you ask good questions, and I no longer feel even slightly self-conscious talking to them. These tell me they know a thing&nbsp;or&nbsp;two about change \u2013 <em>of course, when we were young, this&nbsp;was all fields</em>.</p> <p>I approach one whose trunk is particularly carbuncled and whiskery with clusters of small shoots. Such epicormic growth can be a sign of stress, an attempt to power-up following injury or other change in circumstance.

      "bodyText": "Morning fog has reduced the visible landscape to a few tens of metres, and it takes the rhythm of my strides \u2013 up, two-three-four; down, two-three-four \u2013 to remind me that beneath the sward, this pasture is still rippled like a ribcage from the till and turn of long-ago strip farming. Post-enclosure, most of these riggs and furrows were lost to plough or plantation, leaving just these few in areas of lightly grazed and assiduously picturesque pasture. Elsewhere, the terrain became one of fields and hedges. But change is coming again. Adjacent to the tellingly named Bog Hall, an area comparable to that inside York city walls is almost a year into a nature restoration scheme. The fields are looking predictably scruffy, hedges are expanding, old ruts have filled with water. There will be much more of that when the long-awaited habitat engineers arrive. While most authorised beaver reintroductions in the UK have been in small enclosures, here the plan is to give them 450 acres to work with, alongside pigs and large grazers that will churn and prune and trample and further invigorate ecological processes. I cannot wait to see it. The core of the site is a damp woodland, an already diverse mixture of trees including birch, oak, ash, hornbeam, hazel, elder and holly. Most are young, with skinny, race-for-the-light stems, but among them are some significantly girthier oaks, with spreading branches. Trees are eloquent teachers if you ask good questions, and I no longer feel even slightly self-conscious talking to them. These tell me they know a thing or two about change \u2013 of course, when we were young, this was all fields. I approach one whose trunk is particularly carbuncled and whiskery with clusters of small shoots. Such epicormic growth can be a sign of stress, an attempt to power-up following injury or other change in circumstance. But on this tree, each twiggy cluster is capturing leaves falling from above, resulting in a series of natural hanging baskets in which herb robert and dog\u2019s mercury have sprouted in the leaf mould. The tiniest of refuges, but they captivate me. I\u2019m reminded that nature is fractal. I have a word for you, says the tree.

After an investigation under Strike Force Mylor, Mohommed Farhat, a 20-year-old man from Mascot, was arrested at about 3.50am this morning at Sydney airport. He was taken to Mascot police station and charged with 21 offences, including 14 counts of destroying or damaging property, three counts of entering a building/land with intent to commit an indictable offence, and behaving in an offensive manner in or near a public place or school. The matter was briefly mentioned at Downing Centre local court on Monday afternoon, where Farhat was refused bail, and his lawyer told the magistrate his client needed more time to put together a comprehensive application. The matter was referred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and adjourned until 9 December. The NSW premier, Chris Minns said the arrest was \u201cgood and welcome news\u201d and demonstrated police had dedicated significant resources to their investigations. Minns also said he was considering changes to the state\u2019s laws against racial vilification, despite the state\u2019s Law Reform Commission advising against changing the laws, section 93z of the Crimes Act, in a report presented in parliament on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve got concerns about whether the current 93z laws in place at the moment are fit for purpose,\u201d he said.",

It\u2019s like we\u2019ve been playing a game of KerPlunk where you keep taking out different bits of funding and see how little you can sustain a career with.\u201d The artist Larry Achiampong, who had a break-out year in 2022 with his Wayfinder solo show, said the fees artists receive have plummeted. \u201cThe compensation for the work that we do tends to be the last thing that\u2019s brought up by institutions,\u201d said Achiampong. \u201cThere are all kinds of excuses that are produced, I do the maths and find that I often end up out of pocket.\u201d The British-Ghanaian artist was offered \u00a3350 to participate in a group exhibition that would tour four institutions. \u201cI have sympathy for organisations in terms of the funding cuts, but it doesn\u2019t excuse the treatment of artists and their pay as an afterthought,\u201d he added. Achiampong said that after almost 20 years as a professional artist he had started to consider changing career, although he has no immediate plans to stop making art. \u201cTen years from now, as a parent of two, I can\u2019t go on like this, something has to give,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve realistically looked at making money in other areas, like gaming, because if I carry on this way I\u2019ll be packing up in five years.\u201d",

He quickly applied but was this rejected in August this year on the grounds that he was late.</p> <p>Merkel Solomons said she felt embarrassed to be Swedish and could not understand the approach of the authorities given that Solomons is a fully integrated member of society, a stepfather to her two children, paying taxes and a Swedish speaker.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting. The way this is being handled is beyond belief. It is almost as if they are discriminating, punishing British citizens,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cKenny came here full of entrepreneurship, he works, he set up businesses, learned Swedish. He pays taxes, employs people.</p> <p>\u201cWe did not receive a single piece of mail to say \u2018please be aware you need to apply to stay in the country because of Brexit\u2019. Nothing from the Swedish government, nothing from the British embassy.</p> <p>\u201cIs the EU really saying to me you do not have any kind of protection after Brexit? Shouldn\u2019t they stand up for these people?\u201d</p> <p>The migration department, the equivalent of the UK\u2019s Home Office, said it could not comment on individual cases but said its data showed it was dealing with 452 late applications, with 45 approved in 2023.</p> <p>The late applications include applications from family members of some of the 12,000 people who applied on time, so the number of cases like Solomons\u2019 may be much smaller.</p> <p>Campaigners in the Facebook grassroots group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/527543321113976/\">Brits in Sweden</a> say they have not found a single late applicant whose application has been accepted and there are still individuals discovering they should have applied.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/18/home-office-pressed-on-eu-citizens-removed-from-uk-while-awaiting-approval-to-stay\">Home Office pressed on EU citizens removed while awaiting approval to stay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>David Milstead, a British professor of physics in Stockholm and a voluntary campaigner in Brits in Sweden, has been raising concerns over Sweden\u2019s approach for two years, battling to get statistics or answers from the authorities.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no mass mailing of registered Brits by the Swedes, despite the fact that they know our addresses and many of us have digital inboxes for communications from government authorities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, the media outreach from the Swedish government was minimal. It was a lucky Brit in Sweden who encountered a message from the Swedish authorities. On top of this, after contacting the state authorities or reading their webpages, Brits often received conflicting information. What we\u2019re seeing is an avoidable mess that is ruining lives.\u201d</p> <p>Solomons, who has returned to the UK, says he cannot understand how Brexit could have caused so much damage to his family life. He had been a successful commercials actor and then an entrepreneur running seven restaurants and barber shops, continuously employing people in Stockholm including through the pandemic.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI had 38 staff, my own employees. My priority was to try to save the company through Covid.

      "bodyText": "A singer with a Swedish disco band who performed at this year\u2019s Eurovision has told of the \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201cdistressing\u201d consequences of Brexit after her British husband\u2019s application to remain in Sweden was rejected. Tess Merkel Solomons, a singer with the band Alcazar, said it felt as if her husband, Kenny Solomons, an actor and entrepreneur, was being \u201cpunished\u201d because he was a British citizen in Sweden after Brexit. Their ordeal began three years ago when Solomons, who had been living in the country since 2012, learned from one of his British employees that he should have applied to remain in Sweden by the end of 2021. He quickly applied but was this rejected in August this year on the grounds that he was late. Merkel Solomons said she felt embarrassed to be Swedish and could not understand the approach of the authorities given that Solomons is a fully integrated member of society, a stepfather to her two children, paying taxes and a Swedish speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting. The way this is being handled is beyond belief. It is almost as if they are discriminating, punishing British citizens,\u201d she said. \u201cKenny came here full of entrepreneurship, he works, he set up businesses, learned Swedish. He pays taxes, employs people. \u201cWe did not receive a single piece of mail to say \u2018please be aware you need to apply to stay in the country because of Brexit\u2019. Nothing from the Swedish government, nothing from the British embassy. \u201cIs the EU really saying to me you do not have any kind of protection after Brexit? Shouldn\u2019t they stand up for these people?\u201d The migration department, the equivalent of the UK\u2019s Home Office, said it could not comment on individual cases but said its data showed it was dealing with 452 late applications, with 45 approved in 2023. The late applications include applications from family members of some of the 12,000 people who applied on time, so the number of cases like Solomons\u2019 may be much smaller. Campaigners in the Facebook grassroots group Brits in Sweden say they have not found a single late applicant whose application has been accepted and there are still individuals discovering they should have applied. David Milstead, a British professor of physics in Stockholm and a voluntary campaigner in Brits in Sweden, has been raising concerns over Sweden\u2019s approach for two years, battling to get statistics or answers from the authorities. \u201cThere was no mass mailing of registered Brits by the Swedes, despite the fact that they know our addresses and many of us have digital inboxes for communications from government authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the media outreach from the Swedish government was minimal. It was a lucky Brit in Sweden who encountered a message from the Swedish authorities. On top of this, after contacting the state authorities or reading their webpages, Brits often received conflicting information. What we\u2019re seeing is an avoidable mess that is ruining lives.\u201d Solomons, who has returned to the UK, says he cannot understand how Brexit could have caused so much damage to his family life. He had been a successful commercials actor and then an entrepreneur running seven restaurants and barber shops, continuously employing people in Stockholm including through the pandemic. He said: \u201cI had 38 staff, my own employees. My priority was to try to save the company through Covid. That was my priority to save my company and to save people\u2019s jobs and I had zero idea that Brexit meant I had to apply to remain in the country again. My main priority was to make sure others were OK \u2013 that I got from my mother, who always said put others first. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until another Brit, that I employed, said \u2018you should have sent in a piece of paper last week\u2019 that I knew I had to do it. So I spent two years trying to save my company and employees all through Covid and at the end, sadly, it worked out well for everyone else but not the employer.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m told there is absolutely zero chance that I am allowed to reside in Sweden with my wife and kids. I\u2019m told I can appeal in five years. I can appeal to the European court, but I want to be speak openly. \u201cI am afraid. I even get nervous talking about this because I am afraid if I put one foot out of line I\u2019m going to even lose my opportunity to be able to visit my wife and kids and my home as a tourist.\u201d Although Solomons pays a mortgage and has had a family home in Sweden for more than the five years that would have made him a permanent resident of the country, he is afraid that if he breaks a single rule by going back to see his family he will risk incurring a two-year entry ban. \u201cI\u2019m afraid If I continue to fight this, my health might not be able to keep up,\u201d he said. \u201cI can turn up as a tourist by law, but it\u2019s at the discretion of border control.

The illegal mining is known as \u201cgalamsey\u201d, a pidgin contraction of the phrase \u201cgather them and sell\u201d, in reference to the way in which artisans gather alluvial deposits dispersed by large-scale activity of mining corporations.</p>    <p>The practice exploded in two phases: first after a 1989 law formalised artisanal mining and then as unemployment rates rose because of a weakening economy in recent years.

As owners of customary land in Ghana, they have the power to allocate freely and have been accused of being willing collaborators in galamsey. In August, a prominent monarch <a href=\"https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/ghana-news-asantehene-destools-3-chiefs-over-galamsey.html\">stripped three of his chiefs</a> of their titles for being complicit in the practice.</p> <p>\u201cThis is gold business, it\u2019s making the [chiefs and politicians] a lot of money,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands and thousands of dollars.\u201d</p> <p>Akufo-Addo\u2019s predecessor John Mahama, whose government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/15/ghana-deports-chinese-goldminers\">expelled 45,000 Chinese nationals</a> in 2013 after raiding galamsey sites, has said he would tackle the practice if he won the presidential election this December. The incumbent has accused his rival of politicising the issue, saying the latter once promised amnesty for perpetrators.</p> <h2><strong>The fight goes on</strong></h2> <p>Despite the complexity of challenges, more local people say they are determined to save their country.</p> <p>Patrick Danso, a teacher turned activist in Atronsu in western Ghana, says Chinese intermediaries tried to bribe him in August to stop his activism. The father of five says he refused as he has a responsibility to \u201csecure the future for his kids\u201d and protect his cocoa farm \u2013 \u201chis pension\u201d.</p> <p>In September, a civil society coalition including Serwah\u2019s Eco-Conscious Citizens sued the government regarding the legality of a 2022 law which allows mining in forest reserves, including globally significant biodiversity areas.</p> <p>Labour unions had called for a national strike in October to force a repeal of the law but the plan was shelved after Akufo-Addo promised to rescind the law and parliament began a debate about the process.</p> <p>Some say they are ready to protest again, even though 11 of those detained in September have been imprisoned.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to protect the future of your nation, it\u2019s a worthwhile cause,\u201d said Nelson, who still faces multiple charges in court including unlawful assembly. \u201cAnd Ghana is worth that sacrifice.\u201d</p>",

In August, a prominent monarch stripped three of his chiefs of their titles for being complicit in the practice. \u201cThis is gold business, it\u2019s making the [chiefs and politicians] a lot of money,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands and thousands of dollars.\u201d Akufo-Addo\u2019s predecessor John Mahama, whose government expelled 45,000 Chinese nationals in 2013 after raiding galamsey sites, has said he would tackle the practice if he won the presidential election this December. The incumbent has accused his rival of politicising the issue, saying the latter once promised amnesty for perpetrators. The fight goes on Despite the complexity of challenges, more local people say they are determined to save their country. Patrick Danso, a teacher turned activist in Atronsu in western Ghana, says Chinese intermediaries tried to bribe him in August to stop his activism. The father of five says he refused as he has a responsibility to \u201csecure the future for his kids\u201d and protect his cocoa farm \u2013 \u201chis pension\u201d. In September, a civil society coalition including Serwah\u2019s Eco-Conscious Citizens sued the government regarding the legality of a 2022 law which allows mining in forest reserves, including globally significant biodiversity areas. Labour unions had called for a national strike in October to force a repeal of the law but the plan was shelved after Akufo-Addo promised to rescind the law and parliament began a debate about the process. Some say they are ready to protest again, even though 11 of those detained in September have been imprisoned. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to protect the future of your nation, it\u2019s a worthwhile cause,\u201d said Nelson, who still faces multiple charges in court including unlawful assembly. \u201cAnd Ghana is worth that sacrifice.\u201d",

The report by UN Women found 85,000 women and girls were killed intentionally by men in 2023, with 60% (51,100) of these deaths committed by someone close to the victim. The organisation said its figures showed that, globally, the most dangerous place for a woman to be was in her home, where the majority of women die at the hands of men. Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda, UN Women\u2019s deputy executive director, said: \u201cWhat the data is telling us is that it is the private and domestic sphere\u2019s of women\u2019s lives, where they should be safest, that so many of them are being exposed to deadly violence. \u201cWe see the numbers in this report as the tip of the iceberg,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we know not all women\u2019s deaths are recorded and not all causes of death are accurately recorded as femicides, and there were many communities where we couldn\u2019t access any information.\u201d The UN global estimates on femicide, defined as the gender-related killing of women and girls, showed an overall decrease on the 89,000 intentional deaths of women and girls in 2022, but an increase in numbers killed by intimate partners and family members. The data from the UN agency dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women showed that Africa recorded the highest rates of intimate and partner-related femicide, with an estimated 21,700 victims in 2023, followed by the Americas and then Oceania. In Europe and the Americas, most women were killed by intimate partners, while elsewhere, close family members were the primary perpetrators. UN Women said that available data for three countries \u2013 France, South Africa and Colombia \u2013 confirmed that a \u201csignificant share\u201d of women killed by their intimate partners had previously reported some form of violence to the authorities before their death. The report said that while men and women are victims of intimate partner or family violence, men accounted for 80% of all global homicide victims in 2023, but only 12% of these deaths were attributed to lethal violence within the family, compared with 60% of women.

      "body": "<p>As well as an eight-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter, Kaya Scodelario is the dedicated parent of a 10-year-old French bulldog called Arnie. She is hiding from at least one of them during our video call, and says it\u2019s the dog.</p> <p>She is in the cosy and, crucially, locked spare bedroom of her home in north London, where she sits cross-legged on the floor. The mood is decidedly wholesome, and spiritually a million miles away from the place where audiences first encountered her, on Channel 4\u2019s landmark teen drama Skins. Her character, Effy Stonem \u2013 sister to Nicholas Hoult\u2019s Tony \u2013 uttered barely a word in series one and two; by series three she was the lead, captivating the boys of Bristol\u2019s Roundview sixth form, not least by challenging them to sniff glue and start fires in return for sex with her. All the while, she was slipping deeper into trauma and depression.</p> <p>As the writer Emma Garland <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-enduring-appeal-of-effy-stonem/\">observed</a> in 2020, Effy\u2019s allure \u201ccomes from the conflict between how she really feels (<em>deeply</em>) and how she acts (as though she doesn\u2019t feel a thing) \u2013 a facade recognisable to the audience, but very few characters in the show\u201d.</p> <p>Between that personality, her slept-in smoky eye, and a wardrobe of fishnets and ripped tank tops that the high street duly copied, Effy was nothing short of iconic in 2007. And, more than a decade and a half later, she remains so, with gen Z paying homage to her on <a href=\"https://i-d.co/article/tiktok-effy-stonem-skins-fashion-makeup-videos/\">TikTok</a>. The character is also, Scodelario explains, absolutely nothing like her. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t the confident cool girl at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a typical shy girl that tried to fit in with the cool kids. I would untuck my shirt, but it wasn\u2019t really me.\u201d</p>    <p>A down-to-earth Londoner (she has already called me \u201cdarling\u201d within the first minute of the call), Scodelario, 32, grew up in a council flat in Islington with her Brazilian mum, where a revolving cast of waifs and strays from the motherland were always welcome. At school, things were more low-key: she was a timid child who was \u201cscared to put my hand up, scared to make friends, scared to speak\u201d. Cast as Oliver in a school play aged 11, she found something that made her fizz with excitement. \u201cBut I wrote it off. I was like: \u2018No \u2013 I definitely can\u2019t afford to go to drama school.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Scodelario was 14, however, a teacher mentioned an audition for a new teen drama. \u201cA group of us went down just to look, and then a couple of the confident girls went in,\u201d she says. \u201cI was stood watching when the creator, Bryan Elsley, came outside for a cigarette \u2013 I think they had had too many kids turn up, so he was going down the line and quite brutally being like: yes, no, yes, no. He saw me across the road and said: \u2018Do you want to audition?\u2019\u201d Scodelario got the part, having lied about her age (she said was 15) and then \u2013 when she realised that actually they needed a younger actor \u2013 calling the producers back in a panic to confess: \u201cNo, I lied! I lied! I\u2019m only 14!\u201d</p> <p>What followed was a \u201ccrazy five or six weeks\u201d of filming, though it didn\u2019t feel like it had the potential to become something long-term. \u201cEven the crew were saying they didn\u2019t think it would get picked up. I remember one of the electricians on set going: \u2018I\u2019ve worked on really expensive period dramas that didn\u2019t get a second season \u2013 there\u2019s no fucking way this will.\u2019 And then, kind of overnight, it happened \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Skins came out and was, she says, \u201cthis cultural moment. People really related to it.\u201d Her life didn\u2019t change much at first. The family were \u201cstill broke most of the time\u201d, and filming was confined to her school holidays. Things only really started to shift when she turned 16, and passed up a place at sixth-form college to become the show\u2019s leading lady. By that point, the series was a bona fide hit, and a Bafta winner. During filming for season three, Scodelario says, a car full of university students drove past the set, \u201cpulled down the window, and shouted: \u2018Skins is shit!\u2019 And we were all like: \u2018Wow, we\u2019ve made it!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Scodelario made some of her closest friends on Skins, among them Hoult, Daniel Kaluuya \u2013 who is her son\u2019s godfather \u2013 and Jack O\u2019Connell, whom she dated at the height of the show\u2019s popularity. \u201cIt\u2019s a really loving group,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes you don\u2019t get that with actors. You get competition.\u201d Not with the Skins lot. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how was that shoot? Are you feeling all right? Are you taking enough time off? And how\u2019s your back?\u201d</p>    <p>She is proud of how authentic the show felt, and says her focus was on bringing Effy\u2019s mental-health storyline to life, which included working with the charity Mind. The show gave her a taste for playing complicated characters, and she admires the way it avoided making moral judgments about them, but allowed the audience to \u201cfollow along with the journey more than preaching to them directly \u2026 It wasn\u2019t an episode of Byker Grove where someone takes drugs and then they die and everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Let\u2019s never do that again.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what the magic of Skins was.\u201d</p> <p>However, it was also an intense gig, and one that its young stars weren\u2019t always prepared for. Spontaneous nights out in crowded bars were a no, and getting on the tube back in London sometimes made Scodelario feel \u201cstuck and claustrophobic\u201d. On set, too, things could be difficult. In a post on TikTok in 2022, Scodelario compared Skins with the HBO hit Euphoria, and talked about how she had thought that that series was \u201ccrazy for 17-year-olds, then [I remembered] what I was doing on TV at 14\u201d. Safeguarding, she added, \u201creally wasn\u2019t a thing back then\u201d.</p> <p>Nowadays, she says that she advocates for younger actors on sets as often as she can, and is proud of gen Z for stressing the need for intimacy coordinators. \u201cNothing too awful ever happened [on the set of Skins], thank God, but it could have, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s scary about it. What\u2019s wonderful now is that every production is aware that a sex scene is essentially a stunt, and it should be choreographed.\u201d</p> <p>With Skins, she adds, its young cast \u201cwere so grateful and happy to be there that we did as we were told most of the time. But this was a show that was created by older grownups, and it would have been cool to have more conversations as actors about what we were doing.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, she concludes that the group \u201cwere treated like teenagers that were there to make a teenage show. It was nice that we felt free, and didn\u2019t understand the politics of the business \u2013 we weren\u2019t worrying about whose face was going to be on the poster, or who was earning more than who. But at the same time, it\u2019s important to treat actors like actors.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, three years after Skins\u2019 initial run ended, she appeared in a spin-off \u201cconclusion\u201d miniseries, Skins: Fire, following Effy\u2019s life working for a City hedge fund. \u201cI felt much more confident in saying what I felt during that series,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the first draft came through, there were a lot of sex scenes in it, and I could tell it was because I turned 18, and that meant that they could show more. And I went back and said: \u2018No, there\u2019s no need to do that.\u2019\u201d She was 19 by that stage, had been on other sets, and felt \u201cstrong enough\u201d to make her voice heard.</p>    <p>In an Instagram comment last year, Scodelario thanked Jennette McCurdy, the Nickelodeon star whose book I\u2019m Glad My Mom Died detailed the mistreatment she had endured from both her family and the TV industry. In particular, Scodelario said that the book, along with therapy, had made her realise she had had \u201can abusive mother and been screwed by the industry\u201d. She had previously described her mother as \u201cvery strict\u201d. \u201cShe raised me alone,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/pirates-carribean-star-kaya-scodelario-10486242\">she told the Mirror</a>, \u201cand she suffered depression most of her life. It can be very dark, very difficult, especially as a teenager. It put a lot of pressure on our relationship.\u201d</p> <p>She is hesitant to say more now, although she promises: \u201cThere will be a day where I really can get into it. What I love about Jennette\u2019s book is that she clearly took the time to figure out her feelings before speaking publicly. I\u2019m not quite ready to tell my story on my terms. I\u2019m still focusing on being a mum, and wanting my work to be what speaks for me.\u201d</p> <p>There certainly is a lot of it. There was a brief wobble in confidence when Skins was coming to an end (at an audition for Emma at the BBC alongside \u201cposh, gorgeous\u201d girls, her anxiety spiked and she walked out). However, she has remained busy ever since, in Andrea Arnold\u2019s acclaimed reimagining of Wuthering Heights, big-money US action franchises such as The Maze Runner and Pirates of the Caribbean, Netflix\u2019s ice skating drama Spinning Out, and Guy Ritchie\u2019s latest series The Gentlemen, in which she played a hard-as-nails crime boss.</p> <p>She says that she faced fewer barriers to entry in the US than the UK, where because of her background a call for a period drama would inevitably be to play a maid. However, she has done \u201cthree back-to-back British jobs in the past three years, and I think things have changed for the better. It seems like the industry is finally catching up with the idea that a British actor doesn\u2019t look or sound a certain way.\u201d</p> <p>While she hasn\u2019t deliberately homed in on action roles, she can see how she has ended up doing so many of them (Terminator\u2019s Sarah Connor was her childhood hero, after all). \u201cIn action, it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m the woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter that there\u2019s no love story. I don\u2019t have to snog anyone, I don\u2019t have to bat my eyelids \u2013 I get to just do what I need to do to survive in that moment. I fell in love with the power that came from it, of screaming at the top of my lungs, of killing things. There is something really fun about it.\u201d</p> <p>Fun, but also gruelling, clearly. \u201cI\u2019ve broken so many bones,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI broke a finger during [Alexandre Aja\u2019s claustrophobic 2019 horror] Crawl. I broke a collarbone on Pirates of the Caribbean, but that was because I slipped on the boat. So that wasn\u2019t as cool. But Crawl was the most intense job I\u2019ve ever done \u2013 I was covered in dirt and blood and tears all day, every day, for three months. I broke my finger at the start of one day, but I didn\u2019t tell anyone because I didn\u2019t want to go home.\u201d</p>    <p>Last year she was in S\u00e3o Paulo for another high-octane production, the Netflix drama Senna. This revolves around the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/may/01/ayrton-senna-30-years-f1-uncompromising-complex-genius\">racing driver Ayrton Senna</a>, although Scodelario\u2019s role as a fictional half-British, half-Brazilian journalist sees her largely trackside rather than putting her pedal to the metal. Scodelario had \u201calways heard stories\u201d about the driver, who died in 1994, when she was two, but only realised how important he was to many Brazilians after a screening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/31/senna-asif-kapadia\">Asif Kapadia\u2019s documentary</a>, also titled Senna. \u201cIt was wall-to-wall Brazilians in that cinema. They were crying, and shouting at the screen every time [Senna\u2019s rival, Alain] Prost came up. It was the most emotional, passionate cinema experience of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Making Senna was the first time Scodelario had spoken Portuguese on screen (she voices her character in both the original version and the English dub). \u201cI\u2019d spent years asking my agents to find me a project in Brazil,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me that I show the world that that is part of my culture. I was described as an English rose once in an article and it really pissed me off, because I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>So when Senna came along, \u201cI just jumped at it. I said: \u2018I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I\u2019ll do it for free. I will Duolingo my Portuguese to get it perfect.\u2019\u201d It was, she says, \u201cthe most exhausting job I\u2019ve ever done, even though I didn\u2019t do anything physical, because I was trying to be very aware of the sounds my mouth was making, making sure that my accent was correct. It was scary.\u201d</p> <p>It was an important moment for the whole family, she says, not least because the children were with her. She has always tried to take them on jobs. \u201cI just never wanted it to be an excuse for producers not to hire me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was 23 when I had my son [with her ex-husband, the actor Benjamin Walker]. A lot of people said: \u2018Well, that means you\u2019re not going to work any more.\u2019 I was lucky that I was in a position where I could say: \u2018I\u2019m going to fly my son out and I can breastfeed in the makeup chair.\u2019 I bring them along for the ride. And so what if that means I sometimes get a bit of puke on my gown just as I\u2019m going on a red carpet? I can just wet it off \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy ex-husband came with me, and he fell in love with it too,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have that connection to Brazil now, and I\u2019m hoping that we can go regularly all together. My son came home and immediately was like: \u2018No \u2013 I want to go back!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If anyone can wangle another gig there, it\u2019s surely her.</p> <p><em>Senna is on Netflix from</em><em> 29 November</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "As well as an eight-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter, Kaya Scodelario is the dedicated parent of a 10-year-old French bulldog called Arnie. She is hiding from at least one of them during our video call, and says it\u2019s the dog. She is in the cosy and, crucially, locked spare bedroom of her home in north London, where she sits cross-legged on the floor. The mood is decidedly wholesome, and spiritually a million miles away from the place where audiences first encountered her, on Channel 4\u2019s landmark teen drama Skins. Her character, Effy Stonem \u2013 sister to Nicholas Hoult\u2019s Tony \u2013 uttered barely a word in series one and two; by series three she was the lead, captivating the boys of Bristol\u2019s Roundview sixth form, not least by challenging them to sniff glue and start fires in return for sex with her. All the while, she was slipping deeper into trauma and depression. As the writer Emma Garland observed in 2020, Effy\u2019s allure \u201ccomes from the conflict between how she really feels (deeply) and how she acts (as though she doesn\u2019t feel a thing) \u2013 a facade recognisable to the audience, but very few characters in the show\u201d. Between that personality, her slept-in smoky eye, and a wardrobe of fishnets and ripped tank tops that the high street duly copied, Effy was nothing short of iconic in 2007. And, more than a decade and a half later, she remains so, with gen Z paying homage to her on TikTok. The character is also, Scodelario explains, absolutely nothing like her. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t the confident cool girl at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a typical shy girl that tried to fit in with the cool kids. I would untuck my shirt, but it wasn\u2019t really me.\u201d A down-to-earth Londoner (she has already called me \u201cdarling\u201d within the first minute of the call), Scodelario, 32, grew up in a council flat in Islington with her Brazilian mum, where a revolving cast of waifs and strays from the motherland were always welcome. At school, things were more low-key: she was a timid child who was \u201cscared to put my hand up, scared to make friends, scared to speak\u201d. Cast as Oliver in a school play aged 11, she found something that made her fizz with excitement. \u201cBut I wrote it off. I was like: \u2018No \u2013 I definitely can\u2019t afford to go to drama school.\u2019\u201d When Scodelario was 14, however, a teacher mentioned an audition for a new teen drama. \u201cA group of us went down just to look, and then a couple of the confident girls went in,\u201d she says. \u201cI was stood watching when the creator, Bryan Elsley, came outside for a cigarette \u2013 I think they had had too many kids turn up, so he was going down the line and quite brutally being like: yes, no, yes, no. He saw me across the road and said: \u2018Do you want to audition?\u2019\u201d Scodelario got the part, having lied about her age (she said was 15) and then \u2013 when she realised that actually they needed a younger actor \u2013 calling the producers back in a panic to confess: \u201cNo, I lied! I lied! I\u2019m only 14!\u201d What followed was a \u201ccrazy five or six weeks\u201d of filming, though it didn\u2019t feel like it had the potential to become something long-term. \u201cEven the crew were saying they didn\u2019t think it would get picked up. I remember one of the electricians on set going: \u2018I\u2019ve worked on really expensive period dramas that didn\u2019t get a second season \u2013 there\u2019s no fucking way this will.\u2019 And then, kind of overnight, it happened \u2026\u201d Skins came out and was, she says, \u201cthis cultural moment. People really related to it.\u201d Her life didn\u2019t change much at first. The family were \u201cstill broke most of the time\u201d, and filming was confined to her school holidays. Things only really started to shift when she turned 16, and passed up a place at sixth-form college to become the show\u2019s leading lady. By that point, the series was a bona fide hit, and a Bafta winner. During filming for season three, Scodelario says, a car full of university students drove past the set, \u201cpulled down the window, and shouted: \u2018Skins is shit!\u2019 And we were all like: \u2018Wow, we\u2019ve made it!\u2019\u201d Scodelario made some of her closest friends on Skins, among them Hoult, Daniel Kaluuya \u2013 who is her son\u2019s godfather \u2013 and Jack O\u2019Connell, whom she dated at the height of the show\u2019s popularity. \u201cIt\u2019s a really loving group,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes you don\u2019t get that with actors. You get competition.\u201d Not with the Skins lot. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how was that shoot? Are you feeling all right? Are you taking enough time off? And how\u2019s your back?\u201d She is proud of how authentic the show felt, and says her focus was on bringing Effy\u2019s mental-health storyline to life, which included working with the charity Mind. The show gave her a taste for playing complicated characters, and she admires the way it avoided making moral judgments about them, but allowed the audience to \u201cfollow along with the journey more than preaching to them directly \u2026 It wasn\u2019t an episode of Byker Grove where someone takes drugs and then they die and everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Let\u2019s never do that again.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what the magic of Skins was.\u201d However, it was also an intense gig, and one that its young stars weren\u2019t always prepared for. Spontaneous nights out in crowded bars were a no, and getting on the tube back in London sometimes made Scodelario feel \u201cstuck and claustrophobic\u201d. On set, too, things could be difficult. In a post on TikTok in 2022, Scodelario compared Skins with the HBO hit Euphoria, and talked about how she had thought that that series was \u201ccrazy for 17-year-olds, then [I remembered] what I was doing on TV at 14\u201d. Safeguarding, she added, \u201creally wasn\u2019t a thing back then\u201d. Nowadays, she says that she advocates for younger actors on sets as often as she can, and is proud of gen Z for stressing the need for intimacy coordinators. \u201cNothing too awful ever happened [on the set of Skins], thank God, but it could have, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s scary about it. What\u2019s wonderful now is that every production is aware that a sex scene is essentially a stunt, and it should be choreographed.\u201d With Skins, she adds, its young cast \u201cwere so grateful and happy to be there that we did as we were told most of the time. But this was a show that was created by older grownups, and it would have been cool to have more conversations as actors about what we were doing.\u201d Ultimately, she concludes that the group \u201cwere treated like teenagers that were there to make a teenage show. It was nice that we felt free, and didn\u2019t understand the politics of the business \u2013 we weren\u2019t worrying about whose face was going to be on the poster, or who was earning more than who. But at the same time, it\u2019s important to treat actors like actors.\u201d In 2013, three years after Skins\u2019 initial run ended, she appeared in a spin-off \u201cconclusion\u201d miniseries, Skins: Fire, following Effy\u2019s life working for a City hedge fund. \u201cI felt much more confident in saying what I felt during that series,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the first draft came through, there were a lot of sex scenes in it, and I could tell it was because I turned 18, and that meant that they could show more. And I went back and said: \u2018No, there\u2019s no need to do that.\u2019\u201d She was 19 by that stage, had been on other sets, and felt \u201cstrong enough\u201d to make her voice heard. In an Instagram comment last year, Scodelario thanked Jennette McCurdy, the Nickelodeon star whose book I\u2019m Glad My Mom Died detailed the mistreatment she had endured from both her family and the TV industry. In particular, Scodelario said that the book, along with therapy, had made her realise she had had \u201can abusive mother and been screwed by the industry\u201d. She had previously described her mother as \u201cvery strict\u201d. \u201cShe raised me alone,\u201d she told the Mirror, \u201cand she suffered depression most of her life. It can be very dark, very difficult, especially as a teenager. It put a lot of pressure on our relationship.\u201d She is hesitant to say more now, although she promises: \u201cThere will be a day where I really can get into it. What I love about Jennette\u2019s book is that she clearly took the time to figure out her feelings before speaking publicly. I\u2019m not quite ready to tell my story on my terms. I\u2019m still focusing on being a mum, and wanting my work to be what speaks for me.\u201d There certainly is a lot of it. There was a brief wobble in confidence when Skins was coming to an end (at an audition for Emma at the BBC alongside \u201cposh, gorgeous\u201d girls, her anxiety spiked and she walked out). However, she has remained busy ever since, in Andrea Arnold\u2019s acclaimed reimagining of Wuthering Heights, big-money US action franchises such as The Maze Runner and Pirates of the Caribbean, Netflix\u2019s ice skating drama Spinning Out, and Guy Ritchie\u2019s latest series The Gentlemen, in which she played a hard-as-nails crime boss. She says that she faced fewer barriers to entry in the US than the UK, where because of her background a call for a period drama would inevitably be to play a maid. However, she has done \u201cthree back-to-back British jobs in the past three years, and I think things have changed for the better. It seems like the industry is finally catching up with the idea that a British actor doesn\u2019t look or sound a certain way.\u201d While she hasn\u2019t deliberately homed in on action roles, she can see how she has ended up doing so many of them (Terminator\u2019s Sarah Connor was her childhood hero, after all). \u201cIn action, it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019m the woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter that there\u2019s no love story. I don\u2019t have to snog anyone, I don\u2019t have to bat my eyelids \u2013 I get to just do what I need to do to survive in that moment. I fell in love with the power that came from it, of screaming at the top of my lungs, of killing things. There is something really fun about it.\u201d Fun, but also gruelling, clearly. \u201cI\u2019ve broken so many bones,\u201d she sighs. \u201cI broke a finger during [Alexandre Aja\u2019s claustrophobic 2019 horror] Crawl.

They actually have some previous in this. \u201cWe met during Top of the Lake,\u201d says Malcolm, referring to the 2013 mystery drama. \u201cHis character was an arsehole to mine.

Mullan is Phil, her ex-husband, with whom some appalling falling out has occurred. It unfolds pretty fast that something happened between him and a drunk minor at a party, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s spent five years exiled from the tightknit community in Wellington, New Zealand. Except, did it? And why do people tread so delicately around the question of Penny\u2019s credibility? If this were any ordinary drama, Penny would be the clear heroine, risking ostracism because her courage won\u2019t have it any other way. But it\u2019s not ordinary at all.</p> <p>Malcolm embarked on After the Party after an experience with a film Taylor had written. \u201cIt was meant for a couple in their mid 50s,\u201d says Malcolm, who is 59. \u201cI\u2019d been pegged to be the wife.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We\u2019re both yappers,\u201d says Peter Mullan, the Glaswegian actor and firebrand. \u201cSo we yapped a lot. Actors we admire. Art we admire. Politics, life, love, death, all the usual stuff.\u201d Mullan is telling me how he and Robyn Malcolm, the New Zealand actor and firebrand, first got together. \u201cSo we did a lot of yap,\u201d he goes on. \u201cAnd we\u2019re nice enough to give the other one time to yap.\u201d Malcolm, seated by his side, sweetly interjects: \u201cAnd we still do.\u201d We\u2019re here to talk about After the Party, which Malcolm co-wrote with screenwriter Dianne Taylor. Malcolm co-stars with Mullan \u2013 although absolutely not in a \u201clovey-dovey way\u201d. They play exes whose mutual distrust is fathomless. They actually have some previous in this. \u201cWe met during Top of the Lake,\u201d says Malcolm, referring to the 2013 mystery drama. \u201cHis character was an arsehole to mine. You can do smoochy scenes with an actor you just abhor. And you can do brutal stuff with an actor you adore. We had a ball.\u201d Malcolm plays Penny in the six-parter, a straight-talking, unabashed, funny, morally robust schoolteacher, the sort of person who\u2019s good at telling people how to get their acts together. Mullan is Phil, her ex-husband, with whom some appalling falling out has occurred. It unfolds pretty fast that something happened between him and a drunk minor at a party, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s spent five years exiled from the tightknit community in Wellington, New Zealand. Except, did it? And why do people tread so delicately around the question of Penny\u2019s credibility? If this were any ordinary drama, Penny would be the clear heroine, risking ostracism because her courage won\u2019t have it any other way. But it\u2019s not ordinary at all. Malcolm embarked on After the Party after an experience with a film Taylor had written. \u201cIt was meant for a couple in their mid 50s,\u201d says Malcolm, who is 59. \u201cI\u2019d been pegged to be the wife. Then the director cast a woman 20 years my junior and Di was furious. So she said, \u2018I want to write something only you can play.\u2019\u201d Malcolm talks about \u201caspirational casting\u201d, the idea that audiences are happy to watch characters in their 50s and 60s, but only if they\u2019re played by actors in their 40s. Mullan\u2019s indignation is a joy to watch. \u201cMost definitely I look middle-aged,\u201d says the 65-year-old. \u201cI had a tougher paper round than a lot of American actors my age. Trying to find anyone who looks credibly of this vintage has become an issue.

This is the fifth year of Make Amazon Pay protests. \u201cAmazon\u2019s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy,\u201d said Christy Hoffman, the general secretary of UNI Global Union. \u201cBezos\u2019s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organising, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers\u2019 desire for justice \u2013 for union representation \u2013 can\u2019t be stopped. We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all.\u201d An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cThese groups represent a variety of interests, and while we\u2019re always listening and looking at ways to improve, we remain proud of the competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, and engaging, safe work experience we provide our teams.\u201d Amazon says it is the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world, and that last year all its electricity was matched with renewable energy sources. It says its starting pay in the UK is a minimum of \u00a328,000 a year on four-day week shifts. The campaign group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice says that the company does not have any interim targets to get to its net zero emissions goal by 2040, and that its annual carbon emissions have grown by 34.5% since 2019. At Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse, workers narrowly voted against union recognition in July, but the TUC insisted that the battle for union recognition would go on.",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/tsunami2004\">2004 Boxing Day tsunami</a>, caused by an earthquake (the third-most powerful in history) off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, affected 14 countries around the Indian Ocean basin and killed more than 225,000 people. As an incomprehensibly massive event that occurred before smartphones were ubiquitous, the tsunami is very well documented and yet not: the mess of scrambled pictures has been picked over many times.</p> <p>Tsunami: Race Against Time, a four-part documentary that flies by, reshapes the catastrophe into an anthology of gripping stories, capturing the carnage and stirring, moving tales of survival. The contemporary footage \u2013 walls of water silently approaching beaches, torrents raging through buildings, people hurt or dead in the aftermath \u2013 has been painstakingly resourced and expertly linked together, but it\u2019s the testimonies of the survivors that stick.</p> <p>Documentaries with such grave subject matter must choose how much narrative spin to put on the facts. How many storytelling tricks can be used before it feels distasteful? This series unashamedly uses a couple of devices to heighten our reactions. Survivors speak to camera, their presence in the safety of 2024 contrasting with grainy 2004 images of nightmarish chaos, which seem to be merely the nearest fit the producers could find to what is being described. But then the person talking suddenly appears in the old film, knitting the recollection and the clip together.</p> <p>More riskily, Tsunami: Race Against Time repeatedly features survivors who describe losing contact with loved ones in the surging water. These memories are delivered via solo, tearful interviews, implying that their partner, sibling or parent died. Many turn out not to have made it, but on several occasions the fact that they survived is held back for as long as possible, before a surprise reveal. One episode even lingers on an old photograph, zooming in slowly in a way that usually signifies the person is dead. Then we smash-cut to the same woman seated happily in front of the camera in the present day.</p> <p>Some viewers may find these liberties inappropriate. But they are an effective tool in evoking the horrible game of chance people were thrown into in 2004, replicating the way the lucky ones bounced between abject despair and relief. It is difficult to remain unmoved.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/dec/21/boxing-day-tsunami-community-born-out-of-disaster-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"Boxing Day tsunami remembered: community born out of disaster - video\"            data-video-provider=\"AAP\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/18/1418871566588/Phuket-Thailand.-015.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453655273\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/18/1418871566588/Phuket-Thailand.-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/18/141218tsu2_FromGAus-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/18/141218tsu2_FromGAus/141218tsu2_FromGAus.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/18/141218tsu2_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/18/141218tsu2_FromGAus.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/18/141218tsu2_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/dec/21/boxing-day-tsunami-community-born-out-of-disaster-video\">Boxing Day tsunami remembered: community born out of disaster</a> |</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The interviewees not directly affected are well chosen, too. We hear from the seismologist Barry Hirshorn, who was stationed at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii when the disaster unfolded. At the time, the Indian Ocean had no equivalent facility; Hirshorn\u2019s readings were the world\u2019s best, but, like a supporting character in a disaster movie, he knew what was coming yet had no means of getting the word out. The digital age had not progressed to the point where someone in Hawaii could easily get the attention of a stranger in Phuket, so Hirshorn picked up a landline telephone and improvised. Although he eventually played a major part in issuing crucial warnings to eastern Africa, he is filled with sorrow for the lives he had no time to save.</p> <p>Another sobering perspective is provided by Eli Flournoy, a CNN editor who was working the usually uneventful Christmas shift. Within hours, CNN had updates from multiple locations. Then their journalists deduced that the worst-hit place had to be Banda Aceh, Indonesia \u2013 because they had received no information from there at all.</p> <p>The series\u2019 producers have tracked down people who were involved in some of the day\u2019s most extraordinary stories. One contributor was at Emerald Cave, on Ko Muk island in Thailand, a tourist hotspot with a beach accessed by swimming through the still waters of a cave tunnel. Her group was inside when the wave filled it. Another was on a train in Sri Lanka that flooded and tipped over, drowning more than 1,700 passengers. That this incident remains the worst railway disaster in history is mentioned, but in this context it is a footnote.</p> <p>It is all extraordinarily harrowing \u2013 and the series gets as close to communicating the scale of the disaster as possible. But in the last episode, there is a feeling of humanity picking itself up and walking on determinedly.</p> <p>It centres on the triaging and treating of hundreds of injured people on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi amid complete devastation \u2013 a process led by a gregarious local restaurateur \u2013 who was so helpful and decisive that it was wrongly assumed she had some relevant training \u2013 and a British psychiatrist whose medical knowledge made him the nearest thing to an emergency-room physician. They are lucid, thoughtful, emotive speakers. It\u2019s a privilege to see and hear them; that terrible day important to revisit.</p> <p>\u2022 Tsunami: Race Against Time airs on National Geographic and is on Disney+</p>",

Documentaries with such grave subject matter must choose how much narrative spin to put on the facts. How many storytelling tricks can be used before it feels distasteful? This series unashamedly uses a couple of devices to heighten our reactions. Survivors speak to camera, their presence in the safety of 2024 contrasting with grainy 2004 images of nightmarish chaos, which seem to be merely the nearest fit the producers could find to what is being described. But then the person talking suddenly appears in the old film, knitting the recollection and the clip together. More riskily, Tsunami: Race Against Time repeatedly features survivors who describe losing contact with loved ones in the surging water. These memories are delivered via solo, tearful interviews, implying that their partner, sibling or parent died. Many turn out not to have made it, but on several occasions the fact that they survived is held back for as long as possible, before a surprise reveal. One episode even lingers on an old photograph, zooming in slowly in a way that usually signifies the person is dead. Then we smash-cut to the same woman seated happily in front of the camera in the present day. Some viewers may find these liberties inappropriate. But they are an effective tool in evoking the horrible game of chance people were thrown into in 2004, replicating the way the lucky ones bounced between abject despair and relief. It is difficult to remain unmoved. The interviewees not directly affected are well chosen, too. We hear from the seismologist Barry Hirshorn, who was stationed at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii when the disaster unfolded. At the time, the Indian Ocean had no equivalent facility; Hirshorn\u2019s readings were the world\u2019s best, but, like a supporting character in a disaster movie, he knew what was coming yet had no means of getting the word out. The digital age had not progressed to the point where someone in Hawaii could easily get the attention of a stranger in Phuket, so Hirshorn picked up a landline telephone and improvised. Although he eventually played a major part in issuing crucial warnings to eastern Africa, he is filled with sorrow for the lives he had no time to save. Another sobering perspective is provided by Eli Flournoy, a CNN editor who was working the usually uneventful Christmas shift. Within hours, CNN had updates from multiple locations. Then their journalists deduced that the worst-hit place had to be Banda Aceh, Indonesia \u2013 because they had received no information from there at all. The series\u2019 producers have tracked down people who were involved in some of the day\u2019s most extraordinary stories. One contributor was at Emerald Cave, on Ko Muk island in Thailand, a tourist hotspot with a beach accessed by swimming through the still waters of a cave tunnel. Her group was inside when the wave filled it. Another was on a train in Sri Lanka that flooded and tipped over, drowning more than 1,700 passengers. That this incident remains the worst railway disaster in history is mentioned, but in this context it is a footnote. It is all extraordinarily harrowing \u2013 and the series gets as close to communicating the scale of the disaster as possible. But in the last episode, there is a feeling of humanity picking itself up and walking on determinedly. It centres on the triaging and treating of hundreds of injured people on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi amid complete devastation \u2013 a process led by a gregarious local restaurateur \u2013 who was so helpful and decisive that it was wrongly assumed she had some relevant training \u2013 and a British psychiatrist whose medical knowledge made him the nearest thing to an emergency-room physician. They are lucid, thoughtful, emotive speakers. It\u2019s a privilege to see and hear them; that terrible day important to revisit. \u2022 Tsunami: Race Against Time airs on National Geographic and is on Disney+",

Tarnawsky revealed on Monday that she had begun proceedings for adverse action under the Fair Work Act, naming the commonwealth, her boss Richard Marles and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Tim Gartrell, as respondents. Tarnawsky is not alleging that either Marles or Gartrell bullied her. The claim alleges Tarnawsky was victimised for having raised the complaint. Her statement to the federal court names a colleague and refers to others unnamed. The claim outlines what Tarnawsky alleges Marles said when she raised the issue with him on 30 April. The legal action comes six weeks after Tarnawsky told Guardian Australia that she had allegedly been advised to find another job and effectively locked out of her office since raising a bullying complaint with Marles. She alleged the matter remains unresolved. Technically employed but on indefinite leave, Tarnawsky alleged she was unable to do her job. She made a public statement that day. Responding in parliament at the time, Marles said Tarnawsky was \u201ca wonderful person\u201d and he felt \u201cdeeply sad\u201d about the allegation but because of legal processes he could not comment further. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email On Monday, Tarnawsky announced she had commenced legal action, alleging she had been \u201cexiled\u201d and faced \u201cuntenable delays\u201d in resolving the matter. \u201cLike every worker in this country, those who work at Parliament House should be treated professionally, and afforded a safe and respectful workplace,\u201d Tarnawsky told journalists. \u201cTo my fellow staffers: we give countless hours of our lives to these jobs, in support of the ministers and MPs we serve. In return, we should not be tossed aside abruptly after such loyal service. Good exits are possible. It should not be unreasonable for any of us to expect to depart our roles with dignity; to walk away better from our time working in this building, rather than carrying lifelong trauma from the poor treatment we have endured here.\u201d Tarnawsky\u2019s statement of claim to the court alleges she had been attempting to manage the behaviour on her own but decided to raise it with Marles at the end of a trip to Ukraine in late April. Tarnawsky alleges in the documents that Marles told Gartrell on 29 April that he \u201cno longer wanted Ms Tarnawsky as his chief of staff\u201d. \u201cMr Gartrell did not inform Ms Tarnawsky of the conversation with Mr Marles or intervene to prevent Mr Marles acting in the manner he proposed,\u201d her statement of claim alleges, continuing that Gartrell acted \u201cto assist Mr Marles in preventing Ms Tarnawsky from performing her role\u201d. Tarnawsky alleges that in a phone conversation on the morning of 30 April, she sought Marles\u2019 help and he responded that he did not think the issue was \u201cfixable\u201d, that there had been \u201cissues\u201d with Tarnawsky for \u201cover a year\u201d and that he wanted to \u201cfinish\u201d dealing with it immediately. The claim alleges Marles told her on 30 April that she was \u201cnot stood down\u201d but must take immediate leave from work and look for another job and could \u201cdepart with dignity\u201d. It says she agreed to look for another job but \u201cif that was not possible, she would need to return to her role\u201d. It also alleges he told her she would no longer participate in an official visit to Hawaii, for which they were due to depart the next day. \u201cThe alteration of Ms Tarnawsky\u2019s position was to her prejudice, because it rendered Ms Tarnawsky\u2019s employment uncertain and insecure as a result of Mr Marles\u2019 adverse action and left her with no substantive role to perform,\u201d the claim alleges. Tarnawsky\u2019s lawyer, Marque Lawyers\u2019 managing partner Michael Bradley, said Tarnawsky would be seeking compensation. He alleged she was \u201cpunished \u2026 in a state of limbo, frozen out for more than 200 days now\u201d. The claim seeks compensation for medical expenses, alleged \u201churt, distress and humiliation\u201d and reputational damage. A government spokesperson said the matter was \u201csubject to legal proceedings, and it would not be appropriate to comment further\u201d. A spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office said Gartrell had no comment. Guardian Australia has approached Marles\u2019 office for comment.",

There are several themes that interrelate.</p> \n<p>There has long been serious concern at the prospect of a petrostate in charge of the climate talks for the second year in a row. Few had any confidence that the Azerbaijan presidency would put aside its oil and gas and interests in favour of the greater good \u2013 and no one was disappointed on this front.</p> \n<p>Throughout the last two weeks in Baku, the presidency appeared to listen mainly to the Saudis and the bigger emitting countries of the like-minded developing country group, essentially ignoring the interests of the small island states and least developed countries. Late in the Cop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/23/revealed-saudi-arabia-accused-of-modifying-official-cop29-negotiating-text\">blatant evidence</a> emerged of the presidency allowing Saudi Arabia to doctor its own texts.</p> \n<p>Next was the shocking failure of political leaders to respond to the increasing evidence of the climate crisis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/24/cop29-climate-progress-trump-presidency-politics-science\">The silver lining at a disappointing Cop29? It showed climate progress can survive Trump 2.0 | Geoffrey Lean</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Australia is no exception. Nearly all observers believe climate change minister, Chris Bowen, is strongly committed to action but most would also agree that the Albanese government, as a whole, has a distinct lack of commitment.</p> \n<p>Indeed it appears far more committed to fossil fuel development than taking the kind of action needed to address an issue that has wreaked havoc on Australians, from devastating floods to heatwaves, drought and bushfires. The evidence? Australia\u2019s fossil fuel emissions have flatlined when other countries are beginning to see a significant decrease.</p> \n<p>We also see worsening geopolitics after the election of Donald Trump and the rightward move of politics in various elections around the world. But I consider there\u2019s a much bigger thing happening than even these issues, something that explains a lot of the Cop politics and the lack of climate action.</p> \n<p>The fossil fuel industry.</p> \n<p>It is undergoing a resurgence: fielding 1,700 lobbyists in Baku, fighting climate action, promoting false solutions like carbon capture and storage, pushing offsets over action; net zero over real zero; capturing governments, [often still] denying the science, and doing its best to undermine policy wherever it can.</p> \n<p>Oil and gas emissions have been the cause of 90% of the increase in CO2 emissions over the past year, with gas the largest source. Last year the developed world gave this industry <a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/articles/statement/cop-29-moves-needle-on-finance\">US$378bn</a> in subsidies.</p> \n<p>Australia likes to present itself as a progressive country that\u2019s taking strong climate action but I\u2019m afraid on fossil fuels it\u2019s entirely hypocritical.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/blog/highlighting-the-hypocrisy-fossil-fuel-export-emissions/\">Our research</a> shows that Australian fossil fuel exports make a much larger contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions than domestic emissions, as \u2013 alongside Japan and South Korea \u2013 it continues to massively promote gas development in the east and south-east Asian region.</p> \n<p>The Albanese government needs to work out which side of history it wants to be on when it comes to climate change. A primary school student can work out that you don\u2019t stop bad behaviour by continuing to do it, which makes the government\u2019s dash for gas all the more confounding.</p> \n<p>Next year will be another tough one on climate internationally. The next Cop host, the Brazilian government, needs all the support it can get. President Lula wants to secure an ambitious Cop30 outcome that moves us forward on action to limit warming to 1.5C.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/24/greenwashing-cop-summits-best-chance-averting-climate-breakdown\">Yes, there is a lot of greenwashing, but Cop summits are our best chance of averting climate breakdown | Ashish Ghadiali</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Will Australia help? Or will it be too busy promoting its gas interests with companies like Woodside? How will Australia react to the inevitable pressure from the Trump presidency to expand gas use globally, particularly to help gas block the necessary coal-to-renewables transition in the Asian power sector.</p> \n<p>And then of course there\u2019s Australia\u2019s bid to host Cop31 in 2026. While it\u2019s clear Bowen rightly sees great benefits for climate action in Australia from hosting Cop31, what\u2019s not clear is whether there is a whole-of-government commitment: it wasn\u2019t particularly visible in Baku.</p> \n<p>I wonder whether lying behind this ambiguity is the Albanese government\u2019s larger commitment to develop the gas industry at increasing scale all the way to 2050.</p> \n<p>The next few years are going to see a mounting sense of urgency and crisis, if not panic in some places, as climate impacts \u2013 long foretold by us in the science community \u2013 begin to unfold on an ever-increasing and rapid scale. So by the time we get to Cop31, there\u2019s going to be enormous pressure for action \u201cand indeed on developing momentum for a phase-out of fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>But right now Australia is at serious risk of putting itself on the wrong side of history.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate Analytics</p>",

Baku saw little sense of urgency or increased climate action, despite the universal message from scientific studies, including the Climate Action Tracker. Our global update this year found that in the last three years there\u2019s been virtually no improvement in either action on the ground, nor ambition to take action in the future. And this is despite a series of seemingly never-ending, global warming-linked deadly catastrophes unfolding around the world. It deferred implementation of the first global stock take, the most critical part of the Paris agreement that assesses progress every five years. Last year it found in the strongest terms that the world was far off track to meet the Paris agreement\u2019s 1.5C warming limit and that we need to urgently transition away from fossil fuels. How did this all come about? There are several themes that interrelate. There has long been serious concern at the prospect of a petrostate in charge of the climate talks for the second year in a row. Few had any confidence that the Azerbaijan presidency would put aside its oil and gas and interests in favour of the greater good \u2013 and no one was disappointed on this front. Throughout the last two weeks in Baku, the presidency appeared to listen mainly to the Saudis and the bigger emitting countries of the like-minded developing country group, essentially ignoring the interests of the small island states and least developed countries. Late in the Cop, blatant evidence emerged of the presidency allowing Saudi Arabia to doctor its own texts. Next was the shocking failure of political leaders to respond to the increasing evidence of the climate crisis. Australia is no exception. Nearly all observers believe climate change minister, Chris Bowen, is strongly committed to action but most would also agree that the Albanese government, as a whole, has a distinct lack of commitment. Indeed it appears far more committed to fossil fuel development than taking the kind of action needed to address an issue that has wreaked havoc on Australians, from devastating floods to heatwaves, drought and bushfires. The evidence? Australia\u2019s fossil fuel emissions have flatlined when other countries are beginning to see a significant decrease. We also see worsening geopolitics after the election of Donald Trump and the rightward move of politics in various elections around the world. But I consider there\u2019s a much bigger thing happening than even these issues, something that explains a lot of the Cop politics and the lack of climate action. The fossil fuel industry. It is undergoing a resurgence: fielding 1,700 lobbyists in Baku, fighting climate action, promoting false solutions like carbon capture and storage, pushing offsets over action; net zero over real zero; capturing governments, [often still] denying the science, and doing its best to undermine policy wherever it can. Oil and gas emissions have been the cause of 90% of the increase in CO2 emissions over the past year, with gas the largest source. Last year the developed world gave this industry US$378bn in subsidies. Australia likes to present itself as a progressive country that\u2019s taking strong climate action but I\u2019m afraid on fossil fuels it\u2019s entirely hypocritical. Our research shows that Australian fossil fuel exports make a much larger contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions than domestic emissions, as \u2013 alongside Japan and South Korea \u2013 it continues to massively promote gas development in the east and south-east Asian region. The Albanese government needs to work out which side of history it wants to be on when it comes to climate change. A primary school student can work out that you don\u2019t stop bad behaviour by continuing to do it, which makes the government\u2019s dash for gas all the more confounding. Next year will be another tough one on climate internationally. The next Cop host, the Brazilian government, needs all the support it can get. President Lula wants to secure an ambitious Cop30 outcome that moves us forward on action to limit warming to 1.5C. Will Australia help? Or will it be too busy promoting its gas interests with companies like Woodside? How will Australia react to the inevitable pressure from the Trump presidency to expand gas use globally, particularly to help gas block the necessary coal-to-renewables transition in the Asian power sector. And then of course there\u2019s Australia\u2019s bid to host Cop31 in 2026. While it\u2019s clear Bowen rightly sees great benefits for climate action in Australia from hosting Cop31, what\u2019s not clear is whether there is a whole-of-government commitment: it wasn\u2019t particularly visible in Baku. I wonder whether lying behind this ambiguity is the Albanese government\u2019s larger commitment to develop the gas industry at increasing scale all the way to 2050. The next few years are going to see a mounting sense of urgency and crisis, if not panic in some places, as climate impacts \u2013 long foretold by us in the science community \u2013 begin to unfold on an ever-increasing and rapid scale. So by the time we get to Cop31, there\u2019s going to be enormous pressure for action \u201cand indeed on developing momentum for a phase-out of fossil fuels. But right now Australia is at serious risk of putting itself on the wrong side of history. \u2022 Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate Analytics",

Less than 2% of the population account for almost 14% of all A&amp;E attendances, the British Red Cross study suggests. Across the UK, patients are turning to emergency departments five or more times a year due to \u201cunresolved medical issues\u201d, the charity said. \u201cMany of those frequently attending A&amp;E had often tried to get other help but this had not met their needs,\u201d its report says. \u201cThis meant that when they reached A&amp;E, they were often in need of more urgent care.\u201d The research comes as NHS England\u2019s top A&amp;E doctor urged people to use 111 services this winter and suggested that as many as two in five people arriving at A&amp;E could be better treated elsewhere. Frontline emergency doctors have sounded the alarm over an approaching winter crisis that they say is already putting patients in overstretched A&amp;E departments at risk. For the new study, British Red Cross experts conducted a deep-dive review of repeat visitors in emergency departments and also examined five years of data on A&amp;E attendances in Dorset. Just 1.7% of Dorset\u2019s population accounted for 13.8% of its A&amp;E attendances, according to the review. The visits were more likely to be classed as urgent by doctors, the report found. Frequent visitors were also more likely to live in deprived neighbourhoods. The majority of people attending A&amp;E frequently fell into two main groups: people over 70, most of whom had multiple long-term conditions; and people aged 20 to 49, particularly younger women, with mental ill health. Both groups were more likely to arrive at A&amp;E via ambulance and both attended GPs more frequently in the month before their A&amp;E attendance. B\u00e9atrice Butsana-Sita, the chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: \u201cEvery year millions of people go to A&amp;E when they have an accident or are in desperate need of care.

Prof Julian Redhead, NHS England\u2019s clinical director for urgent and emergency care, urged people to use 999 or A&amp;E services only for life-threatening emergencies and serious injuries, and otherwise to call 111 or use 111 online or via the NHS app. NHS England estimated up to two-fifths of A&amp;E attendances were avoidable or could be better treated elsewhere.
