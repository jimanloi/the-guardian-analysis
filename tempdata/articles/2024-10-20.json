Moldovans went to the polls earlier in the day to cast their vote in a presidential election and an EU referendum that marked a key moment in the tug-of-war between Russia and the west over the future of the small, landlocked south-east European country with a population of about 2.5 million people. At 3am GMT on Monday, with 97.66% of the vote counted, 50% of Moldovans voted \u201cyes\u201d, according to results given on Moldova\u2019s electoral commission website.

Pre-election surveys indicated that Sandu held a comfortable lead over her main rival, Stoianoglo, and other candidates, while polls suggested that about 60% of voters supported the pro-EU path in the run-up to the referendum. Sandu, a 52-year-old former World Bank adviser, was first elected president in November 2020, riding a wave of popularity as an anti-corruption reformer with a pro-European agenda. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moldova has gravitated between pro-western and pro-Russian courses, but under Sandu it had accelerated its push to escape Moscow\u2019s orbit, especially as Russia launched its war in neighbouring Ukraine. The two ballots were held amid claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow and its proxies had orchestrated an intense \u201chybrid war\u201d campaign to destabilise the country and derail its EU path. \u201cMoldova has faced an unprecedented assault on our country\u2019s freedom and democracy, both today and in recent months,\u201d Sandu told supporters in the capital, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, on Sunday as votes were being counted, adding that \u201ccriminal groups\u201d had tried to \u201cundermine a democratic process\u201d. \u201cWe are waiting for the final results, and we will respond with firm decisions,\u201d she added. The allegations against Moscow included funding pro-Kremlin opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme. In particular, officials accused the fugitive pro-Russian businessman Ilan Shor, a vocal opponent of EU membership, of running a destabilising campaign from Moscow. Earlier this month, the national police chief, Viorel Cern\u0103u\u021banu, accused Shor and Moscow of establishing a complex \u201cmafia-style\u201d voter-buying scheme and bribing 130,000 Moldovans \u2013 almost 10% of normal voter turnout \u2013 to vote against the referendum and in favour of Russia-friendly candidates in what he called an \u201cunprecedented, direct attack\u201d. On Thursday, law enforcement agencies said they had also uncovered a programme in which hundreds of people were taken to Russia to undergo training to stage riots and civil unrest. In total, Moldovan officials claimed Russia had spent about $100m this year on Moldova\u2019s electoral processes. Moldova applied to join the EU after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, which was harshly condemned by Sandu and many in the country as tens of thousands of Ukranian refugees fled to Chi\u0219in\u0103u. Moldova officially began EU accession negotiations in June, though scepticism remains high about the country\u2019s ability to implement the necessary democratic and judicial reforms in the near future. Observers believe Sandu could now be facing a tricky second-round runoff against a united pro-Moscow opposition front led by Stoianoglo. Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was dismissed by Sandu, urged people to boycott the referendum or vote \u201cno\u201d, describing it as a \u201ccynical\u201d move to boost Sandu\u2019s popularity. In an earlier interview with the Guardian, Stoianoglo denied that he was working on behalf of Russia. But he declined to criticise the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and called for improved relations with Moscow.",

It says that encouraging better welfare and health practices within workplaces would help to reduce the economic cost of ill health, which is estimated to be around \u00a3100bn a year.</p> <p>William Roberts, the chief executive of the RSPH, said: \u201cWe are at a critical time for our nation\u2019s health. Millions of people are leaving the workforce due to ill-health. It costs us tens of billions every year. It also puts an additional strain on our health service leaving people languishing on waiting lists.</p> <p>\u201cThe employment rights bill is a big step in the right direction, but we need to go further and quicker. We spend a great deal of our adult lives in and around the workplace.

      "bodyText": "Almost half of the UK workforce lack access to workplace health support including winter flu vaccinations and checks for cardiovascular diseases, a report has found. The analysis, by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), looked at data from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) and found that more than 10 million UK workers lack access to services including basic health checks, vaccinations, and smoking or weight loss support, provided by their employer. The report found that the UK\u2019s current workplace health system could further exacerbate existing health inequalities, given that people in lower paid industries, such as hospitality and agriculture, are even less likely to have access to health protection interventions at work. A common type of health check used by employers is an NHS-run programme that checks for signs of conditions such as cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The paper calls for the government to establish a national health and work standard that would establish a minimum level of support, to which employees should be entitled. It says that encouraging better welfare and health practices within workplaces would help to reduce the economic cost of ill health, which is estimated to be around \u00a3100bn a year. William Roberts, the chief executive of the RSPH, said: \u201cWe are at a critical time for our nation\u2019s health. Millions of people are leaving the workforce due to ill-health. It costs us tens of billions every year. It also puts an additional strain on our health service leaving people languishing on waiting lists. \u201cThe employment rights bill is a big step in the right direction, but we need to go further and quicker. We spend a great deal of our adult lives in and around the workplace. We need to think about how we use our workplaces to build health, keep people well, and prevent people being signed off sick. \u201cAs it stands, our workplaces are exacerbating health inequalities. This means that millions of people that would most benefit from workplace health support are missing out. We know that businesses want to do more to build healthy workplaces and support their employees. This report sets out a clear and actionable set of recommendations that will make a real impact if implemented by policymakers.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",

Many more \u2013 two-thirds of respondents \u2013 said they would not want anyone who is not directly treating them to have access to their medical records.

In the May consultation, large majorities also said they were worried that NHS IT systems could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks (82%) and that the NHS might make mistakes in handling the data (65%). Half (50%) were slightly or strongly concerned that the health service might sell their personal data to companies without their permission. Of those polled, 69% said they would like to be told if a summary of their GP record is collected nationally, allowing doctors away from home to be able to view their private information. Writing in the Guardian, Streeting said: \u201cThe challenges the NHS faces today are huge, but the opportunities are enormous. The revolution taking place today in science and technology will transform the way we receive healthcare. \u201cNye Bevan would have had no idea in 1948, but the model he created makes the NHS the best-placed healthcare system in the world to take advantage of rapid advances in data, genomics, predictive and preventative medicine. \u201cIt allows us to introduce patient passports, so whether you\u2019re seeing a GP or a hospital surgeon, they have your full medical history. We will be able to judge a child\u2019s risk of disease from birth, so they can take steps to prevent it striking.\u201d Launching a \u201cnational conversation\u201d with the public, health workers and experts to help shape the government\u2019s 10-year NHS plan, to be published in spring next year, Streeting said that as well as the digitisation of the NHS, he wanted healthcare to shift from hospitals to the community. As part of that, the government wants new neighbourhood health centres where patients will be able to see family doctors, district nurses, care workers, physiotherapists, health visitors and mental health specialists, all locally and under the same roof. There will also be a third shift in focus, from sickness to prevention, with the aim of shortening the amount of time people spend chronically unwell and preventing ill-health. Smart watches and wearable tech will be handed to millions of people with diabetes or high blood pressure, so they can monitor their own health at home. The prime minister is expected to accompany Streeting at the launch of the new online platform at a London health centre on Monday. Keir Starmer said of the consultation: \u201cWe have a clear plan to fix the health service, but it\u2019s only right that we hear from the people who rely on the NHS every day to have their say and shape our plan as we deliver it. \u201cTogether we can build a healthcare system that puts patients first and delivers the care that everyone deserves. \u201cWe have a huge opportunity to put the NHS back on its feet. So, let\u2019s be the generation that took the NHS from the worst crisis in its history and made it fit for the future.\u201d",

Drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Gospel of Luke, the vice-president argued for policies that embrace compassion.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWhen we come across our brothers and sisters in need, let us, as the Good Samaritan, did see in the face of a stranger, a neighbor, and let us recognize that when we shine the light in moments of darkness, it will guide our feet into the path of peace.</p> <p>\u201cAnd let us remember that while weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>She asked: \u201cWhat kind of country do we want to live in \u2013 a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice?\u201d</p> <p>Harris added: \u201cThe great thing about living in a democracy is that we, the people, have the power to answer that question. So let us answer not just through our words, but through our actions and with our votes.\u201d</p> <p>Later in the day, Stevie Wonder joined Harris at a rally at the Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro. And the vice-president spoke with the Rev Al Sharpton.</p> <p>Asked by the civil rights leader about her support among men, and reports that Black men are pulling away from Harris\u2019s campaign, the vice-president said: \u201cThere\u2019s this narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not panning out in reality.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his earlier comments that attacked Democrats as \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, this time specifically denouncing representatives Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff.</p> <p>During an <a href=\"https://x.com/AccountableGOP/status/1848025582488936724\">interview </a>with Howard Kurtz on Fox News, broadcast on Sunday, the former president said that \u201cradical left lunatics \u2026 the enemy from within \u2026 should be very easily handled, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military\u201d \u2013 before singling out Pelosi and Schiff.</p> <p>Similar comments made by Trump in the past weeks have sparked widespread concern and raised fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he were to become president again. The Harris campaign was quick to respond to the new comments.</p> <p>\u201cEven in his Fox News safe space, Donald Trump cannot help but show himself as the unhinged, angry, unstable man that he is \u2013 focused on his own petty grievances and tired playbook of division,\u201d Ammar Moussa, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, wrote in an email.</p> <p>\u201cThis is precisely why his handlers are hiding him from major mainstream interviews and refusing to let him debate again. They don\u2019t want the country to see this candidate in decline,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Later in the day, the former president made a campaign stop at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania, manning the fryer. The visit was meant to be a jab at Harris, who worked at the fast food chain when she was younger. Trump has frequently called that experience into question, without providing any evidence.</p>    <p>Trump spent most of his town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Sunday evening attacking immigrants coming into the US over the southern border, boasting about his harsh immigration policies during his presidency, and promising to increase fracking in the state.</p> <p>Also taking the stage on Sunday was Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X who has thrown his weight behind Trump. At a town hall in Pittsburgh, Musk repeated false and fear-mongering claims, telling attendees \u201cthe constitution is literally under attack\u201d. He then issued his second check for a million dollars to a signatory of his petition backing the first and second amendment.</p> <p>Musk announced on Saturday that America Pac, his Trump-allied political action committee, will give $1m every day until the presidential election to someone who signs the petition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/20/elon-musk-promises-to-award-1m-every-day-to-voters-as-he-steps-up-campaigning-for-trump\">Musk pledges $1m each day in apparent bid to galvanize Republican voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pledge appears to be a way to incentivize Republicans in battleground states to register to vote. But the legality of the scheme is unclear. Several legal experts said on Saturday the petition appeared to violate federal election laws that prohibits paying or offering to pay for someone to register to vote or actually vote under title 52 of the US code.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Democratic governors from three states in the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d delivered their closing pitches for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris\">Harris</a>.</p> <p>Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer barnstormed the Sunday morning political shows to talk up the vice-president\u2019s policy agenda \u2013 and highlight differences with Trump, 16 days before an election that polls suggest is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/harris-trump-polls-election-race\">still on a knife edge</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to Donald Trump when he was in charge of the country,\u201d Shapiro told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.</p> <p>\u201cRemember the record? I know there\u2019s still some people that have maybe a little brain fog, they don\u2019t remember what it was like under Donald Trump. You had more chaos, you had less jobs, and you had a whole lot less freedom.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to go back to a time of chaos. I want a stable, strong leader, and that\u2019s Kamala Harris.\u201d</p> <p>In Michigan, according to Whitmer, voters were comparing both candidates\u2019 records ahead of the election.</p> <p>\u201cWhile this is going to be close, I\u2019d much rather be playing our hand in theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got a better candidate. We\u2019ve got receipts on the issues that matter to the American people, on the economy, individual rights, affordable housing, and we got a better ground game.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans appearing on the Sunday talk shows were trying to control the message after Trump\u2019s extraordinary and vulgar rhetoric during a Saturday night rally in Pennsylvania, when he called Harris a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d and exalted the size of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-updates\">late golfer Arnold Palmer\u2019s penis</a>.</p> <p>The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham lost his composure when questioned about it on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press \u2013 and tried to pivot to two recent assassination attempts on Trump, both conducted by pro-Republican persons.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you talk about rhetoric, you gotta remember they tried to blow his head off,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd another guy tried to kill him \u2026 so I\u2019m not overly impressed about the rhetoric game here.\u201d</p> <p>Graham also condemned Republican colleagues, including Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, as well as numerous ex-Trump administration officials who have denounced him and expressed support for Harris.</p> <p>The House speaker, Mike Johnson, was more restrained \u2013 but equally as determined to avoid questions about Trump\u2019s commentary in an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, suggesting that it was host Jake Tapper who was obsessed with talking about Palmer\u2019s penis.</p> <p>\u201cThe media can pick it apart, but people are going to vote what\u2019s best for their family and they see that in Trump,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Early in-person voting is under way in numerous states, with voters in Georgia setting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/us-election-briefing-georgia-shatters-early-voting-record-as-more-than-300000-cast-ballots\">first-day turnout record</a> on Tuesday, even as polls have the candidates in a virtual dead heat.</p> <p>It emerged Sunday that Harris has no plans to campaign with Joe Biden before election day on 5 November. \u201cThe most important role he can play is doing his job as president,\u201d an anonymous White House official <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-no-current-plans-campaign-biden-election-day-rcna176254\">told NBC News</a>, which said the decision was mutual following discussions between the campaign and Biden administration officials.</p> <p><em>Hugo Lowell contributed reporting</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday on the campaign trail on Sunday while Donald Trump visited a McDonald\u2019s and doubled down on his dangerous rhetoric labeling Democrats as \u201cenemies from within\u201d, as both candidates tried to shore up support in key states ahead of the US presidential election. Harris rallied Black voters in Georgia on Sunday with \u201csouls to the polls\u201d visits to two community churches. Harris\u2019s comments to the congregation of the New Birth Missionary Baptist church in Atlanta focused on how religious experiences in her youth in Oakland, California, influenced her politics. Drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Gospel of Luke, the vice-president argued for policies that embrace compassion. She said: \u201cWhen we come across our brothers and sisters in need, let us, as the Good Samaritan, did see in the face of a stranger, a neighbor, and let us recognize that when we shine the light in moments of darkness, it will guide our feet into the path of peace. \u201cAnd let us remember that while weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning.\u201d She asked: \u201cWhat kind of country do we want to live in \u2013 a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice?\u201d Harris added: \u201cThe great thing about living in a democracy is that we, the people, have the power to answer that question. So let us answer not just through our words, but through our actions and with our votes.\u201d Later in the day, Stevie Wonder joined Harris at a rally at the Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro. And the vice-president spoke with the Rev Al Sharpton. Asked by the civil rights leader about her support among men, and reports that Black men are pulling away from Harris\u2019s campaign, the vice-president said: \u201cThere\u2019s this narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not panning out in reality.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his earlier comments that attacked Democrats as \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d, this time specifically denouncing representatives Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. During an interview with Howard Kurtz on Fox News, broadcast on Sunday, the former president said that \u201cradical left lunatics \u2026 the enemy from within \u2026 should be very easily handled, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military\u201d \u2013 before singling out Pelosi and Schiff. Similar comments made by Trump in the past weeks have sparked widespread concern and raised fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he were to become president again. The Harris campaign was quick to respond to the new comments. \u201cEven in his Fox News safe space, Donald Trump cannot help but show himself as the unhinged, angry, unstable man that he is \u2013 focused on his own petty grievances and tired playbook of division,\u201d Ammar Moussa, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, wrote in an email. \u201cThis is precisely why his handlers are hiding him from major mainstream interviews and refusing to let him debate again. They don\u2019t want the country to see this candidate in decline,\u201d he added. Later in the day, the former president made a campaign stop at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania, manning the fryer. The visit was meant to be a jab at Harris, who worked at the fast food chain when she was younger. Trump has frequently called that experience into question, without providing any evidence. Trump spent most of his town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Sunday evening attacking immigrants coming into the US over the southern border, boasting about his harsh immigration policies during his presidency, and promising to increase fracking in the state. Also taking the stage on Sunday was Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X who has thrown his weight behind Trump. At a town hall in Pittsburgh, Musk repeated false and fear-mongering claims, telling attendees \u201cthe constitution is literally under attack\u201d. He then issued his second check for a million dollars to a signatory of his petition backing the first and second amendment. Musk announced on Saturday that America Pac, his Trump-allied political action committee, will give $1m every day until the presidential election to someone who signs the petition. The pledge appears to be a way to incentivize Republicans in battleground states to register to vote. But the legality of the scheme is unclear. Several legal experts said on Saturday the petition appeared to violate federal election laws that prohibits paying or offering to pay for someone to register to vote or actually vote under title 52 of the US code. Meanwhile, Democratic governors from three states in the so-called \u201cblue wall\u201d delivered their closing pitches for Harris. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer barnstormed the Sunday morning political shows to talk up the vice-president\u2019s policy agenda \u2013 and highlight differences with Trump, 16 days before an election that polls suggest is still on a knife edge. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to Donald Trump when he was in charge of the country,\u201d Shapiro told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cRemember the record? I know there\u2019s still some people that have maybe a little brain fog, they don\u2019t remember what it was like under Donald Trump. You had more chaos, you had less jobs, and you had a whole lot less freedom. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to go back to a time of chaos. I want a stable, strong leader, and that\u2019s Kamala Harris.\u201d In Michigan, according to Whitmer, voters were comparing both candidates\u2019 records ahead of the election. \u201cWhile this is going to be close, I\u2019d much rather be playing our hand in theirs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got a better candidate. We\u2019ve got receipts on the issues that matter to the American people, on the economy, individual rights, affordable housing, and we got a better ground game.\u201d Republicans appearing on the Sunday talk shows were trying to control the message after Trump\u2019s extraordinary and vulgar rhetoric during a Saturday night rally in Pennsylvania, when he called Harris a \u201cshit vice-president\u201d and exalted the size of the late golfer Arnold Palmer\u2019s penis. The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham lost his composure when questioned about it on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press \u2013 and tried to pivot to two recent assassination attempts on Trump, both conducted by pro-Republican persons. \u201cWhen you talk about rhetoric, you gotta remember they tried to blow his head off,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd another guy tried to kill him \u2026 so I\u2019m not overly impressed about the rhetoric game here.\u201d Graham also condemned Republican colleagues, including Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, as well as numerous ex-Trump administration officials who have denounced him and expressed support for Harris. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, was more restrained \u2013 but equally as determined to avoid questions about Trump\u2019s commentary in an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, suggesting that it was host Jake Tapper who was obsessed with talking about Palmer\u2019s penis. \u201cThe media can pick it apart, but people are going to vote what\u2019s best for their family and they see that in Trump,\u201d he said. Early in-person voting is under way in numerous states, with voters in Georgia setting a first-day turnout record on Tuesday, even as polls have the candidates in a virtual dead heat. It emerged Sunday that Harris has no plans to campaign with Joe Biden before election day on 5 November. \u201cThe most important role he can play is doing his job as president,\u201d an anonymous White House official told NBC News, which said the decision was mutual following discussions between the campaign and Biden administration officials.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us today. This blog is closing soon. Here\u2019s where things stand: Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday rallying Black voters in Georgia today with \u201csouls to the polls\u201d visits to two community churches. At the second rally, Stevie Wonder joined Harris and sang Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cRedemption Song\u201d. Donald Trump visited a McDonald\u2019s franchise in Pennsylvania, where he wore an apron and began handing out orders to customers waiting in the drive-thru lane. He was also manning the fryer while he answered questions from reporters. The former president also attended a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by former ESPN anchor Sage Steele and answered questions from the audience. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, hosted a town hall in Pittsburgh in support of Trump. In a short speech, Musk repeated false and fear-mongering claims, telling attendees \u201cthe constitution is literally under attack\u201d. Donald Trump concluded his remarks at a town hall held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. His final question came from moderator Sage Steele, who asked him why he chose to do such a \u201cdangerous job\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make America greater than ever before, and we can\u2019t do that sitting on a beach,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump has spent most of his town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, attacking immigrants coming into the US through the southern border, boasting about his harsh immigration policies during his presidency, and promising to increase fracking in the state. \u201cDrill, baby, drill. Frack, baby, frack,\u201d he said, a usual campaign slogan. He also invited Republican representatives Lloyd Smucker and Dan Meuser to the stage to make brief remarks. During an interview on MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNatio, Kamala Harris spoke with Reverand Al Sharpton in a one-on-one interview in Atlanta. Harris discussed the death of Yahya Sinwar and the conflict between Israel and Hamas. \u201cWe have got to get this war over with. We got to get the hostages out. We need the war to end,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe death of Sinwar I believe has removed an obstacle to that end. And so, we\u2019ve got to work at it and we\u2019ve got to work at it through diplomatic means and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d The Democratic presidential nominee also spoke about the latest polling on support from Black men. \u201cThis narrative about what kind of support we are receiving from Black men that is just not panning out in reality,\u201d she said. \u201cI must earn the vote of everyone regardless of their race or gender.\u201d Donald Trump said he\u2019s completed two cognitive tests as opponents have increasingly questioned the 78-year-old Republican presidential nominee\u2019s mental and physical fitness. \u201cI aced the both of them,\u201d Trump said during a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd the doctor in one case said, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen anybody ace them.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see cognitive tests for anybody running for president or vice-president\u201d, Trump added. He later expressed age is but a number, using media mogul Rupert Murdoch as an example. During the town hall in Pennsylvania, a woman with a tattoo of Donald Trump on her leg asked the former president about his plan to lower taxes for working Americans. Trump accused migrants arriving from Central America of hampering the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let foreign countries come in and steal our businesses, our jobs and everything else,\u201d he said, continuing to make anti-immigrant remarks during his answer. \u201cWe want to have people come in, but they have to come in legally. We have to know they love our country,\u201d he added. Musk entered the stage at the Roxian Theater in Pittsburgh as the sound system blared \u201cSabotage\u201d by the Beastie Boys. He carried a yellow \u201cterrible towel\u201d of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city\u2019s beloved NFL team, and jumped up and down as the crowd chanted his name.In a short speech, Musk told attendees, many wearing red Maga hats, that \u201cthe constitution is literally under attack\u201d and urged a \u201cclean sweep of those who believe in the constitution\u201d in November. He then issued his second check for a million dollars to a signatory to his petition backing the first and second amendment. Kristine Fishell, who had sat on the balcony level, received the giant novelty check and smiled for the cameras before being whisked away. The event then pivoted to a lengthy town hall, where attendees asked a variety of conspiracy tinged questions and whether Musk would run for president in 2028. He could not, he explained, due to the natural born citizen clause of the US constitution, and did not want the job either. \u201cI hate politics,\u201d Musk said, explaining his purported reason for injecting himself into the 2024 race. \u201cBut the stakes are so high.\u201d As the town hall began to wrap up, no attendee had asked whether Donald Trump\u2019s promise to bring Musk, who is worth an estimated $247bn, into government as a \u201csecretary of cost cutting\u201d might be a conflict of interest. He told the crowd he was ready for the position, adding \u201cI\u2019d like to say it\u2019s a hard job, but it\u2019s not\u201d. A few seconds earlier a member of the crowd had shouted \u201ctaxation is theft!\u201d. Former ESPN anchor Sage Steele is moderating the town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump is taking questions from the audience. His first question was on whether he would protect social security and Medicare benefits. \u201cNumber one, no tax on social security for our seniors, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNo tax on tips,\u201d he said, and \u201cno tax on overtime.\u201d Former president Donald Trump has started delivering his remarks at an event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His speech in the Lancaster County Convention Center follows a visit to a local McDonald\u2019s, where he wore an apron and worked the french fries station. We\u2019ll be following his comments as he rallies in the battleground state. The legendary singer Stevie Wonder rallied congregants at a church in Atlanta with a rendition of Bob Marley\u2019s Redemption Song in support of Vice-President Kamala Harris. Wonder performed during a church service and early vote event at Divine Faith Ministries International. He also sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d as Harris celebrates her 60th birthday today. The Harris campaign responded to comments made by former president Donald Trump calling Democratic representatives \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d during an interview with Fox News that aired on Sunday. \u201cEven in his Fox News safe space, Donald Trump cannot help but show himself as the unhinged, angry, unstable man that he is \u2013 focused on his own petty grievances and tired playbook of division,\u201d Ammar Moussa, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, wrote in an email. \u201cThis is precisely why his handlers are hiding him from major mainstream interviews and refusing to let him debate again. They don\u2019t want the country to see this candidate in decline,\u201d he added. The legality of the America Pac $1m prize draw is unclear, and a justice department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry. But several legal experts said on Saturday the petition appeared to violate federal election laws that prohibits paying or offering to pay for someone to register to vote or actually vote under title 52 of the US code. According to the justice department\u2019s election crimes manual, for an offer of payment to violate federal election law, it must have been intended to induce or reward the prospective voter for engaging in one or more acts necessary to cast a ballot. The election crimes manual distinguishes between making it easier for people to vote, such as offering free rides to a polling station, and inducing people to vote, which is unlawful. UCLA law professor Rick Hasen said in his blog that the America Pac $1m prize draw appears to be an illegal scheme because it offered the payments to registered voters. \u201cThough maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,\u201d he wrote. At a town hall in Pennsylvania, billionaire Elon Musk has commented on his aims to expedite government agency procedures and his role under Trump\u2019s presidency if he were to be elected. \u201cI will do my best to ensure that that actions are taken that maximize the benefit to the American people,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI don\u2019t know at the end of the day how much influence I\u2019ll have. But I\u2019ll do my best to be as helpful as possible.\u201d \u201cThere are actually a huge number of of drugs that are stuck in approval at the FDA that can help people and they\u2019re just stuck in bureaucratic molasses,\u201d Musk said. \u201cSimply expediting drug approval and the FDA, I think, will save millions of lives.\u201d The CEO of Tesla and owner of X, Elon Musk, is speaking at a town hall in Pittsburgh today in support of former President Donald Trump. Musk is in McKees Rocks to promote voter registration and mail-in balloting ahead of the November election and a promise of cash for those who attend. He\u2019s currently taking questions from the audience. Fromer president Donald Trump doubled down on his comments labeling Democrats as \u201cthe enemy from within,\u201d this time specifically attacking Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. During an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News with Howard Kurtz, Trump said that \u201cradical left lunatics\u2026 the enemy from within\u2026 should be very easily handled, if necessary, by the National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military.\u201d \u201cThese are bad people. We have a lot of bad people. But when you look at \u2018Shifty Schiff\u2019 and some of the others, yeah, they are, to me, the enemy from within,\u201d Trump said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cMediabuzz.\u201d \u201cI think Nancy Pelosi is an enemy from within,\u201d he added. \u201cShe was supposed to protect the Capitol.\u201d The former president sparked outrage last week after calling for the US armed forces to be turned against his political adversaries when voters go to the polls at next month\u2019s presidential election. Former president Donald Trump, while working at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania, sarcastically congratulated Kamala Harris on her 60th birthday. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get her some fries,\u201d Trump said. He also took a moment to boast about his time in office while he was working the fryer at the fast food chain. \u201cWe had the best economy ever. We had the strongest borders ever, a military that knocked out ISIS in a few weeks,\u201d he said. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson accused SpaceX founder Elon Musk of \u201cspreading dangerous disinformation.\u201d The comments come after Musk alleged that \u201cMichigan has more registered voters than eligible citizens.\u201d \u201cHere are the facts,\u201d Benson wrote in a post on X. \u201cThere aren\u2019t more voters than citizens in Michigan. There are 7.2 million active registered voters and 7.9 citizens of voting age in our state.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t feed the trolls,\u201d she added. In an interview with NBC News, a Harris campaign official said that Joe Biden plans to help Kamala Harris by leveraging his longtime political relationships, specifically with labor leaders, and by holding official White House events. \u201cHe\u2019s out there doing the job as president, and she\u2019s out there campaigning,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear voters want something new.\u201d White House officials told NBC News they believe at this time that \u201cthe most important role he can play is doing his job as president.\u201d Former president Donald Trump was working at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania, manning the fryer as a way to attack Vice-President Kamala Harris stint working at the fast food chain when she was younger, an experience he calls into question frequently. Vice-President Kamala Harris spoke at New Birth Missionary Baptist church on Sunday, before a congregation of about 4,000 in south DeKalb, a Black suburb of Atlanta. Her comments focused on how religious experiences in her youth at a church in Oakland, California, influenced her politics. Drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Bible\u2019s Book of Luke, Harris argued for policies that embrace compassion. \u201cWhen we come across our brothers and sisters in need, let us, as the Good Samaritan, did see in the face of a stranger, a neighbor, and let us recognize that when we shine the light in moments of darkness, it will guide our feet into the path of peace. And let us remember that while weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning.\u201d Harris was accompanied by her pastor Amos Brown of San Francisco\u2019s Third Baptist church. Brown, a contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights leaders in the lexicon of Atlanta\u2019s history. New Birth Missionary Baptist is a megachurch which owns more land than any other Black church in America, said it\u2019s pastor, Jamal Bryant, in opening remarks. The church plays a prominent role in Atlanta politics, counting many of the region\u2019s most powerful Black elected and appointed officials as regular members. Bryant noted that its sanctuary has hosted five different presidents. The funeral service for Coretta Scott King was moved to New Birth to accommodate the demands of space. New Birth gave away $83m in scholarships this year. The Trump campaign launched a new ad on Saturday, posting a video of Kamala Harris calling young adults aged 18 to 24 \u201cstupid\u201d. The video ends with text on the screen urging voters to \u201cvote Kamala out\u201d. The ad, which is running on Facebook, Instagram, and Google in several battleground states, has been described as lacking context. In the longer video, Harris is talking about a program aimed at lowering recidivism among young offenders with better reintegration. The Harris campaign also launched an ad, though it holds back on the aggressiveness. The video, posted on Facebook, features basketball legend Magic Johnson encouraging voters to vote early, saying, \u201cI\u2019m counting on you to vote, and so is America.\u201d Minnesota Governor Tim Walz delivered his remarks at a church in Saginaw, Michigan, where he took a stab at former president Donald Trump for selling branded Bibles. Walz told the crowd that he feels \u201cpretty uncomfortable with this idea\u201d. \u201cWe understand in our faith, the Bible is to be read and followed and absorbed. It\u2019s not to be branded and sold for $59,\u201d Walz said. The Democratic VP pick also allded to the topic of religion and how it came up during the vice-presidential debate against JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate. \u201cA couple weeks ago, I was in a little discussion with somebody who disagreed with where we were at, and I mentioned at that time when they were continuously denigrating newcomers to this country,\u201d Walz said. \u201cI mentioned the one thing of my faith that was very central. ... And that was Matthew, Chapter 25, Verse 40; \u2018What you do to the least amongst these brothers and sisters, you do unto me.\u2019\u201d In his new book, Bob Woodward, the legendary Watergate reporter, says Donald Trump is far worse than former president Richard Nixon and \u201cmost reckless and impulsive president in American history.\u201d The Middle East and Ukraine are ablaze, the US mired in turmoil. An octogenarian president recedes from view. The threat of a second Trump term hangs like the sword of Damocles. Fifty years ago, with Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward captured Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon. Now, the US sits at an inflection point once again. Woodward\u2019s fourth book at least in part about Donald Trump is a sober but alarming must-read. War depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin\u2019s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy. True to form, Woodward gets his sources to talk. \u201cAll interviews were conducted under the journalist ground rule of \u2018deep background\u2019,\u201d he notes. Unless the source agreed to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s still a mystery to me how he deals with Putin and what he says to Putin,\u201d Dan Coats, director of national intelligence under Trump, says of his former boss. \u201cIs it blackmail?\u201d There\u2019s something there, Coats is sure. In the fall of 2021, the Biden administration concluded that Russia would soon invade Ukraine. They had the intelligence to prove it. They mounted a full-court press. On the front pages of the Washington Post, they laid out what was coming. They warned and later armed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite his initial skepticism, and they rallied the west. Read Lloyd Green\u2019s full analysis here: North Carolina grapples with holding election in hurricane disaster zone. In a normal life Jon Council would be holding his last campaign fundraiser of the 2024 cycle, exhorting local small business owners in Watauga county to back his bid to become a county commissioner over a plate of spaghetti and garlic bread. But in the wake of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, which left western North Carolina reeling from massive floods that swept away buildings, downed power lines, and left thousands of people stranded in their homes, life is anything but normal in this part of the Appalachians. Instead of wooing donors, the candidate is seeking winter feed for sheep. \u201cWe\u2019re talking hay bales, so we really need a truck,\u201d he pleads down the phone. With just over two weeks to go to election day, Council is wrestling with a problem that is common to anyone running for office in this rugged mountainous stretch of western North Carolina, from local candidates like him all the way up to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. How do you hold an election in a disaster zone? Can you meaningfully talk to people about their electoral choices at a time when they are fighting for daily survival? How do you reach them, let alone engage them, when the internet is down, there is scant cellphone coverage, the roads are broken, power is still out, and mail boxes swept away? \u201cThe voting landscape has totally changed,\u201d Council said. \u201cPolling places have been destroyed, people have been unable to leave their homes, absentee ballots and IDs are lost \u2013 given all that, talking to folk about why they should vote for me just feels wrong.\u201d Council, who is unaffiliated with any political party, was gearing up his campaign for the final stretch when Helene struck on 26 September. The flooding and landslides killed at least 115 people in North Carolina, with almost 100 still missing. Here\u2019s more on the hurricane\u2019s effects on the elections: Later today, Vice President Kamala Harris will attend another \u2018Souls to the Polls\u2019 event at Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro, Georgia, where she will be joined by Stevie Wonder. Meanwhile, Governor Tim Walz is attending services in Saginaw, Michigan, and Minnesota. His wife Gwen Walz is attending services in Las Vegas, Nevada. The visits comes as the Harris-Walz campaign centers on reaching Black voters through churches and religious communities. During an interview with Meet the Press, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he disagrees with General Mark Milley, who allegedly called former president Donald Trump a \u201cfascist\u201d in Bob Woodward\u2019s new book. \u201cTo General Milley, you have a right to your opinion, but I don\u2019t fear Donald Trump,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI fear what\u2019s going on in the world today. If you want the world to stay on fire, vote for her,\u201d he said referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cThey protested an election,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cThey had a right to.\u201d The former president previously said the thousands of people who traveled to Washington DC that day did so because \u201cthey thought the election was a rigged election\u201d. \u201cAnd when I say we, these are people that walked down, this was a tiny percentage of the overall which nobody sees and nobody, nobody shows. But that was a day of love,\u201d he said in a town hall held in Miami recently. Despite a revitalization, Donald Trump wrongfully claimed Charleroi, Pennsylvania, is \u201cvirtually bankrupt\u201d with \u201cmassive crime\u201d. There is one thing about her community that makes Kristin Hopkins-Calcek prouder than anything: her city is now one of the few boroughs in Pennsylvania with a growing population. \u201cWe haven\u2019t invested in our borough for a long time,\u201d says the Charleroi council president, \u201cand now we are finally able to do that \u2013 it\u2019s because we have a need to.\u201d Surrounded by retired power plants, railway lines and steel mills, Charleroi in south-west Pennsylvania was once the epitome of Rust belt America. For decades, factories here and in the surrounding area closed and people moved away, its population falling by about 60%. But in recent years, immigrants have descended on the town of 4,200 people, drawn by well-paying jobs and cheap housing. According to the 2020 census, for the first time in a century, more people chose to make this quiet community on the banks of the Monongahela River their home rather than flee it. The first jobs Rodny Michel could find when he arrived in Charleroi four years ago were line work at a food-preparation company and, later, similarly grueling work at an Amazon factory in a nearby town. Today, as the native of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, sees his community grow in Charleroi, his work day involves turning an empty, dated store on Fallowfield Avenue into a Caribbean restaurant that will serve the town\u2019s growing immigrant community. \u201cSometimes I work for 12 hours a day,\u201d he says from inside the Global Food Mart, a Caribbean grocery store where shoppers play arcade games and sift through boxes of tropical fruit. \u201cIt will be the first for our community and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d But while locals such as Michel and Hopkins-Calcek see Charleroi as being in the midst of a revitalization, others have tried putting the town\u2019s immigrant communities to political use. It is something that has thrust this tiny community into the national spotlight of America\u2019s bitterly fought and divisive 2024 election. Read more on Charleroi\u2019s revitalization: Elon Musk\u2019s extensive influence over US government agencies is both financially beneficial and fraught with conflicts, as his companies rely on federal contracts while also facing numerous investigations, according to a review of documents by the New York Times. If Donald Trump wins the presidency, his promise to give the Tesla CEO a powerful regulatory role could create significant conflicts of interest, allowing Musk to oversee agencies that regulate his own businesses. Yesterday, during a rally in Pennsylvania\u2019s Arnold Palmer Regional Airport, Trump recounted some the stories he shared with the now deceased legendary golfer. In one instance, he praised Palmer\u2019s genitals. \u201cArnold Palmer was all man, and I say that in all due respect to women,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a guy that was all man.\u201d Tapper told Johnson that, if it were President Joe Biden who would\u2019ve made these comments, he would be labeled as cognitively impaired. \u201cYou can cherry-pick a few words or lines that have a two-hour event,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe could do that with Kamala Harris after a 20 minute event because she does word salads and she couldn\u2019t hold court like that without a teleprompter.\u201d \u201cWe all know that the facts the American people see it and, you know, the media can pick it apart, but people are going to vote,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cThey\u2019re going to vote what\u2019s best for their family and they see that in Trump.\u201d Biden\u2019s economic legacy could decide the presidential race in Scranton. From the north, motorists pull into Scranton via the Joseph R Biden Jr Expressway. Cutting through the scenic Pocono Mountains, now at the start of autumn color season, they are greeted with a towering, electric billboard, blaring an encapsulating \u2013 if divisive \u2013 message to this working-class town: \u201cDemocrats for Trump,\u201d it reads. \u201cEconomy,\u201d it continues, with a green checked box next to the word. The sign in Biden\u2019s hometown is the perfect fall 2024 welcome mat in this crucial swing state filled with voters whose economic anxiety or satisfaction will decide next month\u2019s election. The US has staged a remarkable recovery since the pandemic and Biden has successfully pursued an economic agenda, Bidenomics, that should benefit Scranton and the state \u2013 $13bn has been earmarked from his infrastructure bill for repairing highways and bridges alone. But poll after poll shows deep-seated worries about the economy \u2013 worries that could sink Democrats\u2019 chances of keeping the White House come November. Like many mid-sized upper midwest cities that have faced post-industrial decline, Scranton, a longtime Democratic stronghold, has grown more conservative in recent elections. With the city\u2019s native son leaving office, and pocketbook issues top of mind, some believe Trump could finally take Scranton - a more-than-symbolic win. But with Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s successor, and Donald Trump tied in the polls, guessing who will take Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the White House is a fool\u2019s errand. And this politically split town shows why the race is so close. On the street, one person\u2019s economic reality may be entirely different to the next. The complicated political mix of fears about the local economy, faith and mistrust in both Harris and Trump and shifting political allegiance was evident at the Marketplace at Steamtown, a downtown mall filled with local mom-and-pop shops. Read more about what people in Scranton have to say: During an interview in NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d governor Josh Shapiro called into question Elon Musk\u2019s promise to give $1m every day until election day to someone who signs his petition that effectively encourages Republicans in the key battleground states to register to vote. The money would come from his Trump-supporting political action committee, America Pac. \u201cI think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThat is deeply concerning.\u201d \u201cMusk obviously has a right to be able to express his views,\u201d Shapiro told moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cBut when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions that folks may want to take a look at.\u201d Shapiro added: \u201cI think it\u2019s something that law enforcement could take a look at.\u201d Kamala Harris concluded her remarks at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia. She asked the crowd: \u201cWhat kind of country do we want to live in, a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice?\u201d \u201cThe great thing about living in a democracy is that we, the people, have the power to answer that question,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo let us answer not just through our words, but through our action and with our votes.\u201d Kamala Harris, speaking at a service at an Atlanta church, continued talking about acts of kindness recently taking place in the US, especially in the wake of Hurricane Helene. \u201cRight here in the Atlanta area, I saw the story of a reporter who was outside covering the storm live on television when he heard some screams, he dropped everything and waded into chest deep water to rescue a woman trapped in her car, carrying her on his back to safety,\u201d Harris said. The service at the church Kamala Harris is attending is honoring breast cancer survivors during National Breast Cancer Awareness month. Harris spoke about her mother, who was a breast cancer researcher. \u201cShe had two goals in her life, to raise her two daughters, my sister, Maya and me, and to end breast cancer,\u201d Harris said. The Vice President later narrated the parable of the Good Samaritan to connect the story to a message of approaching others with kindness. \u201cAs the Good Samaritan reminds us, it is not enough to preach the values of compassion and respect. We must live them,\u201d Harris said. \u201cFaith is a verb.\u201d Kamala Harris is delivering remarks at a service in New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Georgia. The crowd sang happy birthday when the Vice President, who turns 60 today, took the stage. Harris began her speech by turning the attention towards the ferry dock collapse on Georgia\u2019s Sapelo Island, where at least seven people were killed during a fall celebration by the island\u2019s tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. \u201cOur administration has been in touch with state and local officials to offer any needed support,\u201d Harris said. Good morning, and welcome to our continuing coverage of the run-up to the US election. We\u2019re nearly two weeks away from election day. Today, Vice-President Kamala Harris will kick off her 60th birthday with two church visits in Georgia. The Democratic presidential nominee is slated to to rally early voters in the state a day after a star-studded campaign Saturday in Detroit with rapper Lizzo and in Atlanta with pop icon Usher. Former president Donald Trump is heading to a McDonald\u2019s fast food place in Pennsylvania. The visit will probably be used to undermine Harris\u2019s stint at McDonald\u2019s, which Trump constantly puts into question during his rallies. He will later hold a rally in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, his second event in the battleground state this weekend. Both candidates are laser focused on rallying support from voters in battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris\u2019s running mate, will take part in a \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d event aimed at using gospel performances, national and state faith leaders, elected officials and others to mobilize voters. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Elon Musk promised to award $1m every day to voters as he steps up campaigning for Trump. The commitment, which started on Saturday as Musk handed a lottery-style check to the first winner of his contest at a town hall event, could mean Musk is on the hook for $17m if he remains the sole donor to his own Pac. A Pennsylvania town is thriving with Haitian immigrants \u2013 and is the latest target of Republican hate. Despite a revitalization, Donald Trump wrongfully claimed Charleroi is \u201cvirtually bankrupt\u201d with \u201cmassive crime.\u201d Incarcerated Californians can\u2019t vote. A prison held an election anyway. Voters in a mock election at San Quentin revealed strong feelings about prison labor, wages and the presidential race.",

What a talent he looks. Will he get a drive for 2025? Max Verstappen speaks: \u201cIt was a tough battle, to be on the podium is a good result. I have my opinion but I don\u2019t need to say it here, I\u2019ll let the stewards do their thing.\u201d Charles Leclerc speaks: \u201cVery happy, it hasn\u2019t been an easy weekend until now I have been struggling with the feeling in the car but I had the confidence in the race and the feeling was better.\u201d 1. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) 2. Carlos Sainz (Ferrari) 3. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 4. Lando Norris (McLaren) 5. Oscar Piastri (McLaren) 6. George Russell (Mercedes) 7. Sergio Perez (Red Bull) 8.

Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) The Monegasque and Italian anthems ring out as Leclerc takes the plaudits. Rest of the top ten. 6. Russell 7. Perez 8. Hulkenberg 9. Lawson 10. Colapinto Interesting take. US GP top five 1. Charles Leclerc 2. Carlos Sainz 3 Max Verstappen 4. Lando Norris 5. Oscar Piastri \u201cA hard race,\u201d says Verstappen, Christian Horner offering him credit for getting a podium finish. He\u2019s still complaining about Norris, who is aghast at the five-seconds and then suggests he should have dropped behind and then gone again. 56/56 Russell overtakes Perez and takes sixth; great driving from him. Leclerc is meanwhile flying towards the finish. Norris gets a five-second penalty confirmed. Can he make it up? No, is the answer. Ferrari take a one-two. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy, another win,\u201d is the message sent to Leclerc. 55/56 Leclerc\u2019s progress to winning has been serene. Ocon puts in a fastest lap to steal a vital point from one of the contenders. Red Bull say Norris has gone over his track limits. That will mean he drops down. 54/56 Norris was off the track but Verstappen gave him nowhere to go. The stewards are looking. Five-seconds or ten? Or none? Verstappen is raging. Again. 53/56 One for the stewards, and one for the VAR. Both drivers plead innocence to their teams. And while that continues, they almost come to blows again. 52/56 It briefly seems as if Norris can get past, the crowd roars, but Verstappen always seems to find a way to power away from the bends. Verstappen forces Norris off, but Norris comes back and goes ahead. 51/56 Verstappen is schooling Norris in defensive tactics. Norris is going right at it, to his credit. 50/56 Norris needs to take more risks but his car doesn\u2019t quite have the purchase. As Verstappen seems to falter, so does he. 49/56 Leclerc clears backmarkers to stay away from Sainz. Norris keeps seeing a gap and then finds it closed off. Bottas is a backmarker in the way, but steps aside. 48/56 Franco Colapinto has set the fastest lap in the Williams. Good to have someone like him around. Norris and Verstappen continue in their duel. Verstappen maintains the racing line. 47/56 Norris keeps going, knocking on the door. What a race, what driving from Verstappen. Norris pecking away, but not getting it done on this lap. 46/56 Norris getting closer. Can DRS be engaged? Verstappen throwing everything at it. The gap is down to mere metres. 45/56 This is racing now. Norris tries to edge closer. Verstappen is forced to be defensive. Russell goes up to seventh, and now gives chase to Perez. 44/56 Here comes the battle between Norris and Verstappen. He tries to claw back some of the 54-point lead the champion has. 43/56 The McLaren garage look on intently as their man Norris chases down Verstappen. Russell sets a fastest lap, and looks on course to score points from the pit lane. 42/56 Tsunoda spun, but not off, he\u2019s down in 14th. Way up ahead, Norris is chasing down Verstappen, just 1.4 seconds between them. 41/56 Russell pits and takes on that five-second penalty, and he comes out eighth. Franco Colapinto and Magnussen go off on a battle, but the Argentine holds him off. This is a fine battle. 40/56 Charles Leclerc sets a new fastest lap just when it seemed Sainz might fancy giving chase. Franco Colapinto is the last to pit, on lap 40. He comes out ahead of Magnussen in 12th. 39/56 After that shoddy start, Norris has chance to make amends by passing Verstappen. Magnussen, back to 13th, was demanded to pit. Liam Lawson is in 10th. He\u2019s full of racing. 38/56 Norris has the fastest lap, and is under three seconds short of Verstappen. He can see his target. 37/56 Liam Lawson pits, and is geared up to battle for a top ten place. He\u2019s ahead of Yuki Tsunoda, his teammate. He\u2019s in 12th. 36/56 Verstappen: \u201cThese tyres are no good. I can\u2019t brake, I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d He\u2019s raging. The calm of pre-race is forgotten. 35/56 Franco Colapinto is keeping Perez at bay. It\u2019s not gone well for Perez, this season. Norris\u2019s speed is coming to the fore. He\u2019s flying along, so much quicker than Verstappen. With much of the race to go. 20 laps, in fact. 34/56 There\u2019s 11 seconds between the top three now. Leclerc and Sainz in command here. Their pace is too much for the Red Bull today. Verstappen will have to wait longer for that first win since June. 33/56 Oscar Piastri\u2019s pit is slow. But the plan is to be quick at the end of the race when the fuel load is far lower. 32/56 \u201cTime to pit,\u201d says Zach from McLaren. Norris goes in, and Leclerc takes the lead. Piastri will stay out until the next pit, presumably. Norris is in fifth, Russell sixth (but with a five second penalty) and the flying Kiwi, Lawson is in seventh. 31/56 Until those McLarens pit, the race will not take fullest shape. Piastri is being chased by Leclerc, who isn\u2019t prepared to wait for his opponent to pit. He passes with ease, and takes second. Norris\u2019s pit is imminent. 30/56 Norris is told his team don\u2019t want to pull the trigger too early. \u201cA Germany situation,\u201d apparently. Some odd code words being used. 29/56 \u201cMore phase 1 brake release,\u201d Ferrari tells a dumbfounded Sainz. 28/56 Norris and Piastri are making hay on their tyres, lapping as quick as Verstappen. But when to pit? 27/56 Leclerc goes into the pits and on the hard tyres, and will come out behind the McLarens and ahead of Sainz. They are yet to pit. Is this a one-stop strategy? It looks like it from Ferrari. 26/56 Lando Norris was catching up Verstappen, who pits, and then Sainz goes ahead of him into fourth. The undercut leaves Leclerc leading with McLaren, yet to pit, ahead of Sainz. Norris is motoring nicely. 25/56 \u201cMy tyres are really bad now,\u201d says Verstappen. Ferrari are in a position to pull a fast on him. 24/56 Sainz, on those hard tyres, sets off on the fastest lap so far. 23/56 Franco Colapinto, the youngster, overtakes Fernando Alonso, the veteran. McLaren are trying to work out their pace on the tyres in chasing down Verstappen. Leclerc says \u201cI don\u2019t want to be under pressure\u201d in regards to Ferrari\u2019s strategy. 22/56 Sainz goes in, putting hard tyres on his Ferrari. He comes out in fifth, ahead of Perez. The McLarens are ahead in his road to chasing down Verstappen. 21/56 Most of the action is down the field, so serene has been Leclerc\u2019s progress since that start. 20/56 Is a pit undercut in the offing? Sainz might be attempting it with Verstappen who is sluggish on his current tyres, and with that mystery problem. 19/56 The battle is on for eighth, Tsunoda and Hulkenberg before Tsunado pits. Leclerc is getting even more clear \u2013 eight seconds. 18/56 Leclerc is seven seconds clear of Verstappen; the Ferraris have Max in a sandwich. 17/56 Liam Lawson is chasing down Hulkenberg for 10th place, and the hapless Perez for ninth. Toto Wolff\u2019s verdict on that Russell penalty is \u201ctotal joke\u201d. 16/56 George Russell gets a penalty for passing Bottas \u2013 five seconds. No luck for the Mercs this weekend. \u201cWhat?!\u201d is the reply from George. 15/56 Hugh Molloy gets in touch: \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Lando, just let him hit you. Verstappen has more to lose, he\u2019s going to try and shove you off guaranteed, simply stand your ground! Totally bottled it.\u201d Yes, far too hesitant. 14/56 George Russell, in a hard tyre, is making up places, into 13th. Verstappen is told there is a problem with his car; it will be sorted when he goes in to pit. 13/56 This heat must be hard on the tyres. Lots of talk over what the strategy might be. Lando Norris says that his tyres are fine but his car\u2019s pace is not good enough. 12/56 Leclerc continues to hold that fastest lap. Liam Lawson passes Alonso and into 11th, the replacement for Daniel Ricciardo. He\u2019s touted for Red Bull next season. 11/56 George Russell is up to 15th, having started in that pit lane. Sainz tells his team things are better. He longer smells fuel. Phew. His Ferrari is way ahead of Norris, 2.5 seconds. 10/56 Leclerc leads, Verstappen second, Sainz losing pace, with the McLarens behind. Zhou Guanyu is the latest to spin. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened there,\u201d he tells his team. 9/56 \u201cNo power on the exit of the corners,\u201d says Sainz. He smells fuel in the car. He\u2019s dropping off, and Norris can close. That\u2019s bad news for Ferrari. 8/56 Is this a one-stop race? Seems a few are protecting their tyres. 7/56 Norris is struggling to keep up with the leading three. Piastri, his teammate is also sluggish. Problems for McLaren? 6/56 The Merc now removed from the track, the safety car pulls aside. Leclerc and Verstappen go at it, right from the gun. No DRS on this lap. Liam Lawson, who started 19th, is in 12th. Nice driving, young man. Leclerc edging ahead of the Red Bull. He sets a fastest lap. 5/56 First safety car since Canada, and the field is closed up. Albon has pitted after his prang. Lando and his McLaren team want a stewards\u2019 on the start. Good luck. That won\u2019t be happening. \u201cSame as Budapest,\u201d says Norris. Verstappen did seem to go off the track and hold his position 4/56 An eventful start, and Norris will be rueing his lack of aggression at the start. In the pack. Ocon and Albon clashed. That hill start produced carnage. The Hamilton crash looks like he lost it. \u201cSorry, guys,\u201d he says. No rear grip, it seems. 3/56 That bright start comes to end. He\u2019s deep in the gravel track, and here\u2019s the safety car. The crowd applaud Hamilton, who is in no mood for applause. 2/56 Huge whoops from the crowd. Leclerc has the afterburners on, he\u2019s a full second ahead of Verstappen. Sainz is after Verstappen too. Ferrari in control here 1/56 Verstappen points right but Norris gets ahead, and then when it looks like Verstappen might pass Norris, Leclerc speeds through and leads from fourth. What a mess from Norris, what a piece of opportunism from Leclerc. Hamilton goes from 17th to 12th. Sainz, in third, chases Verstappen, who cuts across him. One for the stewards? OK, here we go. The formation lap begins. \u201cDamn, this far back,\u201d says Lewis Hamilton, back in 17th. Mercedes have had a shocker in qualifying with George Russell in the pit lane. Lando Norris on pole leads out the field. The two Ferraris of Sainz and Leclerc are second on the grid. Max Verstappen: \u201cYesterday was an indication it\u2019s been a bit better already. The sprint should replicate to the main race. Winning would make life a lot easier. That\u2019s always been the aim.\u201d AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck is playing too loud for the telecasters. Great record. Martin Brundle is on his pit walk. A quick chat with Fernando Alonso. \u201cWe start seventh but are not the seventh fastest,\u201d says the veteran. Pierre Gasly: \u201cThe team did a very good job. The car seems to have come alive.\u201d Kevin Magnussen, in the top 10 in the Haas: \u201cSeems the car is liking this track. It\u2019s great to be this competitive. Every race in F1 is a gift.\u201d The hill at the race start has seen the wind dropping. Martin talks to Gabby Douglas, the Olympic gold medallist. She\u2019s a Lewis Hamilton fan and hopes to meet him later. Mondo Duplantis is also there. \u201cI like adrenaline\u2026just having a good time.\u201d Gordon Ramsay is there, seeming a little amped. No swearwords, though. And here comes the national anthem. The stadium announcer sounds robotic, like a talking elevator. The Stars and the Stripes rings out choral style. None of your vocal histrionics here though some natty descant work. It reminds of a 1960s Disney film. In the crowd, there are visible cowboy hats. The weather report from Austin, Texas, and the Circuit of the Americas is that it\u2019s hot and sunny, 27 degrees C. Bright blues skies. What effect might that have on tyres? Bad news for Mercedes: George Russell starts from the pit lane. Revised starting grid: 1. Lando Norris 2. Max Verstappen 3. Carlos Sainz 4. Charles Leclerc 5. Oscar Piastri 6. Pierre Gasly 7. Fernando Alonso 8. Kevin Magnussen 9. Sergio Perez 10. Yuki Tsunoda 11. Nico Hulkenberg 12. Esteban Ocon 13. Lance Stroll 14. Alex Albon 15. Franco Colapinto 16. Valtteri Bottas 17. Lewis Hamilton 18. Zhou Guanyu 19. Liam Lawson* Pit lane. George Russell** Report on that Saturday sprint race, too. And in the garages, too. Before any running began on Friday the FIA confirmed it was looking into complaints that Red Bull may have been gaining an advantage by using a device that allowed them to adjust the bib, also known as the tea tray \u2013 the front of the floor of the car \u2013 after qualifying to achieve a better race setup, when regulations forbid changes to the car under conditions. It\u2019s been getting tetchy in the mind games stakes. Giles Richards all over the detail in previewing the final six races of the F1 season. As things stand Norris and McLaren have the quickest car on the grid in the MCL38. More importantly, and key to Norris\u2019s hopes, is what a stable platform it provides across a variety of circuits and how swiftly the team are able to dial it into local conditions such that it is up to pace early in the weekend. The starting grid positions: 1. Lando Norris 2. Max Verstappen 3. Carlos Sainz 4. Charles Leclerc 5. Oscar Piastri 6. George Russell 7. Pierre Gasly 8. Fernando Alonso 9. Kevin Magnussen 10. Sergio Perez 11. Yuki Tsunoda 12. Nico Hulkenberg 13. Esteban Ocon 14. Lance Stroll 15. Alex Albon 16. Franco Colapinto 17. Valtteri Bottas 18. Lewis Hamilton 19. Zhou Guanyu 20. Liam Lawson* (back of grid) To Austin, Texas, and we have a ten-gallon hat of a race for you. Lando Norris in pole, Max Verstappen alongside him, with signs of a Red Bull revival. Verstappen winning the sprint race edged him to 339 points, with Norris on 285 in the drivers\u2019 standings. That could be vital with the McLaren still expected to be the quicker car.

      "bodyText": "At least 87 people have been killed or are missing and 40 injured after intense Israeli airstrikes overnight in the north of the Gaza Strip, part of the country\u2019s ferocious renewed assault on the area, medics in the besieged Palestinian territory have said. In the past 24 hours 108 people had been killed in bombings across the territory, according to local health officials on Sunday. \u201cThe nightmare in Gaza is intensifying. Horrifying scenes are unfolding in the northern strip amidst relentless Israeli strikes and an ever-worsening humanitarian crisis,\u201d Tor Wennesland, the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said in a statement. \u201cNowhere is safe in Gaza \u2026 We owe it to the families suffering in Gaza and Israel. The war must stop now,\u201d he added. Bombings late on Saturday night in the town of Beit Lahiya flattened several houses and an apartment block, killing members of several families, according to Raheem Kheder, a medic. Among the dead were two parents and their four children, and a woman, her son and daughter-in-law and their four children, he said. The internet and phone services have been down in parts of Gaza since Saturday evening, complicating the rescue operation. In a post on X, Mounir al-Bursh, the director general of the health ministry, said the flood of injured people from the strikes compounded \u201can already catastrophic situation for the healthcare system\u201d in northern Gaza. There was no immediate comment on the strikes in Beit Lahiya from the Israeli military, which said it was \u201ccontinuing to operate across Gaza in both aerial strikes and ground operations\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have nominally held complete control of northern Gaza since January, but launched a new assault on the area two weeks ago that they said was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from regrouping. Gaza\u2019s civil defence service said it had recovered at least 500 bodies since the operation began on 6 October. Sweeping evacuation orders for the estimated 400,000 people still living in the northern third of the territory, the blockage of aid and food deliveries and the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as hospitals have led rights groups to accuse Israel of the war crime of seeking to forcibly displace the remaining population. Israel has denied it is systematically removing Palestinians from the area. Several struggling hospitals have been unable to evacuate patients, and two people at the Indonesia hospital in Beit Lahiya died from a lack of oxygen after electricity and fuel shortages, the health ministry in the territory said. The tightening of the siege on northern Gaza comes as Israel\u2019s new war with Hezbollah in Lebanon deepens. Israel said its air force attacked Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence headquarters in Beirut on Sunday, as well as an underground workshop for the production of weapons, and killed three commanders. Hezbollah made no immediate comment. Lebanon\u2019s army, which has remained on the sidelines during the new war between Hezbollah and Israel, said three of its soldiers were killed by an Israeli strike while travelling in an army vehicle in the south of the country. According to the IDF, Hezbollah fired 170 rockets into Israel on Sunday, with a resulting fire causing three minor casualties. Most of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems. On Sunday night hundreds of Beirut residents fled their homes after Israel said it was preparing attacks on sites linked to al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-run banking system that provides loans and services primarily to people who live in areas where the militia group is popular. Soon after the Israeli warning, several blasts were heard and a large fire was seen in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (Unifil) said on Sunday evening that an Israeli army bulldozer had deliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence at its position in Marwahin in southern Lebanon. Unifil said in a statement: \u201cYet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.\u201d Meanwhile, world powers are awaiting Israel\u2019s retaliation against Iranian strikes on the Jewish state on 1 October that were launched in support of Tehran\u2019s Lebanese ally. Late on Friday, it emerged that top-secret US documents that allegedly reveal details about Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran had been leaked and published online. Washington has not denied that the files, which appear to be the US\u2019s assessment of Israel\u2019s preparations, are authentic. The papers supposedly date from 15 and 16 October, and allege that Israel has fortified underground warplane bunkers at the Hatzerim airbase, where there are signs of preparation for arming plane-launched ballistic missiles. An Israeli source told the Israeli daily Haaretz that the US had apologised to Israel for the leak. In an interview with CNN, the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, said on Sunday that an investigation into the incident had been launched. Netanyahu has called a national security council meeting for Sunday evening in which it is expected that a response to Iran will be discussed. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Tuesday to discuss Israel\u2019s multifront war and a renewed international push for a ceasefire after the killing of the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Rafah last week. Israel and Hamas, however, have so far stuck to their irreconcilable demands. Internationally mediated talks aimed at a lasting truce in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the 7 October attack that sparked the war broke down in August.",

      "bodyText": "Arne Slot said Liverpool had made the perfect start to a defining period in their season with victory against Chelsea but that judgment on his team\u2019s potential must be reserved. Liverpool reclaimed top spot in the Premier League with an absorbing defeat of Enzo Maresca\u2019s side that extended Slot\u2019s outstanding start to 10 wins in 11 matches. Mohamed Salah opened the scoring against his former club before the man of the match Curtis Jones restored Liverpool\u2019s lead moments after Nicolas Jackson\u2019s equaliser for Chelsea. Slot was delighted with his team\u2019s tenacity, less so the performance of the referee, John Brooks, but believes Liverpool\u2019s ability to sustain a title challenge will become clear only after they have come through a demanding set of Champions League and Premier League fixtures. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the result,\u201d said the head coach. \u201cIn an ideal world we would have completely outplayed them but that was definitely not the case.

Colwill morphing into a morpho caused him to trip Curtis Jones for a penalty seconds after getting away with another indiscretion, which was still infiltrating his thoughts when he caught the Liverpool midfielder. The tone had been set in the space of a few minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/20/liverpool-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Curtis Jones strikes to sink Chelsea and reclaim top spot for Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Salah wheeled away in celebration, Diogo Jota sat on the floor and his game was cut short after he failed to overcome a problem caused by Tosin Adarabioyo falling on him. Arne Slot could have brought on Luis D\u00edaz and rejigged the forward line but with access to one of the great architects of chaos, there was only one thing in the Liverpool head coach\u2019s mind and he called for Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez. The Uruguayan repaid the crowd immediately with a mid\u2011air flick for his first touch as he levitated in the Merseyside wind.</p> <p>Chelsea had gone from looking composed to confused, with a defence eager to play themselves into trouble. Liverpool, without the level of possession to which they are accustomed, were playing more often on the break, regularly releasing Salah down the right against an increasingly confused Malo Gusto. It was a case of thinking smarter to find new methods of creation.</p> <p>Maybe Brooks was left questioning himself after not penalising Colwill for his challenge on Salah, making him more eager to&nbsp;give the penalty. The referee then awarded a second spot\u2011kick, this time adjudging Robert S\u00e1nchez to be the culprit in a robust tackle with Jones. Anfield was euphoric but they became part of the pantomime when Brooks was forced to jog down to the other end of the pitch and peer at the screen. After agreeing he had been too hasty, he wandered off to draw a box in the air and rescinded the goalkeeper\u2019s booking.</p> <p>Even the Chelsea equaliser was a glorious moment of confusion and contradiction. Everyone, except Nicolas Jackson, thought Jackson was offside when he latched on to a through ball and slid it beyond Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher. Darren Cann had got a very close offside call correct in the first half to rule out a Cody Gakpo tap-in. Few would ever doubt the decision-making of&nbsp;Cann, who won the BBC quiz show Pointless (and there are few higher accolades), but even he could not fathom how far back Ibrahima Konat\u00e9\u2019s leg was and raised his flag before it was whispered in his ear that he had not won the jackpot. The away fans\u2019 silence turned to euphoria.</p> <p>Amid all the humdrum, Liverpool can rely on the calmness of one man: Salah was at his best, thrashing home the penalty and taking his time to pick&nbsp;out Jones with a glorious cross from the right. Others might&nbsp;not have spotted the movement but the Egyptian has the quality and requisite execution to ensure he had a goal and an assist in a Premier League match for a 34th time.</p>    <p>Chelsea were not helped by Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella being suspended, forcing Maresca to create a new unit that was more Thin Blue Line than Line of Duty when it came to detection. Jones was the benefactor of disorganisation in the Chelsea backline. Reece James, playing his first match of the season, forgot how the offside rule worked to leave the midfielder free to wander into space in front of S\u00e1nchez five minutes after Chelsea levelled.</p> <p>Chelsea possess a lot of talent but struggled with the occasion and the high tempo of the match in critical situations. A moment of Cole Palmer magic was lacking&nbsp;and although Madueke looked dangerous with his promising dribbling, and repeatedly caused Andy Robertson cause for concern, the final product fell short.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/oct/20/liverpool-v-chelsea-premier-league-live-score-updates\">Liverpool 2-1 Chelsea: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The half-hour spell between Colwill v Salah and Liverpool\u2019s winner was highly entertaining, as was the entire match, but eventually Liverpool found the calm. Jones, Ryan Gravenberch and Salah were the three that soothed, not using the frenetic nature as an excuse and bringing composure to a match lacking a final ball or finish. This was supposed to be Liverpool\u2019s biggest test of the Slot era and the trio helped them come out the other side at the summit.</p> <p>It was a blockbuster afternoon at Anfield, everyone playing their part from those who executed perfectly in the critical moments, to mistakes at the back, to the officials\u2019 indifferent decision\u2011making. Maybe it would not have been such a high-octane affair had Colwill made a different decision in his early battle with Salah but it was a catalyst for change by galvanising the hosts.</p> <p>Liverpool have proved they can breeze through matches with calmness and control but here they were part of a wrestling match and landed on their feet after being thrown around in the wind.</p>",

Colwill morphing into a morpho caused him to trip Curtis Jones for a penalty seconds after getting away with another indiscretion, which was still infiltrating his thoughts when he caught the Liverpool midfielder. The tone had been set in the space of a few minutes. After Salah wheeled away in celebration, Diogo Jota sat on the floor and his game was cut short after he failed to overcome a problem caused by Tosin Adarabioyo falling on him. Arne Slot could have brought on Luis D\u00edaz and rejigged the forward line but with access to one of the great architects of chaos, there was only one thing in the Liverpool head coach\u2019s mind and he called for Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez. The Uruguayan repaid the crowd immediately with a mid\u2011air flick for his first touch as he levitated in the Merseyside wind. Chelsea had gone from looking composed to confused, with a defence eager to play themselves into trouble. Liverpool, without the level of possession to which they are accustomed, were playing more often on the break, regularly releasing Salah down the right against an increasingly confused Malo Gusto. It was a case of thinking smarter to find new methods of creation. Maybe Brooks was left questioning himself after not penalising Colwill for his challenge on Salah, making him more eager to give the penalty. The referee then awarded a second spot\u2011kick, this time adjudging Robert S\u00e1nchez to be the culprit in a robust tackle with Jones. Anfield was euphoric but they became part of the pantomime when Brooks was forced to jog down to the other end of the pitch and peer at the screen. After agreeing he had been too hasty, he wandered off to draw a box in the air and rescinded the goalkeeper\u2019s booking. Even the Chelsea equaliser was a glorious moment of confusion and contradiction. Everyone, except Nicolas Jackson, thought Jackson was offside when he latched on to a through ball and slid it beyond Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher. Darren Cann had got a very close offside call correct in the first half to rule out a Cody Gakpo tap-in. Few would ever doubt the decision-making of Cann, who won the BBC quiz show Pointless (and there are few higher accolades), but even he could not fathom how far back Ibrahima Konat\u00e9\u2019s leg was and raised his flag before it was whispered in his ear that he had not won the jackpot. The away fans\u2019 silence turned to euphoria. Amid all the humdrum, Liverpool can rely on the calmness of one man: Salah was at his best, thrashing home the penalty and taking his time to pick out Jones with a glorious cross from the right. Others might not have spotted the movement but the Egyptian has the quality and requisite execution to ensure he had a goal and an assist in a Premier League match for a 34th time. Chelsea were not helped by Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella being suspended, forcing Maresca to create a new unit that was more Thin Blue Line than Line of Duty when it came to detection. Jones was the benefactor of disorganisation in the Chelsea backline. Reece James, playing his first match of the season, forgot how the offside rule worked to leave the midfielder free to wander into space in front of S\u00e1nchez five minutes after Chelsea levelled. Chelsea possess a lot of talent but struggled with the occasion and the high tempo of the match in critical situations. A moment of Cole Palmer magic was lacking and although Madueke looked dangerous with his promising dribbling, and repeatedly caused Andy Robertson cause for concern, the final product fell short. The half-hour spell between Colwill v Salah and Liverpool\u2019s winner was highly entertaining, as was the entire match, but eventually Liverpool found the calm. Jones, Ryan Gravenberch and Salah were the three that soothed, not using the frenetic nature as an excuse and bringing composure to a match lacking a final ball or finish. This was supposed to be Liverpool\u2019s biggest test of the Slot era and the trio helped them come out the other side at the summit. It was a blockbuster afternoon at Anfield, everyone playing their part from those who executed perfectly in the critical moments, to mistakes at the back, to the officials\u2019 indifferent decision\u2011making. Maybe it would not have been such a high-octane affair had Colwill made a different decision in his early battle with Salah but it was a catalyst for change by galvanising the hosts. Liverpool have proved they can breeze through matches with calmness and control but here they were part of a wrestling match and landed on their feet after being thrown around in the wind.",

The phrase \u201cwhat this show\u2019s all about\u201d has become a tired talent show trope but Merse the Magic Man really was. A month ago, he was a sequin-sceptic football pundit who seemed baffled by what he\u2019d signed up for.</p> <p>As he said, \u201cI\u2019ve only danced three times in my life - and they were all at my weddings\u201d. However, he formed a hilarious team with pro partner <strong>Karen Hauer </strong>and showed signs of falling in love with hoofing.</p> <p>His journey\u2122 began with that prop-laden American Smooth to Vindaloo, during which he headed a ball so hard, it rebounded back onto the dancefloor and almost tripped him up. He flipped burgers on a sparkly barbecue for his suburban dad salsa and saddled up for a Magnificent Seven cha cha cha in Movie Week.</p> <p>His highlight came last week when a debonair quickstep surprised nobody more than Paul himself. The samba is always a tricky proposition for celebrity males, not to mention 56-year-olds. Last night\u2019s disco effort duly proved the dance of death but it was the right result. As the lowest scorer left in the contest, he deserved to depart.</p> <p>This was a whole new ball game for the ex-England international. He described Strictly as \u201chard work but worth it, like sucking on a really thick milkshake\u201d. He didn\u2019t know the difference between a samba and a salsa. Despite sharing a dressing room with <strong>Wynne Evans</strong>, he insisted on calling him \u201cGwynne\u201d. Every week, he\u2019d be told what he was dancing and shrug \u201cI\u2019ll Google it.\u201d</p> <p>His hangdog wit consistently made <strong>Claudia Winkleman</strong> cackle. As Paul told her two weeks ago: \u201cIt\u2019s not community service. I don\u2019t have to do this, I want to do it.\u201d Each week was a relegation battle but he did Karen proud to last this long.</p> <p>He goes home having danced nine more times - five weeks plus two dance-offs, a group number and a last dance - and with several million new fans. Well played, Paul.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-10-20T19:07:40.708Z\">at 8.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-671553d08f08156d15776da5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-20T19:03:39.550Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JB Gill suffers curse of going first</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The appearance of <strong>JB Gill</strong> in the dance-off was a shocker to rival Shayne Ward\u2019s last week. He finished fifth from bottom on the judges\u2019 scoreboard, 11 points off the bottom. He\u2019s scored a solid 30 for the past two weeks and has the sixth highest average in the contest. However, JB failed to win enough viewer votes and tumbled down into the bottom two.</p> <p>Was it partly because he performed first on Saturday\u2019s show, meaning his routine got forgotten when voting opened? It\u2019s the third time in four weeks that \u201cthe slot of death\u201d has led directly to the dance-off, with<strong> Tom Dean</strong> and<strong> Shayne Ward</strong> suffering the same fate.</p> <p>Up against <strong>Paul Merson</strong>, JB was never destined to follow his JLS bandmate <strong>Aston Merrygold</strong> by suffering an unjustly early exit, despite making too many mistakes in his jive second time around.

Lots of push and pull with partner Jowita Przystal. There are showmance rumours between the pair, so the sensual mood is present and correct. Plenty of focus and intensity, not much continuous hip motion and he\u2019s throwing the arm movements away when he should extend.

Even Craig saw some progression but now he\u2019s saddled with the samba, often tricky for male celebrities. The former footballer says it\u2019s his \u201chardest dance by a million miles\u201d but he\u2019s throwing himself into it with gusto. Funky disco feel but the concentration is showing on his face. Unleashing his hips. Changes of rhythm. He\u2019s worked so hard on this, you can tell. Some swagger and twinkle toes. A spot where he lost timing and Karen danced around him. Lacks bounce and fluidity but a decent effort. Less Rio carnival, more Romford high street.</p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> Car Wash by Rose Royce.

Now she tackles the tango. A mystical tarot card theme and a stylish, spinning opening section. Sharp footwork, rotations and changes of direction. Snapping head-turns and biting staccato. Her frame wobbles a tad and footwork hurried but this is leggy, intense and terrific.</p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> Dog Days Are Over by Florence + The Machine.

As a Liverpool FC fan, he\u2019s paying tribute to his roots and hoping to please his home town - or at least, half of it. \u201cI may be forfeiting votes from the blue half of Merseyside and the whole of Manchester,\u201d he admits. His footwork and musicality have wowed all series but it\u2019s his upper body which has let him down. Can he fix his slouchy posture and nail the ballroom frame? Rise and fall, changes of direction. The technicalities of the waltz are showing up his faults a tiny bit but this is romantic and affecting. An emotive story of togetherness and hope, beautifully sung by Tommy Blaize - a Liverpool fan himself. Solo section where he walks alone towards the end. Clever and all-round lovely.</p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers. This showtune from Carousel became a Liverpool FC anthem after it was recorded by the Merseybeat band in 1963 and topped the charts for four weeks.

She said in the VT that it was more of a Glaswegian waltz but I think it was halfway to Austria. </p> <p><strong>Song:</strong> She\u2019s Always A Woman To Me by Billy Joel. He wrote the folky, love-lorn ballad for his then-wife, Elizabeth Weber, in 1976. The couple divorced six years later.

Once again, <strong>Paul Merson</strong> looks vulnerable but he showed considerable imprpvement last week. <strong>Dr Puman Krishan</strong> and <strong>Sam Quek</strong> could also find themselves in danger.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for watching along with me, sequin-spangled squadron, and making this one of the warmest, most welcoming corners of the internet every weekend. Our 11 pairings now progress to the sixth live show, the annual feast of frightening fancy dress which is the Halloween spooktacular. It airs next Saturday at 6.25pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to rate the twinkle-toed tricks and technical treats. Hey, maybe Wynne\u2019s hand will come as Thing from The Addams Family. In the meantime, it\u2019s your usual mantra: keeeeep dancing! Have a lovely week and be careful of that weather out there. Goodnight. Finally, Lester48 says: \u201cIf/when Paul goes tonight, that\u2019s the weakest dancer gone. Now we\u2019re in the realms of shocks about who goes from next week.\u201d girlpanic adds: \u201cChanges I don\u2019t like in this year\u2019s Strictly so far: Not starting the judging with Head Judge Shirley Ballas Not thanking Dave Arch and his wunnerful orchestra Crashing into the results show with a boring update from Tess. Why has the group dance been moved? There will probably be more.\u201d Toesturnedin says: \u201cSad for Paul. He had really improved. Please, please can Karen get a youngster next year!!!\u201d OverLunder2 says of Sophie Ellis-Bextor\u2019s performance: \u201cAh Sophie, now we know why Brendan is there. He was so gallant when there was a push to make her performance more sexy. I paraphrase but it was something along the lines of \u2018Perhaps she doesn\u2019t want to be more sexy.\u2019 Now that\u2019s a sexy man. Cheers, Brendan.\u201d On the group number choreographed by Oti Mabuse, Climbingrose says: \u201cWow! Best group dance this series. We miss you, Oti!\u201d On JB Gill being in the bottom two, Strictlylounging says: \u201cOoh curse of going first for JB and Amy? Tricky middle table but I did like their routine.\u201d shazza2704 adds: \u201cSo pleased for JB and Amy. I know it\u2019s all about the celebrity but if anyone has been on a \u2018journey\u2019 it\u2019s our Amy. She is an inspiration.\u201d Time for a rapidfire round-up of your comments. On the dance-off, Lidoswimmer says: \u201cThe right decision but seemed JB badly affected by the collywobbles there. Hopefully can get back in his stride next week. Well done to Paul, gave it his best and is a decent bloke who I\u2019m sure has helped a lot of other men in recent years..\u201d acanthe says: \u201cWell, obviously if they save JB it\u2019ll be the right decision but I\u2019ll be genuinely sad to see Paul go because he seems to really enjoy himself up there with Karen &amp; it\u2019s lovely to see.\u201d EastofStratford says: \u201cI think the mistake in Paul\u2019s dance was having those air filled things wobbling in the background. When the props are the better dancers you know you are in trouble..\u201d TheMathDiva adds: \u201cI think Paul has come the furthest since the competition started and has proved he\u2019s not the joke turn. Sad to see him go but out of the two it was the right choice.\u201d Tonight\u2019s TV tips, you say? Well, you can now stay tuned to BBC1 for Antiques Roadshow, flip to Channel 4 for The Dog House or it\u2019s Joan Bakewell Night over on BBC4. At 9pm, crime drama DI Ray returns to ITV1, Showtrial is on BBC1, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing is on BBC2 or fraudster doc Love Cheats is on Channel 4. If you fancy a film, The Thomas Crown Affair (original, not remake) is just starting on Sky Arts. At 9pm, choose between Bohemian Rhapsody on Film4, If Beale Street Could Talk on BBC3 or Mission: Impossible - Fallout on E4. Run, tiny Tom Cruise, run! Venezuelan-born firecracker and Latin specialist Karen Hauer might be Strictly\u2019s longest-serving pro but she\u2019s stuck in a disappointing run. Karen hasn\u2019t reached the Halloween special since 2020, when she miraculously made it to the final with Jamie Laing. Since then, she\u2019s finished 12th for four series in a row - with Greg Wise, Jayde Adams, Eddie Kadi and now Paul Merson. Karen won\u2019t mind this statistical quirk too much, because she clearly had a ball with Paul, but surely she\u2019s earned a more promising partner in 2025? Arguably the most fortunate celebrity once again is waltzing medic Dr Punam Krishan. She was second bottom of last night\u2019s scoreboard and has been in the bottom three every week but one. Yet somehow she\u2019s managed to dodge the dance-off so far. Barring dramatic improvement, the dancing doc\u2019s luck will surely run out soon. Pete Wicks and Sam Quek will also be breathing sighs of relief tonight. So will Shayne Ward, who surely feared another red light of doom, and Wynne Evans after his difficult week of unwelcome headlines. All of them will relish the chance to throw themselves into a character next week. Bring on the face-paint and fright-wigs. Strictly 2024 will be a less entertaining place without have-a-go hero Paul Merson. The phrase \u201cwhat this show\u2019s all about\u201d has become a tired talent show trope but Merse the Magic Man really was. A month ago, he was a sequin-sceptic football pundit who seemed baffled by what he\u2019d signed up for. As he said, \u201cI\u2019ve only danced three times in my life - and they were all at my weddings\u201d. However, he formed a hilarious team with pro partner Karen Hauer and showed signs of falling in love with hoofing. His journey\u2122 began with that prop-laden American Smooth to Vindaloo, during which he headed a ball so hard, it rebounded back onto the dancefloor and almost tripped him up. He flipped burgers on a sparkly barbecue for his suburban dad salsa and saddled up for a Magnificent Seven cha cha cha in Movie Week. His highlight came last week when a debonair quickstep surprised nobody more than Paul himself. The samba is always a tricky proposition for celebrity males, not to mention 56-year-olds. Last night\u2019s disco effort duly proved the dance of death but it was the right result. As the lowest scorer left in the contest, he deserved to depart. This was a whole new ball game for the ex-England international. He described Strictly as \u201chard work but worth it, like sucking on a really thick milkshake\u201d. He didn\u2019t know the difference between a samba and a salsa. Despite sharing a dressing room with Wynne Evans, he insisted on calling him \u201cGwynne\u201d. Every week, he\u2019d be told what he was dancing and shrug \u201cI\u2019ll Google it.\u201d His hangdog wit consistently made Claudia Winkleman cackle. As Paul told her two weeks ago: \u201cIt\u2019s not community service. I don\u2019t have to do this, I want to do it.\u201d Each week was a relegation battle but he did Karen proud to last this long. He goes home having danced nine more times - five weeks plus two dance-offs, a group number and a last dance - and with several million new fans. Well played, Paul. The appearance of JB Gill in the dance-off was a shocker to rival Shayne Ward\u2019s last week. He finished fifth from bottom on the judges\u2019 scoreboard, 11 points off the bottom. He\u2019s scored a solid 30 for the past two weeks and has the sixth highest average in the contest. However, JB failed to win enough viewer votes and tumbled down into the bottom two. Was it partly because he performed first on Saturday\u2019s show, meaning his routine got forgotten when voting opened? It\u2019s the third time in four weeks that \u201cthe slot of death\u201d has led directly to the dance-off, with Tom Dean and Shayne Ward suffering the same fate. Up against Paul Merson, JB was never destined to follow his JLS bandmate Aston Merrygold by suffering an unjustly early exit, despite making too many mistakes in his jive second time around. However, he got a pre-Halloween fright and our couples will be even more wary of opening the show from now on. As the departing couple take a final trip around the floor to How Am I Supposed To Live Without You? by Michael Bolton, the credits roll and castmates crowd around to commiserate. Please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. His pro partner Karen Hauer returns the compliment: \u201cYou\u2019ve been a joy. I\u2019ve never giggled this much. My abs are really tight now. I\u2019m so proud of you. Every week you have shown up, you have improved. You\u2019re what Strictly is about. I want to thank you for bringing such joy and showing everyone what\u2019s possible with a little bit of work and lots of giggles.\u201d Clearly fond of each other, which is lovely to see. In his farewell speech, Paul Merson tells Tess: \u201cIt\u2019s been really good. Anybody I talk to, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got to go on this show. Everybody is great. There\u2019s a Tottenham fan over there called Lincoln and even he\u2019s nice! It\u2019s been amazing, honestly. I loved every minute and I\u2019ve had a great teacher. Karen\u2019s been absolutely amazing and I couldn\u2019t wish for a better coach. I\u2019ve won because I can dance now. I couldn\u2019t dance before and I can half-dance now. It\u2019s an absolute bonus.\u201d Well said, sir. As expected, it\u2019s unanimous. Head judge Twirly Shirley also would\u2019ve voted to save JB and Amy but not by much, it seems. The majority vote means that Paul Merson and his pro partner Karen Hauer become this year\u2019s fourth couple to get the choreographic red card JB and Amy, saying \u201cthey made mistakes and it shouldn\u2019t have been this close \u2013 but Paul wasn\u2019t clean either\u201d. JB and Amy, saying \u201cthey were clean and readable, whereas Paul\u2019s timing was off\u201d. JB and Amy. Paul briefly pretends it was him, bless him. Craig scored JB four points more last night and Motsi three points more. Did Paul do anywhere near enough to close the gap or is this a foregone conclusion? Let\u2019s consult the four people whose opinion counts. Paul Merson and his pro partner Karen Hauer have another go at their samba to Car Wash by Rose Royce. The judges said last night that it lacked bounce but was content-packed and showed attempts at basic technique. They appreciated Paul\u2019s hard work and liked the fact that he was smiling by the end. It scored 19 points, 11 fewer than JB, so he\u2019ll need to show considerable improvement and pray for a miracle. Sadly, he\u2019s being upstaged by those rainbow brushes and waving pink windsocks behind him. JB Gill and his dance partner Amy Dowden reprise their jive to Hey Ya! by Outkast. The judges said last night that it was well-timed and clean but a little stompy, with JB advised to use his knees and toes more. It scored 30 points, a whopping 11 more than Paul\u2019s samba, so JB surely just needs to avoid any major mistakes. Small whoopsie towards the end, I think, but nothing disastrous, darling. Musical interlude now from Sophie Ellis-Bextor, performing her new single Freedom Of The Night - her first major label single in 14 years, surprisingly. The two Ns, Neil Jones and Nadiya Bychkova do the hoofing honours. Sophie was a Strictly finalist back in 2013, partnered by Brendan Cole. Excellent in ballroom, as I recall, with a memorable Charleston too. Tasha Ghouri talks abut getting messages and videos from viewers with cochlear implants, who\u2019ve also been jazzing theirs up with extra sparkle. The power of representation. More balcony bantz with the euphoric couples. As well as the first Argentine of the series (love it), Sarah Hadland gives us an update on her mum Beaky, who\u2019s been mobbed in the Cheadle branch of John Lewis. Understandable. No surprise, we suppose. Paul Merson and Karen Hauer must samba again for survival. Their second time in the dance-off, having seen off Toyah Willcox a fortnight ago. Can he claim another scalp? So are Sarah Hadland, Dr Punam Krishan and Sam Quek. Now to find out who will face JB and Amy in the dance-off. Clench those buttocks and don\u2019t forget to say thank you down the camera, couples. They\u2019re on about fregolina again. It\u2019s a dance step, not a shape of pasta. The judges come in like a wrecking ball and join Claudia for a closer look at last night\u2019s routines. Ginger Neil has his trousers hoisted to Simon Cowell height. Maybe it\u2019s to make X Factor winner Shayne Ward feel at home. Now a group dance from the Strictly professionals. Choreographed by homecoming pro Oti Mabuse, it\u2019s a fiery paso doble, set in a cantina by a highway in the arid US south. Nancy Xu and Dianne Buswell take the lead as warring queens in a celebration of feminine power. Slow, moody, intense opening before gathering momentum. Soundtracked by 70s disco hit Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood by Santa Esmeralda, it features red fan-ography, fiery scarves and the boys sliding on their knees. Lots of lifts, kicking, stretching and Spanish shaping. Ol\u00e9, Oti! And the first of doubtless many spooky-themed VTs now. Any theme is never knowingly under-flogged. Chris McCausland has a cheeky fondle of Jojo Radebe\u2019s bare chest and declares that \u201cLatin is nonsense\u201d. Awkward because he\u2019s dancing a Stayin\u2019 Alive samba next week Up in the Clauditorium with the happy couples who are through to Halloween fright night, Pete Wicks reveals that he\u2019ll playing the Batman villain for Halloween. Shayne Ward is so relieved to get 40th birthday present of being saved, he and Nancy Xu do an impromptu spots of Oleta Adams karaoke. Two yeses from me. A shocker to rival last week\u2019s. JB Gill and Amy Dowden are consigned to the dance-off for the first time. Gasps of shock in the ballroom and on sofas. Also safely through to next Saturday are Shayne Ward (no double dance-off), Pete Wicks and Wynne Evans. Hold tight. The spotlight of doom is about to do its worst. Shayne Ward and Pete Wicks still seem to be dressed as one another. A glitch in the Matrix. Our couples await their fates in the ballroom. At least half of them must be girding their loins for a potential dance-off, especially the three Ps (Paul, Pete and Punam). A rewind of Saturday night\u2019s action on-screen now. Team MoJo\u2019s Afro-Caribbean celebration! Jamie Borthwick\u2019s terrific traditional paso! Chris McCausland\u2019s emotional Liverpudlian waltz! A slight dip from early pace-setter Tasha Ghouri! A too-early paddle-raise from Shirley! Brendan Cole and Ian Beale in the studio audience! But sadly not together! Shame. Here\u2019s our presenting pair, so time for our traditional sartorial smackdown. Tess Daly is in a white sparkly tuxedo suit. Claudia Winkleman is in a red frock. Claud wins, making it another clean sweep for La Winkle this weekend. Roll clap-along credits. Which of these smiling couples will soon be weeping into their sparkly hankies? Wave a welly-clad farewell to Countryfile and pour yourself a warming libation. We\u2019re about to head back to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Tonight\u2019s musical guest is another Strictly alumna: kitchen disco queen Sophie Ellis-Bextor. She\u2019s performing her new single rather than \u201cthat\u201d viral hit from Saltburn. So fear not, you don\u2019t have to to throw shapes to it naked or do unsavoury things with bathwater. Phew, frankly. A mere five minutes until the glittery curtain comes up\u2026 Tonight\u2019s pro routine is a spectacular group paso doble, choreographed by much-loved Strictly alumna Oti Mabuse - sister of judge Motsi, of course, and a two-time glitterball winner with Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey. We miss you, Oti. Come back again soon. Only 10 minutes to wait now\u2026 All this talk of Storm Ashley put me in mind of Strictly\u2019s own two Ashleys: Ashley Roberts from the Pussycat Dolls, who finished runner-up with Pasha Kovalev in 2018, and Hollyoaks actor Ashley Taylor Dawson, who reached the quarter-final with Ola Jordan in 2013. Both of them - wait for it - danced up a storm. Ahem. Sorry. On BBC1 right now is an autumn harvest-themed episode of rural stalwart Countryfile. But where is dapper meteorologist Tomasz Schafernaker when we need him? And why hasn\u2019t he been signed up for Strictly? Sort it out, BBC bigwigs. Fifteen minutes until the red spotlight of doom gets switched on\u2026 Lots of talk on social media last night about comedian Chris McCausland\u2019s post-waltz question to his partner Dianne Buswell, which was picked up by mics and audible over the rapturous applause. \u201cDid I do OK?\u201d he asked sweetly, to which Di replied: \u201cYou did really good, yeah. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d It seemed to leave lots of viewers with lumps in their throats. A heart-melting moment. It might well be a nervy wait for Shayne Ward. He made a shock appearance in last week\u2019s dance-off and is once again in the middle of the leaderboard (always a treacherous place to be), having improved his score by just one point. Dodging the dance-off - that\u2019s his goal. It\u2019s 20 minutes until glitter o\u2019clock\u2026 Maximum scores were awarded to two routines last night: Jamie Borthwick\u2019s paso doble and Montell Douglas\u2019 Afro-Caribbean Couple\u2019s Choice, both of which earned three 10s for a near-perfect 39 points. They tied with Tasha Ghouri\u2019s Charleston as the highest score of the series. As is traditional, Craig Revel Horwood is keeping his 10 paddle in storage - possibly until Blackpool or beyond. It\u2019s 25 minutes until we\u2019re back in the ballroom\u2026 Coming into this weekend, bookmakers\u2019 strong favourite for elimination was former footballer Paul Merson. He duly finished bottom of the judge\u2019s scoreboard with 19 points - his fourth score in the teens. Will voting viewers (not to mention Arsenal fans) ride to his rescue? Half an hour until we get our first clues\u2026 One couple won\u2019t get to raid the BBC\u2019s fancy dress box. Good evening and welcome to the fourth elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your Sunday night cyber-dance partner for tonight\u2019s results show. Please watch along with me as the fourth celebrity is sent home, falling agonisingly short of next weekend\u2019s Halloween spooktacular. Following last night\u2019s high-scoring live show, our dancefloor dozen will soon become 11. The judges\u2019 scores have been combined with the public vote. Tonight the bottom two duos will dance off for survival. So who\u2019s in danger? Paul Merson was left propping up the scoreboard, with Dr Punam Krishan second from bottom. But will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Pete Wicks, Sam Quek or the cluster of mid-table celebrities could be under threat. It\u2019s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and cheek from the cheap seats. So close the curtains on Storm Ashley, snuggle up and see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d also love to hear from you. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for choreographic chit-chat I\u2019ll matador knee-walk down there occasionally to gauge your reaction and report on your comments. Pumpkin-spiced heartbreak beckons for one couple. Nearly time to staaaaaart spooky eliminating! That concludes Saturday\u2019s livebloggery-pokery but we\u2019ll be back on the digital dancefloor tomorrow. Meet you back here for the results show, which airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1. I\u2019ll crank up the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so I hope you\u2019ll rejoin me then. Thanks for watching along with me and all your ace comments, which I score at least a nine and in many cases, a perfect 10. Meet you here for the fourth elimination tomorrow. In the meantime, it almost goes without saying: keeeeeep dancing! Goodnight. Commenter opinion seems to be split on Wynne Evans, with just as much support as slating. JWT1967 says: \u201cSome great dances tonight, most notably Jamie and Montell. It wasn\u2019t Wynne\u2019s best but I still voted for him and shall continue to do so, as there\u2019s no way he deserves to suffer death by social media.\u201d An unpredictable set of scores tonight. Montell Douglas and Jamie Borthwick jointly top the standings, with Chris McCausland in third place. Paul Merson is way down at the bottom, with Dr Punam Krishan and Pete Wicks just above. As always, though, the viewer vote helps decide who\u2019ll be consigned to tomorrow night\u2019s dreaded dance-off. It could be a sweaty-palmed wait for Sam Quek and Shayne Ward, too. Finally, on Montell Douglas and Jojo Radebe\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice, SnailyWhaley says: \u201cJust occasionally, Couple\u2019s Choice is spectacular.\u201d VictoriasSecret says: \u201cWhat a way to finish! I have mixed views about Couple\u2019s Choice but that I loved. Just wished it lasted longer!\u201d loubylou99 says: \u201cLove MoJo! Not normally fan of CC but this was the best I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d On dance-of survivor Shayne Ward, GreatIsMyNewt says: \u201cI think Shayne\u2019s \u2018problem\u2019 is that he\u2019s normal. Many of the other slebs have big personalities.\u201d mcculloch29 says: \u201cLovely storytelling from Shayne and Nancy.\u201d jagadox adds: \u201cIt was a complete surprise to find Shayne in the dance-off last week. Surely that lovely romantic American Smoochie, sorry Smooth, will save him this week?\u201d On Pete Wicks\u2019 rumba, paperview says: \u201cTo be fair, ever since Len schooled Craig about scoring in professional ballroom dancing during the very first series, Craig has always been a stickler for illegal steps.\u201d ReclinedPotato adds: \u201cPete reminds me of background pirate #6. Not as wooden as long John Silver\u2019s leg but rough as a ship\u2019s biscuit.\u201d On Sarah Hadland\u2019s samba, MikeMoonlight says: \u201cIt\u2019s really quite amazing that, at the start of the series, Toyah could barely dance at all, then she was actually voted off two weeks ago and yet she comes back with a performance like that! Oh, hang on a minute...\u201d Paul Merson continues to be a commenter favourite. Owbeck says: \u201cPaul improves every week, just not at the same rate as others.\u201d styletraveller says: \u201cWhen Merse is given some moves, he\u2019s ok. I think Karen needs to trust him more.\u201d EmmyHarb says: \u201cI love that Paul Merson started the series with quite a meh attitude but now Strictly is working its magic on him.\u201d emas2023 adds: \u201cI shall be voting for Paul tonight as I really want him on Halloween week.\u201d On Tasha Ghrouri\u2019s tango, FascinatingFlamenco says: \u201cToo dark for Tasha and Aljaz\u2019s dance. Was difficult to see properly. Loved the energy and intent. Some really great head placement.\u201d Somersetlass adds: \u201cHmm. A technically great dance from Tasha, but not enough drive and passion for a tango, I thought.\u201d On Sam\u2019s Quekstep, Vicc says: \u201cOh I did love that quickstep, whether or not the judges like it. I think Sam\u2019s joie de vivre shines through and that is what swung it for me.\u201d MarkRoche adds: \u201cKeep waiting for the lovely Sam to have that breakthrough. She\u2019s competent but seems to be holding back a bit.\u201d On Chris McCausland\u2019s You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone waltz, Somersetlass says: \u201cWhile that wasn\u2019t Chris\u2019 best dance - he seemed a little tentative at first, and his posture wasn\u2019t great - that bit at the end where he walked alone and then joined Dianne left me in tears. Rather beautiful.\u201d fihema says: \u201cI kinda wish Chris could see Di in that frock. It felt like the third dancer and made it somehow all the more emotional. Sparkly shadows, serenity, flow. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever enjoyed that song more. No wait. I have never enjoyed that song more.\u201d Jennifera030 says: \u201cI thought that was beautiful. Reminds me of a passage from Terry Pratchett about how tragic it is that so many people never get the chance to find out what they could be good at. Amazing that a blind man has found out that he is a natural dancer.\u201d YodaknowsAll adds: \u201cChris just made me well up. The judges can go on all they like about technique, but you cannot beat feelings. Outstanding for me.\u201d On Jamie Borthwick\u2019s paso doble, Pancake01 says: \u201cOh wow! One of the better pasos of recent years. Well done Jamie! Unusual choreography as well. Loved the music.\u201d dAsgoyne says: \u201cCastanets? Generalised Spanishery? What happened? Did they not get the memo that they should have been dancing to Shang-a-lang dressed as an ocelot?\u201d ryfford adds: \u201cFFS, no one gets a 10 for a Paso. NO ONE!!!\u201d On JB Gill\u2019s jive, mimig says: \u201cLovely Welsh Amy and JB starting to be one of my favourite couples. I wonder if he might have the \u2018journey\u2019 we all love?\u201d Aine183 adds: \u201cJB\u2019s jive seemed very technical to me. I didn\u2018t see any joy in the dance, too much caution.\u201d Your verdicts are in from the comment section. On Dr Punam Krishan, jagadox says: \u201cPunam tends to be hard on herself. Making a mistake as a doctor could have much worse results than the Strictly ones, eh?\u201d Spittal76 adds: \u201cI thought it was harsh marking for Dr Punam. I suspect the public will like it more than the judges.\u201d Viewers can now flip to ITV1 for The Voice UK semi-final or to BBC2 for Florence + the Machine at the Proms. And possibly attempt a tango. If hands-up-the-back-end-of-cows is more your scene, it\u2019s All Creatures Great &amp; Small Night on BBC4. At 9pm, Irish crime drama Blackshore starts on U&amp;Drama. At 9.50pm, Later with Jools Holland returns to BBC2 with music from Laura Marling, Jade Thirlwall, Blossoms and Queen drummer Roger Taylor. If you\u2019re in a filmic frame of mind, choose at 9pm between Spy on ITV2 or Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary on 5Star. There\u2019s also a horror double bill for pre-Halloween spooks: Smile (9.20pm on BBC2) and The Blair Witch Project (11.50pm on BBC1). Boo! Sorry. They\u2019re the awards everyone is talking about. At least in my house. Here are this week\u2019s recipients of our coveted liveblog gongs\u2026 Best dance: Montell Douglas and Jamie Borthwick were both a point away from perfection but Chris McCausland\u2019s waltz was also wonderful. Worst dance: Dr Punam for me. Paul Merson scored two points fewer but was heaps more fun. Best music choice: Loved the traditional Latin numbers but You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone takes the trophy. Worst music choice: Oasis? For a rumba? With my reputation? Best outfit: A dead heat between Tasha Ghouri and Dianne Buswell\u2019s frocks. Shout-out to that quick mid-routine change by Montell and Jojo. Worst outfit: Jamie Borthwick\u2019s cosplay matador, compelte with eye-wateringly tight trousers. Best judges\u2019 comment: Craig\u2019s tetchy teasing of Anton, including \u201cStop standing up, it\u2019s getting on my nerves\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re 40? Try telling your surgeon\u201d. Worst VT: Dr Punam and Sam Quek, who both played the cute kid card early. Best Claudia quip: Her adoration of Pete Wicks saying he felt damp like an otter: \u201cThat was my all-time favourite comment to Tess.\u201d \u201cKeeeeeep dancing,\u201d Tess and Claudia tell us. Claud has been waiting the entire week, apparently. As the scoring paddles are packed away in their velvet-lined cases, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. Tonight\u2019s routines get the recap treatment on-screen. Which dream duo are you voting for? Which ploddy pairing are you definitely not? The usual mayhem erupts. Make sure you vote for your favourites if you don\u2019t want any nasty dance-off surprises. Judges\u2019 scores for Montell and Jojo: 9 (you tease!), 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Joint highest score of the series and joint top with Jamie. Judges\u2019 comments for Montell and Jojo: Craig says \u201cMontell excelled\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou exploded with energy, everyone feels seen, loved it\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyour nanna sprinkled her magic dust from heaven, exceptional\u201d. Anton concludes \u201ca celebration, do it again in the final\u201d. Nines and 10s imminent? Last week, Shirley said they were \u201ccreeping up there, you\u2019re becoming dangerous for the rest\u201d. Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe duly notched their first nine. Can they score more with this groundbreaking number? It\u2019s an Afro-Caribbean fusion between both their backgrounds. Homely opening in robes and gradually expands, with Montell changing into a colourful feathered carnival dress. Jamaican flag and South African flags tucked in their waistbands. Sass, smiles and a real sense of freedom. Lifts and tricks. Confetti falls. Bringing it home and leaving their hearts on the dancefloor. Song: Skeleton Move by KG feat Zanda Zakuza. A 2018 hit from the South African DJ and producer, real name Kgaogelo Moagi, with vocals from house diva Zanda Zakuza. Judges\u2019 scores for Wynne and Katya: 7, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 33 points. Fourth as it stands. Hands, what hands? Judges\u2019 comments for Wynne and Katya: Shirley says \u201cloved it, joyous, you moved beautifully, fantastic\u201d. Anton says \u201cgreat energy and showmanship but right arm too far back\u201d. Craig says \u201cdishevelled in places\u201d, then cheekily changes his tune when Wynne says he\u2019s reviewing Craig\u2019s album next week. Motsi concludes \u201cfun, rhythmical, exquisite timing, well done\u201d. Eights and nines? Opera singer Wynne Evans got two nines for his tango last week and reached the dizzy heights of joint second on the leaderboard but it was throughly overshadowed by \u201cthe hand incident\u201d, aka \u201cGrope Compare\u201d. Now he\u2019s sticking with ballroom. A frothy routine with a fun concept to help shake off the lingering aroma of scandal. Decent frame and plenty of character with farcical comedy flourishes. Slightly lacks the stamina to maintain the style throughout, gets heavy-footed and fluffs a jump. Song: Mr Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra. This Beatles-esque 1977 classic featured in both the opening and closing ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympics. It also very nearly became the theme tune to The US Office. Judges\u2019 scores for Shayne and Nancy: 7, 8, 8 (too early from Shirley), 8 for a total of 31 points. Top half. Judges\u2019 comments for Shayne and Nancy: Anton says \u201clovely to see another 40-year-old, spectacular lifts and fabulous partnering, lots to like but keep the focus when you\u2019re apart\u201d. Craig says \u201cwonderful flow and sentiment\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou\u2019re clearer and more subtle in ballroom than Latin, good direction, keep going\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cgreat footwork, beautiful flow, a remarkable comeback, you\u2019re a great student and dancer but search for your authentic self\u201d. Eights, do we reckon? The shock dance-off survivors bid to bounce back. Shayne Ward turned 40 this week, so could get a cake in the Clauditorium after this, just in case he needed extra motivation. It\u2019s foxtrot style. Emotional song, romantic connection and smooth technique. This is all all about the flow and he\u2019s pulling that off with aplomb. Maybe lacking wow factor and Hollywood glamour but divine mood and beautiful lifts, albeit with some lumpy transitions. Song: Get Here by Sam Smith. A cover of Oleta Adams\u2019 1990 hit which was co-produced by Roland Orzabal from Tears For Fears - returning the favour after Adams provided guest vocals on their hit Woman In Chains. Judges\u2019 scores for Sarah and Vito: 8, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 32 points. Top half. Judges\u2019 comments for Sarah and Vito: Motsi says \u201cyou gave 110 per cent, soften your arms but you are a force\u201d. Shirley says \u201cdifficult choreography and you didn\u2019t miss a beat, concentrate on foot positions but a charm to watch\u201d. Anton says \u201ca bit stiff but for personality and performance, your best dance\u201d. Craig concludes \u201carms flung without a destination in mind but a party I want to be at, the campest thing, loved it\u201d. Eights? Maybe a nine from Tony Beak? Her foxtrot flopped last week and Sarah Hadland\u2019s scores dipped, falling out of the 30s for the first time. Can she party her way back up the leaderboard? The fast, bouncy samba should suit her high energy levels but she needs to control it, maintain timing and finish the moves. Riviera theme. A kitsch and camp song. Signature bending-back move and challenging steps. She looks like Toyah but its twice as good. Colourful, carnival feeling. Great legs and spins. Heaps of fun. Fab-ew-lous. Ciao, ciao! Song: Do It Do It Again by Rafaella Carr\u00e0. This mid-70s Eurodisco hit reached the top 10 in the UK. The late Italian diva was once pursued by Frank Sinatra but repeatedly rejected his advances. Attagirl. Judges\u2019 scores for Pete and Jowita: 4, 5, 6, 7 (surge scoring!) for a total of 22 points. Judges\u2019 comments for Pete and Jowita: Pete says he\u2019s \u201cwet like an otter\u201d and cannily flirts with Shirley. She says \u201clove the lifts and attentiveness to your partner, not a lot of body action, I was mesmerised by one hip isolation but needed more\u201d. Anton does another demo time and says \u201creally good effort at a difficult dance\u201d. Craig says \u201cillegal lifts, a little bit unco (uncoordinated) but you\u2019re committed and I can see you\u2019ve been studying\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cyou sold the story but your bottom half was a problem\u201d. The judges start bickering. Unseemly, darlings. Anton said last week that if Pete Wicks can keep improving and raise his performance levels, he could become a contender. If last week\u2019s quickstep was all about fast feet, now it\u2019s all about slow hips. The Oasis anthem is an interesting choice, shall we say, for a rumba. Lots of push and pull with partner Jowita Przystal. There are showmance rumours between the pair, so the sensual mood is present and correct. Plenty of focus and intensity, not much continuous hip motion and he\u2019s throwing the arm movements away when he should extend. It\u2019s just lacking rhythm, which Pete admits he struggles with. Song: Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger by Oasis. The 1996 Britpop hit was the first Oasis single with lead vocals by Noel Gallagher, rather than his brother Liam. Noel described it as a cross between John Lennon and All The Young Dudes. Of the \u201cso Sally can wait\u201d refrain, he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t actually know anybody called Sally. I thought I might as well throw a girl\u2019s name in there and it fitted.\u201d Judges\u2019 scores for Sam and Nikita: 6, 7, 6, 7 for a total of 26 points. Better than the comments suggested. Sam is disappointed but refuses to make excuses. Was there a wardrobe malfunction? Shirley thought her shoe might have got caught up in her skirt. Judges\u2019 comments for Sam and Nikita: Anton says \u201cso close but went wrong and got tense in the shoulders, you\u2019ve got a great performance in you but that wasn\u2019t it\u201d. Craig says \u201cyou were fighting each other and mistakes threw you, gapping and posture problems but movement and personality were great\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou move easily, it was glamorous but timing was off and nerves got to you\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cone of those nights but it happens to the best, you got caught up, two bodies should move as one in ballroom but you\u2019re one of our strongest females\u201d. Fives incoming? Sam is upset with herself, bless her. No need. She\u2019s ace. Last week she put the Sam into samba. Now can she put the Quek into quickstep? It was hockey star Sam Quek\u2019s 36th birthday yesterday, so she\u2019s hoping to celebrate with a hit routine. It\u2019s her first ballroom since week one, which seems strange. Her sporty background should help with the quickstep\u2019s speed and stamina. Cutesy opening and dreamy atmosphere but wobbly frame and gapping galore. Better out of hold than in it. Song: Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield. This mid-Noughties number wasn\u2019t quite as big a UK hit as her previous single These Words but it went stratospheric in the States, becoming the second most-played song on US radio in 2006. The following year, Bedingfield performed it at the Concert For Diana benefit gig. Judges\u2019 scores for Paul and Karen: 3 (boo!), 5, 5, 6 for a total of 19 points. His second highest score but bottom of the leaderboard at the midway mark. Former Strictly pro Brendan Cole is in the studio audience, like the ghost of glitterballs past. Judges\u2019 comments for Paul and Karen: Tess does an \u201cI love your little face\u201d. Motsi says \u201clots of basic content, a funny little bit and transitions missing but loved that you were smiling by the end, joyous\u201d. Shirley says \u201centhusiasm and you did very well\u201d. Anton does his second demo time of the night and says \u201clove it\u201d. Craig concludes \u201clacked bounce, timing, musicality and turn-out but appreciate the attempts at technique\u201d. Paul Merson put the gimmicks aside (no footballs, barbecues or horseplay) and surprised everyone last week with a debonair Fred Astaire quickstep, climbing out of the bottom two for the first time. Even Craig saw some progression but now he\u2019s saddled with the samba, often tricky for male celebrities. The former footballer says it\u2019s his \u201chardest dance by a million miles\u201d but he\u2019s throwing himself into it with gusto. Funky disco feel but the concentration is showing on his face. Unleashing his hips. Changes of rhythm. He\u2019s worked so hard on this, you can tell. Some swagger and twinkle toes. A spot where he lost timing and Karen danced around him. Lacks bounce and fluidity but a decent effort. Less Rio carnival, more Romford high street. Song: Car Wash by Rose Royce. The first draft of the 1976 disco hit was jotted down by Motown songwriter Norman Whitfield on a paper bag from a fried chicken shop. Finger-lickingly funky. Judges\u2019 scores for Tasha and Alja\u017e: 8, 9, 8, 9 for a total of 34 points. Five down on last week. Judges\u2019 comments for Tasha and Alja\u017e: Craig says \u201clacked aggression and intent but you danced it magnificently\u201d. Motsi says \u201cstill up there, strong start, got loose in places but great work\u201d. Shirley says \u201cclear timing but got loosey-goosey and wobbly in the final third\u201d. Anton concludes \u201clegs disconnected, it rattled around but youre at van incredible level\u201d. Eights and nines? Tasha Ghouri scored the first 10s of the series last week with her Coachella-themed Charleston, complete with pesky selfie stick. Now she tackles the tango. A mystical tarot card theme and a stylish, spinning opening section. Sharp footwork, rotations and changes of direction. Snapping head-turns and biting staccato. Her frame wobbles a tad and footwork hurried but this is leggy, intense and terrific. Song: Dog Days Are Over by Florence + The Machine. It was inspired by a text installation by artist Ugo Rondinone which Florence Welch used to see every day while riding her bike over Waterloo Bridge. The drum sounds on the 2008 track were created by banging on the recording studio walls. Judges\u2019 scores for Chris and Dianne: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. His highest. Second place as it stands. Judges\u2019 comments for Chris and Dianne: A tearful Shirley says \u201cextremely emotional, your footwork was spectacular, attempted to keep frame and it\u2019s improved since your foxtrot\u201d. Anton says \u201cneeds more work on top but heavenly down below, flow and timing exquisite, I had a moment where I welled up\u201d. Craig says \u201cleft elbow too low, lacked swing and sway but enormous amount of gaw-jus rise and fall, covered so much floor, brilliant\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cit transcended technique, I felt every emotion\u201d. Eights ahoy? Chris gives a lovely shout-out to Tommy\u2019s vocals. What a gent. After two fast, full-on dances in a row, comedian Chris McCausland is relieved to be changing gear for a slower paced waltz. As a Liverpool FC fan, he\u2019s paying tribute to his roots and hoping to please his home town - or at least, half of it. \u201cI may be forfeiting votes from the blue half of Merseyside and the whole of Manchester,\u201d he admits. His footwork and musicality have wowed all series but it\u2019s his upper body which has let him down. Can he fix his slouchy posture and nail the ballroom frame? Rise and fall, changes of direction. The technicalities of the waltz are showing up his faults a tiny bit but this is romantic and affecting. An emotive story of togetherness and hope, beautifully sung by Tommy Blaize - a Liverpool fan himself. Solo section where he walks alone towards the end. Clever and all-round lovely. Song: You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers. This showtune from Carousel became a Liverpool FC anthem after it was recorded by the Merseybeat band in 1963 and topped the charts for four weeks. Legendary Reds manager Bill Shankly picked it as one of his Desert Island Discs and played it on his record player every day after he retired. Judges\u2019 scores for Jamie and Michelle: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Joint highest score of the series. Paso-bleeding-tastic indeed. Judges\u2019 comments for Jamie and Michelle: Craig says \u201cpaso bleeding tastic, darling\u201d. Motsi says \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Shirley says \u201coutstanding choreography, basics and oval shapes, set the tone, remarkable\u201d. Anton concludes \u201ceight fregolina steps, the perfect number, you will never dance better\u201d. Nines? A 10 or two? Ian Beale is in the house. Actor Adam Woodyatt really should sign up for Strictly. Shouldn\u2019t he be manning the Beale\u2019s Plaice chip shop, though? \u201cYou ain\u2019t my dance partner.\u201d \u201cYes I am!\u201d His scores have been creeping up and Jamie Borthwick finished joint second on last week\u2019s leaderboard. Can he continue that progression with a paso? Pleasingly traditional, with proper music, a black-and-white matador suit and Michelle Tsiakkas swishing her polka dot skirt. He\u2019s strong, powerful and focused, looking imperious with his chin up. Using his acting skills to nail the attitude and showmanship. Dramatic, fiery, sultry and sizzling, with knee-walks, Spanish line and curved arms. Gathers pace nicely. Lacking a little fluidity at times but really rather good. Ol\u00e9! Song: Malague\u00f1a by Ernesto Lecuona. This classic flamenco tune by the Cuban composer is a regular choice for Strictly pasos. It was the choice for Stacey Dooley and Kevin From Grimsby, plus Anita Rani and Glen Savchenko (swoon). Judges\u2019 scores for Punam and Gorka: 4, 6, 5, 6 for a total of 21 points. One more than last week. Dance-off danger, I fear. Judges\u2019 comments for Punam and Gorka: Motsi says \u201cloved the wedding vibe, it was romantic and vulnerable, got on top of the mistakes but push it more and make it dynamic\u201d. Shirley says \u201cdelightful, you\u2019re a doll but turn your volume up\u201d. Anton says \u201clovely but you keep it to yourself, share it with us, too hesitant, crakc it out and commit\u201d. Craig concludes \u201clike a social stroll in the park, lacked musicality and energy in the body, but there was truthfulness in the acting\u201d. Sixes en route? Dr Punam Krishan finished bottom of last week\u2019s leaderboard after her jive was littered with mistakes. Can she do better in ballroom hold? The Viennese waltz is dreamy to watch but difficult to execute. She\u2019s in a delicate yellow one-shouldered dress. Standing still too much and takes too long to get into hold but respectable when she does. Soft knees and dizzying spins. She said in the VT that it was more of a Glaswegian waltz but I think it was halfway to Austria. Song: She\u2019s Always A Woman To Me by Billy Joel. He wrote the folky, love-lorn ballad for his then-wife, Elizabeth Weber, in 1976. The couple divorced six years later. It\u2019s a favourite for Vienneses on Strictly - Dan Walker and Debbie McGee both waltzed to it in previous years. The ubiquitous BBC presenter makes this week\u2019s Clauditorium cameo, reading out the voting smallprint. He \u201cloves this place and wants to come back\u201d. Your starter for 10: as a 2025 contestant maybe? Judges\u2019 scores for JB and Amy: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Solid. Best scoring jive of the series. Judges\u2019 comments for JB and Amy: Anton says \u201cclean but stompy and heavy of foot\u201d. Craig says \u201ctiming excellent, sharp kicks and flicks, great job\u201d. Motsi says \u201cuse your knees and toes but plenty of good things going for it\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cticked lots of boxes but use your feet more\u201d. Sevens, do we say? An eight or two? He conquered the rumba last week. Now JB Gill out of JLS goes to the opposite end of the speedometer with a high-speed, high-impact jive. There have been only three jives so far this series, scoring an average of 22 points. He should boost that figure. It\u2019s upbeat and bouncy with JB flicking, kicking and up on the balls of his feet. Lacking a little attack but great timing and he sustains the energy impressively. Shake it like a Polaroid picture. Song: Hey Ya! by Outkast. This 2003 electro-funk banger was the first song to reach 1m downloads on iTunes, stat fans. What\u2019s cooler than being cool? Ice cold! Vito Coppola has forgotten to button up his shirt again. He\u2019ll catch his death. First sighting of our dancefloor dozen as they emerge onto the fabled Strictly staircase. Fairly restrained outfits this week. Saving the fancy dress for Halloween, wisely. Here come our paddle-raising panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas, frugging to a spot of C&amp;C Music Factory. Motsi looking fab-ew-lous. Our presentational double act arrive, so time to rate their finery. Tess Daly is in a red asymmetric high-necked dress. Claudia Winkleman is in black velvet. Claud wins. High fives! Hair tossing! Paul Merson bumping Karen Hauer out of shot with his backside! Rude. Cue ye olde melodramatic montage. Yes, it means a lot. No, you don\u2019t want this journey to end. Just guessing. Buckle up, buttercups. We\u2019re about to be beamed live to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Alan Carr\u2019s Picture Slam drawing to a conclusion on BBC1 now. He popped up on the Clauditorium last week, reading the voting Ts &amp; Cs, waving a red feathery fan and admitting \u201cUniversity Challenge it ain\u2019t\u201d. He wasn\u2019t kidding, was he? Dave Arch and his band will be treating us to some bangers tonight, with tunes from ELO, Rose Royce, Outkast, and Florence + The Machine, plus some traditional Latin numbers. There\u2019s also a rare airing for Natasha \u201clittle sister of Daniel\u201d Bedingfield and an emotional rendition of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. Most frighteningly of all, Pete Wicks will dance a rumba to Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger by Oasis. Will it be subject to dynamic scoring? Ten minutes until the choreographic clock strikes\u2026 For the second week running, Have I Got News For You featured a Strictly gag last night. This time, guest host Professor Hannah Fry (love her, please sign her up next year) quipped: \u201cWith just a few weeks to the US election, Donald Trump has turned to dance to get his message across - presumably thanks to his new campaign manager, Giovanni from Strictly.\u201d Thank you, thank you, thank you. Montell Douglas and Johannes Radebe will dance a Couple\u2019s Choice tonight, fusing their African and Caribbean cultures.We\u2019ll also be able to compare and contrast two sambas and a pair of quicksteps. It\u2019s 15 minutes until sequins, spraytans and Spanx are deployed\u2026 Tick them off when they happen! Take a drink for each! Get the giggles and hiccups! Here\u2019s this week\u2019s 10-point spotter\u2019s guide: Shirley tells a celebrity \u201cI\u2019m going to call you Mr/Miss Something\u201d, then never calls them that again Craig says there was no connection between the couple but the other three judges disagree Celebrity uses ye olde \u201cbusy week in the day job impacting our training time\u201d excuse Judges openly laugh at Paul Merson\u2019s samba hip action Claudia asks after Sarah Hadland\u2019s cat Percy and is shown a pic of him in fancy dress Motsi cries after Montell and Jojo\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice Someone says the quickstep \u201cis quick with lots of steps\u201d Rictus grins from Wynne and Katya on the balcony, knowing cameras will be trained on them Anton Du Beke harks back to past \u201csaaarm-bas\u201d he danced himself Claudia looks to camera while Vito Coppola embarks on a rambling description of a dance step The running time of tonight\u2019s live show is under two hours for the first time this series. It\u2019s all downhill to Christmas from here. Despite his dapper Fred Astaire quickstep showing a marked improvement last Saturday, Paul Merson is bookies\u2019 favourite for the exit. He\u2019s also saddled with the technically tricky samba tonight. The big mover in the betting market, though, was Wynne Evans. His odds of elimination have tumbled from 20/1 to 9/2. Can he quickstep to safety?It\u2019s 25 minutes until we get our first choreographic clues\u2026 A right old choreographic kerfuffle erupted this week, thanks to Wynne Evans\u2019 seemingly wandering hands and his pro partner Katya Jones appearing to snub a high-five from him. Despite trending on the-social-network-formerly-known-as-Twitter, the couple have insisted it was all a joke and all is well between them. Do we believe them? Producers will be praying so. The last thing the show needs is another behind-the-scenes scandal. Tonight the couple will be under intense scrutiny, with eagle-eyed viewers alert for any signs of tension. It will surely be a relief for them both for the focus to return to actual hoofing. Half an hour until until the spangly curtain comes up\u2026 Who\u2019ll miss out on the annual spooktacular? Good evening and welcome to the fifth live weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2024. I\u2019m Michael, your cyber dance partner for tonight\u2019s show. You\u2019re cordially invited to watch along with me as our 12 surviving pro-celebrity pairs bid to make it through to the competition\u2019s next landmark - namely next week\u2019s Halloween special. Last week saw this year\u2019s first perfect 10s for Tasha Ghouri, while injury-plagued Nick Knowles was eliminated after defeat to shock dance-offer Shayne Ward. Our remaining dancefloor dozen now trip the light fantastic again. As per usual, tonight\u2019s scores will be combined with the public vote. The two lowest-ranked couples will fight for survival on Sunday night. Who could become this year\u2019s fourth celebrity to board the Wengabus home? Once again, Paul Merson looks vulnerable but he showed considerable imprpvement last week. Dr Puman Krishan and Sam Quek could also find themselves in danger. Even Wynne Evans might not be safe, his odds of elimination plummeting due to last week\u2019s Katya Jones kerfuffle - more on that shortly. It\u2019s showtime at 6.25pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 5.55pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and hoofing-based hilarity. So lace up your dancing shoes, get stitched into your clingiest outfit and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As per usual, I\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for Latin and ballroom badinage. I\u2019ll samba-bounce down there every now and again to see your thoughts and report on your reactions. Somebody won\u2019t be allowed out trick or treating. Nearly time to staaaart dancing!",

      "body": "<p>Elon Musk said on Saturday that America Pac, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>-allied political action committee he founded, will give $1m every day until the presidential election to someone who signs his petition that appears to be a way to incentivize Republicans in battleground states to register to vote.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to be awarding $1m randomly to people who have signed the petition,\u201d Musk said at a town hall event in Pennsylvania. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re having is how do we get the public to know about this petition because the legacy media won\u2019t report on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI figured, so how do we get people to know about it? I think this news will really fly. So every day between now and the election we will be awarding $1m, starting tonight,\u201d Musk said, before presenting an oversized lottery-style check to the first winner of the prize draw.</p> <p>The petition asks people to pledge their support for the first and second amendments, but the small print says that to be eligible for any of the monetary awards, signers need to be registered voters in the key battleground states.</p> <p>In doing so, the petition appears to be designed to principally push Trump voters to register to vote in the presidential election so that they can be in the running for the $1m prize. Signing the petition is also now a prerequisite to attend Musk\u2019s town hall events.</p> <p>The legality of the America Pac $1m prize draw is unclear, and a justice department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry.</p> <p>But several legal experts said on Saturday the petition appeared to violate federal election laws that prohibits paying or offering to pay for someone to register to vote or actually vote under title 52 of the US code.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/criminal/file/1029066/dl\">the justice department\u2019s election crimes manual</a>, for an offer of payment to violate federal election law, it must have been intended to induce or reward the prospective voter for engaging in one or more acts necessary to cast a ballot.</p> <p>The election crimes manual distinguishes between making it easier for people to vote, such as offering free rides to a polling station, and inducing people to vote, which is unlawful.</p> <p>UCLA law professor Rick Hasen <a href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397\">said in his blog</a> that the America Pac $1m prize draw appears to be an illegal scheme because it offered the payments to registered voters.</p> <p>\u201cThough maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,\u201d he wrote.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Elon Musk said on Saturday that America Pac, the Donald Trump-allied political action committee he founded, will give $1m every day until the presidential election to someone who signs his petition that appears to be a way to incentivize Republicans in battleground states to register to vote. \u201cWe are going to be awarding $1m randomly to people who have signed the petition,\u201d Musk said at a town hall event in Pennsylvania. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re having is how do we get the public to know about this petition because the legacy media won\u2019t report on it.\u201d \u201cI figured, so how do we get people to know about it? I think this news will really fly. So every day between now and the election we will be awarding $1m, starting tonight,\u201d Musk said, before presenting an oversized lottery-style check to the first winner of the prize draw. The petition asks people to pledge their support for the first and second amendments, but the small print says that to be eligible for any of the monetary awards, signers need to be registered voters in the key battleground states. In doing so, the petition appears to be designed to principally push Trump voters to register to vote in the presidential election so that they can be in the running for the $1m prize. Signing the petition is also now a prerequisite to attend Musk\u2019s town hall events. The legality of the America Pac $1m prize draw is unclear, and a justice department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry. But several legal experts said on Saturday the petition appeared to violate federal election laws that prohibits paying or offering to pay for someone to register to vote or actually vote under title 52 of the US code. According to the justice department\u2019s election crimes manual, for an offer of payment to violate federal election law, it must have been intended to induce or reward the prospective voter for engaging in one or more acts necessary to cast a ballot. The election crimes manual distinguishes between making it easier for people to vote, such as offering free rides to a polling station, and inducing people to vote, which is unlawful. UCLA law professor Rick Hasen said in his blog that the America Pac $1m prize draw appears to be an illegal scheme because it offered the payments to registered voters. \u201cThough maybe some of the other things Musk was doing were of murky legality, this one is clearly illegal,\u201d he wrote.",

The documents are attributed to the US Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. They are written in a style similar to documents previously leaked from the Pentagon, using classifications familiar to the national security community. The first document has the title \u201cIsrael: air force continues preparations for strike on Iran and conducts a second large-force employment exercise\u201d and the second \u201cIsrael: defense forces continue key munitions preparations and covert UAV activity almost certainly for a strike on Iran\u201d. Both are dated 16 October and were first leaked a day later. In general terms, they note that Israel was still positioning military assets as of the middle of last week to conduct a military strike in response to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on 1 October. Based on monitoring from satellite imagery and other geospatial intelligence, they focus on Israeli preparations relating to air-launched ballistic missiles, refuelling aircraft and covert long-range drone surveillance in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East. That could imply that Israel was planning a long-range missile response to Iran\u2019s attack, described at one point as similar to the long-range strikes it conducted against the Houthis in Yemen on 29 September. It appears to reflect an effort by the US and its closest partners to independently monitor Israel\u2019s plans to attack Iran, though they do not predict its scale or scope.

      "bodyText": "A mass shooting during homecoming weekend at Georgia\u2019s Albany State University left one person dead and five others wounded on Saturday night, according to school officials. Earlier Saturday in Mississippi, authorities said three people were killed and eight others were injured near Lexington, Mississippi, when at least two people fired guns at a group of several hundred people who were at an outdoor trail celebrating a high school football team\u2019s homecoming game victory. Albany State University\u2019s interim president, Lawrence M Drake II, said the shootings happened on the school\u2019s east campus, according to the Georgia television news station WAGA. He said Georgia\u2019s state bureau of investigation (GBI) is in charge of the case. \u201cAs always, the safety and security of our ASU students, faculty and staff are the number one priority of this institution,\u201d Drake said in a statement Sunday. Dougherty county coroner Michael Fowler told the Georgia news outlet WALB that a 19-year-old man from Atlanta died at Phoebe Putney memorial hospital in Albany. WALB identified the slain victim as De-Morion Tayshawn Daniels. Albany State enrolls about 6,000 students. As of Sunday morning, there had been more than 420 mass shootings across the US so far this year. The nonpartisan archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed. Annually high rates of mass shootings in the US have prompted some in the country to call for more substantial federal gun control, though Congress has largely been unable or unwilling to implement such measures.

      "bodyText": "Everyone is always looking for a narrative, New Zealand couldn\u2019t have provided a better one: from ten losses in a row to World Champions, slipping under the radar, holding their nerve when England and Australia lost theirs, to win the tournament. A brilliant team performance, from the grandmas to the fresh-faced twenty-somethings. A cracking end to a memorable tournament, played in front of 21,000 spectators, and the perfect topping to an amazing day for New Zealand cricket. And that\u2019s it from us \u2013 Raf\u2019s report will be here shortly. The third and final Test starts tomorrow in the small hours. Thanks for all your messages \u2013 good bye! Now New Zealand for the handshakes. Bouncing on air, they collect their medals. Nine tournaments, twice runners-up, now winners: Sophie Devine \u2013 \u201cI started to let myself dream last night about what it would be like to hold that trophy up in front of that team. For New Zealand cricket, it has been a long time between drinks. \u201cResults haven\u2019t gone our way recently but we knew what we were building to. We played the two best teams in the row but at a World Cup everyone starts at zero. On \u2018the grandmas\u2019: To have Suz in the side \u2013 so stoked in what we were able to do for her. Lea is the sort of person you want in your team, she\u2019ll scrap for you, she was fantastic today And on changing her mind on stepping down as captain of T20 team. \u201cNo chance. I am done.\u201d \u201cAmelia Kerr is a once in a generation player \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure she can\u2019t feel her legs at the moment and she\u2019s probably chundered everywhere. She\u2019s an amazing cricket and person.\u201d And at last she is freed to lift the trophy. Up go the fireworks, up goes the champagne and New Zealand are crowned champions at last. South Africa collect their medallions. Laura Wolvaardt: \u201cWe had a really good semi-final, the focus was to reset, but we didn\u2019t nail our cricket today. \u201cThey really came at us hard in the power play, at first we thought we could ride the wave, but they just kept on going. At the half way stage we were still backing ourselves though.\u201d \u201cI though it was game on, but overs 7-11 was not our best phase but they bowled really well. I\u2019m very excited for the future, very experience players like Marizanne Kapp but we\u2019ll keep building, go back to the drawing board.\u201d She thanks the management, who don\u2019t always get mentioned. And all the family who flew out. I love this from Nasser. \u201cSome of those catches Suzie Bates has taken, the joy on her face, that you can still have that hunger and passion for the game \u2013 it is like a virus that spreads through the game.\u201d Ah! A figure at last \u2013 21,000 people were in the stadium today, though most of them have drifted back through the turnstiles before the presentation ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit speechless and I\u2019m just so stoked to get the win after all the team has been through. I thought 145 kept us in the game. Brooke Halliday took so much pressure off me, she did it in the semi-final to do it again in the final was class. \u201cI was cramping up in the field, found myself hiding in the ring and short third. The first ball I bowled I cramped up and I thought I\u2019m not going to be able to bowl as fast today\u2026 Bowling is what first got me in the White Ferns.\u201d The go between? I love it, I\u2019ve played international cricket for a while, and I\u2019ve been able to play with some of the greats but to be a similar age to the young players is amazing too. Georgia Plimmer on Suzie Bates: \u201cShes been incredible not just for New Zealand cricket but the world game, she\u2019s an exceptional human being and I\u2019m so unbelievably lucky to have played alongside her.\u201d An all time great is now a world champion: Susie Bates \u201cI\u2019m in shock really. This tournament little things have gone our way. Whatever happened today I was really proud of the group and to think we\u2019ve won the thing is unbelievable. We just wanted to take the game on, we wanted to play with freedom, Georgia was incredible for such a young kid.\u201d Re Devine. \u201cThis means everything for us, we\u2019ve played team sport for so long. WEepulled our way back to the top. She\u2019s been so outstanding leading this team, I think we\u2019ll probably have a cuddle for even longer later. There have been some dark times, we questioned ourselves as leaders.\u201d A delighted Gaze: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk in. I heard the snick (from Bosch) really clearly . We\u2019ve got so much belief, we came into the tournament not on the best streak but we\u2019ve done it. This is for them [the older players], hopefully we\u2019ve made them proud. \u201c Devine hugs every member of her crew, before wiping away her own tears with the elbow of her sleeve. The other side of the mirror, subdued embraces from South Africa. A grim-faced Wolvaardt leads her team out to shake hands \u2013 their second runner\u2019s-up prize in a T20 final in succession. 20th over: South Africa 126-9 (Mlaba 4, Khaka 4) The Trophy is New Zealand\u2019s for the first time! Hugs, tears and huge huge smiles. 19th over: South Africa 121-9 (Mlaba 2, Khaka 1) Just the formalities to go. 38 needed off six balls A second from the over! Jafta has a huge swing, misses, and the ball alleluias into the top of leg stump. Tryon has to go for it, leans back, hits big, but not big enough and Green collects, almost down on her haunches at long on. 18th over: South Africa 117-7 (Tryon 14, Jafta 5) Kerr is bowled out \u2013 three wickets to go with her 43 runs \u2013 player of the match for sure, player of the tournament too? 42 needed in 12 balls A third wicket for Kerr, a third catch for Bates \u2013 prowling at as cover as another fielder ducks and slides out of the way so they don\u2019t collide. 17th over: South Africa 107-6 (Tryon 13, Dercksen 8) Glum faces from South Africa. Dercksen , bright green boots, hauls the ball down the ground. Some cracking fielding by Green stops the boundary, though leaves her sprawled over the rope. 52 needed from 18 balls 16th over: South Africa 100-6 (Tryon 12, Dercksen 2) Halliday the hidden assassin \u2013 she so befuddles South Africa with her allsorts, that they can\u2019t get a handle on her. 59 needed in 24 balls The captain\u2019s hunch brings a terrible curled up marmite sandwich of a first ball and a wicket with the second! Bates takes a back of the hand catch with joy at extra cover. 15th over: South Africa 96-5 (Tryon 11, Luus 8) Tryon goes straight and big and bold and sends Tahuhu for four. Another big shot but can\u2019t find the rope. A healthy ten from the over but the RR has crept up to more than 12. 14th over: South Africa 86-5 (Tryon 3, Luus 6) Kerr thinks she\u2019s got an lbw, Devine shrugs and goes upstairs \u2013 but ball grazes glove and no cigar. New Zealand have no reviews left. 13th over: South Africa 81-5 (Tryon 1, Luus 3) Luus and Tryon are energetic in their dibbing and dabbing \u2013 but South Africa need more than that now. Simon McMahon: \u201cThink South Africa have two chances now, Tanya. Slim, and none, and slim just left town\u2026\u201d Two in two as Mair comes back on. A super ball, and de Klerk can only muscle an outside edge to Kerr on the edge of the circle. Kapp swipes to deep midwicket \u2013 but Plimmer is waiting \u2013 and holds on. A moment caught in time as the camera catches Kapp\u2019s moment of knowing disappointment as Bates roars with joy. 12th over: South Africa 77-4 (de Klerk 6) Grim faces on the South African bench. Gaze is convinced she has got another catch as de Klerk goes to sweep. We go upstairs. Anna Harris is in the third umpire\u2019s room. She calls for ultra edge \u2013 we wait\u2026. Plimmer helps Carson stretch out her legs\u2026not out. A clever bit of fielding on the rope comes to naught as Kapp finds the rope from the bounce back. But she falls next ball. 11th over: South Africa 70-3 (Kapp 3, de Klerk 4) The two new batters farm Jonas nicely for six runs, but the run rate is now over nine an over. The tiniest tickle of cough on the flat line ends Bosch\u2019s World Cup story. Kerr didn\u2019t look so convinced when Devine went for the review \u2013 but Gaze had the look of a woman who knows. Two huge wickets in the over, and Kerr, who is moving like a cheap clockwork cracker toy, continues her incredible WC form. 10th over: South Africa 64-3 (Kapp 1) The big one! Woolvaardt decides to go for broke against a limping Kerr, she goes up, but can\u2019t beat the ring of players in the circle and Bates jumps neatly to collect the catch, then roars in celebration. 9th over: South Africa 59-1 (Wolvaardt 33, Bosch 5) In terms of runs scored at this point in the game, the teams are neck and neck. Bosch ignores a bouncer from Tahuhu, looks at the umpire for the signal, but it doesn\u2019t come. Just one from the over- aggressive, accurate stuff from Tahuhu. 8th over: South Africa 58-1 (Wolvaardt 32, Bosch 5) And here is Kerr, who must have recovered enough to bowl. South AFrica don\u2019t try anything too fancy, just milk her for six. A loud lbw appeal agains tBosch, but the umpire says no and would have been umpire\u2019s call. 7th over: South Africa 52-1 (Wolvaardt 30, Bosch 1) Jonas, who starts the over with a couple of dots, with the vital breakthrough \u2013 though no time for celebrating yet as the wicket only brings in Bosch. \u201dAs you correctly pointed out this is the first time none of the big three are present for the final, leaving the aspiring big teams a chance for glory.\u201d taps Jeremy Boyce. \u201cDon\u2019t forget Windies in all this, who did a job on England. There\u2019s only room for two in a final though, obviously....\u201d Yes, they were really impressive I thought against New Zealand, particularly in the field. New Zealand \u2013 so far \u2013 have upped their game in the field since that semi-final. A cracking pick up and ping from Brits \u2013 but it is a big ground, and a long boundary, and Green is waiting. Very well held. New Zealand with the very very very needed breakthrough. 6th over: South Africa 47-0 (Wolvaardt 29, Brits 15) Fireworks are sprayed into the air as Wolvaardt stands and drives \u2013 with the power of the mountain \u2013 to the mid-on boundary, nearly decapitating her partner at the same time. Win predictor still hedging its bets: 50/50. Now Brits gets in on the act, taking a huge stride and lifting an over pitched ball from Mair for four. 4th over: South Africa 37-0 (Wolvaardt 24, Brits 10) Excellent from Carson, who pulls the initiative back \u2013 conceding just three singles from her second over. 3rd over: South Africa 34-0 (Wolvaardt 23, Brits 8) Wolvaardt is the leading scorer in this tournament, with more fours than anyone \u2013 and here is another as she picks Tahuhu off her boots and sends her lfying for four. And another! Slammed over deep mid wicket Tahuhu regains control with a final dot ball. 3rd over: South Africa 24-0 (Wolvaardt 14, Brits 7) Jonas with her slingshot action. She drags one down, just spitting distance from the bowling crease, and Wolvaardt tucks in with a flamed backfoot drive. New Zealand struggling to grip the ball in the humidity. 2nd over: South Africa 14-0 (Wolvaardt 7, Brits 4) It\u2019s baby-faced Carson at the other end, who has been so effective this tournament. Starts with two dots but Wolvaardt tucks into the fourth, swivels and punchily pulls her down for four. Amelia Kerr is back on the field but is visibly uncomfortable with cramp and is given another rehydration drink on the rope. 1st over: South Africa 7-0 (Wolvaardt 1, Brits 3) Mair with the new ball \u2013 not the best start, three wides winging down the leg side. Tea turned to coffee in the kitchen. The players are already out, the chase nearly on. Hello Guy Hornsby! \u201cWell that\u2019s a brilliant innings from New Zealand, Tanya. They seemed to time the reverse bell-curve perfectly with that big start, then accumulating in the middle and really taking down multiple bowlers at the end. 150 felt a great total, so I\u2019m willing to say this feels 10 over par to get. Kerr and Halliday really timed they\u2019re acceleration well and they took surprisingly lot of runs off Khaka. This should be fascinating, because while South Africa have the firepower, NZ have a strong spin attack. Game very much on!\u201d I fancy it is too many as well \u2013 but South Africa have pulled more than a few surprises in recent years\u2026 and Wolvaardt and Brits have runs in their souls. Time to grab a very quick cup of tea. Advantage New Zealand I think. Hello there Tim Hare! \u201dFollowing your coverage from Brittany. What an amazing weekend for NZ- America\u2019s Cup, Test win in India, Silver Ferns hosing the Aussies in Wellington and now going very well in the T20 final. Got to love a country that punches so far above its weight in so many sports.\u201d Agreed. This one of many things to love New Zealand for. 20th over: New Zealand 158-5 ( Green 12, Gaze 3) What a fabulous final flourish \u2013 16 from the last over including an beautifully struck up and over six by Green when Khaka misses her yorker, which flies over the rope at midwicket. South Africa huddle on the pitch, but no side has ever chased down that many in a women\u2019s T20 World Cup final. 19th over: New Zealand 142-5 ( Green 1, Gaze 1) Eleven from the penultimate over -but the big prize in Kerr gone. Kerr tips her head back in dismay \u2013 but she\u2019d already farmed ten from Mlaba\u2019s first four balls. A nice catch from Brits low down, almost slipping, hunting at deep midwicket. 18th over: New Zealand 131-34(Kerr 33, Green 1) Can New Zealand keep the momentum now Halliday is gone. Can Kerr pick up the pace? \u201cHi Tanya.\u201d Hello there Simon McMahon. Was good to see Alistair Cook and Neetu David, both newly inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame, carrying the trophy before the start. Hoping for a close, exciting game, either of these sides would be worthy champions\u2026\u201d Ah, that\u2019s why he\u2019s there! And agreed \u2013 here\u2019s to a thriller. A huge roar as Bosch at backward square leg steadies herself and accepts the gift swept up and away by Halliday. The end of a cracking innings that gave New Zealand its momentum back. Tryon is poker-faced \u2013 job not nearly yet done. 17th over: New Zealand 125-3 (Kerr 31, Halliday 36) Kapp is back, but starts with a no ball \u2013 uncharacteristically undisciplined. There have been a few extras in this innings. Kapp nearly has Halliday with a low full toss that evades her bat but skips (inexplicably) past the stumps. Kapp finishes with 0-25 from her four overs. 16th over: New Zealand 117-3 (Kerr 29, Halliday 31) A drop! Not easy, as Kerr slams the ball straight back to the bowler and Khaka instinctively reaches for it but can\u2019t hold on. To add to their woes, South Africa are four minutes behind the clock. 15th over: New Zealand 110-3 (Kerr 23, Halliday 26) New Zealand suddenly mounted and charging. Halliday neatly dismisses a slightly frazzled looking de Klerk past point for four. A back foot no ball then brings a free hit \u2013 which Kerr makes the most of: up and over mid off for four more. Click clack. 14th over: New Zealand 97-3 (Kerr 20, Halliday 21) A first boundary since the sixth over! Halliday the woman \u2013 who follows up her haul over deep square leg with another next ball, this time to long-on \u2013 fluffed on the rope by de Klerk. 13th over: New Zealand 85-3 (Kerr 19, Halliday 10) Mlaba returns. The outfield is not fast, the ball sticking like glue as Halliday cuts to the rope and the fielders are able to chase it down. The crowd is filling up. 12th over: New Zealand 79-3 (Kerr 17, Halliday 6) New Zealand staying busy, running well between the wickets, rotatig the strike, being bold, Halliday top-edges a switch hit. Five from Luus\u2019s over. 11th over: New Zealand 74-3 (Kerr 15, Halliday 3) No boundaries since the power play for New Zealand and lots of pressure now on Kerr. On comms they suggest her strengths lie in massaging the bowling \u2013 leaving the big hitters to strike the rope. Respect to de Klerk for both the wicket and the review! She persuades Wolvardt to go upstairs \u2013 and the tech gives it out, Devine misses her pull and is hit above the knee -but the ball would have hit the top of the stumps. Big wicket that one. 10th over: New Zealand 70-2 (Kerr 14, Devine 6) New Zealand not finding it easy to get stuck into Tryon\u2019s slow left arm. But they keep plugging away and rinse eight from the over. At the half way point in this innings they pause for DRINKS, ice packs and a change of gloves. 9th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Kerr 12, Devine 1) Kapp is brought back, determination oozing from every pore. A rare onfield smile as the ball fails to come out of her hand in delivery. She dries her hand on a cloth. I think it must be very humid out there \u2013 we\u2019ve already seen the batters pause for drinks breaks. 8th over: New Zealand 57-2 (Kerr 10, Devine 0) What can Devine and Kerr do from here? Three handy wides from the over. Bates dipped like a doughnut by a quicker ball, shuffling around the crease, goes to paddle one round the corner, but loses her stumps. She throws her bat in the air in dismay. Great energy at the top of the innings though. 7th over: New Zealand 50-1 (Bates 25, Kerr 8) The cameras aren\u2019t quite making it clear how full, or otherwise the ground it. Lots of noise anyway. New Zealand farm seven from the over. 6th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Bates 25, Kerr 8) A double change as Mlaba replaces Khaka. A striking figure, her short hair dyed blond \u2013 a neat nose ring. A leading edge from Bates drops just short of point But Bates makes the most of a leg-side offering, kneeling and shovelling four. End of the power play \u2013 with this the most runs conceded by South Africa in the power play this tournament. 5th over: New Zealand 36-1 (Bates 18, Kerr 8) A bowling change, as Tryon replaces Kapp. Wolvaardt, who looks permanently worried, bites her lip. Some running-between-the-wickets confusion for the first time, but South Africa can\u2019t capitalise as Kapp fumbles slightly in her pick up. Excellent over. 4th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Bates 17, Kerr 7) Khaka keeps it tight, New Zealand farming ones and twos, till the last ball when Bates pulls past the diving mid off to the rope. Alastair Cook is here, watching with his young family. 3rd over: New Zealand 24-1 (Bates 10, Kerr 4) New Zealand\u2019s aggressive intent continues, though with less to show from it. A no ball from Kapp \u2013 but no sweeties as Kerr is bowled from the free hit. 2nd over: New Zealand 20-1 (Bates 7, Kerr 4) Bates get in on the act, swiping Khaka to the midwicket boundary. Plimmer falls \u2013good strong catch from Luus 0 but Kerr comes in and immediately is on the attack too, pulling four from her first ball. This is A PLAN. Plimmer goes big one too many times and Luus is waiting\u2026can she hold on? The seconds still, but she does, to South African sprinting delight. 1st over: New Zealand 9-0 (Bates 1, Plimmer 8): My my! Young Plimmer has the bit between her teeth \u2013 aggressive from the first ball, a boundary from the fourth as Plimmer hauls Kapp to the rope., four more as she lays into a shorter ball, swivels and pulls with gumption. The players are out, Marizanne Kapp has ball in hand, here we go! This is Devine\u2019s last match as New Zealand\u2019s T20 captain, and Suzie Bates today overtakes Mithali Raj to become the most capped player in women\u2019s international cricket. Here come the umpires, here come the teams for the anthems, hand in hand with the children mascots. The Kiwis are in fine voice tonight and Sophie Devine grins wolfishly at the end. Now South Africa\u2019s turn, hands across their chests, with the best anthem in cricket. New Zealand XI: Suzie Bates, Georgia Plimmer, Amelia Kerr, Sophie Devine (capt), Brooke Halliday, Maddy Green, Isabella Gaze (wk), Lea Tahuhu, Rosemary Mair, Eden Carson, Fran Jonas Unchanged from the semi-final. South Africa XI: Laura Wolvaardt (capt), Tazmin Brits, Anneke Bosch, Marizanne Kapp, Chloe Tryon, Sune Luus, Annerie Dercksen, Nadine de Klerk, Sinalo Jafta (wk), Nonkululeko Mlaba, Ayabonga Khaka. Unchanged all tournament. \u201cIt feels to me like a chasing ground,\u201d says Nasser. It\u2019s growing dark, it\u2019s over 30 degrees and the seats are filling up\u2026 Ninety-seven chances have gone down in this competition. Why. Why???? Mel Jones has been asking. \u201cSome people say it is about the lights, some about the pressure. I think we have to go back to basics over the next four year cycle in catching and fielding.\u201d New Zealand wanted to bat anyway \u2013 and they too keep the same side from the semi-final. Sophie Devine says that she has exchanged messages with the men\u2019s team over in India, who just won for the first time in India for over 36 years. Laura Wolvaardt: \u201cI think it has worked really well for us throughout the tournament. I think we have batting resource we haven\u2019t even used yet, though I hope the top order can do the job.\u201d South Africa keep the same side. And this is a super read on where South Africa and New Zealand sit (as well as the now knocked out West Indies.) I love this from Suzie Bates: \u201cWe\u2019re the grandmas of this team, still standing. Leah [Tahuhu] with her bionic knees, Sophie having dealt with a lot of stuff as captain, and me keeping on going - it\u2019s really a special moment. There have been tough times, we have been through ups and downs, but that we have made the final is special. We look after each other.\u201d Hello! This is it. A T20 World Cup final \u2013 but not just any T20 World Cup Final. A T20 World Cup final without Australia, without England, without India \u2013 for the first time in the history of the women\u2019s T20 competition. But, as big as the news has been about England and India\u2019s underwhelming performances, (see Raf Nicholson here): And Australia\u2019s shock defeat (see Megan Maurice here): The real news is the rise of New Zealand and South Africa. Both surprise finalists, both on the rise from the \u201cmiddle group\u201d of women\u2019s cricket teams \u2013 who have seemed so far away from the big three. But not so now. Sophie Devine\u2019s New Zealand started the tournament after a disastrous year of results. Their rebuilding phase had not brought any tangible benefits, and Devine worried to women\u2019s cricket podcast \u201cPowerplay\u201d that young girls were gravitating towards netball or rugby union instead. But once they hit the tournament, everything started to come together, with the tournament\u2019s leading wicket taker Amelia Kerr the shining light. South Africa, who knocked out England to reach the final in the last competition have been hovering on the edge of the big time, \u201cTwo finals in two years, we must be doing something right\u201d in the words of Laura Wolvaardt. Their strength has been that batting \u2013 topped by Anneke Bosch\u2019s incredible 74 not out against Australia. By this evening will be a new name on the trophy. Play starts at 3pm BST.

Slot arrived from Feyenoord with the unenviable task of replacing one of Liverpool\u2019s greatest and most beloved managers; Maresca, on the other hand, took up a pew nobody much seemed to want, or have any hope of staying in for long.</p> <p>For both new arrivals, the early signs have been positive. Liverpool have barely broken stride, winning six of their first seven league games while developing a more considered style under Slot. When Chelsea opted to ditch Mauricio Pochettino and bring Maresca in, they looked doomed to another reset \u2013 but the Italian has already assembled an exciting, youthful first XI who are outpacing early expectations.</p> <p>Which brings us to today\u2019s showdown at Anfield. This fixture brought little joy to the visitors in the J\u00fcrgen years. Seven different Chelsea coaches faced Klopp on his home turf in the league; the only one who got a win is now the England manager. Liverpool start as favourites, and a victory would cement their status as bona fide title contenders.</p> <p>On the other hand, if Chelsea can rewrite recent history and win here, they would move a point behind Liverpool, suddenly back in the title race conversation themselves after years of turbulence. An intriguing contest awaits, kicking off at 4.30pm BST (yes, still BST). Let\u2019s go!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Enzo Maresca: \u201cI really like the performance of our team \u2026 perhaps we deserved something more. We don\u2019t like to lose, but if you have to drop points, this is the way to do it. We had possession in their half, we were brave on and off the ball and I feel this is the right way.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think today\u2019s game defines where we are \u2013 we tried to prepare in the best way. You have to take chances, but overall we played well, we were brave and it\u2019s important we leave with a good feeling.\u201d Here are Liverpool\u2019s next 11 games \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty brutal run: Leipzig (A), Arsenal (H), Brighton (A, Carabao Cup), Brighton (H), Leverkusen (H), Villa (H), Southampton (A), Real Madrid (H), Man City (H), Newcastle (A), Everton (A). Arne Slot: \u201cThe most important thing is you have to work so hard, which we did. We created a few very good chances, and were perhaps unlucky \u2013 although maybe I am a bit biased \u2013 with some of the decisions.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the VAR overturn of the second penalty, and also Adarabioyo only getting a yellow card for his foul on Jota. Slot was booked during the game and said \u201cmy emotions took over \u2026 I deserved the yellow card. Lots of people were shouting and I jumped in!\u201d He adds that the second penalty \u201cstill looked a penalty on the screen.\u201d He also praises Curtis Jones for keeping Cole Palmer quiet, and for his involvement at both ends of the pitch. Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s match report from Anfield. Thanks for joining me, and enjoy your Sunday evenings. Bye! Curtis Jones: \u201cTo play in this team, you\u2019ve got to run, you\u2019ve got to have energy, press, get back and help out.\u201d He adds that his shoulder is still a bit sore after being suplexed by Sanchez, and hasn\u2019t seen the penalty calls yet but definitely \u201cfelt contact\u201d on the first. Jones became a dad last week: \u201cit\u2019s the best thing ever, a different type of joy\u201d. Under Slot, players now sleep at home the night before games, and Jones adds: \u201cI was in the spare room last night, but she\u2019s a little dream, she\u2019s sleeping well.\u201d Player of the match on very little sleep, and he called the interviewer \u2018la\u2019 to boot. Lovely stuff. \u201cMy side won, so I feel I can say that I can\u2019t remember a worse refereeing performance,\u201d writes Johnathan. \u201cBrooks was weak, inconsistent, and had no control over the game.\u201d I agree he wasn\u2019t great, but I can think of worse refereeing performances this month. \u201cRe: Gravenberch,\u201d writes Drew Lundgren. \u201cWe\u2019ve all tried to transform an attacking mid into a defensive mid on a video game \u2013 are we to believe it\u2019s actually working for Slot? In real life??\u201d It seems to be \u2013 he was very much the water-carrier today with Jones pushing forward, and did so with very little fuss. On Sky, Kelly Cates says this felt \u201clike a Cup game\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s reflected in the post-match reaction, Chelsea looking crestfallen while Liverpool players pat each other\u2019s backs, a mixture of pride and relief. Liverpool reclaim top spot in the Premier League after a very hard-earned victory. Curtis Jones got the winner, just moments after Nicolas Jackson had levelled for Chelsea, who had their chances but were just outmuscled by their opponents. Arne Slot\u2019s impressive start continues. 96 mins: A final half-chance for Chelsea, Neto\u2019s cross running through to Gusto on the right \u2026 but Robertson makes the block, and Liverpool hold on! 95 mins: Diaz almost seals victory in superb style, picking up Mac Allister\u2019s pass, slaloming through two defenders, but sending his shot just high and wide of Sanchez\u2019s goal. 94 mins: Another Chelsea chance! Neto swings in a cross from the left and Nkunku gets a toe to the ball \u2013 but can only send it into the side netting. The Liverpool defence were on their heels there \u2026 93 mins: Gomez does well to close down Veiga on the left side, at the cost of a throw-in to Chelsea. Seven added minutes, by the way \u2026 92 mins: Oooof! Palmer\u2019s inswinging delivery is in the sweet spot and Renato Veiga gets to it first, but heads over the bar! That was a chance, even if Konate was making life difficult for him. 91 mins: At the other end, Palmer steps away from Mac Allister, who continues a fraught cameo by tripping him up, earning that yellow card \u2013 and giving Chelsea a dangerous free kick \u2026 89 mins: Caicedo crunches into Van Dijk in midfield, giving Liverpool a chance to lift the ball into the area. Both centre-backs go forward, but Szoboszlai\u2019s delivery lacks direction. 88 mins: Renato\u2019s header lands to Szoboszlai, who finds Gomez on the right \u2013 but he opts to retain possession rather than swing a cross into the area. 87 mins: Chelsea are still in with a shout here \u2013 but Neto aside, the substitutes haven\u2019t offered much, with Nkunku getting frustrated here and fouling Gomez. 85 mins: An example here as Gomez sends the ball behind for a corner with an edgy backpass. The corner is played short, whipped in, and cleared away. 84 mins: Liverpool appear to be seeing this out with a degree of comfort, but there\u2019s been a weird edge to this game, where it feels like either defence might self-destruct at any moment. 82 mins: Mac Allister gets involved in what\u2019s been a mighty scrappy run of play, hacking down Gusto with a challenge that would probably earn a booking, had he not just come on. 80 mins: Diaz has a go from 25-odd yards out, but his shot is straight at Sanchez. Konat\u00e9 brings down Nkunku to stop a Chelsea break, and is booked. Another Liverpool change incoming: Joe Gomez will replace Trent Alexander-Arnold at right back. 79 mins: Alexis Mac Allister is set to come on for the last 10 minutes. Slot opted not to risk starting him after he picked up a knock on international duty. He\u2019ll replace Curtis Jones, who has proved himself a very able deputy. 77 mins: Chelsea probe without success in the Liverpool third and then the hosts break through Luis D\u00edaz, who is upended by Veiga. 75 mins: Badiashile concedes a free kick out on the right-hand touchline. Before Liverpool take it, Madueke is replaced by Nkunku for Chelsea. 72 mins: Neto again makes that dangerous infield run, and with a lack of attacking options around him, pulls a low shot wide of the far post. 70 mins: Neto makes another impressive infield run, barrelling past Alexander-Arnold and Konate before prodding delicately to Palmer, whose shot is closed down. 69 mins: Alexander-Arnold, who had been very solid so far, almost lets Enzo Fernandez in as he dithers on a ball which wasn\u2019t quite running through to Kelleher. 67 mins: Badiashile moves forward but, after overplaying a pass wide to Neto, is clattered by Nunez. The striker gets a booking, and Chelsea have a free kick, from which they pass the ball around a bit. 65 mins: Cody Gakpo, who has had a middling afternoon, is replaced by Luis Diaz. 63 mins: Chelsea win a free kick close to the edge of the area as Gravenberch brings down Neto, this time running inside to try and escape Alexander-Arnold. Palmer takes it but it clips the wall, and from the corner, Nunez is bundled over to ease the pressure. 62 mins: Neto, a busy presence on the left, lifts a cross to the far post where Madueke opts to let it drop, volleying a shot straight at Kelleher. 61 mins: Neto protests after Gravenberch nicks the ball away from him on the edge of the area, having dropped back to assist Alexander-Arnold. 59 mins: Liverpool advance and Nunez finds Salah, who sweeps the ball beautifully over to the left flank. Gakpo dallies on the ball, reducing his options, and sends a tentative effort well over the bar. 58 mins: Renato makes a break through midfield but is dispossessed by Jones, who then draws a foul from Caicedo \u2026 56 mins: Neto hooks in a cross towards Palmer, gambolling in like a gazelle, but Kelleher gets down to smother the ball. Like a frustrated Fifa player, Maresca responds with three changes in one go \u2013 Badiashile, Enzo Fernandez and Renato Veiga are on for James, Tosin and Lavia. Veiga, who is becoming something of a fan favourite, will play on the left with Malo Gusto moving to right-back. A crafty bit of attacking play, with three Liverpool players offside as Salah whips in a cross \u2013 but not Curtis Jones, who times his run perfectly to nick the ball past Sanchez and inside the far post. He\u2019s been Liverpool\u2019s standout player so far today. Well, that didn\u2019t last long. Liverpool restore their lead in a matter of moments through Curtis Jones! 50 mins: That was simple but so effective, the kind of move Chelsea had been threatening to put together throughout the first half, helped by Liverpool sitting much higher up the field. Konate was playing him onside, and the goal stands. Jackson has his fifth goal of the season, and Chelsea are back in the game! Goal? Caicedo plays in Jackson, who spins in between Konate and Van Dijk, runs on and slots coolly past Kelleher \u2013 but the flag is up. Replays, though, tell a different story \u2026 We\u2019re back under way, with Pedro Neto on for Jadon Sancho. I\u2019m slightly surprised as Sancho had been lively \u2013 if well-marshalled by Alexander-Arnold down the right. In other news \u2026 \u201cOut in France and the commentators are curious as to how a grey-area decision at best can be overturned by VAR,\u201d writes Ben Jones. \u201cThe only thing clear and obvious about that challenge by S\u00e1nchez was that he was always going to scythe through Curtis Jones.\u201d I\u2019m not sure why Sanchez getting a touch negates him then going through Jones like Hulk Hogan through a stack of barrels. Mike Dean himself said the same (in so many words), but then changed his mind once he saw Brooks heading to the pitchside monitor. \u201cIt\u2019s moments like these that prove beyond doubt that Curtis Jones is head over heels in love with playing for Liverpool,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cI thought it was a flippin\u2019 foul.\u201d So, one Liverpool penalty given \u2013 and scored by Mohamed Salah \u2013 and another overturned by VAR. Chelsea have been in the game, with Cole Palmer going close late in the half, but dodgy defending has been their downfall so far. More soon \u2026 52 mins: We play on, thanks to the delay in checking the penalty call \u2013 and Palmer is bundled over by Szoboszlai, who then kicks the ball away. He gets a yellow card, probably for the latter infraction. James whips in a dangerous ball, which Nunez does well to nod away. And that\u2019s half time. 49 mins: Close from Palmer! This is the closest Chelsea have come, with Cole Palmer controlling Madueke\u2019s cutback and curling his effort just over the bar. 47 mins: Sanchez, who has been close to a liability for Chelsea in this half, got lucky there. I think that kind of challenge might be a red card even in rugby union. Penalty to Liverpool? This is an awful mess, with Sanchez trying to block Jones\u2019 shot and sending the Liverpool man flying over his shoulder. Brooks points to the spot, but the replays show Sanchez actually kicked the ball on to Jones\u2019 shins \u2026 and after a monitor check, the penalty (and booking) is overturned. 45 mins: Madueke wins a corner, delivered by Palmer and headed away by Van Dijk. We\u2019ll have five minutes of injury time \u2026 44 mins: We close on half-time with a familiar pattern now in place \u2013 Chelsea probing in the Liverpool half, the hosts happy to wait and pounce on a mistake. 42 mins: Chelsea have plenty of attacking options on the bench \u2013 Nkunku, Neto, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix \u2013 although Jackson is OK to continue for now. 40 mins: Jackson has gone down off the ball, holding his hip. He\u2019s had a busy international break, playing twice for Senegal in Afcon qualifying. It looks like he might have hurt himself after falling while taking that shot on a few minutes ago. 39 mins: Caicedo is robbed by Nunez, who feeds Salah on the right. His ball in to Gakpo\u2019s feet puts him one-on-one with Adariaboyo, but the Chelsea defender stands his ground well this time. 38 mins: Palmer misjudges a pass on the edge of the Liverpool area; he\u2019s not had the best of games so far. Chelsea come again, and the tricky Sancho is denied by Alexander-Arnold, at the expense of a corner. 36 mins: Gakpo plays a lovely pass in to Szoboszlai, who mishits a decent chance into Sanchez\u2019s gloves, causing Peter Drury to shout DOMINIK Szoboszlai at an entirely unnecessary volume. \u201cI just made the mistake of checking the darker parts of the internet, where everything is binary and there are no shades of grey, and there are Arsenal supporters claiming that Adarabioyo\u2019s yellow and Saliba\u2019s red are definite proof there\u2019s a PGMOL conspiracy against them,\u201d writes Andy Flintoff (not that one). I\u2019ve never really understood how these refereeing conspiracies are supposed to work. If you have ever had a decision go your way, surely that debunks the whole theory? 34 mins: Chelsea break through Caicedo, who plays a raking diagonal ball to Jackson. His shot from a tight angle is decent, perhaps clipping the very outside of the post \u2013 but Maresca is unhappy he didn\u2019t look up and see Palmer arriving in the middle. No goal! They almost pay for their fuzzy thinking here, with Sanchez\u2019s weak clearance setting up another Liverpool attack. Nunez flicks on to Jones, who plays in Salah, whose low cross is turned in by Gakpo. Lovely stuff \u2026 but the flag is up, Salah just offside in the buildup. 31 mins: Sanchez is off his line quickly to clear from under Nunez\u2019s feet, before Salah wins a corner. Chelsea just need to clear their heads here \u2026 30 mins: Jackson is booked for protesting the decision while Salah waited to take the penalty. There\u2019s also an early change for Liverpool, with Diogo Jota \u2013 moving gingerly ever since that Tosin challenge \u2013 being replaced by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez. Sanchez dives to his right, Salah smashes the ball into the other corner, and Liverpool lead! Moments later, Salah\u2019s blocked shot rebounds into Curtis Jones\u2019 path \u2013 and as he turns to shoot, he\u2019s brought down by Colwill. That\u2019s a penalty, right there. And now Salah will step up \u2026 25 mins: Liverpool go again, Colwill appearing to foul Salah outside the area, and there\u2019s another challenge in the area, but John Brooks waves the appeals away. Arne Slot is so hoppin\u2019 mad he gets a booking, but you might argue Salah leaned into that second challenge. But wait \u2026 24 mins: Chelsea break and Madueke\u2019s cut-back deflects to Cole Palmer, whose quick shot is blocked smartly by Jones. You almost expect him to score from that kind of position \u2026 23 mins: At the other end, James gets into trouble and is prised off the ball by Gakpo. Jota has a run at the last man, but the referee gives a foul. James was a little lucky there \u2026 21 mins: Another tricky deep cross from Reece James is headed behind by Alexander-Arnold; from the corner, Kelleher has to clear under pressure from Jackson, but then the offside flag is raised against Colwill. 20 mins: The first murmurs of frustration from the home fans as a pass goes astray in the centre circle. Liverpool fans are also urging their team to push forward \u2013 everyone is behind the ball with Chelsea in possession. 19 mins: Maresca appeals after Alexander-Arnold brings down Sancho in the area after a tangle of legs, but no further action is taken. 18 mins: Sanchez almost gifts Liverpool the lead, trying to be too clever and clattering the ball off Gakpo. Luckily for Chelsea, it ricochets back into this gloves. 16 mins: Enzo Maresca has won his first three away Premier League games, and his team have had the better of a fairly low-key opening, bar the Tosin yellow card. 13 mins: Chelsea move the ball smoothly through midfield again, and Sancho plays in Gusto, whose cross is deflected behind \u2013 but he got the last touch, so it\u2019s a Liverpool goal kick. 11 mins: A nice Sanchez-Sancho link here as the Chelsea keeper plays a perfect long pass out wide. The winger advances and pulls it back to Gusto, who overcooks his attempted cross. 9 mins: A lull in the game, during which we get a close-up of Kelleher, making his 50th Liverpool appearance and untroubled thus far. 7 mins: Adarabioyo is booked! Probably a fair decision \u2013 Jota would have had more to do than Evanilson yesterday, with the ball heading towards the touchline and Gusto in pursuit. Tosin is on the proverbial tightrope now, though. 6 mins: Uh-oh \u2026 Salah launches a long ball and Jota is away, in behind Tosin Adarabioyo, who is caught on the wrong side and bundles him over. It\u2019s a very similar incident to the William Saliba red card last night \u2026 5 mins: Caicedo stays down briefly holding his knee, but is OK to carry on for now. Diogo Jota almost breaks through the Chelsea defence, but just lets the ball out from under his feet. 4 mins: After a wriggling run from Jones, Salah\u2019s long-range effort comes off Colwill\u2019s hand \u2013 nothing given, although Colwill was actually outside the area. 2 mins: We\u2019ve started at a gentle pace, with Reece James\u2019 curling cross headed away by Konate in the first attacking foray from either team. Here we go, Liverpool in all-red, Chelsea in almost all-blue (white socks). It\u2019s a classic combination. First, a minute\u2019s applause for Peter Cormack, a star midfielder for Bill Shankly\u2019s Liverpool side, who died recently at the age of 78. Here is one of Cormack\u2019s most famous goals, a diving header to win the Merseyside derby in 1972. RIP. \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d echoes around Anfield. How about Chris McCausland on Strictly, eh? Anyway, kick-off is coming up \u2026 \u201cThis should be a highly entertaining fixture,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cOn VAR. Bin it. Has it reduced the amount of controversy? No. Accept human frailty and go back to human decisions.\u201d I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance VAR will be binned; it still feels to me that in England, it\u2019s the way officials use the system that is largely to blame. And Arne Slot: \u201cIt\u2019s always the next game, it\u2019s a tough one as Chelsea are doing well this season. It\u2019s no surprise to me, they have a lot of very good players, so an interesting challenge.\u201d Here\u2019s Enzo Maresca: \u201cReece was injured, now he\u2019s back, hopefully he can get minutes and get a bit more fit. I know Romeo very well from City, it\u2019s similar, he just needs games [but] he\u2019s back to help us.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s game won\u2019t define where we are, if we win or not. We try to prepare in the best way, get points, and then we\u2019ll see.\u201d Incredible VAR drama (Varma?) at Molineux, as John Stones heads a last-gasp winner \u2026 only for Stuart Attwell to send the referee over to the monitor. But after a quick look, Chris Kavanagh sticks with his onfield decision! You can unpick all that with Daniel Harris. Reece James captains Chelsea in his first appearance since May; he slots in at right-back with Malo Gusto on the left, covering the suspended Marc Cucurella. Wesley Fofana is also out after getting a fifth booking, with Tosin Adarabioyo coming in, while Rom\u00e9o Lavia replaces Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez in midfield. Three changes for Liverpool, with Andy Robertson back in place of Tsimikas, and Dominik Szoboszlai replacing Alexis Mac Allister. That could mean Curtis Jones moves back alongside Ryan Gravenberch in midfield. In goal, Caoimhin Kelleher replaces the injured Alisson. As it stands, Liverpool will kick off the game top of the table \u2013 because after Arsenal lost at Bournemouth, Manchester City are labouring at Molineux, where it\u2019s 1-1 with 15-odd minutes to play. Follow that one with Daniel Harris: Liverpool (4-2-3-1): Kelleher; Alexander-Arnold, Konat\u00e9, Van Dijk, Robertson; Gravenberch, Jones; Szoboszlai, Salah, Gakpo; Diogo Jota. Subs: Jaros, Gomez, Endo, D\u00edaz, N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Mac Allister, Tsimikas, Quansah, Morton. Chelsea (4-2-3-1): S\u00e1nchez; James, Adarabioyo, Colwill, Gusto; Lavia, Caicedo; Madueke, Palmer, Sancho; Jackson. Subs: Bettinelli, Disasi, Badiashile, Pedro Neto, Fern\u00e1ndez, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, Nkunku, Dewsbury-Hall, Veiga. Referee: John Brooks. VAR: Michael Oliver. Arne Slot and Enzo Maresca, two humble, softly-spoken, fashionably bald tracksuit managers, both stepped into pre-warmed seats in the Premier League at the start of this season. Slot arrived from Feyenoord with the unenviable task of replacing one of Liverpool\u2019s greatest and most beloved managers; Maresca, on the other hand, took up a pew nobody much seemed to want, or have any hope of staying in for long. For both new arrivals, the early signs have been positive. Liverpool have barely broken stride, winning six of their first seven league games while developing a more considered style under Slot. When Chelsea opted to ditch Mauricio Pochettino and bring Maresca in, they looked doomed to another reset \u2013 but the Italian has already assembled an exciting, youthful first XI who are outpacing early expectations. Which brings us to today\u2019s showdown at Anfield. This fixture brought little joy to the visitors in the J\u00fcrgen years. Seven different Chelsea coaches faced Klopp on his home turf in the league; the only one who got a win is now the England manager. Liverpool start as favourites, and a victory would cement their status as bona fide title contenders. On the other hand, if Chelsea can rewrite recent history and win here, they would move a point behind Liverpool, suddenly back in the title race conversation themselves after years of turbulence. An intriguing contest awaits, kicking off at 4.30pm BST (yes, still BST). Let\u2019s go!",

Ms Reeves insists that \u201cday-to-day costs must be met by revenue\u201d. By contrast, New Labour\u2019s fiscal approach aimed to balance the budget \u201cover the cycle\u201d.

This would free up an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5198b1d8-8801-454b-b549-97e04687d5db\">additional</a> \u00a37bn a year for current spending. However, what value do fiscal rules hold if they\u2019re altered whenever politically convenient? Jagjit S Chadha, the outgoing director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, offers a far better solution.</p> <p>Instead of relying on self-imposed fiscal rules that are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/consideration-fiscal-targetry?type=topical-briefing\">honoured more in the breach than in observance</a>\u201d, Prof Chadha proposes a more transparent approach. He suggests that the Treasury should publish an overview of the government\u2019s balance sheet, showing how ministerial decisions have affected national income. Additionally, a \u201cstate of the economy\u201d address could outline areas of progress \u2013 and failure. This, he argues, would hold the chancellor accountable for actual economic performance, rather than forecasts that are invariably inaccurate. Given that the UK has seen seven different sets of fiscal rules since 2010, the risk of abandoning the current ones seems minimal. The country faces pressure arising from an ageing society and the demands of net zero. To meet such challenges needs a fresh approach. \u200b\u200bProf Chadha\u2019s proposal would offer substantial improvement, especially with Britain in urgent need of economic repair.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ms Reeves insists that \u201cday-to-day costs must be met by revenue\u201d. By contrast, New Labour\u2019s fiscal approach aimed to balance the budget \u201cover the cycle\u201d. The IFS believes the chancellor will have to attempt to balance spending \u201cover the medium term\u201d. This matters \u2013 without such a long-term commitment, the result could be an additional \u00a320bn in cuts and tax hikes this year. Ms Reeves has another option. She could exclude transfers from the government to the Bank of England \u2013 intended to offset losses from the unwinding of its quantitative easing programme \u2013 from her \u201cdeficit\u201d rule. This would free up an additional \u00a37bn a year for current spending. However, what value do fiscal rules hold if they\u2019re altered whenever politically convenient? Jagjit S Chadha, the outgoing director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, offers a far better solution. Instead of relying on self-imposed fiscal rules that are \u201chonoured more in the breach than in observance\u201d, Prof Chadha proposes a more transparent approach. He suggests that the Treasury should publish an overview of the government\u2019s balance sheet, showing how ministerial decisions have affected national income. Additionally, a \u201cstate of the economy\u201d address could outline areas of progress \u2013 and failure. This, he argues, would hold the chancellor accountable for actual economic performance, rather than forecasts that are invariably inaccurate. Given that the UK has seen seven different sets of fiscal rules since 2010, the risk of abandoning the current ones seems minimal. The country faces pressure arising from an ageing society and the demands of net zero. To meet such challenges needs a fresh approach. Prof Chadha\u2019s proposal would offer substantial improvement, especially with Britain in urgent need of economic repair. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has also set out his intention for the UK to lead in these areas, citing the climate in his speech to the UN general assembly last month. \u201cWe are returning the UK to responsible global leadership,\u201d he told fellow heads of government. \u201cBecause it is right, but also because it is plainly in our self-interest.\u201d Davis said: \u201cThe government has recognised that the nature crisis is of equal gravity to the climate crisis, and that we cannot tackle one without addressing the other. Ecosystems and the species they support are essential to maintain food security, reduce health risks and manage the impacts of rising global temperatures.\u201d Her appointment follows that of Rachel Kyte, formerly the top climate official at the World Bank, to the role of climate envoy, a post that was scrapped under the Conservative government. That appointment was criticised as Kyte also holds a position on an advisory board to a charitable foundation funded by a financial investment firm that made a \u00a34m donation to Labour before the election. Kyte was not involved in that decision, and many prominent environmental experts leaped to her defence. Nicholas Stern, the economist, told the Guardian: \u201cRachel was on the board of the philanthropic foundation and not the company, and she was very well equipped to advise that foundation. No conflict of interest.\u201d The Guardian understands that Davis will not hold any other external roles. Davis beat a strong field of candidates for the new role of nature envoy. Names spoken of in relation to the post included Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF UK; Matthew Gould, the chief executive of the Zoological Society of London; and Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England. Leading voices in green campaigning hailed Davis\u2019s appointment. Edward Davey, the head of the UK office of the World Resources Institute thinktank, said: \u201cRuth Davis is the environmentalist\u2019s environmentalist, and the best of us: profoundly knowledgeable, deeply committed, a person of fearless integrity, and entirely selfless. She will be a wonderful nature envoy and is a brilliant appointment.\u201d Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative former minister, said: \u201cI worked with Ruth as a minister and was always impressed by her knowledge and commitment. She will be a real asset to the new government.\u201d Oscar Soria, the director of the Common Initiative, a thinktank specialising in global environmental policy, said: \u201cRuth\u2019s name means: a compassionate friend. The UK is now appointing a big heart and a clear mind, and that\u2019s good news for the world. \u201cHer deep understanding of global contexts, paired with a diplomatic touch that bridges cultures and countries, sets her apart. In a world needing both global insight and local action, Ruth thrives in complexity. Her intelligence is matched by an often overlooked quality: compassion. At a time when the world needs thoughtful, caring leadership, Ruth is the person to guide the UK with empathy and respect, ensuring no path is left unexplored in the fight for biodiversity.\u201d The UN biodiversity conference Cop16 in Cali begins on Monday. At the summit, governments will examine progress towards meeting this decade\u2019s UN targets to halt biodiversity loss, which include protecting 30% of land and sea for nature and repurposing $500bn (\u00a3380bn) of environmentally harmful subsidies.",

      "bodyText": "Tributes have poured in for the Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy after he revealed he had received a terminal cancer diagnosis. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Hoy, who won six golds and one silver medal for Team GB, said doctors had told him he had between two and four years to live. While Hoy, 48, had said earlier this year he had been receiving treatment for cancer, he did not say which type, but he told the Sunday Times he had been diagnosed with primary cancer in his prostate, which had spread to his bones. His wife, Sarra, has also been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease. The couple have two children, Chloe and Callum. \u201cAs unnatural as it feels, this is nature,\u201d Hoy told the Sunday Times. \u201cYou know, we were all born and we all die, and this is just part of the process. You remind yourself, aren\u2019t I lucky that there is medicine I can take that will fend this off for as long as possible.\u201d \u201cHand on heart, I\u2019m pretty positive most of the time and I have genuine happiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is bigger than the Olympics. It\u2019s bigger than anything. This is about appreciating life and finding joy.\u201d Hoy made no reference to his personal news as he presented from the Track Cycling World Championships on the BBC on Sunday afternoon. After the publication of the article, social media platforms have been full of tributes and support from friends and well-wishers. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible Chris, sending much love and strength,\u201d the Olympic gold medallist Sally Gunnell said. The television pundit and ex-footballer Ally McCoist wrote: \u201cYou, my friend are a superstar in every sense of the word. Love and strength from all of us.\u201d The Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish called Hoy a \u201chero of a human being\u201d. The Edinburgh-born athlete has been credited with playing a key role in making British Cycling a success. Hoy shared a picture on Instagram from the World Track Cycling championships in Copenhagen, and wrote: \u201cYou may see in the news this weekend some articles about my health, so I just wanted to reassure you all that I\u2019m feeling fit, strong and positive, and overwhelmed by all the love and support shown to my family and me. Onwards!\u201d \u201cSuch sad news,\u201d the prime minister, Keir Starmer, wrote on X. \u201cChris is a British sporting legend. To face his diagnosis with such positivity is inspiring. The whole country is behind him and his family.\u201d The UK health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: \u201cI\u2019m in awe that Chris Hoy is meeting his cancer with the same positivity and resilience that has defined his life and career. The whole country will be cheering him on as we have done so many times before and sending him and his family so much love.\u201d \u201cI send every good wish to Sir Chris Hoy and his family,\u201d the Scottish first minister, John Swinney, wrote. \u201cHe has always inspired us by all that he has done.

      "body": "<p>My friend and former colleague Simon \u201cSpike\u201d Mullings, who has died aged 57 in a kayaking accident, was a self-taught expert in housing law who worked for a London legal firm before moving to the Hammersmith and Fulham Law Centre and co-chairing the Housing Law Practitioners Association (HLPA). </p> <p>Spike got into legal work when he was employed as an odd-job man at the east London solicitors Edwards Duthie, where I worked, and through that connection developed an interest in how the law operated.</p> <p>Despite having no legal qualifications or formal training, he learned the law himself by reading and observing cases, and began to work as a paralegal at Edwards Duthie under the supervision and guidance of their lawyers.</p> <p>Beginning with outdoor clerking \u2013 going to court with a barrister, taking notes and liaising with and supporting clients \u2013 he gradually became the in-house expert on housing law at Edwards Duthie, and senior members of the commercial property team would frequently seek his opinion for their commercial clients.</p> <p>As his knowledge grew, in the late 1990s the firm offered to pay the course fees for him to undertake a law conversion course with a view to qualifying as a solicitor \u2013 but he turned the offer down, preferring to spend his free time with his young children. Eventually he progressed into delivering training on housing law and began to act as a link between legal aid solicitors, law centres and citizens advice bureaux on housing law issues.</p> <p>Spike also became involved in the politics of law, including as co-chair from 2020 to 2024 of the HLPA, with whom he lobbied to bring in protection for tenants during the Covid-19 pandemic, including by temporarily halting evictions.</p> <p>During his tenure at the HLPA he revitalised the association, and his video podcasts during lockdown were a comfort and inspiration to many.

      "bodyText": "My friend and former colleague Simon \u201cSpike\u201d Mullings, who has died aged 57 in a kayaking accident, was a self-taught expert in housing law who worked for a London legal firm before moving to the Hammersmith and Fulham Law Centre and co-chairing the Housing Law Practitioners Association (HLPA). Spike got into legal work when he was employed as an odd-job man at the east London solicitors Edwards Duthie, where I worked, and through that connection developed an interest in how the law operated. Despite having no legal qualifications or formal training, he learned the law himself by reading and observing cases, and began to work as a paralegal at Edwards Duthie under the supervision and guidance of their lawyers. Beginning with outdoor clerking \u2013 going to court with a barrister, taking notes and liaising with and supporting clients \u2013 he gradually became the in-house expert on housing law at Edwards Duthie, and senior members of the commercial property team would frequently seek his opinion for their commercial clients. As his knowledge grew, in the late 1990s the firm offered to pay the course fees for him to undertake a law conversion course with a view to qualifying as a solicitor \u2013 but he turned the offer down, preferring to spend his free time with his young children. Eventually he progressed into delivering training on housing law and began to act as a link between legal aid solicitors, law centres and citizens advice bureaux on housing law issues. Spike also became involved in the politics of law, including as co-chair from 2020 to 2024 of the HLPA, with whom he lobbied to bring in protection for tenants during the Covid-19 pandemic, including by temporarily halting evictions. During his tenure at the HLPA he revitalised the association, and his video podcasts during lockdown were a comfort and inspiration to many. In 2020 he won the social welfare lawyer category at the Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year awards. Spike was born in London to Peter Mullings, who was in the merchant navy, and Gill (nee Collie), a building society systems manager. Growing up in Nelson, Lancashire, he went to Walton Lane high school in the town and then to Leeds Music College, leaving early to play bass with various indie bands, in particular the Snapdragons, who released two albums and a number of singles between 1988 and 1991. In 1993 he moved to London after meeting Melanie Warner, a teacher in Islington, and did a variety of casual jobs, often with my brother Nick, which was how he ended up at Edwards Duthie. Spike made friends everywhere and was lovely company. His Christmas Eve parties, organised with Melanie at their house in Forest Gate, east London, were famous for bringing local people together. He was at his happiest though, on the islands and by the lochs of Scotland with his family and friends. After many years together Spike and Melanie married in 2022. She survives him, as do their children, Maisie and Sonny, and his mother.",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes it helps having a double World Cup champion in your side. There are numerous reasons why Leicester overturned an 11-point deficit to win a thrilling contest against Gloucester under blue skies and swirling winds. Their experienced bench played a role, as did greater accuracy in the backline after a disjointed opening. They rode their luck on occasion and it did not hurt playing against the most porous defence in the league.</p> <p>A key factor, though, was the presence at fly-half of Handr\u00e8 Pollard, who scored a crucial try at the start of the second half while kicking nine points in a three-point win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/rugby-brain-injury-lawsuit-stuck-in-legal-limbo-and-players-are-still-suffering\">Rugby brain injury lawsuit stuck in legal limbo \u2013 and players are still suffering</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Springbok pivot missed for the first time this season on 23 minutes when he failed to convert Ollie Hassell-Collins\u2019s wonder finish. That shank against the upright felt costly at the time as a little later Max Llewellyn bagged his second and Gloucester\u2019s third try to take a healthy, and deserved, 19-8 lead into the break.</p> <p>Shortly after the break \u2013 during which Leicester\u2019s head coach, Michael Cheika, brought out the hairdryer on \u201cthe very lowest setting\u201d, as he put it \u2013 the Tigers had a penalty within touching distance of the try line. They opted to tap and go and from neat interplay, including quick hands from Juli\u00e1n Montoya, Pollard had it on a blind run. After taking an initial hit, he powered over under the posts.</p> <p>Rugby games so often have turning points; moments when momentum shifts and everything that had come before feels immaterial. This was it. And as soon as Pollard added the extras the result seemed inevitable.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a class player,\u201d was the simple verdict from Cheika, who praised Pollard\u2019s decision-making but chose instead to focus on the collective that now occupies third place in the Premiership. \u201cHe was able to play off the back of more physicality, more go-forward. We carried a bit harder, our ruck was more dynamic in the second half therefore we were able to maintain possession. And when you keep moving forward like that other things start to work for you.\u201d</p>    <p>Leicester began to boss the point of contact which sucked in multiple defenders, a departure from Gloucester\u2019s original plan to limit the number of bodies committed to the breakdown. Montoya was faultless at the lineout, which served as a springboard for meaty carries. Six minutes after Pollard\u2019s try, Freddie Steward ran a scything line from midfield and played a simple pass on his outside for the supporting Josh Bassett to score in the corner.</p> <p>Gloucester could not handle the greater impetus from their hosts despite commanding the first half. Tomos Williams, who came into the game with the second most linebreaks, initially ran the show at scrum-half with his fellow Welshman Llewellyn punching holes in midfield.</p> <p>Arthur Clark set up a try for his second-row partner Freddie Thomas when the pair combined across 50 metres of running. And when Santiago Carreras hammered Olly \u00adCracknell into touch a stunned silence rippled through the stands. Despite Hassell-Collins\u2019s five-pointer, procured from 20 metres out even though he had two covering defenders to deal with, Leicester\u2019s faithful had little to cheer.</p> <p>Then Pollard scored. So, too, did Bassett. And when Dan Kelly charged over from close range following sustained pressure on 65 minutes, it seemed as if all of Gloucester\u2019s fight had left them. There would be another twist but not another turning point.</p> <p>With the game slipping away from the away side, and after Pollard had left the field, Llewellyn \u2013 tipped by George<strong> </strong>Skivington, Gloucester\u2019s director of rugby, to earn a Wales call-up this week \u2013 registered his hat-trick when he straightened off his right foot from close range as Leicester\u2019s defence was under threat.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes it helps having a double World Cup champion in your side. There are numerous reasons why Leicester overturned an 11-point deficit to win a thrilling contest against Gloucester under blue skies and swirling winds. Their experienced bench played a role, as did greater accuracy in the backline after a disjointed opening. They rode their luck on occasion and it did not hurt playing against the most porous defence in the league. A key factor, though, was the presence at fly-half of Handr\u00e8 Pollard, who scored a crucial try at the start of the second half while kicking nine points in a three-point win. The Springbok pivot missed for the first time this season on 23 minutes when he failed to convert Ollie Hassell-Collins\u2019s wonder finish. That shank against the upright felt costly at the time as a little later Max Llewellyn bagged his second and Gloucester\u2019s third try to take a healthy, and deserved, 19-8 lead into the break. Shortly after the break \u2013 during which Leicester\u2019s head coach, Michael Cheika, brought out the hairdryer on \u201cthe very lowest setting\u201d, as he put it \u2013 the Tigers had a penalty within touching distance of the try line. They opted to tap and go and from neat interplay, including quick hands from Juli\u00e1n Montoya, Pollard had it on a blind run. After taking an initial hit, he powered over under the posts. Rugby games so often have turning points; moments when momentum shifts and everything that had come before feels immaterial. This was it. And as soon as Pollard added the extras the result seemed inevitable. \u201cHe\u2019s a class player,\u201d was the simple verdict from Cheika, who praised Pollard\u2019s decision-making but chose instead to focus on the collective that now occupies third place in the Premiership. \u201cHe was able to play off the back of more physicality, more go-forward. We carried a bit harder, our ruck was more dynamic in the second half therefore we were able to maintain possession. And when you keep moving forward like that other things start to work for you.\u201d Leicester began to boss the point of contact which sucked in multiple defenders, a departure from Gloucester\u2019s original plan to limit the number of bodies committed to the breakdown. Montoya was faultless at the lineout, which served as a springboard for meaty carries. Six minutes after Pollard\u2019s try, Freddie Steward ran a scything line from midfield and played a simple pass on his outside for the supporting Josh Bassett to score in the corner. Gloucester could not handle the greater impetus from their hosts despite commanding the first half. Tomos Williams, who came into the game with the second most linebreaks, initially ran the show at scrum-half with his fellow Welshman Llewellyn punching holes in midfield. Arthur Clark set up a try for his second-row partner Freddie Thomas when the pair combined across 50 metres of running. And when Santiago Carreras hammered Olly Cracknell into touch a stunned silence rippled through the stands. Despite Hassell-Collins\u2019s five-pointer, procured from 20 metres out even though he had two covering defenders to deal with, Leicester\u2019s faithful had little to cheer. Then Pollard scored. So, too, did Bassett. And when Dan Kelly charged over from close range following sustained pressure on 65 minutes, it seemed as if all of Gloucester\u2019s fight had left them. There would be another twist but not another turning point. With the game slipping away from the away side, and after Pollard had left the field, Llewellyn \u2013 tipped by George Skivington, Gloucester\u2019s director of rugby, to earn a Wales call-up this week \u2013 registered his hat-trick when he straightened off his right foot from close range as Leicester\u2019s defence was under threat. That made it a three-point game with eight minutes to play. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Skivington said when asked about his thoughts on his team\u2019s second-half struggles. \u201cThat 10-minute block [after the restart] was the same last week. We\u2019ve got to have a look at that. We\u2019ve got a gameplan in place that demands a lot of the players. You\u2019ve got to work extremely hard and we\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201d Leicester held on. Maybe it was their stout defence or that Seb Blake dropped the ball over the line as Gloucester\u2019s pack rumbled over from a well-worked maul. Or maybe it was an unshakeable winning mentality provided by a few serial winners, including one who\u2019s won it all before.",

Manchester City jumped back to the top of the WSL following a 2-1 win over Aston Villa. Liverpool dropped points to Crystal Palace at home, while Arsenal and Leicester got back to winning ways. Thanks for joining me, enjoy the rest of your weekend! Tom Garry spoke to Lauren James ahead of this evening\u2019s London derby between Chelsea and Tottenham. You can read the full interview here: Here are the results from today\u2019s WSL games so far\u2026 Manchester City 2-1 Aston Villa Liverpool 1-1 Crystal Palace Leicester City 1-1 Everton West Ham 0-2 Arsenal Yuka Momiki\u2019s first-half strike was enough to secure all three points for Leicester at the King Power Stadium. Everton had plenty of chances to get back into the match but failed to make the most of them. Arsenal get back to winning ways in the WSL with a much-needed 2-0 win over West Ham. A positive end to a turbulent week for the north London side. Leicester 1-0 Everton. Huge chance for the visitors! The ball is crossed into the box and Vanhaevermaet goes for goal with a header, but her effort narrowly runs wide! West Ham 0-2 Arsenal. Blackstenius carries the ball down the left before squaring it across goal to Kafaji, who makes no mistake in converting her shot. Kafaji scores her first Arsenal goal! That should seal the three points. West Ham 0-1 Arsenal. Van Domselaar makes a fantastic save to keep Dagn\u00fd Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s effort out. West Ham 0-1 Arsenal. Huge chance for Arsenal! Mead sends a long pass through to Blackstenius on the edge of the box, but the striker fails to control the ball and Szemik can claim. West Ham 0-1 Arsenal. Harries goes for goal with a header but fails to challenge Van Domselaar. Just over 10 minutes left to play in both games now. Both Leicester and Arsenal are leading their opponents 1-0 as we enter the final stages. Mariona calmly converts the spot-kick, slotting the ball into the bottom-left corner with ease! Tysiak trips Blackstenius in the box and the referee points to the spot! Leicester 1-0 Everton. Huge chance for Everton to equalise! Toni Payne, who was introduced just after half-time, makes a run down the right before sending a cross to Sarri in the box. The Greek international throws herself at the ball in an attempt to tap it in, but can\u2019t get enough contact on it. West Ham 0-0 Arsenal. Arsenal interim manager Ren\u00e9e Slegers has just made a quadruple substitution. Stina Blackstenius has replaced Alessia Russo. Little makes way for Kyra Cooney-Cross, with Beth Mead replacing Foord. Finally, summer signing Rosa Kafaji is on for Maanum. We\u2019re back under way in both 3pm games. West Ham 0-0 Arsenal Leicester 1-0 Everton The points are shared at St Helens Stadium. A huge result for Crystal Palace! Leicester have a narrow lead at the break thanks to Momiki\u2019s early goal. A fairly uneventful half in Dagenham. West Ham 0-0 Arsenal. The visitors are desperately pushing for a breakthrough but they are struggling to crack West Ham\u2019s low block at times. Just a few minutes to go now until half-time. Just under 10 minutes to play until half-time now in both 3pm games. Meanwhile, we\u2019re approaching the final stages of Liverpool vs Crystal Palace. Leicester 1-0 Everton. Another goalkeeper time-out, this time involving Leicester\u2019s Leitzig. She receives some treatment before the hosts continue with a throw-in. West Ham 0-0 Arsenal. It\u2019s still goalless at the Chigwell Construction Stadium. Fox has just forced a good save from Szemik as Arsenal look for an opening goal. Liverpool 1-1 Crystal Palace. There\u2019s some concern for Liverpool as Rachael Laws goes down with an injury. After receiving treatment from the physios the goalkeeper is able to play on for now. Leicester 1-0 Everton. What a goal from Momiki! The midfielder receives the ball from Chossenotte just outside the penalty area before poking it through the legs of Vanhaevermaet and passing her shot into the bottom-right corner! Momiki fires Leicester into an early lead! Following his team\u2019s win over Aston Villa, Manchester City manager Gareth Taylor told BBC Two: \u201cI\u2019m always about the performance. I thought we were fantastic in so many ways. Even at half-time I said to the girls it was very good we just did not control one action from Villa. It was a great fightback in the second half. What I loved about it was the fact we stayed calm. \u201cWe continued to play our game, the first half an hour of the second half was a half-pitch practice in our favour and we did some little tactical tweaks which helped a little bit and allowed Leila [Ouahabi] to get a little bit higher, it worked within 30 seconds. It worked straight away. \u201cOf course we have got to thank Lauren [Hemp] for a brilliant goal and a fantastic assist. That second goal was really special.\u201d We\u2019re also up and running at the King Power Stadium! We\u2019re under way at the Chigwell Construction Stadium! It\u2019s all level at St Helens Stadium. Crystal Palace held the lead for the majority of the first half, but the hosts managed to draw themselves level before the break. Arsenal enter a new era in the WSL this weekend following the departure of head coach Jonas Eidevall. The 41-year-old resigned on Tuesday following Arsenal\u2019s 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea. Ren\u00e9e Slegers immediately took over as interim manager and went on to win her first game in charge against V\u00e5lerenga in the Champions League. Arsenal will be in need of a win against West Ham this afternoon to avoid falling away from the top three. Following this afternoon\u2019s 2-1 win against Aston Villa, Manchester City winger Lauren Hemp told BBC Two: \u201cIt feels great, obviously the aim was to win. We managed to do it. We seem to keep doing it the hard way but we got three points in the end. \u201cGoing into the international [break] unbeaten is the aim and games like that last season we would have probably conceded and gone on to draw so it\u2019s important we learned from that and this season put things right and beat them. It was a tough game and credit to them.\u201d Liverpool 1-1 Crystal Palace. Kapocs pounces on a poor clearance from Green before taking the ball into the box and slotting it past Yanez. Kapocs equalises for Liverpool just before half-time! West Ham vs Arsenal. Leah Williamson and Beth Mead have to settle for a spot on the bench for Arsenal. Catley and Codina step into central defence, with Foord and Mariona on the wings. Lotte Wubben-Moy is out of the squad entirely. Leicester starting XI: Janina Leitzig; CJ Bott, Sophie Howard (C), Sari Kees, Courtney Nevin; Sam Tierney, Saori Takarada, Ruby Mace; Deanne Rose, Shana Chossenotte, Yuka Momiki. Everton starting XI: Courtney Brosnan; Justine Vanhaevermaet, Megan Finnigan (C), Heather Payne; Lucy Hope, Honoka Hayashi, Clare Wheeler, Sara Holmgaard; Veatriki Sarri, Katja Snoeijs, Karoline Olesen. Liverpool 0-1 Crystal Palace. Amid some sloppy defending from Liverpool, the ball falls to Stengel in the six-yard box and the ex-Liverpool star manages to poke it into the bottom corner! What a start from Palace! Stengel fires Palace into an early lead! Manchester City deservedly return to the top of the table following a fantastic comeback against Aston Villa. Lauren Hemp was the star of the show, first scoring the equaliser before assisting the winner. Villa are still seeking that all-important first WSL win of the season. West Ham starting XI: Kinga Szemik; Anouk Denton, Li Mengwen, Shannon Cooke, Shelina Zadorsky; Amber Tysiak, Katrina Gorry (C), Seraina Piubel, Oona Siren; Viviane Asseyi, Riko Ueki. Arsenal starting XI: Daphne van Domselaar; Emily Fox, Laia Codina, Steph Catley, Katie McCabe; Kim Little (C), Lia W\u00e4lti, Frida Maanum; Mariona Caldentey, Caitlin Foord, Alessia Russo. Manchester City 2-1 Aston Villa. We\u2019re into five minutes of added time at the Joie Stadium. City are on track to maintain their unbeaten run. Liverpool get us under way in the 2pm game! And Jill Roord\u2019s strike to make it 2-1 to the hosts\u2026 A look at Lauren Hemp\u2019s equaliser\u2026 Manchester City 2-1 Aston Villa. Hemp skips past three Villa defenders with some incredible footwork before sending a low-driven cross to Roord in the box, who fires her shot into the goal. That goal was scored by Roord but sensationally created by Hemp. What a turnaround for Manchester City! And what a moment for Roord \u2013 her first goal since returning from her ACL injury. And just like that, the game has been completely flipped on its head! Roord with the strike! Manchester City 1-1 Aston Villa. Ouahabi sends a cross into the box from the left. D\u2019Angelo gets a hand to it but the ball floats behind and falls to Hemp, who controls it with her head before flicking it over the Villa goalkeeper and into the net! Hemp fires Manchester City level! Manchester City 0-1 Aston Villa. The visitors have managed to hold off City so far in this second half, but they are facing a huge amount of pressure. Liverpool vs Crystal Palace. Liverpool are without striker Sophie Rom\u00e1n Haug today. The 25-year-old suffered an ankle issue against Manchester City last weekend and underwent a scan on Friday. The extent of her injury is yet to be revealed. Jeremy has emailed in about the ongoing match between Manchester City and Aston Villa. He says: \u201cLots of movement possible today in the embryonic WSL table and plenty of points up for grabs. Villa would love them to move away from the foot, City to move away at the head. Seems Villa have made a perfect start, but they may just have stirred the City fire. Whatever, it is a great opportunity to once again appreciate the great play, commitment and hard-as-nails attitude of the great Rachel Daly before she hangs up her headband. She always gives the full 100%.\u201d Aston Villa managed just one shot on target during that first half \u2013 and they certainly made it count! Robert de Pauw\u2019s side face an incredibly difficult challenge trying to keep City at bay in the second half. Liverpool starting XI: Rachael Laws, Lucy Parry, Gemma Bonner, Jasmine Matthews; Gemma Evans, Taylor Hinds (C), F\u016bka Nagano, Marie H\u00f6binger; Olivia Smith, Mia Enderby, Cornelia Kapocs. Crystal Palace starting XI: Shae Yanez; Josie Green, Katrine Veje, Brooke Aspin, Lily Woodham; Lexi Potter, My Cato; Annabel Blanchard, Indiah-Paige Riley, Mille Gejl; Katie Stengel. Manchester City 0-1 Aston Villa. Just five minutes to go in this first half\u2026 I\u2019ll also be bringing you team news for Liverpool vs Crystal Palace in the next few moments. Manchester City 0-1 Aston Villa. Huge chance for Manchester City to equalise! Hemp makes a run down the right before cutting back and sending a cross to Roord on the edge of the six-yard box. The midfielder flings herself at the ball in a bid to tap it in, but can\u2019t quite get enough contact on it. Here\u2019s a look at that Gabi Nunes goal\u2026 Manchester City 0-1 Aston Villa. Hanson makes a run down the left before sending a cross into Nunes at the front post. The Brazilian manages to get in front of Aleixandri before flicking the ball into the bottom-right corner. Brilliant from Villa against the run of play! And just like that, Aston Villa take the lead! Gabi Nunes scores her first goal for the club! Manchester City 0-0 Aston Villa. A fairly tame header from Shaw is comfortably saved by D\u2019Angelo. Villa left the WSL Golden Boot holder completely free in the box there \u2013 they will not want to make that same mistake again. Manchester City 0-0 Aston Villa. City are happy to keep the ball at the moment \u2013 and Villa are happy to let them. The visitors are simply waiting to pounce on a mistake in midfield. They have managed it a few times so far in this game, but are yet to make the most of any chances they have created. Manchester City 0-0 Aston Villa. Chance for City as Shaw goes for goal from outside the box, but her effort flies way off target. Manchester City 0-0 Aston Villa. Manchester City are not trying to force anything in these early stages. Any glimpses at goal have been handled well by the Aston Villa defence. We\u2019re under way at the Joie Stadium! The teams are out! Just a few minutes to go until kick-off at the Joie Stadium! I want to hear from you today! Feel free to send me an email with any score predictions, feelings, thoughts and all that jazz. Who will end the weekend at the top of the WSL table? Will Manchester City and Chelsea continue their dominance? Will Arsenal bounce back from last week\u2019s defeat? Or will West Ham pull off another shock result at the Chigwell Construction Stadium? Manchester United dropped points for the first time this season yesterday after being held to a 1-1 draw by Brighton. United took the lead through Grace Clinton in the 10th minute, but Nikita Parris levelled things up against her former club after half-time. The two sides now sit level on 10 points. Katie Robinson starts her first WSL match for Aston Villa this afternoon. Manager Robert de Pauw has made just one change to his line-up, with the former Brighton star replacing Chasity Grant in attack. Chloe Kelly remains on the bench for Manchester City amid ongoing speculation around her future at the club. Meanwhile, summer signing Vivianne Miedema is unavailable. The Dutch international missed City\u2019s midweek trip to St Polten due to an injury concern which is not thought to be serious. As things stand, Miedema is still expected to link up with the Dutch national team next week. Manchester City starting XI: Ayaka Yamashita; Kerstin Casparij, Laia Aleixandri, Alex Greenwood (C), Leila Ouahabi; Yui Hasegawa, Jill Roord, Jess Park; Mary Fowler, Lauren Hemp, Khadija Shaw. Aston Villa starting XI: Sabrina D\u2019Angelo; Noelle Maritz, Lucy Parker, Anna Patten, Danielle Turner; Jordan Nobbs, Missy Bo Kearns; Katie Robinson, Kirsty Hanson, Gabi Nunes; Rachel Daly (C). Hello and welcome to another WSL clockwatch. We have four games to look forward to before this evening\u2019s London derby between Chelsea and Tottenham. Manchester City and Aston Villa kick off proceedings at 12:15pm BST before Liverpool host Crystal Palace, Everton travel to Leicester and Arsenal take on West Ham. The table could look very different come the end of the day - join me!",

After graduation he began working in London as an advertising copywriter for various big agencies, before setting up a production company, Bussmann Llewellyn, with a friend, to make television commercials. He then established his own firm, Tom Bussmann Films, and over the years received many awards for his commercials, although the one he made for Feast ice-creams was the most popular with his children, as we had a freezer full of them afterwards. Tom kept the company going until gradually winding down into what might be called \u201cflexitirement\u201d in the early 2000s, by which time the plug had also been pulled on Zeitgeist after a 15-year run. He had been asked to compile Zeitgeist by his friend the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, who was aware not just of his writing talent but his great sense of humour. Tom did his own research to find the stories, and there were always huge piles of newspapers around our house, which he would scour for items that he could spin into stories. Aside from Zeitgeist he also wrote a number of off-beat articles for the paper over the years, including on travel and books. His 1965 marriage to Carole (nee Gribben) ended in divorce in the early 90s. He is survived by his second wife, Natascha, whom he married in 1995, four children from his first marriage, Jane, John, Tom and me, and two from his second, Benjamin and Joshua.",

Those who\u2019ve applied before and been unsuccessful often don\u2019t reapply. The application process itself can be a barrier \u2013 technical jargon and language barriers make it challenging for voluntary organisations.\u201d</p> <p>The government launched a protective security scheme for places of worship in 2016 before creating a dedicated scheme worth <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-commits-more-funding-to-protect-uk-muslims\">\u00a329.4m</a> for mosques and faith schools in 2023 to provide security to ensure the safety of Britain\u2019s Muslim communities.</p> <p>A separate government scheme for assisting the Jewish community was set up in 2015 with \u00a318m dedicated to security funding to protect Jewish communities in 2023. The government says the scale of funding is determined by the number of community sites used by each faith.</p> <p>Mohammed said there needed to be a review of the existing process due to fears that at-risk Muslim faith institutions were missing out on security funding.</p> <p>This risk was heightened when mosques across the UK were targeted after a knife attack in Southport, after false news spread online claiming the perpetrator of the attack was a Muslim asylum seeker. As a result, the Home Office set up a rapid response process to provide extra security and support for Muslim communities.</p> <p>Mohammed said: \u201cWe need a comprehensive review of the scheme that addresses three critical areas: why take-up remains so low despite the clear need, whether current funding levels are sufficient given recent far-right riots, and how we can better understand the true scale of risk given widespread under-reporting.\u201d</p> <p>Kamran Hussain, the chief executive of the British Muslim Heritage Centre, said the far-right riots indicated why security for mosques was so essential. \u201cIt was inevitable that with the Islamophobia we are seeing, that there should be an increase in the level of protection around Muslim institutes and mosques,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hussain said his colleagues who applied for security funding for the heritage centre after the riots described the process as \u201cvery easy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey put security in place who are constantly here, 24 hours, to make sure everything is OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had one phone call, a bomb threat, in the last two weeks so it shows the sentiment that\u2019s out there and the risks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/30/sadiq-khan-fears-rise-in-uk-hate-linked-to-middle-east-violence\">Sadiq Khan fears rise in UK hate crime linked to Middle East violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mohammed said the far-right riots were \u201ca stark reminder of the very real threats our mosques face\u201d. She said: \u201cWithout adequate protection, these community centres remain vulnerable to attacks, vandalism, and violence. The government\u2019s response must match the severity of these threats.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt is paramount every community feels safe, especially in places of worship. That is why we introduced the protective security for mosques scheme.</p> <p>\u201cIn response to public disorder in August we introduced a rapid protective security response process for places of worship and we have provided additional security for hundreds of mosques across the country.\u201d</p>",

Although the data reveals more than 304 eligible mosques and associated Muslim faith institutions applied for protective security in 2023, it remains a relatively small proportion of the more than 2,000 mosques and prayer rooms thought to be in the UK, according to the website muslimsinbritain.org. Zara Mohammed, the general secretary of the MCB, described the low take-up for the scheme as indicative of \u201dthe inadequacy of current engagement efforts\u201d. She said: \u201cMany mosques aren\u2019t even aware this funding exists due to minimal outreach. Those who\u2019ve applied before and been unsuccessful often don\u2019t reapply. The application process itself can be a barrier \u2013 technical jargon and language barriers make it challenging for voluntary organisations.\u201d The government launched a protective security scheme for places of worship in 2016 before creating a dedicated scheme worth \u00a329.4m for mosques and faith schools in 2023 to provide security to ensure the safety of Britain\u2019s Muslim communities. A separate government scheme for assisting the Jewish community was set up in 2015 with \u00a318m dedicated to security funding to protect Jewish communities in 2023. The government says the scale of funding is determined by the number of community sites used by each faith. Mohammed said there needed to be a review of the existing process due to fears that at-risk Muslim faith institutions were missing out on security funding. This risk was heightened when mosques across the UK were targeted after a knife attack in Southport, after false news spread online claiming the perpetrator of the attack was a Muslim asylum seeker. As a result, the Home Office set up a rapid response process to provide extra security and support for Muslim communities. Mohammed said: \u201cWe need a comprehensive review of the scheme that addresses three critical areas: why take-up remains so low despite the clear need, whether current funding levels are sufficient given recent far-right riots, and how we can better understand the true scale of risk given widespread under-reporting.\u201d Kamran Hussain, the chief executive of the British Muslim Heritage Centre, said the far-right riots indicated why security for mosques was so essential. \u201cIt was inevitable that with the Islamophobia we are seeing, that there should be an increase in the level of protection around Muslim institutes and mosques,\u201d he said. Hussain said his colleagues who applied for security funding for the heritage centre after the riots described the process as \u201cvery easy\u201d. \u201cThey put security in place who are constantly here, 24 hours, to make sure everything is OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had one phone call, a bomb threat, in the last two weeks so it shows the sentiment that\u2019s out there and the risks.\u201d Mohammed said the far-right riots were \u201ca stark reminder of the very real threats our mosques face\u201d. She said: \u201cWithout adequate protection, these community centres remain vulnerable to attacks, vandalism, and violence. The government\u2019s response must match the severity of these threats.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cIt is paramount every community feels safe, especially in places of worship. That is why we introduced the protective security for mosques scheme. \u201cIn response to public disorder in August we introduced a rapid protective security response process for places of worship and we have provided additional security for hundreds of mosques across the country.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Middle East and Ukraine are ablaze, the US mired in turmoil. An octogenarian president recedes from view. The threat of a second Trump term hangs like the sword of Damocles. Fifty years ago, with Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward captured Watergate and the downfall of Richard Nixon. Now, the US sits at an inflection point once again. Woodward\u2019s fourth book at least in part about Donald Trump is a sober but alarming must-read.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/bob-woodward-book-mark-milley-trump\">War</a> depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin\u2019s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy.</p> <p>True to form, Woodward gets his sources to talk. \u201cAll interviews were conducted under the journalist ground rule of \u2018deep background\u2019,\u201d he notes. Unless the source agreed to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s still a mystery to me how he deals with Putin and what he says to Putin,\u201d Dan Coats, director of national intelligence under Trump, says of his former boss. \u201cIs it blackmail?\u201d There\u2019s something there, Coats is sure.</p> <p>In the fall of 2021, the Biden administration concluded that Russia would soon invade Ukraine. They had the intelligence to prove it. They mounted a full-court press. On the front pages of the Washington Post, they laid out what was coming. They warned and later armed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite his initial skepticism, and they rallied the west.</p> <p>\u201cYou have no reason to invade Ukraine,\u201d Boris Johnson, then British prime minister, told Putin in October 2021, according to Woodward. Woodward also says Johnson called Putin a \u201csmall, puckish lowlife\u201d, for whatever that is worth. The Biden administration looked further afield. \u201cWe are highly confident Russia is going to do this,\u201d Kamala Harris told Emmanuel Macron, in November 2021. \u201cFrance is prepared to impose costs,\u201d the French president answered. \u201cI\u2019m on board for that.\u201d As war broke out, Germany announced that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with Russia would not proceed.</p> <p>Woodward also quotes Biden sharply criticizing Barack Obama for a half-hearted response to earlier Russian aggression. \u201cThey fucked up in 2014,\u201d Woodward quotes the president telling a friend, of the year of the annexation of Crimea. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here \u2026 <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/politics/bob-woodward-book-war-joe-biden-putin-netanyahu-trump/index.html\">Barack never took Putin seriously</a> \u2026 We gave Putin a license to continue! Well, I\u2019m revoking his fucking license!\u201d</p> <p>Predictably, Trump and his minions hold a different view of Putin. \u201cThis is genius,\u201d the once and possibly future president said, after Putin declared regions of Ukraine independent, on top of invading them. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who\u2019s very savvy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know him very well. Very, very well.\u201d</p> <p>Woodward also reminds readers that after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, Trump heaped praise on another terror group, calling Hezbollah \u201cvery smart\u201d and Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defense minister, a \u201cjerk\u201d. At a recent speech in Detroit, Trump delivered a shout-out to Massad Boulos, father-in-law of Tiffany Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter from his second marriage. Boulos, a Lebanese Christian, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-arab-americans-michigan-boulos-gaza-war-57abe06681457106a2e6ab107407edc6\">is reportedly aligned with Hezbollah</a>. Having run unsuccessfully for a seat in Lebanon\u2019s parliament, he plays a role in Trump\u2019s Arab-American outreach.</p> <p>Back to Woodward\u2019s text. Over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Maga fell into line. \u201cThis is going to be old-school original gangster,\u201d said Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and White House strategist, now close to finishing a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson minimized the invasion as a \u201cmere border dispute\u201d.</p> <p>On the Middle East, Woodward writes of a cacophony of wrath, relations between Washington and Jerusalem strained, even as the US supplies ammunition, aid and backup at the UN. Early on, Woodward writes, Biden branded Benjamin Netanyahu as a \u201cbad fucking guy\u201d \u2013 a story initially denied by the White House.</p> <p>Woodward portrays Biden and advisers as more myopic when it comes to domestic events, misjudging their mandate and the mood of the country. Woodward also says Biden kept close tabs on the government prosecution of his son, Hunter, on charges concerning taxes and guns. \u201cI love what you are doing. Keep doing it,\u201d Biden reportedly told Abbe Lowell, Hunter\u2019s lawyer. Since then, Hunter has been convicted. Woodward also shows Biden lamenting picking Merrick Garland, the man overseeing such prosecutions, as attorney general.</p> <p>Trump, though, is in Woodward\u2019s eyes \u201cthe wrong man for the presidency \u2026 unfit to lead the country\u201d, far worse than Nixon, \u201cthe most reckless and impulsive president in American history\u201d.</p> <p>And all the while, on the campaign trail, Trump rages on. \u201cI am your warrior. I am your justice,\u201d he tells supporters. \u201cFor those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\u201d Mark Milley, chair of the joint chiefs of staff under Trump and Biden, now retired, tells Woodward he fears being court-martialed if Trump returns to power.</p> <p>\u201cHe is a walking, talking advertisement of what he\u2019s going to try to do,\u201d Milley warns. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it and it\u2019s not just him, it\u2019s the people around him.\u201d Woodward quotes Bannon: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna hold him accountable.\u201d</p> <p>The culture wars burn. All eyes are on the southern border. Abortion rights may not be the Democrats\u2019 silver bullet. Harris falters. Obama is back on the campaign trail, to bolster a sagging ticket. Less than a month before election day, a second Trump term looms large. In the battleground states that will decide the election, he may carve out a victory.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>War is</em> <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/war-bob-woodward/21702320?ean=9781668052273\">published in the US</a></em> <em>by Simon &amp; Schuster</em></p></li> </ul>",

War depicts an administration under Joe Biden that is often behind the curve, at times captive to its own wishful thinking. The withdrawal from Afghanistan haunts. Trump mesmerizes. Yet as Woodward tells it, Biden and his team did clearly see the menace Russia posed. Unlike George W Bush, Biden did not need to gaze into Vladimir Putin\u2019s blighted soul. Unlike Trump, he did not feel compelled to fluff his ego like a besotted fanboy. True to form, Woodward gets his sources to talk. \u201cAll interviews were conducted under the journalist ground rule of \u2018deep background\u2019,\u201d he notes. Unless the source agreed to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s still a mystery to me how he deals with Putin and what he says to Putin,\u201d Dan Coats, director of national intelligence under Trump, says of his former boss. \u201cIs it blackmail?\u201d There\u2019s something there, Coats is sure. In the fall of 2021, the Biden administration concluded that Russia would soon invade Ukraine. They had the intelligence to prove it. They mounted a full-court press. On the front pages of the Washington Post, they laid out what was coming. They warned and later armed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite his initial skepticism, and they rallied the west. \u201cYou have no reason to invade Ukraine,\u201d Boris Johnson, then British prime minister, told Putin in October 2021, according to Woodward. Woodward also says Johnson called Putin a \u201csmall, puckish lowlife\u201d, for whatever that is worth. The Biden administration looked further afield. \u201cWe are highly confident Russia is going to do this,\u201d Kamala Harris told Emmanuel Macron, in November 2021. \u201cFrance is prepared to impose costs,\u201d the French president answered. \u201cI\u2019m on board for that.\u201d As war broke out, Germany announced that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project with Russia would not proceed. Woodward also quotes Biden sharply criticizing Barack Obama for a half-hearted response to earlier Russian aggression. \u201cThey fucked up in 2014,\u201d Woodward quotes the president telling a friend, of the year of the annexation of Crimea. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here \u2026 Barack never took Putin seriously \u2026 We gave Putin a license to continue! Well, I\u2019m revoking his fucking license!\u201d Predictably, Trump and his minions hold a different view of Putin. \u201cThis is genius,\u201d the once and possibly future president said, after Putin declared regions of Ukraine independent, on top of invading them. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who\u2019s very savvy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know him very well. Very, very well.\u201d Woodward also reminds readers that after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, Trump heaped praise on another terror group, calling Hezbollah \u201cvery smart\u201d and Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s defense minister, a \u201cjerk\u201d. At a recent speech in Detroit, Trump delivered a shout-out to Massad Boulos, father-in-law of Tiffany Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter from his second marriage. Boulos, a Lebanese Christian, is reportedly aligned with Hezbollah. Having run unsuccessfully for a seat in Lebanon\u2019s parliament, he plays a role in Trump\u2019s Arab-American outreach. Back to Woodward\u2019s text. Over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Maga fell into line. \u201cThis is going to be old-school original gangster,\u201d said Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and White House strategist, now close to finishing a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson minimized the invasion as a \u201cmere border dispute\u201d. On the Middle East, Woodward writes of a cacophony of wrath, relations between Washington and Jerusalem strained, even as the US supplies ammunition, aid and backup at the UN. Early on, Woodward writes, Biden branded Benjamin Netanyahu as a \u201cbad fucking guy\u201d \u2013 a story initially denied by the White House. Woodward portrays Biden and advisers as more myopic when it comes to domestic events, misjudging their mandate and the mood of the country. Woodward also says Biden kept close tabs on the government prosecution of his son, Hunter, on charges concerning taxes and guns. \u201cI love what you are doing. Keep doing it,\u201d Biden reportedly told Abbe Lowell, Hunter\u2019s lawyer. Since then, Hunter has been convicted. Woodward also shows Biden lamenting picking Merrick Garland, the man overseeing such prosecutions, as attorney general. Trump, though, is in Woodward\u2019s eyes \u201cthe wrong man for the presidency \u2026 unfit to lead the country\u201d, far worse than Nixon, \u201cthe most reckless and impulsive president in American history\u201d. And all the while, on the campaign trail, Trump rages on. \u201cI am your warrior. I am your justice,\u201d he tells supporters. \u201cFor those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\u201d Mark Milley, chair of the joint chiefs of staff under Trump and Biden, now retired, tells Woodward he fears being court-martialed if Trump returns to power. \u201cHe is a walking, talking advertisement of what he\u2019s going to try to do,\u201d Milley warns. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it and it\u2019s not just him, it\u2019s the people around him.\u201d Woodward quotes Bannon: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna hold him accountable.\u201d The culture wars burn. All eyes are on the southern border. Abortion rights may not be the Democrats\u2019 silver bullet. Harris falters. Obama is back on the campaign trail, to bolster a sagging ticket. Less than a month before election day, a second Trump term looms large. In the battleground states that will decide the election, he may carve out a victory.

      "body": "<p>Halfway through his new memoir, Al Pacino recalls a crisis that unfolded on the set of <em>The Godfather </em>while filming in Sicily. Pacino was shooting a wedding scene with the actor Simonetta Stefanelli, and at one point director Francis Ford Coppola asked him to speak to the local people who were forming part of the background. But none of these extras understood English, and Pacino, despite growing up in an Italian household in New York, didn\u2019t quite speak the language of his grandparents. Later, Coppola asked the bride and the groom to dance a waltz together, but Pacino again pleaded incompetence. Towards the end of the scene, the couple were supposed to drive away in a car, but Pacino, ever the New Yorker, didn\u2019t know how to drive. It was at this moment that Coppola ran out of patience with his male lead. \u201cWhy did I ever hire you?\u201d he&nbsp;shouted at Pacino. \u201cWhat can you&nbsp;do?\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Coppola\u2019s question propels Pacino all through <em>Sonny Boy</em>.

      "body": "<p>The actor and singer Mitzi Gaynor, best remembered as the star of the 1958 film musical South Pacific, began her showbiz career as an ingenue \u2013 the young, pretty female stock character whose marriage ends old-style comedies: the audience never gets to see her grow into a woman. And a bubbly ingenue Gaynor remained throughout a long performing life, still working her adorability when she made her Manhattan cabaret debut at Feinstein\u2019s in 2010 at 78.</p> <p>Gaynor, who has died aged 93, had talent. Her speaking tended to the cute, though she had enough belt as a singer to be plausibly cast into the vaudeville family of There\u2019s No Business Like Show Business (1954), as Ethel Merman\u2019s daughter \u2013 they duetted brassily.

And a bubbly ingenue Gaynor remained throughout a long performing life, still working her adorability when she made her Manhattan cabaret debut at Feinstein\u2019s in 2010 at 78. Gaynor, who has died aged 93, had talent. Her speaking tended to the cute, though she had enough belt as a singer to be plausibly cast into the vaudeville family of There\u2019s No Business Like Show Business (1954), as Ethel Merman\u2019s daughter \u2013 they duetted brassily.

There is a metric specifically designed to tell us which team deserves to win a match \u2013 it\u2019s better known as \u201cthe score\u201d \u2013 and these results are then collated into a precise overall ranking which brooks no argument. It sounds simple because it is.</p> <p>And yet! Wolves, the aforementioned table tells us, are the second-worst team in it, their one point from seven games two fewer than Crystal Palace who sit above them and the same as Southampton who lie below. But the sense persists that they aren\u2019t, or at least shouldn\u2019t be that bad, and as such Gary O\u2019Neil is under severe pressure.</p> <p>He will not expect any favours from Manchester City. Just as Wolves are more than a number in a column so too are the champions, the relentless accumulation of the early Guardiola years replaced by the sinister certainty that will do that whatever it takes to finish one place above their nearest challenger. And with Arsenal having been beaten yesterday, they will know that today offers them the opportunity to emphasise that punishing reality.</p> <p>Wolves, though, have the tools to trouble them \u2013 particularly in midfield, where their drive and physicality can make things uncomfortable for any team, never mind one still working out how to cope without the best midfielder in the world. If they can start quickly and defend properly, this could be an intense and competitive contest; if they cannot, they are in even more trouble than the league table suggests.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 2pm BST</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our match report\u2026 \u2026which means we\u2019re finished here. Of course, you\u2019ll want to join Niall Mcveigh for Liverpool v Chelsea, but otherwise, it\u2019s goodbye from me; peace out. We said earlier than even if Wolves were to lose today, they could get their season going with a good performance, and they delivered one this afternoon. In defence, they were solid, disciplined and compact while, going forward, though they struggled to attack as often as they\u2019d like, when they were able to counter, they were a threat. If they maintain that standard, they\u2019ll be fine this season. City were really poor today, unusually stodgy in attack. But they got it done, and will know how much their win will have disappointed Arsenal and Liverpool, the latter now having to get their heads straight for a big game against an in-form opponent. They don\u2019t look as good a side as previously, but I\u2019m not sure those around them have the minerals or quality to better thsm over 38 games. So City return to the top of the table \u2013 where they\u2019ll stay should Liverpool fail to beat Chelsea \u2013 while Wolves move from second-bottom to bottom, now below Southampton on goal difference. Make up your own mind. This is the law: A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched* by a team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by: interfering with play by playing or touching a ball passed or touched by a team-mate or interfering with an opponent by: preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent\u2019s line of vision or challenging an opponent for the ball or clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball I\u2019ve no idea how we can say the final of these caveats wasn\u2019t met. Looking at the goal yet again, Bernardo backs into the keeper such that Sa shoves him away then, when the header comes in, Bernardo ducks underneath it. I\u2019ve no idea how the ref can look at the footage and deduce that there was nothing done to impact the keeper\u2019s ability to make the save. City find a way! Of course they do! 90+8 min it was, by the way, a really good header, Stones peeling away to retrieve the ball from behind him and power home. 90+8 min Someone on the Wolves bench is booked, and I\u2019m certain Gary O\u2019Neil will have some thoughts about this. 90+8 min But the goal stands! It turns out that the linesman flagged to disallow it, but the ref decided Bernardo wasn\u2019t interfering with play after assessing the footage. 90+7 min The ref is called to the screen and we know what that usually means\u2026 90+6 min But was Bernardo Silva offside? He\u2019s in front of the keeper and certainly in an offside position, but was he interfering with play? I don\u2019t think so\u2026. City find a way! Foden crosses to the front post, Stones is up well, and he punishes a header into the net! He\u2019s saved City late again! 90+5 min City win a corner down the right, Foden to take. This must surely be their last chance\u2026 90+4 min Better from City, Guedes outmuscled before Gundogan finds Haaland at inside-right, the ball making its way over to Nunes on the opposite side of the box. He dips inside as Molineux holds its breath, exhaling in collective relief when his shot goes wide. 90+2 min City have lacked snap in their passing today, which makes sense given the absence of their two main tempo-setters, Rodri and De Bruyne. Without them, Bernardo Silva is far less effective, receiving the ball later and under more pressure than he\u2019d like. And, though he\u2019s a brilliant player, he\u2019s not a transcendental one. 90 min We\u2019ll have a minimum of five added minutes. If City survive them, they\u2019ll set a new club record of 31 league games undefeated. 90 min Another change for Wolves, Bellegarde replacing joao Gomes \u2013 who\u2019s played well. 89 min Grealish wanders down the left and pokes infield, where Bernardo lashes into the near-post side-netting. 88 min City win a corner down the left and Dawson does enough to make first contact, the ball then laid back for Grealish, Sa scrambling to field his low scuffer. 87 min Coming up next and live now: 86 min City replace Kovacic with Nunes, who gets the expected stick off home fans nauseated by how publicly he agitated for a moves there from Wolves. He\u2019s a much better player than he\u2019s so far shown at the Etihad, and must be hoping that Rodri\u2019s absence will allow him more chances to establish himself. 84 min Lewis inverts and slides a pass in behind for Haaland, who might leather it first-time but instead takes a touch, which allows Dawson to make the challenge. 82 min City are properly missing Kevin de Bruyne, whose crossing would\u2019ve been very useful today. But back to those on the pitch, Grealish cuts back for Foden, whose low shot hits Lewis\u2019 heels and bounces to safety. 81 min City find Grealish but to feet, so Semedo stands him up then blocks him off. 81 min Check it: 79 min Strand Larsen has cramp, so after addressing the immediate pain he\u2019s replaced by Goncalo Guedes. 78 min If I was Pep Guardiola, I\u2019d be telling my players to get Grealish one on one with Semedo. If he can commit his man, there\u2019s every chance he picks a pass or nicks a penalty. 77 min How on earth is Scott Carson still on the City bench? Does Richard Wright still play for Arsenal? 75 min Nunes was readying himself to come on, but Bernardo wants to continue. 74 min Grealish curls to the far post where Bernardo heads back as Foden volleys him in the swede. He\u2019s bleeding, so there\u2019s a pause while he\u2019s treated. 74 min Another change for City, Grealish replacing Savinho \u2013 who looks a talent, but lacks end product. 72 min City\u2019s passing \u201cin and around\u201d the box hasn\u2019t been as slick as you\u2019d expect it to be. If they can get the one-touch stuff going, they can move Wolves around, but they\u2019ve not really tried \u2013 they\u2019ve been far too laboured and predictable in possession. 70 min One way of beating a massed defence is running at it and Bernardo picks a way through three men before poking square \u2013 behind Haaland but finding Savinho, who curls over the top. 69 min \u201cI vaguely remember reading how in the ballet community, the go-to for a quick sugar rush was a spoonful of honey,\u201d says Eric Peterson. \u201cNatural, predigested courtesy of our bee friends, quickly bioavailable, doesn\u2019t fill you up. Somebody correct me on this before AI gets a hold of what I\u2019ve just typed and starts preaching it as gospel.\u201d But not much fun. 67 min And immediately Forbs is into the action, Doyle bursting over halfway and sliding a ball in behind. But after drawing men to him, Forbs can\u2019t quite pick out Strand Larsen alongside him. Warning for City, though. 67 min A change apiece, City sending on Foden for Doku and Wolves trying Forbs for Cunha. 66 min Doku, who\u2019ll make way for Foden, has one last go at Ait-Nouri, who again slides in to win a challenge. 64 min Phil Foden has been waiting to come on for well over five minutes now. 63 min Yet more outrage as Joao Gomes is booked for wrestling Kovacic \u2013 who does well to avoid similar punishment. Gundogan\u2019s free-kick is then blocked behind, before another wasted corner buys hands Wolves some respite. 61 min Nice feet from Kovacic on the edge, taking the ball away from Lemina, who\u2019s outraged when penalised after extending a leg and bringing his man down. Free-kick City inside the D\u2026 60 min \u201cI am hardly an example of healthy eating, just ask my doctor and my near-death experiences,\u201d says Mary Waltz.\u201d I am getting better but I give into lovely sugar-based desserts and there is no such thing as healthy sweets. But when you say \u2018the Strawberry Element\u2019 I feel compelled to be a boring, annoying nag. It isn\u2019t even remotely \u2018strawberry\u2019. It\u2019s chemicals and corn syrup. Go for the real, don\u2019t succumb to the corporate synthetic alternative. Indulge your urges with quality.\u201d I enjoy the best and the worst. I think that\u2019s fair. 59 min City win a corner down the left, Savinho swinging out and prompting minor panic as the ball drops, Sa doing well to smother with Gvardiol once again on the scene. 57 min Yup, Haaland pulls on to Totti, Savinho espying a potential mismatch and coaxing a cross-kick towards the back post. But Totti isn\u2019t cowed, leaping to head away; Wolves\u2019 defensive discipline has been excellent so far. 56 min Ait-Nouri carries forward and has Cunha alongside, sliding a pass infield and into stride. Cunha controls on the run, has a look, and smacks yet another low curler just wide of the post. 54 min City work space for Dias, picked out on the edge of the box, where he punches a low curler; again, Sa watches it well, tipping around the post before Doku thrashes a shot wide when the corner reaches him. 53 min Haaland has touched the ball just eight times so far today. I wonder if he might pull wider to try and find space, because centrally, he\u2019s struggling to find advantages positions. 51 min Again, Gvardiol muscles down the left, Doyle heading his cross behind. He\u2019s been excellent today and I\u2019d not be surprised to see the corner directed towards him. Nope, Gundogan seeks Haaland beyond the back post, where he\u2019s easily crowded out. 49 min And there it is, Savinho using the natural width he now gives his side to diddle Semedo on the outside, Gundogan touching on and Haaland barely connecting with a fairy elephant\u2019s backheel. 48 min We wondered if they might do it from the start and they didn\u2019t, but City have now got Savinho on the left and Doku on the right, presumably looking to stretch the play and pick spaces between Wolves\u2019 wing-backs and outside centre-backs. 47 min City have made 218 successful final-third passes to Wolves\u2019 five. And yet the match is level because Wolves deserve it to be; football is great. 46 min Wolves send on Doyle for Andre. 46 min We go again\u2026 \u201cCereal is the quintessential football food,\u201d reckons Sh\u00e1h\u00edn Houshidari. \u201cHighlight of the weekend as a kid was recording Match Of The Day on a tape on a Saturday night, and then watching it back in the early hours of Sunday morning over a bowl of Cheerios. Each crunch of a sugar-y cardboard capsule is worth every last empty calorie, if for only a second clawed back and spent in recollection. Discounting even that, I maintain a mug of cereal is the perfect price/performance pre-run snack.\u201d It\u2019s also a tremendous late-evening snack, facilitating self-loathing and self-loving in equal measure. Half-time email: \u201cIf you cereal naysayers are so clever,\u201d posits N Chide, where am I going to get my recommended daily allowance of riboflavin huh, HUH? Answer me that.\u201d Exactly \u2013 to say nothing of the world\u2019s finest breakfast crockery. Half-time entertainment: Wolves have executed their gameplan to perfection but City have so many wats to score, hence we\u2019re level at the break. 46+2 min Bernardo robs Andre inside the box and feeds back to Lewis; he moves the ball across the face of the box to Savinho, who opens his body, curls low and hard through a crowd of players \u2026 and Sa plunges late, a solid hand making a save that was much better than it first looked. 45 min City win a corner as we\u2019re advised that we\u2019ll have two additional minutes; again, Wolves clear easily enough before Semedo overhits a pass out to Cunha with the counter on. 44 min \u201cI\u2019m with Mary,\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cYou might as well eat the packaging for all the good you get from the contents, and there\u2019d be more fibre. If you really need a sugar fix you should stick to melon and grapes, I once did a sales conference presentation with a bodybuilder on stage next to me and he was stuffing those down just before we went on as he reckoned they were the quickest way of getting sugar to your muscles. Or just eat a spoonful of sugar washed down with your iced milk and leave out the crap.\u201d I dunno \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever abandon the occasional nutritionally questionable treat, and it\u2019s the strawberry aspect that intrigues me here, not the sugar. 43 min Wolves are penned inside their own half now, every man behind the ball such that when they clear, City can retrieve and build again. 41 min \u201cDoing some mother-sitting here waiting for the other match,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cand wonder, with City having been thus far described as a \u2018machine\u2019 whether their football is enjoyable. For me they are obviously hyper-gifted but unwatchable and thus the Steve Smith of teams.\u201d I prefer this iteration of them to the first Guardiola side because they\u2019ve a bit more physical power \u2013 but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re as good. 39 min Lemina and Gomes combine to rob Savinho and find Cunha, who takes the ball adroitly on the half-turn, only for Savinho to foul him; he\u2019s booked. 38 min Doku slides a pass inside, meeting the run of Gvardiol, who powers into the box and might shoot, but instead tries a cut-back that\u2019s intercepted. He\u2019s been City\u2019s best attacker so far \u2013 by a street. 37 min \u201cGood morning from Pittsburgh!\u201d begins Eric Peterson. \u201cHow much better Wolves are than their table position is being grossly understated. After next Saturday against Brighton, they\u2019ll have nine games under their belt, and every one of the current top eight except for Tottenham will have been among them. Based on their form through the season so far against the league behemoths, it\u2019ll be no surprise at all to me if they leave the relegation zone in the dust before they play Spurs after Christmas.\u201d Yup, I agree. I like Gary O\u2019Neil, and I think this 3-5-2 suits them much better than the 4-3-3 they\u2019ve been using prior to today. 35 min We said earlier that Gvardiol is developing into a really good player, and he\u2019s scoring goals like that too often for it to be a streak. It\u2019s City\u2019s seventh from outside the box so far this season, which sounds like the opposite of Guardiolisme but actually shows the freedom his players have within the structure. City are struggling to pick Wolves apart so Gvardiol takes matters into his own hands, picking up a pass from Doku and shifting it to open a shooting lane before unfurling a glorious curler which Sa can only palm into the roof. 30 min Doku is so explosive from a standing start, and he scavenges a yard off Semedo, drilling an instacross that catches Haaland on his heels. So Wolves clear again and, well though they\u2019ve defended, City have asked of them few taxing questions. Ans as I type, Lemina slides an interception behind before another poor corner sees Dawson head clear with Bernardo then penalised for a foul. 29 min \u201cOh how I love these moments,\u201d says Karen Asad. \u201cA breath of hope hoping that City will lose. Of course, we\u2019ve seen that movie one too many times and we all know City\u2019s gonna hit five [at the least] with Haaland bagging a hat-trick. And Daniel, please stick to those green juices.\u201d Ha! I have largely broken my complex and profound sugar addiction but if it\u2019s in you it\u2019s in you. 28 min Bernardo slams a low cross across the face \u2026 and Toti clears. 27 min \u2026and Bueno heads out. He\u2019s made a very assured start. 26 min Doku shapes outside then slips outside Joao Gomes, who extends a leg to concede a free-kick near the left corner of the box. Gundogan will swing in\u2026 25 min Savinho spreads to Doku, who goes back to Kovacic \u2026 and Wolves again block them off, Joao Gomes eventually robbing Doku to the delight of the home support. 23 min What a beautiful beginning for Wolves,\u201d returns Mary Waltz. \u201cCould this be the beginning of their PL resurrection? Good on Wolves but the City machine will eventually grind them into the pitch.\u201d Perhaps, but it\u2019s worth noting that Wolves have had a really difficult start having lost Max Kilman and Neto, their two best players. Even if they lose today, a good performance might still get their season going. 22 min The Sa save from Gundogan aside, City haven\u2019t threatened. But, as I type, Gvardiol comes inside to tease a cunning cross to the far post \u2026 which drifts behind. He is developing into a very serious player. 21 min Ait-Nouri and Semedo haul Savinho back; the latter is booked. 19 min Lovely from Wolves, Cunha into Strand Larsen, pulling left inside his own half. He then turns a first-time return-pass into stride and Cunha slides a terrific ball through the middle for the charging Semedo. But he never looks in total control of himself, all the more so once he feels Gvardiol\u2019s hot breath on his cold neck, and Ederson comes out well to smother an effort that\u2019s neither dink nor slot. 17 min Bernardo is starting to influence the game, taking a pass from Gvardiol and pinching a yard inside the box \u2026 only for the ball to rear up and hit his hand. 16 min More City possession, but Joao Gomes does really well against Doku, winning his challenge and clearing. 15 min Savinho takes the kick left-footed \u2026 and directs it into the foot of one of the two City players obstructing the wall\u2019s sightline. 14 min Totti stands on the ball and slips, so Savinho pounces, nicking it away and wearing the inevitable foul. Totti is booked and City have a free-kick 20 yards out, right of centre. 12 min \u201cMorning greetings from California,\u201d begins Mary Waltz. \u201cRegarding Kellogs Cereal: hey, eat what you want, But why fool yourself calling these various products cereal, as if they have some nutritional value. If you want to start your day with a massive sugar rush I say have a chocolate pastry, a hot chocolate, or a coffee explosion with sugar and caffeine. Or any combination. Tastes far better than cardboard topped with sugar.\u201d I have them very rarely, but cardboard topped with sugar topped with ice-cold milk is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures. 11 min Looking at the goal again, Stones totally loses Strand Larsen \u2013 as we said he might. Though he\u2019s excellent on the ball, he lacks nous and physicality \u2013 and Wolves have the tools to exploit that. 9 min Back come City immediately, Savio finding Gundogan, who finds Bernardo who shoots from the edge \u2026 but Sa palms away on the dive. Who didn\u2019t see this one coming?! A fine clip out wide from Bueno sends Semedo moving forward, no one anywhere near him, and he arcs a gorgeous low cross into Strand Larsen\u2019s path, City\u2019s back four all over the show. The finish, though, is harder than it looks, the ball rushing away from the striker, but he punches home nicely and Wolves have the lead! 5 min Wolves clear the corner easily enough, but City collects possession and keep them boxed, Gundogan prompting with a give-and-go. And again, though Wolves avert immediate danger, City go at them again, Doku cutting in off the left, playing a one-two off Gundogan, whose backheel sets him for a shot \u2026 which he slides wide and plenty. 4 min City move the ball from side to side, Savinho \u2013 starting on the right \u2013 looking to at Ait-Nouri on the outside. But the defender stands up well, then slides in to concede a corner. 2 min \u201cWhile Wolves is bad,\u201d writes Adam Griffiths, \u201cyou do at least get to see the pitch. Newcastle (never ending stairs, better view of the city than the pitch, need binoculars to see anything) and Everton (pillars! More pillars! Pillars everywhere blocking the view) are much worserer.\u201d I love Goodison \u2013 you can just move to avoid the pillars \u2013 but yep, Newcastle is miserable. I thought they\u2019d been made to change it as away fans are now meant to be pitchside, but that\u2019s not in fact the case. 1 min Away we go! For those watching in black and white, City are in the burgundy shirts. The players take the knee. Our teams are tunnelled \u2026 and here they come! Email \u201cWill City target Ait-Nouri?\u201d wonders Gary Stover. I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s today, or as a left-back for the future. I fear Wolves may struggle to hang on to him in January, but I\u2019d not be surprised to see the space behind him targeted. Hivemind: has anyone tried these and if so, are they any use? Also going on: Is Molineux the worst away end in the league? Shallow and down the entire side of the pitch, I contend that it is. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how the midfield battle goes. Lemina, Andre and Gomes will want to make the battle a physical one, because Gundogan and Silva, wonderful though they are, are underpowered. They could well pass their way through Wolves nevertheless, but it won\u2019t be easy. I know O\u2019Neil has gone 3-5-2 to restrict space for City, but I wonder if a tight defensive block might also be a good way to counteract the threat of Erling Haaland, one man able to mark, one to mark the space and the other to troubleshoot. If Wolves keep a low block, Haaland will have to come short to get on the ball, and that is far from his best asset. A potential template for Wolves might be Newcastle, whose muscular, enterprising style regularly causes City grief. Of course, Newcastle have better players, but their ability to make every contest physical is one that Wolves can imitate. Guardiola says that Walker came back from the break injured, so hasn\u2019t travelled. But he\u2019s glad to play on Sunday, as it means his players, the Brazilians in particular, have had an extra day to get ready, which is why Savinho starts. Where is the game? Wolves will look to bottle up the middle of the pitch, forcing City to go around rather than through them; I imagine that\u2019s why Guardiola has picked wingers not wide attackers \u2013 for that reason, I wonder if Doku and Savio will play on their natural sides. Otherwise, the home side\u2019s front two might also pose a threat \u2013 Cunha looks a potentially taxing match-up for Stones, while Strand Larsen is a threat in behind, all the more so given the lack of pace in the centre of City\u2019s back four. Talking of City, they welcome back Nathan Ak\u00e9 \u2013 he\u2019s on the bench \u2013 as is Manuel Akanji, who picked up a minor knock on international duty. As such, Stones comes in at centre-back, while Jeremy Doku and Savinho are handed starts on the wings, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish kept in reserve. O\u2019Neil is, of course, without Yerson Mosquera, Sasa Kalajdzic, Enso Gonz\u00e1lez, Bastein Meupiyou, Boubacar Traor\u00e9 \u2013 and now Hwang Hee-chan, injured playing for South Korea and out for around a month. Consequently, Matheus Cunha and J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen start up front, and have the ability to give John Stones and Ruben Dias a testing afternoon. O\u2019Neil tells Sky that Sam Johnstone got injured in training, so Jos\u00e9 Sa comes in \u2013 and has been pushing for selection. Morale, he says is fine \u2013 Wolves have had a tough run of fixtures and generally played well, though the effort last time out, against Brentford, was unacceptable. Though today is a hard game, they believe they can turn things around and, having won this fixture last year, they know what\u2019s required and how well they have to play to win. Otherwise, he\u2019s taking the risk out of the buildup because his players don\u2019t need complexity currently, but that\u2019s not why he\u2019s gone to five at the back \u2013 he\u2019s always done that against City. Finally, he\u2019s not bothered about Guardiola or any other manager saying Wolves are good \u2013 they just need to play well. Wolverhampton Wanderers: (3-5-2) Sa; Bueno, Dawson, Gomes T; Semedo, Gomes J, Andr\u00e9, Lemina, Ait-Nouri; Cunha, Larsen. Subs: Bentley, Doherty, R Gomes, Doyle, Sarabia, Forbs, Bellegarde, Guedes, Lima. Manchester City (4-1-4-1): Ederson; Lewis, Stones, Dias, Gvardiol; Kovacic; S\u00e1vio, Gundogan, Bernardo, Doku; Haaland. Subs: Ortega Moreno, Carson, Ake, Grealish, Akanji, Nunes, Foden, O\u2019Reilly, McAtee. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Manchester) That the league table doesn\u2019t lie is one of football\u2019s truest truisms. There is a metric specifically designed to tell us which team deserves to win a match \u2013 it\u2019s better known as \u201cthe score\u201d \u2013 and these results are then collated into a precise overall ranking which brooks no argument. It sounds simple because it is. And yet! Wolves, the aforementioned table tells us, are the second-worst team in it, their one point from seven games two fewer than Crystal Palace who sit above them and the same as Southampton who lie below. But the sense persists that they aren\u2019t, or at least shouldn\u2019t be that bad, and as such Gary O\u2019Neil is under severe pressure. He will not expect any favours from Manchester City. Just as Wolves are more than a number in a column so too are the champions, the relentless accumulation of the early Guardiola years replaced by the sinister certainty that will do that whatever it takes to finish one place above their nearest challenger. And with Arsenal having been beaten yesterday, they will know that today offers them the opportunity to emphasise that punishing reality. Wolves, though, have the tools to trouble them \u2013 particularly in midfield, where their drive and physicality can make things uncomfortable for any team, never mind one still working out how to cope without the best midfielder in the world. If they can start quickly and defend properly, this could be an intense and competitive contest; if they cannot, they are in even more trouble than the league table suggests. Kick-off: 2pm BST",

Allies of the deputy prime minister had shared concerns she was being sidelined when it emerged two weeks ago that she had been given only a temporary place on the committee that brings together ministers with military and intelligence chiefs. However, the Guardian understands she has now been made a permanent member of the NSC, which discusses and assesses the biggest threats facing Britain, as part of a concerted effort driven by the new No 10 chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, to bolster her position. Starmer has also strengthened the \u201cquad\u201d of his most senior ministers to become a proper steering group for the government\u2019s agenda, insiders said. As well as Rayner, it includes Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Pat McFadden, the senior cabinet office minister. In another move to shore up the deputy prime minister, she will more formally and routinely deputise for Starmer, for example by standing in at prime minister\u2019s questions this week, while he is away in Samoa at a Commonwealth heads of government summit. Downing Street hopes the changes will reassure the deputy prime minister, and her allies in the Labour party and across the union movement, that she has Starmer\u2019s full support, after reports of continuing tensions between the pair. A No 10 source said: \u201cKeir respects Angela and wants to make sure that is recognised more widely in government.\u201d Others downplayed suggestions that Rayner and other cabinet ministers writing to Starmer to protest at cuts to their departments, set to be unveiled at next week\u2019s budget, was anything other than part of the normal process. A second government source said: \u201cNobody on either side wants any more drama.\u201d There has long been speculation among some of those around Starmer over his deputy\u2019s own motives, with suspicions that she could be on manoeuvres to be in prime position to take over from him at some point in the future. Her allies said the latest changes were led by No 10 itself after the promotion of McSweeney, and should be seen as an attempt to better manage the relationship between Starmer and one of his most powerful ministers. Officials said that while Sue Gray, McSweeney\u2019s predecessor as chief of staff, had been supportive of Rayner personally and of her role in principle, that did not always transfer into practice, with promises not always being delivered on.

      "body": "<p>Fleur Adcock, who has died aged 90, was one of the best loved and most esteemed poets in Britain and New Zealand. The full span of her work from 1960 until 2024 was published earlier this year in a 600-page volume of collected poems to coincide with her 90th birthday. She also translated Latin and Romanian verse, and edited The Oxford Book of Contemporary New Zealand Poetry (1982) and The Faber Book of Twentieth Century Women\u2019s Poetry (1987).</p> <p>Fleur\u2019s deceptively relaxed conversational style is often barbed with an oblique take on reality.

She was an influence on a younger generation of poets that included Duffy, Carol Rumens, <a href=\"https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poet/vicki-feaver/\">Vicki Feaver</a> and Jo Shapcott, especially in writing about subjects such as smoking, celibacy, old age, masturbation, illness and bereavement, and thus opening up new topics for poetry.</p> <p>There were some risqu\u00e9 tongue-in-cheek poems acclaiming the solo woman, like Smokers for Celibacy (1991), which concludes \u201cAltogether, we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that sex is a drag. / Just give us a fag\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Fleur Adcock, who has died aged 90, was one of the best loved and most esteemed poets in Britain and New Zealand. The full span of her work from 1960 until 2024 was published earlier this year in a 600-page volume of collected poems to coincide with her 90th birthday. She also translated Latin and Romanian verse, and edited The Oxford Book of Contemporary New Zealand Poetry (1982) and The Faber Book of Twentieth Century Women\u2019s Poetry (1987). Fleur\u2019s deceptively relaxed conversational style is often barbed with an oblique take on reality. As the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy said: \u201cThe sharper edge of her talent is encountered like a razor blade in a peach.\u201d Her poetry deals with life\u2019s surprises and oddities, the unexpected or unexplained that can cut the ground from beneath your feet.

A letter sent to the chancellor by a leading health charity, thinktanks and the body that represents accountants says carving out a new category of preventive spending would mean a healthier population and save the NHS money. The letter, seen by the Guardian, welcomes Labour\u2019s emphasis on prevention but says there has been a long history of previous administrations making similar pledges only for services that affect health outcomes to become a casualty of pressures on day-to-day budgets and a victim of short-term thinking. Analysis by the Health Foundation \u2013 one of the signatories to the letter \u2013 showed that in the five years leading up to the pandemic (2014-19) spending on hospitals rose by 10%.

Anita Charlesworth, the Health Foundation\u2019s chief economist, said there needed to be a shift \u201cso we are spending more on prevention and less of failure\u201d. Charlesworth said that a report by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility on the fiscal risks facing the UK had found that extra spending on prevention would lead to increased spending on the state pension but higher tax revenues, lower spending on welfare and less pressure on the NHS budget. \u201cA healthier population would be really beneficial to the public finances,\u201d she said.

I\u2019d even hear this from Black people themselves, and I just thought: \u2018Where is this idea coming from?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Mesfin, who is from Ethiopia but has lived in California for 28 years, said the impetus to make Wade in the Water came from such memories, and the discovery of writings by Kevin Dawson, a surfer, academic and the author of Undercurrents of Power: Aquatic Culture in the African Diaspora. \u201cReading his work about surfing happening in West Africa hundreds of years ago, I was hooked,\u201d Mesfin, who is already working on a follow-up documentary, recalled. \u201cI needed to examine why Black Americans have lost the connection to [surfing] and I wanted to do something to inspire people to take it back.\u201d</p> <h2>Surfing\u2019s whitewashed history</h2> <p>If you\u2019ve ever watched the canonical surf film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZsuQXKkPdw\">The Endless Summer</a>, you see Hollywood\u2019s whitewashing and western gaze at work, suggesting that surfing was introduced to West Africa by some blonde Californians in the 1960s.</p> <p>Dawson, the African diasporic cultural studies scholar, features heavily in Mesfin\u2019s film, does not hold back on assessing The Endless Summer. \u201cThat depiction is a myth, it is a fabrication, a white saviour narrative that really took hold in 20th century surf culture and has been hard to shake ever since,\u201d Dawson said.</p> <p>In his work with historical archives, Dawson came across the first written account of activities like surfing from Africa. In 1640, a German merchant-adventurer described how parents around Ghana would \u201ctie their children to boards and throw them into the water\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To make change, we have to be seen in the water, we have to show up</p> <footer> <cite>Esabella Bonner, founder of Black Surf Santa Cruz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, in 1834, the British explorer James Alexander wrote of \u201cboys swimming in the sea with light boards under their stomachs\u201d who would wait \u201cfor a surf and [come] rolling like a cloud on top of it\u201d.</p> <p>Dawson\u2019s theory is that surfing evolved in Africa for pragmatic reasons.

In a matter of months my mother became unwell, I lost two of my closest relatives and my extended family became irreconcilably estranged. What had been a medium-sized family shrunk to a barely recognisable party of two \u2013 that is, if my mother pulled though.</p> <p>During this time I came to understand something that I had been shielded from as a child: relationships were inherently unstable, love would invariably turn to grief and loss was an undeniable fact of life. Indeed, loving and losing were fundamental terms of the human contract to which I was an unknowing signatory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/07/spirituality-is-the-shy-hope-in-my-heart-that-i-can-co-create-a-better-world\">Spirituality is the shy hope in my heart that I can co-create a better world | Jackie Bailey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/surviving-your-childs-adolescence/201002/the-disenchantment-of-adolescence\">disenchantment</a> set in, I developed a cautious view of human attachment. I held parts of myself back, worrying intimacy would backfire and that I would, again, risk insurmountable heartbreak. Of course, something intelligent was at play: the more I avoided connection, the less likely I was to suffer when relationships ended or change formed. I soon learned, however, that this was an unbearably narrow place to live from, a place that denied the breadth and striking dimensionality of human connection.</p> <p>Decades later, on my first month-long Buddhist <a href=\"https://www.lionsroar.com/buddhism/vipassana/\">Vipassana</a> retreat, I sobbed as memories of my relatives coursed through my meditation; not an uncommon experience within the container of silence. I never had said goodbye all those years ago. As the heart released, a tender and rounded sorrow took hold, and I began to soften.

      "bodyText": "Early in life I learned that we lose everyone we love. In a matter of months my mother became unwell, I lost two of my closest relatives and my extended family became irreconcilably estranged. What had been a medium-sized family shrunk to a barely recognisable party of two \u2013 that is, if my mother pulled though. During this time I came to understand something that I had been shielded from as a child: relationships were inherently unstable, love would invariably turn to grief and loss was an undeniable fact of life. Indeed, loving and losing were fundamental terms of the human contract to which I was an unknowing signatory. As disenchantment set in, I developed a cautious view of human attachment. I held parts of myself back, worrying intimacy would backfire and that I would, again, risk insurmountable heartbreak. Of course, something intelligent was at play: the more I avoided connection, the less likely I was to suffer when relationships ended or change formed. I soon learned, however, that this was an unbearably narrow place to live from, a place that denied the breadth and striking dimensionality of human connection. Decades later, on my first month-long Buddhist Vipassana retreat, I sobbed as memories of my relatives coursed through my meditation; not an uncommon experience within the container of silence. I never had said goodbye all those years ago. As the heart released, a tender and rounded sorrow took hold, and I began to soften. Perhaps the path back to connection could be found within the grief itself. Still, the question remained: how can we love fully in the face of inevitable loss? A modern Buddhist response hinges on releasing attachment, accepting change and opening to the radical suggestion that loss is not always as it seems. The Pulitzer prize-winning poet Mary Oliver captures something of this approach in her poem In Blackwater Woods. She writes: To live in this world you must be able to do three things: to love what is mortal; to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it; and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go. Oliver\u2019s evocation invites us to love with abandon, to release our fears and ultimately to let go when the time is right. It\u2019s a tall order yet it captures the delicacy and profundity of the dance we are part of so long as we love. In Buddhism there is an important distinction between love and attachment. Attachment can masquerade as love but seeks to control and possess. It grasps tightly and uses the beloved to selfishly serve its own desires. It places rigid expectations on the other and fails to see them for who they really are but rather what they can do for us. Love, on the other hand, is the genuine wish for another to be well and happy regardless of the circumstances. According to the Buddha, love is unconditional, promotes peace in the heart of the giver and receiver and encourages social harmony. It accepts circumstances as they are and does not seek to manipulate or change another. Love comes with an open hand. Our capacity for real love, as the Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg calls it, unfolds gradually over time and is proportionate to our willingness to loosen the grip of our attachment to our expectations of those around us. In extending this to loss, the art is to let go of what we had hoped for and let go into what we are given. In loss, we are gifted \u201ca box full of darkness\u201d, as Mary Oliver puts it. This is a strange and unwanted gift, yes, but accepting it can bring us back into connection. Later in my adult life I lost a best friend to an aggressive cancer. This time I trusted the fires of loss. A few weeks before her death I bought her a plate printed with images of frogs. She was whimsical and a lover of animals and I knew it would make her chuckle. Each day her carers used it for her meals. A few days after her death two frogs appeared on my front step. And on the day of her birthday I opened the front door to find yet another frog perched as though waiting to be welcomed inside. Some would say it was a coincidence, synchronicity at best, and perhaps they are right, but I took it as a cosmic wink, a strange gift that emerged from that box of darkness, a testament to our ongoing love, wrapped in a new form. To let go in love is to accept change, separation and heartbreak and to trust what is given \u2013 grief, sorrow and yearning \u2013 and know that this, too, is a facet of our human heart that can pave the way for a new and sublime form of kinship.

The report looked globally for polices that encouraged active transport, bringing all the knock-on benefits including reduced pollution, lower transport greenhouse gas emissions and improved physical and mental health. In Finland, France and Lithuania, people can get a rebate for scrapping old cars to help pay for e-bikes or public transport tickets. In the Netherlands, Belgium and France, there are tax rebates and or cash allowances for people who cycle to work. Other suggestions in the report include increasing funding for active transport to the equivalent of 10% of road-related expenditure (the UN has recommended 20%), legalising private e-scooters (now illegal in NSW) and making infrastructure safer for cyclists and public transport. National surveys of cycling rates show the percentage of people who use a bike either weekly, monthly or annually have dropped since 2011, outside a big increase during the pandemic \u2013 which Harrington suggests was because with fewer cars on the road, people felt safer to get on two wheels.

On 24 April this year, blood-drenched horses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2024/apr/24/multiple-people-injured-as-four-horses-escape-into-london-causing-chaos-video-report\">galloped</a> through rush-hour traffic in central London, smashing chaotically into a tourist bus and a taxi, before careening along pavements in blind panic. The horses, which serve in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment guarding the king, were on their daily morning exercises near Buckingham Palace when loud noises from a building site caused them to bolt and rampage through the capital for more than two hours. Six people were hospitalised with minor injuries, but all the horses survived in what seemed a once-in-a-lifetime event. Then, on 1 July, it happened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/01/military-horses-bolt-london-again-break-loose\">again</a>. Three regal horses bolted through Knightsbridge, this time fleeing a London bus.</p> <p>Having just published <em>Hoof Beats: How Horses Shaped Human History</em>, William T Taylor knows a thing or two about horses and he acknowledges the curiousness of the horses\u2019 escape when I call him at his home in Colorado. \u201cThe funny thing about our modern world is that horses are so deeply embedded in so much of our culture,\u201d he says. \u201cThat grew out of their role in things like transport, communication and agriculture. It\u2019s a powerful example, these military horses. It might take them escaping and running amok for us to think about it, but it has actually always struck me, when visiting London, just what a majestic and dangerous symbol of power and authority they represent.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and curator at the CU Museum of Natural History, explores the deep and ancient links between horse and human in forensic, academic, archaeological detail in his book. He plots the evolution of the horse from the extinction of the dinosaurs and the survival, at the time, of the tiny \u201cdawn horse\u201d \u2013 the size and shape of a puppy \u2013 which would evolve into the tall, long-legged, magnificent creatures we know today.</p> <p>Taylor comes from a long line of cowboys. His own choice of work, he says with a sigh, was inspired by an Indiana Jones video game. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a real cliche,\u201d he laughs. But it can also be seen as a lifelong quest to connect with his own past because he grew up in a house filled with western kitsch, dressed in cowboy kits at country fairs \u2013 and today he goes riding in Mongolia.</p> <p>He was recently left his grandfather\u2019s tack: saddle, bit, reins. </p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning, it didn\u2019t particularly mean a lot to me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as I got into this work and began exploring, one of the first things I did with my dissertation work in Mongolia was to begin to try to understand, how does this horse equipment work? What is it? I began to dive real deep into the basics of how different configurations of horse equipment work and what they might mean.</p> <p>\u201cAnd my grandfather\u2019s horse equipment setup tells me how he was a very direct communicator. This is a piece of my family heritage. I\u2019m trying to restore and revive some of that so that maybe I can actually end up using it myself. This might be a little silly and overly dramatic, but there\u2019s something special about connecting to the past through objects. And, of course, I would be a terrible archeologist if I didn\u2019t believe that!\u201d</p> <p>As we speak, Taylor, a lone-ranging bachelor, is preparing for a fresh field trip to Mongolia, where much of his research is carried out. His flight leaves in six hours, but he\u2019s well prepared: he\u2019s packing a full rucksack of coffee along with his GPS drones and several high-quality trowels. \u201cCoffee and trowels, man, I can get the rest there. But you can\u2019t get a decent coffee or a good trowel in Ulan Bator,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Mongolia is the focus for so much of his work, he explains, because it\u2019s one of the places where people and horses are closest today. \u201cMongolia is a place where almost the whole archaeological record is intertwined with horses in some important way, and significantly for <em>Hoof Beats</em>, the role of Mongolia in the human-horse story has been largely omitted from the story told so far,\u201d he says, pointing out that, even in 2024, there are more horses than humans in Mongolia.</p>    <p>Mongolia, a Buddhist nation between Russia and China, is perhaps most famous for the marauding horseback Mongol hordes led by warlord Genghis Khan in the 12th century. Khan commanded the largest land empire in human history, using vast and exclusively horseback armies of expert archers: they were the world\u2019s most mobile and deadly military unit.</p> <p>Khan united the nomadic tribes of the Mongolian Steppe and conquered much of central Asia and China. At their peak, the Mongols controlled an area about the size of Africa \u2013 thanks, in the main, to their deep knowledge of the horse. Khan\u2019s invasions were brutal and genocidal, but he also abolished torture, forged new trade routes and even created the first international postal system. It was an era of unprecedented globalisation: of ideas, objects, and people, all horse-powered.</p> <p>The connection between people and horses is among the most ancient connections that we have with the animal world, says Taylor. And some of these connections lie surprisingly close to home for many of us.</p> <p>In <em>Hoof Beats</em>, he details how a perfectly preserved stone age site, discovered in 1974 in the chalk cliffs of Boxgrove, Sussex, gives us evidence not only of the first human-horse contact in the British Isles, but also perhaps the first proof of human hunting anywhere in the world. Later excavations revealed an almost complete horse skeleton, attacked and killed by early humans more than 500,000 years ago.</p> <p>A drinking mare was ambushed by a group of early humans, <em>Homo he</em><em>idelbergensis</em>, using the water\u2019s edge to trap and ambush the horse. The hunters killed and butchered it in situ, carefully removing its spinal column, brain and tongue \u2013 prized fleshy delicacies. They cracked open some bones for their marrow, and sharpened others as tools and weapons. And it is bones such as these that can today yield extraordinary amounts of new data when analysed by modern techniques and interdisciplinary science. This archaeozoological approach underlies much of Taylor\u2019s work, since the sites he excavates sometimes offer only fragmentary glimpses of the past.</p> <p>The Boxgrove site is so perfectly preserved that pieces of flint knapped from larger stones have been fitted back together like a 3D jigsaw, showing the origin and use of each tool. Some were used for scraping the animals\u2019 hides, raising the tantalising possibility that these early humans dressed themselves in horsehide, while hunting the animals using horse bone spears and daggers.</p> <p>But horses became more than a source of food when they were first domesticated. Where this happened is subject to debate but it is thought to be some time between 3500BCE and 3000BCE. Then, 1,000 years after that, came the invention of the chariot, followed by the emergence of technologies such as the lighter-spoked wheel, the stirrup and saddle, which allowed humans to ride the animals for trade and war. This spread into new territories, new environments or along new trade routes, all of which brought about widespread and revolutionary shifts in human culture, says Taylor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>By sharing technology, \u2018Horses were like an ancient internet\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Working with international teams, including geneticists and even dentistry experts, Taylor studies scraps of bone, or sometimes fully assembled ceremonial chariot burials, to understand how the animals lived and died, and from this to deduce if they were ridden, or controlled using bits and reins, or if they pulled chariots or carts with yokes.</p> <p>By the second millennium BC, horses moved people, goods, languages and technologies into areas they had never before been seen. \u201cHorses are kind of like an ancient internet,\u201d says Taylor.</p> <p>The search for artefacts exploring horse and human contact has unearthed objects as rare as they are bizarre: the first documented human faeces in the Americas, more than 14,000 years old, was found at Paisley Caves, Oregon, alongside horse bones. The oldest known pair of trousers, 3,000 years old, were designed for and worn by an early horse rider. These were found at a tomb in Yanghai in China\u2019s Tarim Basin in 2014.</p> <p>Some of the most magical finds have been in Mongolia, including monumental standing stones known as deer stones for their carved adornments featuring the animals. These structures encircle sacrificed horse skeletons, hollow eyes facing the rising sun, buried in full tack alongside their owners and their chariots. There are several thousand such monuments across the country.</p> <p>Many artefacts have been extracted from deep inverse pyramidal burial grounds in the country\u2019s frozen high plains, says <a href=\"https://www.shh.mpg.de/person/110867/25522\">Dr Bayarsaikhan Jamsranjav</a>, a colleague of Taylor\u2019s, who discovered the world\u2019s oldest evidence of mounted horseback riding. In 2016, he found, identified and dated a fully intact 2,000-year-old wood-framed saddle with iron stirrups in a tomb at Urd Ulaan Uneet in Mongolia, which he says was the highlight of his career.</p> <p>Aside from the academic discoveries, what resounds most clearly through our conversation is Taylor\u2019s deep love of horses: his relationship with them provides him with what seems to be his most intense personal motivations. We discuss the thrill of galloping, of the flowing unity between rider and horse when the animal seems to teach the rider the correct rhythm to experience an ineffable, but terrifying, sense of weightlessness, of effortless flight.</p> <p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s one of the purest ways to understand not just another animal and not just the landscape, but also yourself. It really is transcendent. Most people who spend time on a horse will recognise aspects of that feeling, that moment of pure connection between rider and horse. There are very few experiences like it. When I go someplace new, and I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the landscape, riding horses is one of the purest ways to do it, because you feel it rather than know it. You can academically read about things for a long time, but that experience is incredibly important.\u201d</p> <p><em>Hoof Beats: How Horses Shaped Human History by William T Taylor is published by University of California Press.

      "bodyText": "The University of Toronto\u2019s environment school has announced it will financially dissociate from fossil fuel companies, in a landmark win for climate activists. The institution has committed to stop taking funds from the sector for research, sponsorships, scholarships or infrastructure such as buildings. It will also halt collaborations with the industry on events and school initiatives and cease to host fossil fuel recruitment events, while working to \u201cincrease transparency about the our funding, donations, and partnerships\u201d. The decision makes University of Toronto\u2019s School of the Environment the only academic institution in North America with a commitment to fossil fuel dissociation. Princeton University made such a commitment in 2022 but walked it back this month. The school\u2019s decision came after months of pressure from climate advocates on and off campus. \u201cFaculty, researchers, and students stood together at the University of Toronto to ensure that their School of the Environment will be a place for just climate research, not an avenue for corporate influence,\u201d said Alicia Colomer, the managing director for Campus Climate Network, a student-led advocacy group focused on eliminating oil and gas funding in academia. School officials have been deliberating the specifics of the commitment for \u201cwell over a year\u201d, said Steve Easterbrook, director of the school of environment. \u201cWe heard a range of different opinions on exactly where you draw the line,\u201d he said. The pledge will apply to all companies that extract fossil fuels and all lobbying organizations for coal, oil or gas. Funding from utility companies will be permitted. In October 2021, the University of Toronto committed to divesting its investments from fossil fuels by 2030. Campus activists applauded the commitment as a good step but one that left something to be desired. In 2022, they launched a fossil fuel dissociation campaign at University of Toronto, and in February, the group Climate Justice UofT released a report finding that the university had accepted over $64m from the industry and its enablers between 2008 and 2018. \u201cThe report shows why we needed this commitment,\u201d said Erin Mackey, a recent graduate of University of Toronto\u2019s environment school who worked on the report. \u201cPutting these new safeguards in place will help ensure that the school is not beholden to polluting industries.\u201d A September peer-reviewed meta-analysis found that fossil fuel companies\u2019 funding to universities is delaying the transition away from coal, oil and gas. The authors reviewed 14,000 peer-reviewed articles about conflicts of interest, bias and research funding across all industries from 2003 to 2023, and found that only seven mentioned fossil fuels, even though coal, oil and gas are the key drivers of the climate crisis. Separate student-led research in September found that top US universities are raking in millions of dollars from fossil fuel interests, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Individuals or institutions accepting oil and gas funding may have the best intentions, said Mackey, but there is increasing evidence that funding from oil and gas companies is associated with a more positive view of fossil fuels. \u201cUltimately, accepting that that money changes the nature of the relationship,\u201d making it less likely that research will be critical of fossil fuels, she said. Easterbrook said he had seen the negative impacts of fossil fuel funding \u201cfirsthand\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got many colleagues across the world whose work has been directly attacked and who\u2019ve had their work undermined by the actions of fossil fuel companies, by the actions of politicians who are taking money from those fossil fuel companies,\u201d he said. Even if funding does not directly influence research outcomes, it can \u201caffect what questions researchers are asking\u201d and also create the appearance of a conflict of interest. \u201cEven the perception is a problem for researchers,\u201d he said. The institution\u2019s commitment will not apply to the University of Toronto at large, a \u201climitation\u201d that the school acknowledged. The school was discussing a broader, university-wide policy, but it was \u201cvery hard to to know how fast that may play out or where we might land\u201d, Easterbrook said. The announcement comes amid mounting pressure on academic institutions to cut ties with fossil fuel companies. Public scrutiny of the fossil fuel sector\u2019s relationship with universities is also on the rise, including in an April report from Democrats on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe can\u2019t have corporations on campus if we want our universities and colleges to contribute, unimpeded, to the many existential challenges we face today,\u201d said Michael Classens, undergraduate associate director for the University of Toronto School of the Environment, said in a statement.",

Here, an irascible, obstinate woman of 90 trades stories with a 66-year-old writer who has recently settled, along with her ex-husband, in the small Maine town of Crosby. Nearly always concerning locals past and present, the tales meander, hopping between generations, and both teller and listener often puzzle and disagree over what meaning they might yield, if any. As Olive Kitteridge and Lucy Barton feel their way towards a tentative friendship, even the town\u2019s more lurid events \u2013 an elderly woman goes missing and her oddball son is suspected of her murder \u2013 are absorbed into the gentle pace of their conversations.</p> <p>And yet, Strout is a magician. From what might seem cussedly bathetic, deliberately underplayed, she produces rabbit after rabbit; moments of such sadness or illumination that the reader may feel momentarily winded before being compelled to continue.

      "bodyText": "If you were to describe Elizabeth Strout\u2019s latest novel \u2013 and her work more generally - to a newcomer, you might struggle to convey its immense rewards. Here, an irascible, obstinate woman of 90 trades stories with a 66-year-old writer who has recently settled, along with her ex-husband, in the small Maine town of Crosby. Nearly always concerning locals past and present, the tales meander, hopping between generations, and both teller and listener often puzzle and disagree over what meaning they might yield, if any. As Olive Kitteridge and Lucy Barton feel their way towards a tentative friendship, even the town\u2019s more lurid events \u2013 an elderly woman goes missing and her oddball son is suspected of her murder \u2013 are absorbed into the gentle pace of their conversations. And yet, Strout is a magician. From what might seem cussedly bathetic, deliberately underplayed, she produces rabbit after rabbit; moments of such sadness or illumination that the reader may feel momentarily winded before being compelled to continue. Sometimes it is a matter of the compression of backstory: Gloria Beach, the 86-year-old whose body is discovered in a quarry pool in the middle of the novel, has led a life of such suppressed trauma that it seems almost indecent when its details are quickly recounted. And yet this is what we do: the abused child who married another abuser becomes the spiteful dinner lady nicknamed \u201cBitch Ball\u201d, her bewildered son hypothetically exonerated should he be found to have murdered her.

The novel gains much of its power through gaps and silences.

      "bodyText": "The fourth episode of Saturday Night Live season 50 kicks off with the surprise return of Alec Baldwin \u2013 only the second time he has appeared on the show since his accidental fatal shooting of a crew member on the set of the movie Rust, and his first since the charges against him were dismissed. Baldwin plays Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier, who is sat down to interview the US vice-president, Kamala Harris (Maya Rudolph). When Baier interviewed Trump, his first question was about the issues facing the country, but with Harris he starts off by asking \u201cGive me the exact number of murderers you let into this country? One million? Two million? Ten million?\u201d He continues to interrupt Harris, but she stands her ground, hits her points and her memes (\u201cIn the clurb, we all fam\u201d), and makes the case that Trump is dangerously unstable. Baier rolls a clip from Trump\u2019s (James Austin Johnson) Fox News town hall, where he denies threatening anyone (except for violence) before going on a crazy rant about Alphonse Capone, Al Pacino, Freaky Friday and his disdain for Americans. A little later they cut to Trump\u2019s bizarre 30-minute dance-a-thon during one of his increasingly dire rallies. Baier continues to try to trip up Harris by playing more misleading clips featuring Joe Biden (Dana Carvey) rambling about Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, but Harris manages to turn the tables on him by simply uttering the words \u201cabortion\u201d, \u201cuterus\u201d, \u201cmenstruation\u201d. This was a solid cold open, managing to fit in all the big election moments from last week without feeling random or overstuffed. Baldwin\u2019s muggy Trump impersonation during his term in office got tired fast, but this was a welcome reminder that he\u2019s one of our best comedic actors and SNL\u2019s greatest returning guest. Props too to the writer\u2019s for not trying to \u201cboth sides\u201d things. Baier\u2019s open animosity and bias during the Harris interview and Trump\u2019s continuing mental decline are obvious to all but the most brainwashed Maga members and SNL directly acknowledging this was the right move. Michael Keaton has hosting duties. The actor reminisces about his time working as a PA on Mr Roger\u2019s Neighborhood the same year SNL debuted and notes the similarities between the two programs: \u201cLotta puppets, tons of cocaine.\u201d He moves on to his hit movie, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, before being joined on stage by Mikey Day and Andy Samberg, both in Beetlejuice costumes, and Sarah Sherman, dressed as herself, doing impressions of the iconic ghoul. They badger Keaton into doing the voice, and then it\u2019s onto the rest of the show. The first sketch sees Keaton play a sassy southern cookie salesman hawking his wares on a Halloween themed episode of Shop TV. His latest confection is a cookie that\u2019 supposed to look like a zombie eyeball, but it more resembles like a female breast with a giant pink nipple. Lots of spongy sight gags and bosomy double entendre ensue. Four episodes in, we get the first Please Don\u2019t Destroy of the season. John Higgins and Martin Herlihy celebrate the former\u2019s birthday by taking skydiving lessons, but their instructor (Ben Marshall) throws them off by admitting that he feels nervous and \u201coff\u201d. The others on the plane \u2013 including Keaton\u2019s suicidal instructor who has just lost custody of his kids and the rookie pilot \u2013 add to bad vibes. Things end very bloodily. This is the best PDD had been in a couple of seasons. Next, we find ourselves in 1950s Detroit, during a tense meeting between the families of a mixed-race couple (Andrew Dismukes, Ego Nwodim). The white parents (Heidi Gardner, Keaton) of the son are worried about what people will say, while the black father and brother of the bride (Kenan Thompson, Devon Walker) are more open minded \u2013 at least until the groom busts out a ukelele and plays a song he hopes will the bridge the gap between them all. That song is Hey, Soul Sister by Train, an earworm so white and lame that it earns his parents\u2019 blessing even as it causes his wife to break up with him. No clue why the writers decided to parody 1967\u2019s Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner via a 21-year-old one hit wonder, but at least Dismukes is having fun. This is followed by the worst recurring sketch of the past couple of seasons: a scroll through TikTok, wherein the cast recreate the most popular viral videos from app, in this case cooking videos from tradwives, the Costco boom guys, the Call Her Daddy podcast, election memes and the like. As with previous segments, this is nothing but a grab bag of lazy references and a desperate, unconvincing stab at relevancy. Musical guest Billie Eilish (alongside her brother Finneas and backing band) performs her first song of the night, then it\u2019s time for Weekend Update.

I am grateful to all partners who understand this and support us,\u201d he wrote on X.</p> <p>His post was accompanied with a 47-second video showing numerous smashed-up cars, burning buildings and bombed out homes in seven Ukrainian regions, described as the result of a week of Russian attacks.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said that 110 drones were destroyed in an overnight barrage against seven Russian regions. Many targeted Russia\u2019s border region of Kursk, where 43 drones were reportedly shot down, but others appeared to go much further</p> <p>Gleb Nikitin, the governor of Nizhny Novgorod, a city 250 miles (250km) east of Moscow, wrote on Telegram that four fighters had been lightly injured repelling a drone attack over an industrial zone, and were later discharged. He did not go into further details.</p> <p>The Associated Press new agency reported that social media footage appeared to show air defences at work over the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, close to a factory producing explosives.</p> <p>In Kyiv, officials reported that about 10 drones were destroyed near the capital, with no known destruction or injuries.</p> <p>Visiting Kyiv on Saturday, France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/france-foreign-minister-pledges-support-for-ukraine-victory-plan\">pledged support</a> for Ukraine\u2019s plan for ending the war with Russia, telling reporters he would work to secure other nations\u2019 backing for the proposals.</p> <p>Outlining his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/zelenskyy-ukraine-victory-plan-nato\">\u201cvictory plan\u201d</a> this week, Zelenskyy called for an \u201cimmediate\u201d invitation to join Nato to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security, but western allies have given a guarded response. Moscow claimed the plan amounted to an escalation, by \u201cpushing Nato into direct conflict\u201d with Russia.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UK was speaking to the BBC after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/15/wiltshire-novichok-victim-dawn-sturgess-daughter\">opening of a public inquiry</a> into the death of Dawn Sturgess. She died in 2018 after coming into contact with the nerve agent novichok, believed to have been in a perfume bottle discarded by Russian agents who had tried to assassinate the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury a few months earlier.</p> <p>The inquest into Sturgess\u2019s death was converted into a public inquiry in 2021 and opened last Monday.</p> <p>The UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/14/salisbury-novichok-poisonings-inquiry-sergei-skripal-vladmir-putin\">told the inquiry</a> this week in a statement that it considered the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had authorised the Salisbury novichok poisonings, which could have killed thousands of people.</p> <p>The Russian government has denied any involved in the attempted assassination of the Skripals and poisoning of Sturgess and her partner, Charlie Rowley, who survived.</p> <p>Asked in the BBC interview if he had any words for Sturgess\u2019s grieving family, the ambassador said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have never met this family. I am not involved in discussions with them or anything else. If someone has died of course we are concerned about that.\u201d</p> <p>He also questioned the need for an inquiry: \u201cWhy drag this history so long?\u201d</p> <p>The Skripal poisonings are seen as a turning point in British perceptions of Russia, triggering what the then prime minister, Theresa May, described as \u201cthe largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history\u201d.</p> <p>More than 100 Russian diplomats working in 20 western countries, who were alleged to be spies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/four-eu-states-set-to-expel-russian-diplomats-over-skripal-attack\">were told to return to Moscow</a> in a show of solidarity by western allies.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Moscow\u2019s ambassador to London has said the UK is waging a proxy war against Russia, while predicting the \u201cend of Ukraine\u201d as Russian invading forces make deeper advances into the country. In an interview with the BBC, Andrei Kelin said Ukraine continued to fight but claimed \u201cthe resistance is more feeble and feeble\u201d. Russian troops, he said, were gaining more terrain every day, adding: \u201cThe end of this phase will mean the end of Ukraine.\u201d Russia is thought to control about 18% of Ukraine and has been making slow but steady advances over the last year. Kelin also described the conflict as \u201ca proxy war led by the United Kingdom\u2019s government\u201d which by providing weapons is \u201ckilling Russian soldiers and civilians\u201d. The comments came as Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, renewed his appeal to western countries for air-defence systems, after Russian missile strikes on the central city of Kryvyi Rih late on Saturday wounded 17 people, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine is losing its territory in its eastern Donbas region to Russia\u2019s invading forces, while coming under sustained bombardment, but has yet to convince western allies to provide it with long-range missiles to strike Russian military targets. In Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy\u2019s home town, a police officer and rescue worker were among those injured in Russian attacks that damaged sites including an administrative building, a hotel and an educational facility, Ukraine\u2019s national police reported on social media. The regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said later that 15 apartment buildings, stores, a cafe, a church, office spaces, a bank branch and a gas pipeline had been damaged in the city. In a social media post on Sunday, Zelenskyy said that in the last week Russia had used more than 20 missiles of different types, about 800 guided aerial bombs, more than 500 varying strike drones against Ukraine. \u201cUkraine needs more air defence systems and long-range capabilities. I am grateful to all partners who understand this and support us,\u201d he wrote on X. His post was accompanied with a 47-second video showing numerous smashed-up cars, burning buildings and bombed out homes in seven Ukrainian regions, described as the result of a week of Russian attacks. Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said that 110 drones were destroyed in an overnight barrage against seven Russian regions. Many targeted Russia\u2019s border region of Kursk, where 43 drones were reportedly shot down, but others appeared to go much further Gleb Nikitin, the governor of Nizhny Novgorod, a city 250 miles (250km) east of Moscow, wrote on Telegram that four fighters had been lightly injured repelling a drone attack over an industrial zone, and were later discharged. He did not go into further details. The Associated Press new agency reported that social media footage appeared to show air defences at work over the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, close to a factory producing explosives. In Kyiv, officials reported that about 10 drones were destroyed near the capital, with no known destruction or injuries. Visiting Kyiv on Saturday, France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, pledged support for Ukraine\u2019s plan for ending the war with Russia, telling reporters he would work to secure other nations\u2019 backing for the proposals. Outlining his \u201cvictory plan\u201d this week, Zelenskyy called for an \u201cimmediate\u201d invitation to join Nato to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security, but western allies have given a guarded response. Moscow claimed the plan amounted to an escalation, by \u201cpushing Nato into direct conflict\u201d with Russia. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UK was speaking to the BBC after the opening of a public inquiry into the death of Dawn Sturgess. She died in 2018 after coming into contact with the nerve agent novichok, believed to have been in a perfume bottle discarded by Russian agents who had tried to assassinate the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury a few months earlier. The inquest into Sturgess\u2019s death was converted into a public inquiry in 2021 and opened last Monday. The UK government told the inquiry this week in a statement that it considered the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had authorised the Salisbury novichok poisonings, which could have killed thousands of people. The Russian government has denied any involved in the attempted assassination of the Skripals and poisoning of Sturgess and her partner, Charlie Rowley, who survived. Asked in the BBC interview if he had any words for Sturgess\u2019s grieving family, the ambassador said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have never met this family. I am not involved in discussions with them or anything else. If someone has died of course we are concerned about that.\u201d He also questioned the need for an inquiry: \u201cWhy drag this history so long?\u201d The Skripal poisonings are seen as a turning point in British perceptions of Russia, triggering what the then prime minister, Theresa May, described as \u201cthe largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history\u201d. More than 100 Russian diplomats working in 20 western countries, who were alleged to be spies, were told to return to Moscow in a show of solidarity by western allies.",

It\u2019s increasingly commonplace to see celebrity authors talking about their books on programmes such as BBC Breakfast or The One Show, she said, adding that it\u2019s not unusual for a bookseller to be asked for a newly published celebrity book because someone saw the author on TV.</p> <p>Buyers don\u2019t necessarily care whether the book is good \u2013 \u201csome are, some aren\u2019t\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cthe name on the front that has got the sale\u201d, she says.

Rashford\u2019s fiction series has sold 327,000 copies in the UK, while his nonfiction titles have sold 419,000, according to Nielsen BookData.</p> <h2>Celebrities whose children\u2019s books have been hits</h2> <p><strong>David Walliams<br></strong>Though Walliams\u2019 books have faced criticism \u2013 the anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe described them as \u201csneering, classist, fat-shaming nonsense\u201d, and a story about a Chinese boy named Brian Wong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/04/harpercollins-removes-story-from-david-walliams-book-the-worlds-worst-children\">was removed from his book The World\u2019s Worst Children</a> after being criticised by campaigners \u2013 they have been an undeniable commercial success; more than 37m copies have been sold worldwide. It is safe to say that Walliams is now known just as much for writing The Boy in the Dress and Gangsta Granny as he is for his work as an actor and comedian.</p> <p><strong>David Baddiel<br></strong>As with Walliams, there are children who would know Baddiel only as an author: he has written more than 10 books including The Parent Agency. His novels for children have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 2.5m copies worldwide.</p> <p><strong>Tom Fletcher<br></strong>Among the most respected of celebrity children\u2019s authors within the publishing community, because of the support he shows to other authors, the pop star has written bestselling adventure stories The Creakers and The Danger Gang, a popular series about a pooping dinosaur, with his McFly bandmate Dougie Poynter, and a dystopian YA love story with his wife, Giovanna.</p> <h2>Celebrities whose children\u2019s books have been flops</h2> <p><strong>Meghan Markle<br></strong>The Bench, the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s 2021 picture book, might have made a lot of headlines, but it didn\u2019t sell well at all: only 8,000 copies have ever been sold in the UK according to Nielsen BookScan. Based on a poem the duchess wrote for Prince Harry on his first Father\u2019s Day with Archie, Times critic Alex O\u2019Connell said it \u201clacks the crucial ingredients for a successful tale for this age group: a good story and basic rhythm\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Keith Richards<br></strong>The Rolling Stones guitarist published a children\u2019s book, Gus &amp; Me, in 2o14. Featuring illustrations by Richards\u2019 daughter, the picture book is about his grandfather, who played in a jazz big band and introduced the young Keith to music. It\u2019s safe to say that this one hasn\u2019t become a staple of children\u2019s bookshelves.</p> <p><strong>Simon Cowell<br></strong>It is perhaps incorrect to describe Simon Cowell\u2019s Wishfits series of children\u2019s books about a group of magical creatures as a flop \u2013 it has simply never happened. The X Factor judge and his son Eric were meant to publish their first title in 2022, which was then pushed back to 2023, and then \u2026 nothing. Perhaps Cowell realised the celebrity children\u2019s book market was crowded enough.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2024. An earlier version cited out of date sales figures for David Baddiel. It said that his books had been translated into 26 languages and he had sold more than 1m million copies worldwide; this should have said translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 2.5m copies worldwide.</p>",

It is safe to say that Walliams is now known just as much for writing The Boy in the Dress and Gangsta Granny as he is for his work as an actor and comedian. David Baddiel As with Walliams, there are children who would know Baddiel only as an author: he has written more than 10 books including The Parent Agency. His novels for children have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 2.5m copies worldwide. Tom Fletcher Among the most respected of celebrity children\u2019s authors within the publishing community, because of the support he shows to other authors, the pop star has written bestselling adventure stories The Creakers and The Danger Gang, a popular series about a pooping dinosaur, with his McFly bandmate Dougie Poynter, and a dystopian YA love story with his wife, Giovanna. Celebrities whose children\u2019s books have been flops Meghan Markle The Bench, the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s 2021 picture book, might have made a lot of headlines, but it didn\u2019t sell well at all: only 8,000 copies have ever been sold in the UK according to Nielsen BookScan. Based on a poem the duchess wrote for Prince Harry on his first Father\u2019s Day with Archie, Times critic Alex O\u2019Connell said it \u201clacks the crucial ingredients for a successful tale for this age group: a good story and basic rhythm\u201d. Keith Richards The Rolling Stones guitarist published a children\u2019s book, Gus &amp; Me, in 2o14. Featuring illustrations by Richards\u2019 daughter, the picture book is about his grandfather, who played in a jazz big band and introduced the young Keith to music. It\u2019s safe to say that this one hasn\u2019t become a staple of children\u2019s bookshelves. Simon Cowell It is perhaps incorrect to describe Simon Cowell\u2019s Wishfits series of children\u2019s books about a group of magical creatures as a flop \u2013 it has simply never happened. The X Factor judge and his son Eric were meant to publish their first title in 2022, which was then pushed back to 2023, and then \u2026 nothing. Perhaps Cowell realised the celebrity children\u2019s book market was crowded enough. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2024. An earlier version cited out of date sales figures for David Baddiel. It said that his books had been translated into 26 languages and he had sold more than 1m million copies worldwide; this should have said translated into more than 30 languages and have sold more than 2.5m copies worldwide.",

In otherwise meticulously planned spaces, you might find a \u201cbar manager playing techno at breakfast or a dusty pianist playing some godawful cover version\u201d. To this then-DJ and music journalist such choices jarred.</p> <p>Wood thought that sensitively programmed music could enhance not just a hotel or restaurant\u2019s aesthetic \u201cbut how people feel in that space: comfortable, energised, happier\u201d, with obvious business benefits.</p> <p>In 2007, Wood, now 55, launched the music curation service Music Concierge. Today, it employs more than 60 people internationally, has offices in Shanghai and Dubai among others, and in London delivers music to restaurants ranging from Angela Hartnett\u2019s Cafe Murano and Claude Bosi\u2019s Brooklands to fast-casual chains, pubs and bars.</p> <p>To collate playlists, staff draw on a vast library (about 250 genres; jazz has 35 sub-sections) in which tracks are tagged to enable searches for, say, \u201celegant music that evokes the French Riviera\u201d. \u201c[It\u2019s] detective work,\u201d says Wood.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tom Kerridge wanted more guitar music than we\u2019d normally include</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Music is chosen for what hospitality professionals call \u201cday parts\u201d. Breakfast requires a different soundtrack to dinner, and those moments in the day vary from Monday to Friday or summer to autumn. There are many variables for which Music Concierge designs updatable playlists accordingly.</p> <p>\u201cYou also use music to underpin the service,\u201d says Wood. Guests are more likely to linger for after-dinner drinks if the tempo is relaxed. Casual restaurants looking to turn tables quickly require pacier sounds, an injection, says Wood, of \u201cenergy and momentum that becomes part of [that restaurant\u2019s] culture\u201d.</p> <p>To identify that culture, restaurants are analysed: decor, menus, trading patterns, style of service: \u201cAll those influence what we\u2019re going to recommend.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally, an owner may request a themed playlist that is intended to evoke a specific time and place, say 1920s Paris. Or a chef who is a music fan might lobby for certain songs. Tom Kerridge asked for Shuggie Otis and Laura Marling on the playlist at his Corinthia Hotel restaurant, alongside, says Wood, \u201cmore guitar-orientated artists than we normally include in a place like that\u201d.</p> <p>Usually, the Music Concierge approach is more tangential. Its work for Dishoom, for example, has a \u201cretro element\u201d, fittingly for a brand inspired by Mumbai\u2019s historical Irani cafes. But this eclectic mix is not time coded or geographically literal. Instead, it folds together \u201cfunkier\u201d 1970s Bollywood tracks or 1950s US exotica or jazz to create the democratic, playful atmosphere Dishoom wanted to convey.</p> <p>Programming music the audience will recognise is, with certain exceptions, rarely a priority. Instead, the aim is to choose music which \u201cin emotion and feel matches the restaurant concept\u201d. High-end restaurants particularly, says Wood, are about escapism. \u201cYou don\u2019t want hear what was playing on the radio as you drove there,\u201d he says.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.musicconcierge.co.uk/\">musicconcierge.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>The ceramicist: Skye Corewijn</h2>    <p>In the past decade, the British ceramics scene has \u201cjust exploded\u201d, says London-based potter Skye Corewijn. The number of studios and makers has grown, as has interest from restaurants in Corewijn\u2019s hand-thrown crockery.</p> <p>\u201cPlates are like frames for food,\u201d says Corewijn. Chefs, particularly those who value artisan skills, increasingly want those frames to be bespoke: engaging objects with an interesting backstory of local production. Mass-produced is out, bling is cringe and unique, handmade items rule, not least in tableware.</p> <p>Corewijn, whose restaurant clients include the Sea, the Sea, Cycene and Planque, is a product of that renaissance in traditional skills. The Cape Town-born 35-year-old started pottery classes at London studio the <a href=\"https://www.thekilnrooms.com/\">Kiln Rooms</a> in 2012, eager to mix up her desk job with something \u201cnourishing \u2026 more tactile, something I could touch and feel\u201d.</p> <p>Her first commission came two years later from Giorgio Ravelli, then cooking at Upstairs at the Ten Bells, where Corewijn was working front of house part-time: \u201cIt was quite a wild feeling to take food out on little plates I\u2019d made.\u201d</p> <p>Friends of friends, often chefs, would seek her out (she produced early pieces for the Clove Club and Koya). Honing her skills at Turning Earth\u2019s Leyton studios (\u201cCeramics is a lot about trial and error\u201d), and as an assistant to the potter Jess Joslin, Corewijn developed a portfolio of hospitality clients and her retail work, showcased at the Hackney Road store <a href=\"https://klei.shop/\">Klei</a>.</p> <p>Design is collaborative: \u201cTrying to combine [chefs\u2019] taste with something I\u2019m proud to make.\u201d Having worked in restaurants, Corewijn can offer frank advice about how handmade pieces handle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how plates stack,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they break.\u201d Matt finishes are more prone to chips and cutlery marks: \u201cGlossy finishes are more practical. But some restaurants are like, \u2018We just want it to be beautiful.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Corewijn, beauty means contrasts: \u201cMatt and gloss next to each other, even clay as a texture.\u201d Her pieces largely operate in a vogueish, earthy palette of greys and browns, partly out of necessity. Using an electric kiln to fire stoneware and porcelain narrows the colours achievable, unless you want to deep dive into glazing science. Corewijn\u2019s interests lie more in \u201cthrowing, shape, form\u201d.</p> <p>Feel is important, literally and figuratively. Corewijn\u2019s \u201cdimple\u201d cups for <a href=\"https://assemblycoffee.co.uk/products/assembly-x-skye-corewijn-porcelain-dimple-coffee-mug\">Assembly Coffee</a> featured an indent grip. The drinker\u2019s hand wraps around and into the cup, creating \u201ca comfortable, cosy experience, which embodies a morning coffee\u201d.</p> <p>Chefs buying this work embrace the idiosyncrasies of handmade pottery. A natural material, clay may include iron flecks or produce a variety of shades. When Corewijn makes 100 plates at her Bromley-by-Bow studio, they may vary a few millimetres in diameter. \u201cI\u2019m not a machine,\u201d she says. If chefs want uniform \u201cindestructible work\u201d they can go to factories, but, says Corewijn: \u201cWhere\u2019s the sensibility in that, where\u2019s supporting local business?\u201d<br><em><a href=\"https://skyecorewijn.com/\">skyecorewijn.com</a></em></p> <h2>The interior architect: Richard Eastwood, R2A</h2>    <p>Other architects may enjoy conceiving a building\u2019s exterior, but for Richard Eastwood it is the interior that brings \u201cjoy and romance\u201d to buildings, more so than \u201ccladding a shape\u201d.</p> <p>Specifically, the founder of the agency R2A, which has designed such notable places as Madre in Manchester and Manifest in Liverpool, as well as the Indian chain Mowgli\u2019s first two sites, has fallen in love with \u201cdesigning some of the last social spaces in our cities\u201d. Places where, as Eastwood puts it, lyrically, \u201cpeople meet their future husbands and wives\u201d.</p> <p>R2A\u2019s work is not about \u201cmaking sure cushions match curtains\u201d. Instead, it is a synthesis of the creative and the practical. It aims to reflect a restaurant\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d in its interior, while ensuring that, from kitchen ergonomics to capacity (\u201cwe\u2019re masters at maximising bums on seats\u201d), the space functions smoothly for owners, staff and diners.</p> <p>Eastwood has rigorous opinions on every aspect. Comfort must always trump designer ego: \u201cI see these cool spaces \u2013 raw concrete bench, stainless steel walls \u2013 and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018How long would I actually sit there?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Layered and pooled romantic lighting is \u201ckey to everything\u201d. Table heights (usually 75cm, or 90cm in busier, central areas, to prevent diners \u201cgetting knocked\u201d constantly), need to align with seating accurately, so you\u2019re not \u201cleaning forward all the time\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you open the door, it\u2019s all the detail that gives a place integrity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pet hates include booth tables that are a struggle to clamber into: \u201cI want it to look cool. But I\u2019ve got to get into the table.\u201d As for living walls with neon slogans designed for Instagram selfies: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just old and grumpy. It\u2019s just not us,\u201d says Eastwood, who is 57.</p> <p>Defining a brand\u2019s identity (hip, democratic, luxurious) and choosing how to embody that in materials and features is a more abstract process. Eastwood likens R2A to a music producer, refining ideas from multiple sources \u2013 the owner\u2019s vision; a building\u2019s history; contemporary design trends \u2013 into an achievable plan that has \u201cconfidence and clarity\u201d.</p> <p>Sometimes, interior features reference the food. Manifest has an open kitchen with counter seats and a handsome table at the entrance displaying locally grown, seasonal produce, plus an ageing cabinet for homemade charcuterie. That \u201celemental interior reflects [owner Paul Durand\u2019s] cooking\u201d.</p> <p>Often, the influence and intent is less obvious. R2A\u2019s designs at Madre makes oblique reference to traditional Mexican architecture, but \u201crather than being on the nose: here\u2019s a Mexican restaurant\u201d, it does so in a buzzy space whose lighting gives it a nightclub edge which feels woven into its city-centre location.</p> <p>Madre is modern, sharp, instantly attractive, even if most visitors would struggle to articulate why it lands with such a satisfying aesthetic. It is all the detail, says Eastwood, the hundreds of small design decisions \u2013 surface finishes, colours, how a corner is styled \u2013 which, when \u201cyou open the door, gives it instant integrity\u201d.<br><em><a href=\"https://r2a.studio/studio/\">r2a.studio</a></em></p> <h2>The tanner: Jack Millington, Billy Tannery</h2>    <p>A decade ago, Jack Millington stumbled into what he describes as a \u201cvoid that piqued my interest\u201d. He was trying to find companies that could turn the surplus hides from his father\u2019s goat meat farm into leather but found \u201cthis almost dead industry but with this massive supply of hides, which were going abroad or in the bin\u201d.</p> <p>Then working in advertising, Millington sensed an opportunity. The company he cofounded in 2016, Billy Tannery, became a rare newcomer in the now niche tanning industry. Historically, Britain had thousands of tanneries. In 2019, the industry body, Leather UK, listed 24 on its website.</p> <p>Even in that group, the 36-year-old\u2019s Leicestershire micro-tannery is unusual. It uses a pre-industrial tree bark tanning method and processes goat and deer skins rather than cow or sheep hides. It also designs its own products, made in UK workshops, which, for restaurants, range from handsome chefs\u2019 aprons to leather menu covers, order-pad holders, table mats and bill presenters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can create most valuefrom something that wasgoing to be chucked away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Millington was on a steep learning curve. Both in building the tannery, with guidance from Paul Evans, a former lecturer at the University of Northampton\u2019s Institute for Creative Leather Technologies, and in sourcing male goat skins (preferred for their higher quality) from abattoirs where previously they might have been discarded. \u201cWe can create the most value from something that was going to be chucked away,\u201d says Millington, who contacted goat farms, abattoirs and hide merchants to connect a supply chain for Billy Tannery.</p> <p>This story at the intersection of meat, artisan craft and waste reduction resonated with chefs. 12:51\u2019s James Cochran and Douglas McMaster\u2019s zero-waste restaurant Silo were among early fans of the tannery\u2019s lightweight, supple goatskin aprons. Millington has also created deer aprons for the Ledbury, using hides from two herds owned by the restaurant\u2019s chef-owner, Brett Graham.</p> <p>Luckily, the tannery launched as the live-fire-and-leather-apron look was taking off with chefs. But its hospitality range, including bespoke \u201ctaco pouches\u201d for Mexican restaurant Kol, sells, says Millington, on a combination of style, ethics and hard-headed cost-effectiveness.</p> <p>\u201cA thick, heavy, leather-bound menu can add to the prestige of a big, expensive wine list; that is definitely a motivation,\u201d says Millington. But general managers also \u201cwant to reduce their printing costs. There\u2019s always a&nbsp;practical aspect.\u201d</p> <p>Using Billy Tannery\u2019s products requires some buy-in. Its aprons are a durable, sustainable option but benefit from wiping down attentively and periodic applications of leather cream.&nbsp;Its drinks coasters may \u201cdarken and age, like any leather. It might be nerve-racking to see marks on it from a&nbsp;glass. But over time it becomes part of&nbsp;the piece.\u201d <br><em><a href=\"https://www.billytannery.co.uk/\">billytannery.co.uk</a></em></p>",

What would her ideal feedback be? \u201cIt makes our lives so much easier.\u201d aliceblogg.co.uk The soundtrack expert: Rob Wood, Music Concierge In the mid-2000s, Rob Wood regularly found himself baffled by the music he heard in boutique hotels. In otherwise meticulously planned spaces, you might find a \u201cbar manager playing techno at breakfast or a dusty pianist playing some godawful cover version\u201d. To this then-DJ and music journalist such choices jarred. Wood thought that sensitively programmed music could enhance not just a hotel or restaurant\u2019s aesthetic \u201cbut how people feel in that space: comfortable, energised, happier\u201d, with obvious business benefits. In 2007, Wood, now 55, launched the music curation service Music Concierge. Today, it employs more than 60 people internationally, has offices in Shanghai and Dubai among others, and in London delivers music to restaurants ranging from Angela Hartnett\u2019s Cafe Murano and Claude Bosi\u2019s Brooklands to fast-casual chains, pubs and bars. To collate playlists, staff draw on a vast library (about 250 genres; jazz has 35 sub-sections) in which tracks are tagged to enable searches for, say, \u201celegant music that evokes the French Riviera\u201d. \u201c[It\u2019s] detective work,\u201d says Wood. Music is chosen for what hospitality professionals call \u201cday parts\u201d. Breakfast requires a different soundtrack to dinner, and those moments in the day vary from Monday to Friday or summer to autumn. There are many variables for which Music Concierge designs updatable playlists accordingly. \u201cYou also use music to underpin the service,\u201d says Wood. Guests are more likely to linger for after-dinner drinks if the tempo is relaxed. Casual restaurants looking to turn tables quickly require pacier sounds, an injection, says Wood, of \u201cenergy and momentum that becomes part of [that restaurant\u2019s] culture\u201d. To identify that culture, restaurants are analysed: decor, menus, trading patterns, style of service: \u201cAll those influence what we\u2019re going to recommend.\u201d Occasionally, an owner may request a themed playlist that is intended to evoke a specific time and place, say 1920s Paris. Or a chef who is a music fan might lobby for certain songs. Tom Kerridge asked for Shuggie Otis and Laura Marling on the playlist at his Corinthia Hotel restaurant, alongside, says Wood, \u201cmore guitar-orientated artists than we normally include in a place like that\u201d. Usually, the Music Concierge approach is more tangential. Its work for Dishoom, for example, has a \u201cretro element\u201d, fittingly for a brand inspired by Mumbai\u2019s historical Irani cafes. But this eclectic mix is not time coded or geographically literal. Instead, it folds together \u201cfunkier\u201d 1970s Bollywood tracks or 1950s US exotica or jazz to create the democratic, playful atmosphere Dishoom wanted to convey. Programming music the audience will recognise is, with certain exceptions, rarely a priority. Instead, the aim is to choose music which \u201cin emotion and feel matches the restaurant concept\u201d. High-end restaurants particularly, says Wood, are about escapism. \u201cYou don\u2019t want hear what was playing on the radio as you drove there,\u201d he says. musicconcierge.co.uk The ceramicist: Skye Corewijn In the past decade, the British ceramics scene has \u201cjust exploded\u201d, says London-based potter Skye Corewijn. The number of studios and makers has grown, as has interest from restaurants in Corewijn\u2019s hand-thrown crockery. \u201cPlates are like frames for food,\u201d says Corewijn. Chefs, particularly those who value artisan skills, increasingly want those frames to be bespoke: engaging objects with an interesting backstory of local production. Mass-produced is out, bling is cringe and unique, handmade items rule, not least in tableware. Corewijn, whose restaurant clients include the Sea, the Sea, Cycene and Planque, is a product of that renaissance in traditional skills. The Cape Town-born 35-year-old started pottery classes at London studio the Kiln Rooms in 2012, eager to mix up her desk job with something \u201cnourishing \u2026 more tactile, something I could touch and feel\u201d. Her first commission came two years later from Giorgio Ravelli, then cooking at Upstairs at the Ten Bells, where Corewijn was working front of house part-time: \u201cIt was quite a wild feeling to take food out on little plates I\u2019d made.\u201d Friends of friends, often chefs, would seek her out (she produced early pieces for the Clove Club and Koya). Honing her skills at Turning Earth\u2019s Leyton studios (\u201cCeramics is a lot about trial and error\u201d), and as an assistant to the potter Jess Joslin, Corewijn developed a portfolio of hospitality clients and her retail work, showcased at the Hackney Road store Klei. Design is collaborative: \u201cTrying to combine [chefs\u2019] taste with something I\u2019m proud to make.\u201d Having worked in restaurants, Corewijn can offer frank advice about how handmade pieces handle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how plates stack,\u201d she says. \u201cHow they break.\u201d Matt finishes are more prone to chips and cutlery marks: \u201cGlossy finishes are more practical. But some restaurants are like, \u2018We just want it to be beautiful.\u2019\u201d For Corewijn, beauty means contrasts: \u201cMatt and gloss next to each other, even clay as a texture.\u201d Her pieces largely operate in a vogueish, earthy palette of greys and browns, partly out of necessity. Using an electric kiln to fire stoneware and porcelain narrows the colours achievable, unless you want to deep dive into glazing science. Corewijn\u2019s interests lie more in \u201cthrowing, shape, form\u201d. Feel is important, literally and figuratively. Corewijn\u2019s \u201cdimple\u201d cups for Assembly Coffee featured an indent grip. The drinker\u2019s hand wraps around and into the cup, creating \u201ca comfortable, cosy experience, which embodies a morning coffee\u201d. Chefs buying this work embrace the idiosyncrasies of handmade pottery. A natural material, clay may include iron flecks or produce a variety of shades. When Corewijn makes 100 plates at her Bromley-by-Bow studio, they may vary a few millimetres in diameter. \u201cI\u2019m not a machine,\u201d she says. If chefs want uniform \u201cindestructible work\u201d they can go to factories, but, says Corewijn: \u201cWhere\u2019s the sensibility in that, where\u2019s supporting local business?\u201d skyecorewijn.com The interior architect: Richard Eastwood, R2A Other architects may enjoy conceiving a building\u2019s exterior, but for Richard Eastwood it is the interior that brings \u201cjoy and romance\u201d to buildings, more so than \u201ccladding a shape\u201d. Specifically, the founder of the agency R2A, which has designed such notable places as Madre in Manchester and Manifest in Liverpool, as well as the Indian chain Mowgli\u2019s first two sites, has fallen in love with \u201cdesigning some of the last social spaces in our cities\u201d. Places where, as Eastwood puts it, lyrically, \u201cpeople meet their future husbands and wives\u201d. R2A\u2019s work is not about \u201cmaking sure cushions match curtains\u201d. Instead, it is a synthesis of the creative and the practical. It aims to reflect a restaurant\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d in its interior, while ensuring that, from kitchen ergonomics to capacity (\u201cwe\u2019re masters at maximising bums on seats\u201d), the space functions smoothly for owners, staff and diners. Eastwood has rigorous opinions on every aspect. Comfort must always trump designer ego: \u201cI see these cool spaces \u2013 raw concrete bench, stainless steel walls \u2013 and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018How long would I actually sit there?\u2019\u201d Layered and pooled romantic lighting is \u201ckey to everything\u201d. Table heights (usually 75cm, or 90cm in busier, central areas, to prevent diners \u201cgetting knocked\u201d constantly), need to align with seating accurately, so you\u2019re not \u201cleaning forward all the time\u201d. Pet hates include booth tables that are a struggle to clamber into: \u201cI want it to look cool. But I\u2019ve got to get into the table.\u201d As for living walls with neon slogans designed for Instagram selfies: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just old and grumpy. It\u2019s just not us,\u201d says Eastwood, who is 57. Defining a brand\u2019s identity (hip, democratic, luxurious) and choosing how to embody that in materials and features is a more abstract process. Eastwood likens R2A to a music producer, refining ideas from multiple sources \u2013 the owner\u2019s vision; a building\u2019s history; contemporary design trends \u2013 into an achievable plan that has \u201cconfidence and clarity\u201d. Sometimes, interior features reference the food. Manifest has an open kitchen with counter seats and a handsome table at the entrance displaying locally grown, seasonal produce, plus an ageing cabinet for homemade charcuterie. That \u201celemental interior reflects [owner Paul Durand\u2019s] cooking\u201d. Often, the influence and intent is less obvious. R2A\u2019s designs at Madre makes oblique reference to traditional Mexican architecture, but \u201crather than being on the nose: here\u2019s a Mexican restaurant\u201d, it does so in a buzzy space whose lighting gives it a nightclub edge which feels woven into its city-centre location. Madre is modern, sharp, instantly attractive, even if most visitors would struggle to articulate why it lands with such a satisfying aesthetic. It is all the detail, says Eastwood, the hundreds of small design decisions \u2013 surface finishes, colours, how a corner is styled \u2013 which, when \u201cyou open the door, gives it instant integrity\u201d. r2a.studio The tanner: Jack Millington, Billy Tannery A decade ago, Jack Millington stumbled into what he describes as a \u201cvoid that piqued my interest\u201d. He was trying to find companies that could turn the surplus hides from his father\u2019s goat meat farm into leather but found \u201cthis almost dead industry but with this massive supply of hides, which were going abroad or in the bin\u201d. Then working in advertising, Millington sensed an opportunity. The company he cofounded in 2016, Billy Tannery, became a rare newcomer in the now niche tanning industry. Historically, Britain had thousands of tanneries. In 2019, the industry body, Leather UK, listed 24 on its website. Even in that group, the 36-year-old\u2019s Leicestershire micro-tannery is unusual. It uses a pre-industrial tree bark tanning method and processes goat and deer skins rather than cow or sheep hides. It also designs its own products, made in UK workshops, which, for restaurants, range from handsome chefs\u2019 aprons to leather menu covers, order-pad holders, table mats and bill presenters. Millington was on a steep learning curve. Both in building the tannery, with guidance from Paul Evans, a former lecturer at the University of Northampton\u2019s Institute for Creative Leather Technologies, and in sourcing male goat skins (preferred for their higher quality) from abattoirs where previously they might have been discarded. \u201cWe can create the most value from something that was going to be chucked away,\u201d says Millington, who contacted goat farms, abattoirs and hide merchants to connect a supply chain for Billy Tannery. This story at the intersection of meat, artisan craft and waste reduction resonated with chefs. 12:51\u2019s James Cochran and Douglas McMaster\u2019s zero-waste restaurant Silo were among early fans of the tannery\u2019s lightweight, supple goatskin aprons. Millington has also created deer aprons for the Ledbury, using hides from two herds owned by the restaurant\u2019s chef-owner, Brett Graham. Luckily, the tannery launched as the live-fire-and-leather-apron look was taking off with chefs. But its hospitality range, including bespoke \u201ctaco pouches\u201d for Mexican restaurant Kol, sells, says Millington, on a combination of style, ethics and hard-headed cost-effectiveness. \u201cA thick, heavy, leather-bound menu can add to the prestige of a big, expensive wine list; that is definitely a motivation,\u201d says Millington. But general managers also \u201cwant to reduce their printing costs. There\u2019s always a practical aspect.\u201d Using Billy Tannery\u2019s products requires some buy-in. Its aprons are a durable, sustainable option but benefit from wiping down attentively and periodic applications of leather cream. Its drinks coasters may \u201cdarken and age, like any leather. It might be nerve-racking to see marks on it from a glass. But over time it becomes part of the piece.\u201d billytannery.co.uk",

Do you know how many Black and brown people she put in prison? \u2026 She\u2019s gonna be like a Bill Clinton, a conservative Democrat who is tough on crime.\u201d Despite those misgivings, he couldn\u2019t stomach supporting Trump: \u201cSince he\u2019s been in politics, he\u2019s been courting racist white people who think that people who aren\u2019t white are taking their country.\u201d</p> <p>Jaime Joseph Jaramillo, 53, said he supported Trump, appreciating his promise of mass deportations to \u201cget rid of the drug cartels\u201d and favoring him on foreign policy: \u201cI want him to bomb Iran and drill, drill, drill.\u201d He expressed sympathy for Palestinians, but said: \u201cI want him to take out Hamas.\u201d</p> <p>Nate Venegas, 47, said he, too, favored Trump because \u201cour system needs somebody who\u2019s not a politician\u201d.

Trump hasn\u2019t given me anything that he plans to do, except lock down the borders. We have problems with homelessness, jobs and climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel Moctezuma, 32, said he considered Harris \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d and supported her on reproductive rights and immigration: \u201cI think there would be a lot of progressive changes. There have been a lot of human rights taken away from people and she\u2019ll bring some of those policies back.\u201d But he worries about divisions in the country: \u201cNo matter who wins, this country is going to be split and I\u2019m really hoping that there\u2019s not the same amount of violence as January 6.\u201d</p>          <p>On their ballots, some offered handwritten notes about why they voted:</p> <p><em>\u201cWe have not always had the right to vote.

      "bodyText": "An estimated 4 million US citizens are barred from voting because they have a felony conviction. That includes most Americans serving prison sentences. But last week at San Quentin, the 172-year-old prison in the San Francisco Bay Area, residents had a rare opportunity to weigh in on a US election where so much is on the line. As incarcerated residents jogged on the yard and played pickleball, dozens stopped by the prison\u2019s education department and slid paper ballots into a locked metal box with an American flag and the word \u201cvote\u201d painted on it. The voters were participating in a mock election, organized by Juan Moreno Haines, a journalist incarcerated at San Quentin, and Mount Tamalpais College (MTC), a liberal arts institution based at the prison. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to have a voice, especially if it\u2019s being heard on the outside,\u201d said Michael Scott, 45, who is due to be released next year after having been incarcerated for more than two decades, before casting his vote. California, like most US states, prohibits incarcerated people with felonies from voting, affecting more than 90,000 people in state prisons. The US is a global leader in its incarceration rate and an outlier in its sweeping disenfranchisement; a recent report identified more than 70 countries with no or very few restrictions on voting based on criminal records. Roughly 1.7% of the US voting-age population can\u2019t vote, with Black Americans disproportionately excluded and restrictions potentially affecting election results. For San Quentin\u2019s election, MTC, which recently became the first US accredited college exclusively operating behind bars, directed incarcerated students in its American government class to design ballots, choosing which races and initiatives to poll. MTC sent all 3,247 residents a ballot. After a week of voting, 341 ballots had been returned, representing 10.5% of the population. Fifteen volunteers from MTC and the League of Women Voters tallied the results: Kamala Harris won 57.2% of votes, and Donald Trump won 28.2%. Claudia De la Cruz of the Peace and Freedom party, a socialist ticket, won 3.5% of votes; the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein won 2.6%; Robert F Kennedy Jr won 2.1%; and Chase Oliver, a libertarian, won 0.3%. In the California senate race, Adam Schiff, the Democratic candidate, defeated Republican Steve Garvey with 33.7% of votes, though nearly half of respondents left this question blank. Nearly 60% favored Prop 5, which would boost affordable housing funding; 78% favored Prop 32, which would increase the minimum wage; and 57.2% rejected Prop 36, which would increase penalties for certain drug and theft crimes. Prop 6 would change the state constitution to abolish forced prison labor, making it a high-stakes measure for incarcerated people. Just more than 77% of respondents backed it. The state of California, like most others in the US, allows for incarcerated people to be forced to work against their will. California profits from this form of involuntary servitude, with residents providing vital services for negligible wages. Most people in prison currently make less than $0.75 (\u00a30.58) an hour for their jobs. Prop 6 is meant to allow incarcerated people to choose their jobs and prohibit prisons from punishing those who refuse an assignment. Dante Jones, 41, said he wished he could vote for Prop 6 on 5 November: \u201cWe\u2019ve got legalized plantations \u2026 They say they want us to be citizens, they want to rehabilitate us, but then they don\u2019t do anything that allows that to happen. Technically, by the constitution, we\u2019re slaves and they can whip our backs.\u201d Jones said he hopes if Prop 6 passes, incarcerated people can earn better wages to afford commissary, including food. Jones\u2019 assessment of the presidential race was grim: \u201cI think we\u2019re losing either way.\u201d He reluctantly supported Harris despite her prosecutorial record and reputation for harshly punishing Black defendants: \u201cShe ain\u2019t for her people. Do you know how many Black and brown people she put in prison? \u2026 She\u2019s gonna be like a Bill Clinton, a conservative Democrat who is tough on crime.\u201d Despite those misgivings, he couldn\u2019t stomach supporting Trump: \u201cSince he\u2019s been in politics, he\u2019s been courting racist white people who think that people who aren\u2019t white are taking their country.\u201d Jaime Joseph Jaramillo, 53, said he supported Trump, appreciating his promise of mass deportations to \u201cget rid of the drug cartels\u201d and favoring him on foreign policy: \u201cI want him to bomb Iran and drill, drill, drill.\u201d He expressed sympathy for Palestinians, but said: \u201cI want him to take out Hamas.\u201d Nate Venegas, 47, said he, too, favored Trump because \u201cour system needs somebody who\u2019s not a politician\u201d. He thinks Trump could be more swayed on prison reform, citing the former president\u2019s decision to pardon a woman\u2019s drug offense after lobbying by Kim Kardashian while he was in office. But he also called Trump a \u201cclown\u201d and said he disliked his vigorous support of capital punishment: \u201cI don\u2019t believe there should be a death penalty. I don\u2019t believe a man should kill another man.\u201d Scott voted for Harris \u201cbecause she gives me something to look forward to. Trump hasn\u2019t given me anything that he plans to do, except lock down the borders. We have problems with homelessness, jobs and climate change.\u201d Gabriel Moctezuma, 32, said he considered Harris \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d and supported her on reproductive rights and immigration: \u201cI think there would be a lot of progressive changes. There have been a lot of human rights taken away from people and she\u2019ll bring some of those policies back.\u201d But he worries about divisions in the country: \u201cNo matter who wins, this country is going to be split and I\u2019m really hoping that there\u2019s not the same amount of violence as January 6.\u201d On their ballots, some offered handwritten notes about why they voted: \u201cWe have not always had the right to vote. So I would like to cast my vote for each of my [African American] ancestors that was denied access.\u201d \u201cI only ever voted once in my life and I want to do so again.\u201d \u201cDemocracy is at stake.\u201d \u201cI want to feel like I am a part of history.\u201d \u201c[I\u2019ve] been in prison for 29 years and never had an opportunity to vote.\u201d Vermont, Maine and Washington DC are the only places in the US where all incarcerated people can vote. Amy Jamgochian, the chief academic officer at MTC, said the disenfranchisement of incarcerated people was a reminder that the US is \u201cvery confused as a society about what incarceration is for\u201d. \u201cIs it for depriving people of humanity and rights? Will that help them? Are we trying to help them? Or are we just trying to warehouse them? If [the goal] is rehabilitation, then I don\u2019t think we want to dehumanize them. We want to actually deeply respect their humanity, including giving them the right to vote.\u201d Venegas, who has been incarcerated for 25 years and is part of a civic engagement group at San Quentin, said he did feel society\u2019s views on the purpose of the criminal justice system are shifting. He noted how, 20 years ago, the system was primarily focused on punishment, with little interest in getting people ready to come home. Last year, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, renamed San Quentin a \u201crehabilitation center\u201d, pledging to turn the prison into a complex resembling a college campus focused on programming and re-entry. It\u2019s just another reason why efforts like the mock election matter, Venegas argued. \u201cPeople are starting to listen to us and care about having us as neighbors when we get out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo our voices really matter \u2026 and I\u2019d give anything to be able to vote and have a say.\u201d Juan Moreno Haines is an incarcerated journalist at San Quentin and editor-in-chief of Solitary Watch.

They hit it off and Ivan hires Ani for a week, drastically upending her life: she goes from living in a shared apartment, bickering about why there\u2019s no milk in the fridge, to padding around a mansion with a lift, daily maid service and a cryotherapy chamber.

His films, which include <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/15/tangerine-review-sean-baker-la\">Tangerine</a></em> (2015), <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/12/the-florida-project-review-sunshine-state-of-mind\">The Florida Project</a></em> (2017) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/red-rocket-review-sean-baker-predatory-past-it-porn-star\">Red Rocket</a></em> (2022), unfailingly give dignity, nuance and humour to those labouring in the underground strata of American life. He told <em>Sight and Sound</em> magazine recently that the characters in his movies were \u201cpeople who hold their own wherever they go, have street smarts and are scrappy. They won\u2019t necessarily start a fight, but they will know <em>how</em> to fight should they be provoked.\u201d</p> <p>So it is with Ani in <em>Anora</em>. Baker had been wanting to make a film set in Brighton Beach, a tough area of Brooklyn with a large Russian-speaking community, for more than 15 years, but the idea fell into place in an unexpected way. Watching the reboot of the slasher classic <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/16/scream-review-the-smartest-funniest-instalment-since-the-original\">Scream</a></em> on opening weekend in 2022, he was struck by the actor playing the Ghostface killer. Then he remembered he had seen her before: Madison has a small but eye-catching role \u2013 she\u2019s torched by Leonardo DiCaprio with a flame-thrower \u2013 in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/18/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt\">Once Upon A Time</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/18/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt\"> in Hollywood</a></em>. Baker invited Madison for coffee and said he wanted her to take the lead in his new film, which at that point he hadn\u2019t written.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>It comes down to that it factor,\u201d Baker said recently on why he picked Madison. \u201cYou just see somebody and instantly know that you want to see more of them or that they deserve to be on the big&nbsp;screen.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting was life-changing for Madison: Baker\u2019s <em>Tangerine</em>, a buddy comedy about transgender sex workers in LA, which he shot on iPhones, is one of her favourites. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a director see something in me before that made him want to write a script for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I wondered what Sean saw in me that made him think I could possibly play Ani, because it\u2019s such a departure from my previous work. I almost feel he was blindly trusting me with this character. But it\u2019s a testament to his creative vision, where he\u2019s able to be like, \u2018Oh, she can do this, even though I haven\u2019t seen it. I think she&nbsp;can.\u2019\u201d</p>    <p>More than that, Ani is markedly different from Madison herself. \u201cOh, in every possible way,\u201d she says.<strong> </strong>\u201cShe\u2019s a hustler. She\u2019s constantly going. She says everything that\u2019s on her mind. She\u2019s very boisterous and scrappy and has so much attitude. And she has this incredible fighting spirit that I really admire, and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s me at all. In terms of energy, I\u2019m a lower-energy person. I just move through the world in a slower manner.\u201d</p> <p>A year after their first meeting, Baker came back to Madison with a script. She threw herself into the preparations immediately and with fierce intent. Ani is Russian-American and was supposed to speak a smattering of Russian, so Madison started taking lessons, downloaded Duolingo, and took to listening to hours of Russian recordings from when she was making coffee in the morning until she went to sleep. She also moved to Brighton Beach a month before <em>Anora</em> starting shooting to nail that accent.</p> <p>\u201cI walked away from my first two-hour Russian session and I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m not going to be able to do that,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI can\u2019t learn a new language for a film. Who does that? That\u2019s insane! I\u2019m a stubborn person, but I am in disbelief that I was able to do it in the end.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Baker created a list of books and films on sex work for Madison to immerse herself in. The most influential was the memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/21/andrea-werhun-modern-whore-a-memoir-interview\">Modern Whore</a></em>, written in 2018 by the Toronto-based former dancer and escort Andrea Werhun, who became a consultant on <em>Anora</em>. \u201cI really connected to her in a way,\u201d says Madison. \u201cAnd I thought that Ani could possibly relate to her, because I liked her sense of humour and the way that she was talking about sex work and how she enjoyed it. And I think Ani is someone who enjoys her sexuality and sex, and so it was nice to read that perspective. Yeah, I wanted it to be, like, joyful.\u201d</p>    <p>Then, once Madison\u2019s father had put up the dancer\u2019s pole, came months of physical preparation. Ani spends very little of <em>Anora</em> on the pole \u2013 only a few moments \u2013 but the scene is a crucial one. \u201cPole dancing is very physically demanding, in a way I never expected because they make it look so effortless and beautiful and sexy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo even if it\u2019s just for a couple of seconds, you see Ani upside down and what she\u2019s able to do, and immediately you have some idea of how long she\u2019s been dancing, how hard she trains. You know she\u2019s a seasoned dancer. All of that adds layers and depth to the character and to that world.\u201d</p> <p>A recent screening of <em>Anora</em> for sex workers in Los Angeles was a real highlight for Madison. \u201cI definitely felt a responsibility to that community while filming,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the reaction that we got afterwards was incredible, so overwhelmingly positive. People were like, \u2018I know your character. She\u2019s my best friend at the club.\u2019 Everyone saw a piece of themselves in the character or in other characters.\u201d</p> <p>Madison was raised in LA, but her acting origin story is far from the typical one. She lived in the valley, on the rural edges north of the city, and her parents had no connection with entertainment: both are psychologists; her father specialises in schizophrenia and her mother works mostly with children. Madison has two older sisters and two brothers, one of whom is her twin. Before the inevitable question comes, she notes they are not much&nbsp;alike.</p>    <p>\u201cHe went to school for mathematics basically, and now he works in finance, so he\u2019s a math guy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd physically we look \u2026 people thought I was adopted growing up. That was my family\u2019s joke, that I\u2019m adopted. So much so, because I look like nobody in my family, I got a DNA test. And I\u2019m not adopted. I can show you if you want.\u201d</p> <p>Madison scrolls through her phone and finds some family photographs: it\u2019s true, they all have bright red hair, an extreme contrast to her raven-black tresses, wide mouth and intense, dark eyes. \u201cMy brother and I are really close, but mentally, it\u2019s such different parts of the brain that we use.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, Madison\u2019s thing \u2013 like her mother and grandmother before her \u2013 was horse riding. She started being home-schooled to ride more, spending most of her days at the barn looking after her horse. In the evenings, she would watch films, often with her dad, who liked Marilyn Monroe, Tarantino, Bond movies, all sorts. Madison particularly recalls watching <em>Stand By Me</em> when she was 11, and Jennifer Lawrence in <em>The Hunger Games</em> a while after. Aged 14, she decided that she wanted to give acting a&nbsp;shot.</p> <p>Her break came a couple of years later in 2016 when she was cast in <em>Better Things</em>, a new sitcom from Pamela Adlon and Louis CK. The show, about a working single mum (Adlon) and her three, volatile daughters (Madison\u2019s character, Max, is the eldest), ran for five seasons. \u201cThat show was my film school, my college, and I learned a lot about acting too, certainly,\u201d she&nbsp;says.</p> <p>Even better, though, was being cast as Sadie, an acolyte of Charles Manson, in Tarantino\u2019s 2019 <em>Once Upon a Time</em><em> in Hollywood</em>. When the director\u2019s previous film had been released \u2013 <em>The Hateful Eight</em> in 2015 \u2013 Madison had travelled to New York with her father to watch it. She kept the ticket stub in her wallet for years and, without realising it, even had it in there when she was auditioning for Tarantino.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always felt that we were making something special. I always knew it would be at least one person\u2019s favourite movie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was a dream come true,\u201d says Madison of working with Tarantino. \u201cLiterally, he is my hero. I remember watching <em>The Hateful Eight</em> with my dad, and I was getting more serious about acting, and we were like, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to do a movie like this? Ha ha, yeah!\u2019 And then for it to be my first big movie role, that was completely unbelievable and the greatest entry into film for me. But it was also, \u2018OK, well, fuck, I just worked with my hero at 19. What am I going to do&nbsp;now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>A<em>nora</em> is already thrusting Madison into the orbit of a few of her fantasy collaborators: she maintains a Google Doc wishlist of actors and film-makers she wants to work with. She was especially pleased that Gerwig was the head of the jury at Cannes. \u201cThat made me really happy,\u201d says Madison, \u201cbecause I admired her for a long time, especially when I was starting out. Her work spurred me, made me want to become an actress, she was definitely a part of that. So it was really, really cool for her to be the head of the jury and to watch my movie. I was like, \u2018She knows who I am now!\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLhZ8tyVMSc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PLhZ8tyVMSc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLhZ8tyVMSc&amp;rco=1\">Watch a trailer for Anora.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Madison insists that her life hasn\u2019t changed much since Cannes. She\u2019s not signed on to any new projects yet, though she has met \u201csome really wonderful, interesting people\u201d.</p> <p>There may be awards talk around Madison, but she\u2019s not ready to go there yet. \u201cThe film hasn\u2019t even come out,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I always felt that we were making something special. I always knew, no matter what, it would be at least one person\u2019s favourite movie.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever Madison does next, she is striving to find the same intensity of immersion that she had on <em>Anora</em>. She knows it won\u2019t be possible with every project. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t really shove 10lbs of flour into a 5lb sack,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as an actress, it has given me a discipline. And I feel very confident now in my voice: that I have things to share and I have ideas that people should want to&nbsp;hear.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Anora </em>is released in UK and Irish cinemas on 1 November</p></li> </ul>",

Before the inevitable question comes, she notes they are not much alike. \u201cHe went to school for mathematics basically, and now he works in finance, so he\u2019s a math guy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd physically we look \u2026 people thought I was adopted growing up. That was my family\u2019s joke, that I\u2019m adopted. So much so, because I look like nobody in my family, I got a DNA test. And I\u2019m not adopted. I can show you if you want.\u201d Madison scrolls through her phone and finds some family photographs: it\u2019s true, they all have bright red hair, an extreme contrast to her raven-black tresses, wide mouth and intense, dark eyes. \u201cMy brother and I are really close, but mentally, it\u2019s such different parts of the brain that we use.\u201d Growing up, Madison\u2019s thing \u2013 like her mother and grandmother before her \u2013 was horse riding. She started being home-schooled to ride more, spending most of her days at the barn looking after her horse. In the evenings, she would watch films, often with her dad, who liked Marilyn Monroe, Tarantino, Bond movies, all sorts. Madison particularly recalls watching Stand By Me when she was 11, and Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games a while after. Aged 14, she decided that she wanted to give acting a shot. Her break came a couple of years later in 2016 when she was cast in Better Things, a new sitcom from Pamela Adlon and Louis CK. The show, about a working single mum (Adlon) and her three, volatile daughters (Madison\u2019s character, Max, is the eldest), ran for five seasons. \u201cThat show was my film school, my college, and I learned a lot about acting too, certainly,\u201d she says. Even better, though, was being cast as Sadie, an acolyte of Charles Manson, in Tarantino\u2019s 2019 Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. When the director\u2019s previous film had been released \u2013 The Hateful Eight in 2015 \u2013 Madison had travelled to New York with her father to watch it. She kept the ticket stub in her wallet for years and, without realising it, even had it in there when she was auditioning for Tarantino. \u201cIt was a dream come true,\u201d says Madison of working with Tarantino. \u201cLiterally, he is my hero. I remember watching The Hateful Eight with my dad, and I was getting more serious about acting, and we were like, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to do a movie like this? Ha ha, yeah!\u2019 And then for it to be my first big movie role, that was completely unbelievable and the greatest entry into film for me. But it was also, \u2018OK, well, fuck, I just worked with my hero at 19. What am I going to do now?\u2019\u201d *** Anora is already thrusting Madison into the orbit of a few of her fantasy collaborators: she maintains a Google Doc wishlist of actors and film-makers she wants to work with. She was especially pleased that Gerwig was the head of the jury at Cannes. \u201cThat made me really happy,\u201d says Madison, \u201cbecause I admired her for a long time, especially when I was starting out. Her work spurred me, made me want to become an actress, she was definitely a part of that. So it was really, really cool for her to be the head of the jury and to watch my movie. I was like, \u2018She knows who I am now!\u2019\u201d Madison insists that her life hasn\u2019t changed much since Cannes. She\u2019s not signed on to any new projects yet, though she has met \u201csome really wonderful, interesting people\u201d. There may be awards talk around Madison, but she\u2019s not ready to go there yet. \u201cThe film hasn\u2019t even come out,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I always felt that we were making something special. I always knew, no matter what, it would be at least one person\u2019s favourite movie.\u201d Whatever Madison does next, she is striving to find the same intensity of immersion that she had on Anora. She knows it won\u2019t be possible with every project. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t really shove 10lbs of flour into a 5lb sack,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as an actress, it has given me a discipline. And I feel very confident now in my voice: that I have things to share and I have ideas that people should want to hear.\u201d Anora is released in UK and Irish cinemas on 1 November",

      "body": "<p>When Laura, 34, was growing up in a genteel neighbourhood in Edinburgh, her parents taught her that the worst thing a person could do was make a show of themselves. \u201cBy that, they meant wearing bright colours, laughing or talking loudly; doing anything at all to attract attention.\u201d</p> <p>Although she deplored their attitude, Laura finds she has inherited their mindset. \u201cThe other Sunday, I had to have a difficult conversation with a neighbour about their incessantly barking dog. They ended up shouting at me and I wanted the earth to swallow me up. There were other people around and I\u2019m sure they were all wondering what I had done to create this scene. I can\u2019t stop replaying it in my mind.\u201d</p> <p>It can be a challenge to feel comfortable taking up space in the world. Anxiety about saying or doing the wrong thing can prevent us from saying anything at all, let alone feeling relaxed and confident. No one wants to be mocked for being \u201cextra\u201d, but is there a happy medium?</p> <p>Therapists have a name for this fear of exposure: self-focused attention. \u201cIt\u2019s a very common symptom of social phobia and anxiety,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.mitamistry.co.uk\">Mita Mistry</a>, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapist. \u201cIt\u2019s when an individual believes everyone is looking at them and judging them negatively. Typically, they will do a postmortem after an interaction or event, magnifying every last detail.</p> <p>\u201cIf this sounds familiar, my advice would be to remember that most people are so preoccupied with their own problems that they\u2019re not even going to notice what you\u2019re worrying about. Most people are too busy looking at their phones anyway.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I start to feel a lack of confidence again, I remind myself that there are so very many kind people out there</p> <footer> <cite>Karim Ullah</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mistry advises people to become more aware of their thoughts when they start to worry about how they are perceived. \u201c<a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/11/wandering-mind-not-a-happy-mind/\">A Harvard study</a> found that our brains are on autopilot 46.9% of the time. Basically, that means your mind is wandering unconsciously on to things other than what you are doing. It\u2019s this mode that needs to be kept in check for people who struggle with lack of confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Common mental scripts Mistry hears include \u201cI\u2019m going to look ridiculous\u201d, \u201cpeople are going to be talking about me\u201d and \u201cno one is going to like me\u201d. \u201cAs soon as you notice those thoughts popping up, you can reframe the narrative and turn it into a positive,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, \u2018what if they don\u2019t like me?\u2019 can be reframed as \u2018what if I make some amazing new friends tonight?\u2019 Or \u2018what if I bump into someone I haven\u2019t seen for ages?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For some people, extreme discomfort with taking up space can affect multiple areas of their life. James Bore, 41, a cybersecurity consultant, has always struggled with timidity. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when I found it easy to introduce myself to other people; I find it incredibly difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cWith romance and dating, I was a late bloomer, but luckily I met my wife of seven years online. It takes a huge effort for me to start a conversation or to talk to someone at all. I feel extremely awkward, uncomfortable and embarrassed. I get all these intrusive thoughts like: oh, they don\u2019t really want to talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>Since childhood, Bore has been teased about his surname. \u201cWhen I even think about approaching someone I don\u2019t know, I get the feeling that I\u2019m an intruder in the space. I feel like no one wants to waste time engaging with me. I know objectively that isn\u2019t true, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d However, he has learned to head off the \u201cbore\u201d wisecracks by making a joke about it himself. \u201cI\u2019ve even used it in my company motto: \u2018If your security isn\u2019t boring, you\u2019re doing it wrong\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Bore has found an unlikely remedy for his social awkwardness in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-speak-like-bore-james-bore\">public speaking</a>. \u201cIt sounds paradoxical, but if I\u2019m booked to give a talk, first I\u2019m playing a role and second I feel I have full permission to be there, because people are choosing to listen to me. As a bonus, I\u2019m the speaker, so I don\u2019t need to introduce myself. Instead, after the talk, they usually approach me.\u201d </p> <p>***</p> <p>Feeling comfortable enough to make yourself seen and heard in the workplace can be particularly difficult, given that it could affect your livelihood if things go wrong. \u201cHybrid working and the range of different platform options has made life even harder for people who struggle to speak up,\u201d says <a href=\"https://drjoperkins.com\">Jo Perkins</a>, a chartered counselling and coaching psychologist. The main reason for this, she believes, is that we often move between online meetings without a break. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a chatty brainstorm with colleagues one minute, then have to go one-to-one with the boss, you need a reset between the two \u2013 and, for the latter, a minute to rehearse and perhaps comb your hair.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to speaking up at work, Perkins believes preparation is vital. \u201cDon\u2019t wing it. If you\u2019re going into a high-stakes scenario, figure out beforehand what it is you need to communicate. Also, decide what you are going to wear \u2013 even online, looking the part will boost your confidence. On video, body language is still pivotal. Don\u2019t slouch; try to maintain eye contact.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble with speaking up at meetings is that we often zone out while waiting anxiously for the moment to say our piece. \u201cPeople get scared they will miss their big moment, or that someone else will make the point before they get the chance. The best way to combat anxiety and remain calm is to depersonalise it,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cThink in terms of having something valuable to add, rather than how you are coming across or how your voice sounds. If you\u2019re embarrassed about asking questions, reframe it as needing to know so you can do the best job for the good of the team.\u201d</p>    <p>Above all, Perkins counsels against \u201cdisclaimers\u201d such as \u201cthis might sound a bit silly\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with these; we all use them. But if you want to come across as confident, drop them. Say instead: \u2018Excuse me, can I just press pause for a moment and recap what was said?\u2019 or: \u2018I\u2019m not clear about that point.\u2019 Another good way to interrupt is to say: \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t dither. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a good way to enter the fray and you need to jump in. If you\u2019re really nervous about a workplace interaction, rehearse it with a supportive friend or mentor first.\u201d</p> <p>Finding the right support is what helped Karim Ullah, 51, break through the overwhelming shyness that he had struggled with since changing schools in Lincolnshire: \u201cI went from one school with lots of Asian kids to being one of three. I became the most awkward person you could meet.\u201d</p> <p>Ullah left school without qualifications, which didn\u2019t help his confidence; nor did being exposed to casual racism, often disguised as \u201cbanter\u201d. Then he got a job in the worst possible environment for a timid soul: telephone sales. \u201cIt felt so embarrassing to begin with. Worse, as part of the job, I had to go to networking events and I was too scared to say anything to anyone. I felt sure other people were wondering: who is this oddball?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Challenge yourself gradually to have more interactions and test out expressing your opinions in friendly environments</p> <footer> <cite>Felicity Baker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, though, Ullah was offered mentorship by someone in the industry who spotted his potential. \u201cIn the end, I managed to get so good at phone sales that I was moved into face-to-face selling to companies.\u201d</p> <p>During lockdown, Ullah changed gears and opened a restaurant. Doesn\u2019t he find working in such a social atmosphere jarring? \u201cNo, because now I\u2019m able to offer jobs to young people who struggle with confidence, just like I did. I don\u2019t want to see their dreams shattered just because other pushy people have knocked their self-belief.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m doing it to help others, it takes the pressure off worrying about myself. Whenever I start to feel a lack of confidence again, I remind myself that there are so very many kind people out there. One bad experience doesn\u2019t cancel out all the good people who want to help you.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling daunted about speaking up or being seen often leads to avoidance. When we are dreading the Christmas party, a meeting with the boss or a difficult conversation with a neighbour, \u201cthere\u2019s a powerful desire to put it off or bottle it altogether\u201d, says <a href=\"https://www.ultimateresilience.co.uk/about-us\">Felicity Baker</a>, a clinical psychologist who specialises in resilience. \u201cThe problem with doing that is it <em>does</em> give us immediate relief from anxiety. The next time we encounter a similar situation, our brains and bodies remember it as a threatening scenario and we want to avoid it even more. So the more we avoid, the harder it is to face that situation.\u201d</p> <p>To get out of this vicious cycle, start with small, incremental nudges out of your comfort zone, Baker suggests. For example, if you default to email rather than face-to-face communication, try a phone call. \u201cChallenge yourself gradually to have more interactions and test out expressing your opinions in friendly environments,\u201d she says. \u201cSmall challenges help to build our resilience.\u201d</p> <p>Baker cites the positive psychology guru Martin Seligman\u2019s work on <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/learned-optimism-9781473684317?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">learned optimism</a>. \u201cOptimism is a thinking style that helps us to view difficult events as temporary: X is happening now, but it won\u2019t always be and it isn\u2019t personal to me. For example, if you have a phone call that goes badly, rather than saying: \u2018I\u2019m terrible on the phone,\u2019 tell yourself it was just that one time; remember that you had a call last week that went really well.\u201d</p> <p>Many of us aren\u2019t especially timid by nature, but experience \u201csituational shyness\u201d \u2013 becoming tongue-tied in certain environments. Experts say that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190604-the-science-behind-why-some-of-us-are-shy\">70% of people can be prone to this</a>, with only 30% of shyness being down to genetics.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Alice, 27, a PhD student, says she is usually a confident communicator. However, when she has to stand her ground over money, she turns into \u201ca gibbering wreck\u201d. \u201cOne example is when I had to phone my broadband provider last week,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d hit me with an unaffordable increase. I\u2019d heard that if you rang them you could negotiate a better rate. But when it came to it I ended up agreeing to take a load of TV channels I will never watch, instead of haggling for a discount. I feel so frustrated with myself, because how did all these people boasting online about the great deals they\u2019ve struck have the confidence to do it?\u201d</p> <p>Many people struggle to complain, often veering towards one extreme (shouty, in my case) or another (squeaky mouse). \u201cIt can help to adopt a \u2018negotiative\u2019 style when you\u2019re complaining,\u201d says Baker. \u201cSay I want to express disappointment about poor service in a restaurant. I would start by saying: \u2018I know you\u2019ve put a lot of effort in here, but my chicken isn\u2019t cooked properly.\u2019 It\u2019s about acknowledging the other person\u2019s position, which avoids getting their back up, and remaining calm.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/14/10-ways-more-confident-work-colleagues-positive\">\u2018Hoard evidence of your greatness\u2019: 10 ways to be much more confident at work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you are in a face-to-face situation where you need to negotiate or complain, body language is crucial. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2018/04/03/power-posing-is-back-amy-cuddy-successfully-refutes-criticism/\">Research by Amy Cuddy</a> has shown that by adopting a \u2018power pose\u2019, you can change your confidence and make yourself feel more assertive and more able to express your true self,\u201d says Mistry. \u201cIt expands your chest and it helps your words to come out more clearly.\u201d</p> <p>Baker points out that, by its very nature, complaining is a situation ripe for conflict. \u201cKeep track of your emotional state, so you stay calm. That might involve taking some deep breaths while the other person is speaking, listening to their point of view and not interrupting them or jumping to conclusions. Assertiveness is not about angry altercations; it\u2019s about calmly getting your point across.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes this is easier said than done. A friend of mine is in a conflict with a neighbour. \u201cI have made it clear that I don\u2019t like my son to eat junk food, yet every time he goes round there I discover they\u2019ve had a takeaway,\u201d the friend says. \u201cWhenever I raise the issue, she starts on about random things I do that she\u2019s not happy with.\u201d</p> <p>Baker says this is a familiar tactic: \u201cWhen confronted, people will often try to draw you off the point of your argument. The best way to stand up for yourself is to use the \u2018broken record\u2019 technique \u2013 keep repeating your point over and over until the other person moves towards your position or agrees to negotiate. Yes, it can feel very uncomfortable to do that, but it does stop you getting drawn into irrelevant arguments. Stick to your point, even if it means rephrasing it. You are more likely to get the outcome you want.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, no matter how confident and polished others may seem, it\u2019s worth remembering that you are not alone \u2013 everyone feels like a shrinking violet sometimes. \u201cI\u2019ve coached people who head global companies, who have had the most glittering careers you can imagine,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cOne thing I know for sure: we all have our weak points. We all fear rejection and humiliation.\u201d</p> <p><em>Laura and Alice are pseudonyms</em></p>",

I know objectively that isn\u2019t true, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d However, he has learned to head off the \u201cbore\u201d wisecracks by making a joke about it himself. \u201cI\u2019ve even used it in my company motto: \u2018If your security isn\u2019t boring, you\u2019re doing it wrong\u2019.\u201d Bore has found an unlikely remedy for his social awkwardness in public speaking. \u201cIt sounds paradoxical, but if I\u2019m booked to give a talk, first I\u2019m playing a role and second I feel I have full permission to be there, because people are choosing to listen to me. As a bonus, I\u2019m the speaker, so I don\u2019t need to introduce myself. Instead, after the talk, they usually approach me.\u201d *** Feeling comfortable enough to make yourself seen and heard in the workplace can be particularly difficult, given that it could affect your livelihood if things go wrong. \u201cHybrid working and the range of different platform options has made life even harder for people who struggle to speak up,\u201d says Jo Perkins, a chartered counselling and coaching psychologist. The main reason for this, she believes, is that we often move between online meetings without a break. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a chatty brainstorm with colleagues one minute, then have to go one-to-one with the boss, you need a reset between the two \u2013 and, for the latter, a minute to rehearse and perhaps comb your hair.\u201d When it comes to speaking up at work, Perkins believes preparation is vital. \u201cDon\u2019t wing it. If you\u2019re going into a high-stakes scenario, figure out beforehand what it is you need to communicate. Also, decide what you are going to wear \u2013 even online, looking the part will boost your confidence. On video, body language is still pivotal. Don\u2019t slouch; try to maintain eye contact.\u201d The trouble with speaking up at meetings is that we often zone out while waiting anxiously for the moment to say our piece. \u201cPeople get scared they will miss their big moment, or that someone else will make the point before they get the chance. The best way to combat anxiety and remain calm is to depersonalise it,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cThink in terms of having something valuable to add, rather than how you are coming across or how your voice sounds. If you\u2019re embarrassed about asking questions, reframe it as needing to know so you can do the best job for the good of the team.\u201d Above all, Perkins counsels against \u201cdisclaimers\u201d such as \u201cthis might sound a bit silly\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with these; we all use them. But if you want to come across as confident, drop them. Say instead: \u2018Excuse me, can I just press pause for a moment and recap what was said?\u2019 or: \u2018I\u2019m not clear about that point.\u2019 Another good way to interrupt is to say: \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea.\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t dither. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a good way to enter the fray and you need to jump in. If you\u2019re really nervous about a workplace interaction, rehearse it with a supportive friend or mentor first.\u201d Finding the right support is what helped Karim Ullah, 51, break through the overwhelming shyness that he had struggled with since changing schools in Lincolnshire: \u201cI went from one school with lots of Asian kids to being one of three. I became the most awkward person you could meet.\u201d Ullah left school without qualifications, which didn\u2019t help his confidence; nor did being exposed to casual racism, often disguised as \u201cbanter\u201d. Then he got a job in the worst possible environment for a timid soul: telephone sales. \u201cIt felt so embarrassing to begin with. Worse, as part of the job, I had to go to networking events and I was too scared to say anything to anyone. I felt sure other people were wondering: who is this oddball?\u201d Eventually, though, Ullah was offered mentorship by someone in the industry who spotted his potential. \u201cIn the end, I managed to get so good at phone sales that I was moved into face-to-face selling to companies.\u201d During lockdown, Ullah changed gears and opened a restaurant. Doesn\u2019t he find working in such a social atmosphere jarring? \u201cNo, because now I\u2019m able to offer jobs to young people who struggle with confidence, just like I did. I don\u2019t want to see their dreams shattered just because other pushy people have knocked their self-belief. \u201cBecause I\u2019m doing it to help others, it takes the pressure off worrying about myself. Whenever I start to feel a lack of confidence again, I remind myself that there are so very many kind people out there. One bad experience doesn\u2019t cancel out all the good people who want to help you.\u201d Feeling daunted about speaking up or being seen often leads to avoidance. When we are dreading the Christmas party, a meeting with the boss or a difficult conversation with a neighbour, \u201cthere\u2019s a powerful desire to put it off or bottle it altogether\u201d, says Felicity Baker, a clinical psychologist who specialises in resilience. \u201cThe problem with doing that is it does give us immediate relief from anxiety. The next time we encounter a similar situation, our brains and bodies remember it as a threatening scenario and we want to avoid it even more. So the more we avoid, the harder it is to face that situation.\u201d To get out of this vicious cycle, start with small, incremental nudges out of your comfort zone, Baker suggests. For example, if you default to email rather than face-to-face communication, try a phone call. \u201cChallenge yourself gradually to have more interactions and test out expressing your opinions in friendly environments,\u201d she says. \u201cSmall challenges help to build our resilience.\u201d Baker cites the positive psychology guru Martin Seligman\u2019s work on learned optimism. \u201cOptimism is a thinking style that helps us to view difficult events as temporary: X is happening now, but it won\u2019t always be and it isn\u2019t personal to me. For example, if you have a phone call that goes badly, rather than saying: \u2018I\u2019m terrible on the phone,\u2019 tell yourself it was just that one time; remember that you had a call last week that went really well.\u201d Many of us aren\u2019t especially timid by nature, but experience \u201csituational shyness\u201d \u2013 becoming tongue-tied in certain environments. Experts say that 70% of people can be prone to this, with only 30% of shyness being down to genetics. *** Alice, 27, a PhD student, says she is usually a confident communicator. However, when she has to stand her ground over money, she turns into \u201ca gibbering wreck\u201d. \u201cOne example is when I had to phone my broadband provider last week,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d hit me with an unaffordable increase. I\u2019d heard that if you rang them you could negotiate a better rate. But when it came to it I ended up agreeing to take a load of TV channels I will never watch, instead of haggling for a discount. I feel so frustrated with myself, because how did all these people boasting online about the great deals they\u2019ve struck have the confidence to do it?\u201d Many people struggle to complain, often veering towards one extreme (shouty, in my case) or another (squeaky mouse). \u201cIt can help to adopt a \u2018negotiative\u2019 style when you\u2019re complaining,\u201d says Baker. \u201cSay I want to express disappointment about poor service in a restaurant. I would start by saying: \u2018I know you\u2019ve put a lot of effort in here, but my chicken isn\u2019t cooked properly.\u2019 It\u2019s about acknowledging the other person\u2019s position, which avoids getting their back up, and remaining calm.\u201d If you are in a face-to-face situation where you need to negotiate or complain, body language is crucial. \u201cResearch by Amy Cuddy has shown that by adopting a \u2018power pose\u2019, you can change your confidence and make yourself feel more assertive and more able to express your true self,\u201d says Mistry. \u201cIt expands your chest and it helps your words to come out more clearly.\u201d Baker points out that, by its very nature, complaining is a situation ripe for conflict. \u201cKeep track of your emotional state, so you stay calm. That might involve taking some deep breaths while the other person is speaking, listening to their point of view and not interrupting them or jumping to conclusions. Assertiveness is not about angry altercations; it\u2019s about calmly getting your point across.\u201d Sometimes this is easier said than done. A friend of mine is in a conflict with a neighbour. \u201cI have made it clear that I don\u2019t like my son to eat junk food, yet every time he goes round there I discover they\u2019ve had a takeaway,\u201d the friend says. \u201cWhenever I raise the issue, she starts on about random things I do that she\u2019s not happy with.\u201d Baker says this is a familiar tactic: \u201cWhen confronted, people will often try to draw you off the point of your argument. The best way to stand up for yourself is to use the \u2018broken record\u2019 technique \u2013 keep repeating your point over and over until the other person moves towards your position or agrees to negotiate. Yes, it can feel very uncomfortable to do that, but it does stop you getting drawn into irrelevant arguments. Stick to your point, even if it means rephrasing it. You are more likely to get the outcome you want.\u201d Ultimately, no matter how confident and polished others may seem, it\u2019s worth remembering that you are not alone \u2013 everyone feels like a shrinking violet sometimes. \u201cI\u2019ve coached people who head global companies, who have had the most glittering careers you can imagine,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cOne thing I know for sure: we all have our weak points. We all fear rejection and humiliation.\u201d Laura and Alice are pseudonyms",

      "body": "<p>Approaching Stuart Grannen\u2019s home is an experience in itself, marked by the unexpected. Tucked down an unremarkable alley in the industrial heart of Chicago, this 1900s former charcoal factory stands in quiet contrast to its surroundings. Draped in creeping ivy and raw steel, the concrete structure, hidden in plain sight, exudes an original and raw kind of charm. It\u2019s an urban sanctuary that, from the outside, gives little away. But as you pass through the motorised roll-up door and step inside, a whole new world unfolds \u2013 a world crafted with intention, history and a deep respect and love for imperfection.</p> <p>Grannen, globally known as one of the foremost dealers in architectural artefacts, has spent decades amassing a collection of antiques and rare objects that stretch across continents and centuries. His store, <a href=\"https://architecturalartifacts.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopKqqBH7BdFFw7R5Wqg7CidN18ykFjroxBpdVm5JDSzQDz4E1Fa\">Architectural Artifacts</a>, is housed in a 37,000sqft former school, where the grandiosity of his business is on full display. But Grannen\u2019s home, by contrast, offers an intimate glimpse into his personal world, one shaped by a profound love for simplicity, decay and the art of living with objects that carry a past.</p>    <p>\u201cThe building was a wreck the first time I saw it,\u201d Grannen recalls with a laugh. \u201cDirt floors, broken windows, the works. But I immediately saw its beauty. I could picture it cleaned up, modernised, but still very much an old factory building.\u201d He left the walls, floors and ceilings largely untouched, allowing the factory\u2019s original patina to remain intact. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to strip it of its character,\u201d he explains.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I saw its beauty. I could picture it modernised, but still an old factory building. I didn\u2019t want to lose its character</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Walking through the home, that vision is clear. It is a haven of raw materials, muted colours and subtle textures. The interiors are minimalist and yet rich, each room punctuated by carefully curated artefacts, curiosities and pieces from Grannen\u2019s travels around the globe. His home isn\u2019t cluttered with traditional art or overdone shiny furnishings; instead, it is filled with objects that seem to have found their place naturally.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m drawn to things that are unusual or discarded and I like to weave them into my home in a way that feels effortless,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing too fancy, just fun and friendly pieces.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe that this space, so serene and thoughtfully arranged, was once at the heart of an industrial wasteland. \u201cNow, it\u2019s becoming one of Chicago\u2019s newest and most vibrant neighbourhoods. I see it as a good thing, although it\u2019s funny to think that, after all these years of being surrounded by industry, I\u2019m suddenly in the middle of a massive urban revitalisation.\u201d</p>    <p>The layout of the home is simple. Spread across 5,000sqft, including outdoor living areas, it retains the factory\u2019s original proportions. The first floor features three large, light-filled rooms with iron-framed industrial windows that let in ample natural light.

      "bodyText": "Approaching Stuart Grannen\u2019s home is an experience in itself, marked by the unexpected. Tucked down an unremarkable alley in the industrial heart of Chicago, this 1900s former charcoal factory stands in quiet contrast to its surroundings. Draped in creeping ivy and raw steel, the concrete structure, hidden in plain sight, exudes an original and raw kind of charm. It\u2019s an urban sanctuary that, from the outside, gives little away. But as you pass through the motorised roll-up door and step inside, a whole new world unfolds \u2013 a world crafted with intention, history and a deep respect and love for imperfection. Grannen, globally known as one of the foremost dealers in architectural artefacts, has spent decades amassing a collection of antiques and rare objects that stretch across continents and centuries. His store, Architectural Artifacts, is housed in a 37,000sqft former school, where the grandiosity of his business is on full display. But Grannen\u2019s home, by contrast, offers an intimate glimpse into his personal world, one shaped by a profound love for simplicity, decay and the art of living with objects that carry a past. \u201cThe building was a wreck the first time I saw it,\u201d Grannen recalls with a laugh. \u201cDirt floors, broken windows, the works. But I immediately saw its beauty. I could picture it cleaned up, modernised, but still very much an old factory building.\u201d He left the walls, floors and ceilings largely untouched, allowing the factory\u2019s original patina to remain intact. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to strip it of its character,\u201d he explains. Walking through the home, that vision is clear. It is a haven of raw materials, muted colours and subtle textures. The interiors are minimalist and yet rich, each room punctuated by carefully curated artefacts, curiosities and pieces from Grannen\u2019s travels around the globe. His home isn\u2019t cluttered with traditional art or overdone shiny furnishings; instead, it is filled with objects that seem to have found their place naturally. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to things that are unusual or discarded and I like to weave them into my home in a way that feels effortless,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing too fancy, just fun and friendly pieces.\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe that this space, so serene and thoughtfully arranged, was once at the heart of an industrial wasteland. \u201cNow, it\u2019s becoming one of Chicago\u2019s newest and most vibrant neighbourhoods. I see it as a good thing, although it\u2019s funny to think that, after all these years of being surrounded by industry, I\u2019m suddenly in the middle of a massive urban revitalisation.\u201d The layout of the home is simple. Spread across 5,000sqft, including outdoor living areas, it retains the factory\u2019s original proportions. The first floor features three large, light-filled rooms with iron-framed industrial windows that let in ample natural light. An outdoor courtyard, hidden from view, leads into the house, creating a sense of seclusion. As for the kitchen: \u201cI call the kitchen the \u2018K Word\u2019 as I rarely use it.

One of the most remarkable aspects of <a href=\"https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/publications/guides/private-members-bill-procedure-in-the-house-of-commons\">private members\u2019 bills</a> is that they can be given legislative time with only a vague title: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/16/what-is-the-background-to-the-mps-vote-on-assisted-dying\">second reading</a> of this one is scheduled for 29 November \u2013 and it could make it on to the statute book early next year \u2013 but its content has yet to be published. Its supporters insist that there have been years of debate about assisted dying \u2013 but not in the context of a seemingly imminent change in the law (only now, for example, are we <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/spare-us-from-killing-our-own-patients-plead-doctors-stf8cbp9n\">hearing from doctors</a> who think that a new NHS \u201cassisted dying service\u201d might be required).</p> <p>So why the rush? Everything is down to Leadbeater being one of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy84myxm4l0o\">20 MPs</a> picked at random to pilot their own legislation, and the fact that the prime minister, Keir Starmer, was pushed into <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/esther-rantzen-keir-starmer-bill-prime-minister-ed-miliband-b2623901.html\">giving her bill time</a> by a pledge he made to the broadcaster Esther Rantzen, who has incurable lung cancer. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that I\u2019m able, as it were, to make good on the promise I made,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/assisted-dying-bill-parliament-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp\">Too many people have been condemned to die in misery and pain.

And one very strange aspect of the story is incontestable: though there are important voices \u2013 such as those of disabled people \u2013 who are likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/08/assisted-dying-bill-reject\">feel excluded</a>, others are entitled to a level of involvement that beggars belief. They include such members of the House of Lords as the London Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev, the former cricketer Ian Botham and good old Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p> <p>Those people may or may not speak in a debate, or even vote. But others definitely will \u2013 not least the 26 Church of England bishops and archbishops <a href=\"https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/lords-spiritual-in-the-house-of-lords-explained/\">who sit</a> in the upper house. Their role is weird. For not only do they represent a faith group that now has fewer than <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/media/press-releases/weekly-church-attendance-five-cent-third-year-consecutive-growth\">700,000 weekly worshippers</a>, but most of their shrunken flock actually seems to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/30/assisted-suicide-poll-religious\">back changing the law</a>. Still, these senior Anglicans are set to kick up quite a hostile stink.</p> <p>Plenty of pro-Leadbeater campaigners will argue that it is best to keep your eyes on the prize, and ignore all the eccentric nonsense required to win. But by shining light on the awfulness of our legislative process, this story surely demonstrates not just why the current debate is unlikely to do justice to any of the arguments about assisted dying, but also the reasons why so many other broken and unresolved aspects of our national life remain in that state.</p>    <p>Governments tend to be risk-averse \u2013 and wary of big and complicated issues. Eight years ago, the fact that David Cameron decided to retreat from the responsibilities of leadership and subject one such headache to a binary vote triggered <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-uk-economy-almost-ps140billion-smaller-because-brexit#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20new%20research,value%20of%20London's%20economy%20alone.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CI'd%20rather%20not%20be%20talking%20about%20Brexit%20again.\">the disaster of Brexit</a>. Now, the fact that we have no reliable means of hosting informed, nuanced, properly accountable conversations about many areas of policy makes them even more confounding. The result: huge problems continue to pile up, creating the sense of a country that increasingly doesn\u2019t work, and is too frozen by fear to do much about it.</p> <p>We all know the list. Like assisted dying, some of the issues on it are those that governments seemingly dare not touch \u2013 most obviously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/13/legalise-drugs-john-gray\">laws on drugs</a> that are not just absurd, but hugely socially damaging. But others highlight something arguably even more dysfunctional: problems that politicians talk about a lot, but never get to grips with.</p> <p>This government is the latest one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/31/social-care-chiefs-labour-pledges-cap-costs\">to postpone reform</a> of a creaking adult social care model. That problem is partly rooted in the fact that our random archipelago of regional and local government is an underfunded, baffling mess, full of bankrupt or near-bankrupt councils, some areas that elect mayors while others don\u2019t, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/30/wales-council-tax-england-real-levelling-up\">an archaic council tax</a> that Westminster will not touch.</p> <p>And so the issues go on. We have a police service that seems to bounce from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/05/police-still-suffering-damage-uk-government-cuts-funding-crisis\">crisis</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/09/more-than-150-met-officers-investigated-over-sexual-misconduct-or-racism\">disgrace</a> with no real sign of any systemic answers. And even as the climate emergency worsens, there is still no consensus about how our society and economy needs to change to deal with it.</p> <p>There are traditional ways of trying to make progress in difficult circumstances: a government sets up a <a href=\"https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/lln-2020-0094/\">royal commission</a> or official inquiry led by an expert or trusted mediator, which then makes recommendations ministers are duty-bound to accept. But perhaps, these days, we are now too suspicious of supposed elites for that approach to really work. There is also the problem of such bodies\u2019 proposals being ignored: witness the economist Andrew Dilnot\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/briefings/dilnot-commission-report-social-care\">recommendations on social care</a> \u2013 whereby no one would have to pay more than 30% of their savings and assets towards meeting their needs \u2013 which have bounced around Westminster to no avail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/18/grow-up-and-talk-about-social-care-andrew-dilnot-tells-labour-and-tories\">for nearly 15 years</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, there is now constant talk about the use of citizens\u2019 assemblies, based on the understanding that when people listen to different viewpoints and share each other\u2019s company, seemingly intractable problems start to become soluble.</p> <p>Six years ago, thanks to Ireland\u2019s creation in 2016 of a hugely important <a href=\"https://involve.org.uk/news-opinion/opinion/citizens-assembly-behind-irish-abortion-referendum\">official citizens\u2019 assembly</a>, this was the way that an era-defining shift on abortion happened. As one account <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/the-irish-abortion-referendum-how-a-citizens-assembly-helped-to-break-years-of-political-deadlock/\">later put it</a>: \u201cIt only took 99 ordinary citizens to help break years of political deadlock and reach a consensus on this highly polarising issue.\u201d</p> <p>Subsequent assemblies have explored the use of referendums, <a href=\"https://citizensassembly.ie/previous-assemblies/assembly-on-drugs-use/\">drug use</a>, an ageing society and the policy implications of climate change. All this has the scent of the political future \u2013 which is one of the reasons why, in the UK, many green activists are insistent that meaningful climate action will only become politically possible if a citizens\u2019 assembly is at the heart of the relevant decisions.</p> <p>In the meantime, the story of Leadbeater\u2019s bill surely confirms one thing beyond doubt. Whether or not she succeeds, this ought to be the last big push for social change that involves a mixture of accident, senior politicians\u2019 encounters with famous people, and clerics and speciously appointed peers having more of a say than people who need to be heard.</p> <p>It is time we had a 21st-century system of collective decision-making; without one, the problems that so terrify our politicians will only get worse.</p> <ul> <li><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Governments tend to be risk-averse \u2013 and wary of big and complicated issues. Eight years ago, the fact that David Cameron decided to retreat from the responsibilities of leadership and subject one such headache to a binary vote triggered the disaster of Brexit. Now, the fact that we have no reliable means of hosting informed, nuanced, properly accountable conversations about many areas of policy makes them even more confounding. The result: huge problems continue to pile up, creating the sense of a country that increasingly doesn\u2019t work, and is too frozen by fear to do much about it. We all know the list. Like assisted dying, some of the issues on it are those that governments seemingly dare not touch \u2013 most obviously laws on drugs that are not just absurd, but hugely socially damaging. But others highlight something arguably even more dysfunctional: problems that politicians talk about a lot, but never get to grips with. This government is the latest one to postpone reform of a creaking adult social care model. That problem is partly rooted in the fact that our random archipelago of regional and local government is an underfunded, baffling mess, full of bankrupt or near-bankrupt councils, some areas that elect mayors while others don\u2019t, and an archaic council tax that Westminster will not touch. And so the issues go on. We have a police service that seems to bounce from crisis to disgrace with no real sign of any systemic answers. And even as the climate emergency worsens, there is still no consensus about how our society and economy needs to change to deal with it. There are traditional ways of trying to make progress in difficult circumstances: a government sets up a royal commission or official inquiry led by an expert or trusted mediator, which then makes recommendations ministers are duty-bound to accept. But perhaps, these days, we are now too suspicious of supposed elites for that approach to really work. There is also the problem of such bodies\u2019 proposals being ignored: witness the economist Andrew Dilnot\u2019s recommendations on social care \u2013 whereby no one would have to pay more than 30% of their savings and assets towards meeting their needs \u2013 which have bounced around Westminster to no avail for nearly 15 years. Elsewhere, there is now constant talk about the use of citizens\u2019 assemblies, based on the understanding that when people listen to different viewpoints and share each other\u2019s company, seemingly intractable problems start to become soluble. Six years ago, thanks to Ireland\u2019s creation in 2016 of a hugely important official citizens\u2019 assembly, this was the way that an era-defining shift on abortion happened. As one account later put it: \u201cIt only took 99 ordinary citizens to help break years of political deadlock and reach a consensus on this highly polarising issue.\u201d Subsequent assemblies have explored the use of referendums, drug use, an ageing society and the policy implications of climate change. All this has the scent of the political future \u2013 which is one of the reasons why, in the UK, many green activists are insistent that meaningful climate action will only become politically possible if a citizens\u2019 assembly is at the heart of the relevant decisions. In the meantime, the story of Leadbeater\u2019s bill surely confirms one thing beyond doubt. Whether or not she succeeds, this ought to be the last big push for social change that involves a mixture of accident, senior politicians\u2019 encounters with famous people, and clerics and speciously appointed peers having more of a say than people who need to be heard. It is time we had a 21st-century system of collective decision-making; without one, the problems that so terrify our politicians will only get worse. John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, has vowed that Hamas will fight on. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah continues to carry out rocket attacks into Israel. There were reports on Sunday of \u201cintense bombing\u201d and gunfire at Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza. Last week, the US warned Israel that it faced losing the transfer of American weapons if it did not take immediate action to let more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory said on Sunday that not enough aid was being allowed in and that it could not \u201crun a humanitarian operation at the scale needed with just a few unreliable and poorly accessible crossing points\u201d.",

I moved into film, which is pretty shitty, but I liked the art world even less.\u201d</p> <p>He stuck with his puzzle business even as he moved from directing adverts to feature films, though Broxton took a more hands-on role. At the time, the company had hits with its liquid geometry range \u2013 quintessentially 1980s liquid puzzles featuring caviar tins, Perrier and champagne bottles \u2013 and magnetic kinetic sculptures including magnetic pyramid clips and the toy <a href=\"https://loncrainebroxton19691997.wordpress.com/2018/03/19/lb-the-magnetic-feel/\">Magnetic Feel</a>.</p> <p>Loncraine, meanwhile, directed Michael Palin and Maggie Smith in <em>The Missionary</em> in 1982 and the award-winning <em>Richard III</em>, made with Ian McKellen and Richard Eyre.</p> <p>On TV, he is best known for <em>The Gathering Storm</em> in 2002, and <em>The Special Relationship</em> in 2010, the latter written by Peter Morgan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/19/fidget-spinners-are-not-just-a-fad-ask-any-ballpoint-pen-clicker\">Fidget spinners are not just a fad \u2013 ask any ballpoint-pen clicker | Katherine Isbister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRidley Scott took me to lunch to ask me how to get into the film business,\u201d Loncraine recalled. \u201cThat turned out quite well.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of executive toys was a little tired by the 1990s, and the company overexpanded, then made some \u201cstupid\u201d financial decisions and was wound up in 1997.</p> <p>Loncraine still has all the prototypes and samples in his attic and has recently looked at them for the first time in 25 years.

His work appeared alongside pieces by Yoko Ono and Takis in group shows during the 1960s. \u201cI became successful but I wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d he said. \u201cI also didn\u2019t like the art world so I got out. I moved into film, which is pretty shitty, but I liked the art world even less.\u201d He stuck with his puzzle business even as he moved from directing adverts to feature films, though Broxton took a more hands-on role. At the time, the company had hits with its liquid geometry range \u2013 quintessentially 1980s liquid puzzles featuring caviar tins, Perrier and champagne bottles \u2013 and magnetic kinetic sculptures including magnetic pyramid clips and the toy Magnetic Feel. Loncraine, meanwhile, directed Michael Palin and Maggie Smith in The Missionary in 1982 and the award-winning Richard III, made with Ian McKellen and Richard Eyre. On TV, he is best known for The Gathering Storm in 2002, and The Special Relationship in 2010, the latter written by Peter Morgan. \u201cRidley Scott took me to lunch to ask me how to get into the film business,\u201d Loncraine recalled. \u201cThat turned out quite well.\u201d The idea of executive toys was a little tired by the 1990s, and the company overexpanded, then made some \u201cstupid\u201d financial decisions and was wound up in 1997. Loncraine still has all the prototypes and samples in his attic and has recently looked at them for the first time in 25 years. He thinks there would still be a market for them today in a world where stress balls, fidget spinners and offices featuring table football are now the norm. \u201cNo one remembers me for my films,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the idea that I might get to be remembered for designing the Ballrace instead.\u201d Loncraine Broxton: Innovations &amp; Executive Toys 1969-1997 by Richard Loncraine and Peter Broxton (Four Corners Books, \u00a315).

      "bodyText": "It was a simple pledge made amid the excitement of a landmark moment in space exploration: \u201cWe go together,\u201d Bill Nelson, the head of Nasa, promised the world as the agency prepared to launch Artemis 1, its first moon-capable rocket in more than half a century. Now, nearly two years on from that successful uncrewed mission, and as the US \u2013 despite delays \u2013 edges ever closer to placing humans on the lunar surface for the first time since 1972, the resonance of Nelson\u2019s message has become clear. Nasa has matched its giant leaps in space with less prominent, but equally significant, smaller steps on the ground, signing up almost a quarter of the world\u2019s nations to the Artemis Accords, a global alliance setting guiding principles for the peaceful future exploration of deep space. The expansion of its diplomatic reach has quickened significantly in recent months, with 12 of the now 45 signatories joining since January. Estonia became the most recent this week, at the International Astronautical Congress, the world\u2019s largest space conference in Milan, and Nelson is spending his weekend in Bulgaria and Romania, two more members of what he calls the Artemis generation, talking with space and government officials. A diverse range of partners will be crucial, experts say, to Nasa\u2019s plans to land a crew, including the first woman and first person of color on the moon, in 2026, and its longer-range ambitions for reaching Mars. Prior collaboration between nations spawned the international space station, but the scale of the Artemis project is unprecedented. \u201cThis is the US facilitating a global effort to ensure that, with Artemis, we\u2019re not just building better technology, but building a better future,\u201d said Michael Gold, a former Nasa associate administrator for space policy and partnerships and who led its office of international and interagency relations. \u201cAt their core, the Artemis Accords are a preemptive strike against conflict and to ensure we have a peaceful future. As we crafted them, we wanted to ensure they were as inclusive as possible, that any nation which wanted to support responsible, safe and sustainable exploration could do so. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not only take our astronauts to space, but we launch our values of peace, respect for the rule of law, of open science, of sustainable activities. That\u2019s what the accords represent, and that\u2019s something the US, or any one nation, cannot conduct or succeed in on their own.\u201d Notably absent from the list of signatories are China and Russia, who are working together on a proposed international lunar research station (ILRS) for the moon\u2019s south pole by 2035. Nelson has warned China is masking its military ambitions in space through a civilian program, and many observers see the country\u2019s call for 50 countries, including western nations, to join the ILRS project, as a direct challenge to the Artemis Accords. Gold, now chief growth officer at Redwire, a Florida-based leading supplier of infrastructure for the commercial space industry, sees more subtle messaging in the Nasa approach. \u201cSpace is inherently global. There is more that unites us than separates us, for signatories and non-signatories of the accords alike,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember the accords were designed to be a beginning of a discussion, not an ending. They have been tremendously effective in creating momentum for the dialog and norms of behavior in venues like the United Nations involving China and Russia. \u201cAnd because the accords have been signed by 45 nations, if any nation acts in a fashion that is counter to their values, you\u2019ve at least created a context where those kinds of activities would be condemned and viewed as breaking what is quickly becoming traditional international law. \u201cSo even for nations that haven\u2019t signed, the accords are having a substantive and real effect. You can\u2019t force any country to sign, but what we can do is lead by example, show what good looks like, and I believe that has a non-trivial impact.\u201d Giovanni Zanalda, director of Duke University\u2019s Rethinking Diplomacy Program and co-founder of its Space Diplomacy Lab, said Nasa has been particularly successful in attracting smaller countries with no previously apparent interest in space. \u201cSome don\u2019t have space capabilities yet but are interested and excited about joining, to be part of a dialog,\u201d he said. \u201cEven small countries realize they depend on assets in space, satellite data and images for different reasons, agriculture, weather related issues, checking on deforestation trends. So even countries you would not have thought two years ago were so interested in space and the moon, it\u2019s a different situation, it\u2019s a very different world.\u201d Zanalda said the growth of the private space industry, from large players such as SpaceX to smaller start-ups vying for a share, has made the market more global, which, he believes, has fueled the urgency for internationally accepted principles. \u201cCertain governments are investing more and more in these activities, which makes sense because so much of our daily lives, whether we\u2019re in the US, Italy, Rwanda or the Philippines, depends on assets in space.

      "body": "<p>In my childhood homes, I grew up with Korean culture all around me. For years we had a woodblock print of a tiger (intended to ward off evil spirits) on top of our bookcase, a print of the 10 symbols of longevity and a shamanic dance mask of a syphilitic monk mounted on our wall, ancient <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/article/983/silla-pottery/#google_vignette\">Silla</a>-style and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/10/byatt-ceramics-victoria-albert\">celadon</a> pottery on a bookshelf and carved wooden wedding ducks on a side table. All of these things were like background noise to me \u2013 they were just normal.</p> <p>When I was an infant, my father would lift me up and chant the Korean phonemes, \u201c<em>Ga, na, da, ra</em>\u2026\u201d to me to ensure I would be able to pronounce all the sounds of the language. As I grew, he would sing me Korean children\u2019s songs and say rhymes. I still remember all the words to Mountain Rabbit and Forsythia. \u2018\u2018Sythia, sythia, forsythia, pluck one, put it in your mouth.\u201d Still, I used to have trouble pronouncing the plosive letters, of which there are no equivalent in English, and telling the difference between the short and long \u201co\u201d sounds.</p> <p>I also learned how to write Hangul. I remember being about three years old, crouched down in our driveway, making lines and turning them into letters using a stick of chalk. A friend from next door, who was two years older than me, had been drawing little creatures on the asphalt with me before that, but now I was using <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hangul-Korean-alphabet\">Hangul</a> to write \u201cBella\u201d. My friend saw it and asked, \u201cIs that Chinese?\u201d I replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Korean.\u201d She seemed offended to have been wrong. \u201cChinese, Japanese, Korean, it\u2019s all the same thing,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My father would casually mention creatures like goblins or fox demons, or that he had lived for years in a haunted house</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My face first grew hot with anger that became shame as I said nothing. Had I been a bit older, I might have had the knowledge and pride to point out that Hangul was an alphabet, that the letters don\u2019t represent syllables like Chinese characters do, or some such know-it-all thing. But at that age, I couldn\u2019t even understand why anyone would make a blatantly incorrect statement like that. It was strange to see proof of how people could somehow discriminate against something they did not even really know about in the first place.</p> <p><em><strong>A couple of years later,</strong></em> when I was about five, my parents bought me a book about mythology. It felt heavy as an anvil and it was like an arbiter of esoteric knowledge. It was one of my favourite books and I only ever thought of it as \u201cthe big red myth book\u201d. I\u2019d often open it up on the floor of the living room and voraciously consume stories like those of Thoth and Isis or retellings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/05/somehow-i-failed-to-clock-her-magnificence-was-the-worlds-first-literary-hero-a-woman#:~:text=In%20Babylonian%20times%2C%20in%20about,is%20the%20first%20literary%20hero.\">the epic of Gilgamesh</a>, looking at the beautiful photos of murals, carvings, paintings and statues. The book had sections on China, India and Japan, but there was none on Korea.</p> <p>Though they were not to be found in any of my favourite books, I did learn about the myths of Korea over the years, because they were part of my heritage. My father was born in Korea and grew up in a family of storytellers. His mother was a dream interpreter who told fortunes with flower cards, and her eldest brother, my father\u2019s \u201cBig Uncle\u201d, who had narrowly escaped death many times during the Korean war, was a geomancer who read the dragons in the hills to locate auspicious sites for graves and houses. Big Uncle also exorcised ghosts and consulted the <em>I Ching</em>, the ancient Chinese <em>Book of Changes</em>, to foretell the future.</p> <p>My father himself was inspired by storytellers like his uncles to become a folklorist and writer as an adult, so he was always a great resource of Korean folk tales for me. He would casually mention creatures like goblins or fox demons, or that he had lived for years in a house that was said to be haunted. Sometimes, he would tell me stories, like the one about the great quest undertaken by Princess Bari, the mother of Korean shamans.</p> <p>I would reflect on those stories \u2013 both fact and fiction \u2013 about war, long journeys and spirits, questioning if I was even Korean enough, given I was being told these things and not experiencing them directly. With my pale skin, I don\u2019t even look typically Korean. Usually, it\u2019s only the people who are used to seeing mixed-race Koreans who can tell that I\u2019m part-Korean. For example, I had older Korean friends who were my tutors. Some of them had come to the US from Korea to study at a local Quaker school, and I eventually realised that tutoring me was also helping them feel less homesick. They not only taught me the language but Korean culture, too. I remember sitting with them on the floor at the small, ginkgo-wood table my parents had bought from a street vendor in Seoul in the 80s. We would study and eat snacks there. Sometimes my mother would serve us meals with kimchi or make us cucumber pickles, recipes learned from my Korean paternal great-aunt, who had been a famous cook. With my father, I would eat <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-jae-at-untitled-london-seriously-punchy-korean-cooking\">ssam</a> </em>(meat wrapped in a leafy vegetable), with my own-style lamb and rice wrapped in lettuce.</p> <p>My feelings about how Korean I am started to change in adulthood. While I was a student at Vassar College, in New York state, I applied for a work study job in the college\u2019s art museum. During my interview for that position, I had to talk about several objects from different parts of the museum\u2019s collection. One of the objects I chose was in the Asian gallery \u2013 a wooden, once-gilt statuette of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara from a Vietnamese temple. I gave an impromptu lecture about all the different names of this figure, including Gwaneum, the Korean name. I explained that in different countries throughout the world this same deity is a different gender (a man in Vietnam and a woman in Korea, for example) and that Gwaneum is known for rescuing people who have been shipwrecked. It was then I realised that throughout my life, all of these facts had seemed familiar, like common knowledge, forming an essential part of who I am.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I mentioned I was part-Korean, fellow students would say something like, \u2018What do you think of K-pop?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet whenever I ended up mentioning I was part-Korean to fellow students, the response I\u2019d get would be something like, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool, I love K-dramas,\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/k-pop\">K-pop</a>?\u201d When I studied Korean at Vassar, and the professor asked the class why we were taking the course, nearly everyone said they had signed up because they were fans of those genres. I\u2019d seen the change in the people in my hometown, from being ignorant of Korea to being very aware of this aspect of its culture. Today, due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/21/hallyu-the-korean-wave-review-a-dazzling-historical-remix\">the Hallyu phenomenon</a> (also known as the Korean Wave), young people\u2019s sense of Korea\u2019s culture and its folklore is shaped by these exports, but this media is usually tailored to outside audiences, especially western ones. Even films produced for Korean audiences often have English titles phonetically spelled out in Korean. These things made me all the more interested in learning about traditional Korean culture.</p> <p>My first birthday celebration was according to Korean tradition, where the family sets out various objects \u2013 thread, money, rice and a pencil \u2013 and puts them before the baby. Whichever one the child chooses is meant to predict their future: I chose the pencil (a modern substitute for the calligraphy brush), which meant I would become a writer or scholar.</p> <p>As a child, I was far more drawn to visual art than writing, but now I\u2019m equally interested in the latter and I\u2019ve recently co-authored a book with my father in order to introduce Korean folk tales and myths to a new audience. In a sense, this project continues the family tradition of storytelling. I brought my love of mythology and art history, and research methods to it, while my father, a folklorist, shared his knowledge of local legends and his first-hand accounts of Korea in the modern era. We had a vision of the shape of the book from the outset and, each using our favourite fountain pens, co-wrote in longhand an outline of the sections in a loose leaf notebook that we passed back and forth. If it had been 100 years ago, I imagine we would have been grinding ink on an inkstone and writing with calligraphy brushes on mulberry paper.</p> <p>What my picking of the pencil foretold turned out to be true. I now know that I have a lot to share. And while I had no awareness of this back then, now I can see the myths of Korea were always alive all around me and my time absorbed in them was the best preparation to tell the stories I would have loved most as a child. Sometimes, you just have to write the book you needed to read yourself.</p> <p><em>The Korean Myths: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes and Legends by Heinz Insu Fenkl and Bella My\u014fng-w\u014fl Dalton-Fenkl is published by Thames &amp; Hudson at \u00a314.99.

Yet whenever I ended up mentioning I was part-Korean to fellow students, the response I\u2019d get would be something like, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool, I love K-dramas,\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think of K-pop?\u201d When I studied Korean at Vassar, and the professor asked the class why we were taking the course, nearly everyone said they had signed up because they were fans of those genres. I\u2019d seen the change in the people in my hometown, from being ignorant of Korea to being very aware of this aspect of its culture. Today, due to the Hallyu phenomenon (also known as the Korean Wave), young people\u2019s sense of Korea\u2019s culture and its folklore is shaped by these exports, but this media is usually tailored to outside audiences, especially western ones. Even films produced for Korean audiences often have English titles phonetically spelled out in Korean. These things made me all the more interested in learning about traditional Korean culture. My first birthday celebration was according to Korean tradition, where the family sets out various objects \u2013 thread, money, rice and a pencil \u2013 and puts them before the baby. Whichever one the child chooses is meant to predict their future: I chose the pencil (a modern substitute for the calligraphy brush), which meant I would become a writer or scholar. As a child, I was far more drawn to visual art than writing, but now I\u2019m equally interested in the latter and I\u2019ve recently co-authored a book with my father in order to introduce Korean folk tales and myths to a new audience. In a sense, this project continues the family tradition of storytelling. I brought my love of mythology and art history, and research methods to it, while my father, a folklorist, shared his knowledge of local legends and his first-hand accounts of Korea in the modern era. We had a vision of the shape of the book from the outset and, each using our favourite fountain pens, co-wrote in longhand an outline of the sections in a loose leaf notebook that we passed back and forth. If it had been 100 years ago, I imagine we would have been grinding ink on an inkstone and writing with calligraphy brushes on mulberry paper. What my picking of the pencil foretold turned out to be true. I now know that I have a lot to share. And while I had no awareness of this back then, now I can see the myths of Korea were always alive all around me and my time absorbed in them was the best preparation to tell the stories I would have loved most as a child. Sometimes, you just have to write the book you needed to read yourself.

The author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/04/how-i-wrote-the-essex-serpent-sarah-perry\">The Essex Serpent </a></em>is very much alive to the echoes of the dead. \u201cMy approach to time,\u201d she says, cheerfully, \u201cis that I have never felt the present is particularly important.\u201d</p> <p>We are in Norwich, where she lives, in <a href=\"https://www.shikirestaurant.co.uk/\">Shiki</a>, a Japanese restaurant directly opposite the cathedral. Perry has been a regular here for years. \u201cThey used to do a night, I think it was a Tuesday,\u201d she says,- with a giggle, \u201cwhen it was all you can eat. You got given this pile of little scraps of paper, and you would tick what you wanted and give it to the waiter. We never came back for a while after that because we were so embarrassed about how much we\u2019d had. We still have the pile of papers to shame us in my husband\u2019s study.\u201d</p> <p>She orders pretty much from memory \u2013 a bento box \u201cbecause I like the little theatre of it\u201d \u2013, and some sashimi and tempura, and a jug of warm sake. She\u2019s hungry, she says, because she\u2019s just done an hour of weight training, her defence against the \u201ctormenting pain\u201d that immobilised her between the ages of 34 and 38. \u201cI used to see people walking,\u201d she says, \u201cand the act seemed to me as incredible as flight.\u201d She had two conditions. One, the autoimmune disease Graves\u2019 disease for which there is no cure, has been mitigated by drugs. \u201cAnd at the same time,\u201d she says, \u201cin the words of my neurosurgeon, I had the worst imaginable disc rupture in my back and the best imaginable outcome [from surgery], because I can now pick up 115kg. I have a lot of nerve damage in my left leg, and if I don\u2019t weight train, I start falling over, because my foot starts to twist in.\u201d She\u2019s 45 now. \u201cEssentially, I\u2019m so lucky. I feel like I\u2019ve aged backwards.\u201d</p> <p>That period of profound illness, which coincided with Perry\u2019s bestselling breakthrough as a novelist, deepened her instincts toward the gothic that had been shaped by a childhood of strict and cultish religious fervour, in a Calvinist Baptist church in her native Chelmsford, Essex. (\u201cFor example,\u201d she says \u201cif we were on a train on a Saturday and it was delayed, we would get off the train before midnight, so we weren\u2019t making the train driver work on the Lord\u2019s Day\u201d). Those habits of mind have never left her: \u201cChristian thinking is like the vessel into which I\u2019ve been poured,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happens now is I try to think about everything from first principles but there are no first principles. And so in my writing I\u2019m forever circling around precepts of grace and redemption\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Her books are only in the very broadest sense autobiographical, but they each examine in different page-turning ways what she calls \u201cthe split in her consciousness\u201d between faith and doubt, certainty and freedom, that caused her abruptly to leave the church when she was 27, and to follow the alternative vocation that she had felt since she used to make up stories for one of her four older sisters in the bottom bunk of their shared bedroom.</p> <p>Over our lunch, I can begin to imagine the little girl she was; words and stories pour out of her. A friend once told Perry that she was the only person they knew who spoke with semi-colons, and you don\u2019t spend long with her to feel the truth of that. She puts it down to having had to learn big chunks of the King James Bible about as soon as she could speak. Her speech, like her fiction, loops in unexpected directions. By the time our food arrives we have moved from discussion of double decker bento boxes to the great love of her life \u2013 and local hero \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/23/alan-partridge-on-cars-canadians-and-sunday-roasts-im-already-about-70-vegan\">Alan Gordon Partridge</a>, to theoretical physics and its relation \u201cto experiences of the sublime and the ecstatic and the ghostly\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about the material of this room that is ordinary,\u201d she says, waving a chopstick toward the restaurant\u2019s minimalist interior, \u201cif you stop to actually think about what particles are doing.\u201d</p> <p>There is a lovely tension between the cadences of Perry\u2019s chat and the esoterics of her mind. She enjoys her Essex girl heritage and in 2020, three years before becoming chancellor of Essex University, she wrote a sparky and erudite book-length deconstruction of the county caricature of dumb blondes, a stirring manifesto \u201cfor profane and opinionated women everywhere\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The thing about Norwich is that you can\u2019t cross the road without bumping into a writer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That same tension comes across in her books which mix the mundane with the otherworldly.

The author of The Essex Serpent is very much alive to the echoes of the dead. \u201cMy approach to time,\u201d she says, cheerfully, \u201cis that I have never felt the present is particularly important.\u201d We are in Norwich, where she lives, in Shiki, a Japanese restaurant directly opposite the cathedral. Perry has been a regular here for years. \u201cThey used to do a night, I think it was a Tuesday,\u201d she says,- with a giggle, \u201cwhen it was all you can eat. You got given this pile of little scraps of paper, and you would tick what you wanted and give it to the waiter. We never came back for a while after that because we were so embarrassed about how much we\u2019d had. We still have the pile of papers to shame us in my husband\u2019s study.\u201d She orders pretty much from memory \u2013 a bento box \u201cbecause I like the little theatre of it\u201d \u2013, and some sashimi and tempura, and a jug of warm sake. She\u2019s hungry, she says, because she\u2019s just done an hour of weight training, her defence against the \u201ctormenting pain\u201d that immobilised her between the ages of 34 and 38. \u201cI used to see people walking,\u201d she says, \u201cand the act seemed to me as incredible as flight.\u201d She had two conditions. One, the autoimmune disease Graves\u2019 disease for which there is no cure, has been mitigated by drugs. \u201cAnd at the same time,\u201d she says, \u201cin the words of my neurosurgeon, I had the worst imaginable disc rupture in my back and the best imaginable outcome [from surgery], because I can now pick up 115kg.

      "body": "<p>Georgia prosecutors and police have repeatedly stretched the law or come under harsh criticism for their handling of a criminal conspiracy case involving protesters against a police-training center colloquially known as \u201cCop City\u201d, activists and experts say.</p> <p>The case has been pushed so recklessly that one of the subjects of the prosecution told the Guardian that their constitutional rights were being \u201cblatantly violated\u201d, after police took thousands of his personal papers in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/02/atlanta-cop-city-protest-domestic-terrorism-statute\">Swat-style raid</a> last year.</p> <p>Experts have told the Guardian the case is the largest use of so-called Rico statutes against a protest movement in US history. The law has historically been used to prosecute the Mafia or organized crime, but here it is being brought to bear against an environmental and social justice movement.</p> <p>The broad-based movement against the training center, now in its fourth year, has drawn national and global headlines, particularly after police shot and killed Manuel Paez Ter\u00e1n, or \u201cTortuguita\u201d, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/atlanta-cop-city-tortuguita-anniversary\">environmental protester</a> who was camped in a public park near the Cop City site, last year \u2013 the first such incident of its kind in US history.</p> <p>Opposition to the project has come from a wide range of local and national supporters, with concerns such as unchecked police militarization and the clearing of forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police say the center is needed for \u201cworld-class\u201d training.</p> <p>The revelation about police seizing personal papers in apparent violation of the terms of a court-ordered search warrant come from recent courtroom testimon.</p> <p>The hearing on 11 October at the Fulton county superior court was one of several in the last few months where Judge Kimberly Esmond Adams considered motions to dismiss all or parts of the state\u2019s Rico <a href=\"https://www.fultonclerk.org/DocumentCenter/View/2156/CRIMINAL-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> against 61 people, handed down by Georgia attorney general, Chris Carr, on 29 August 2023. It was the first to include multiple state witnesses.</p> <p>Adams expressed concerns about the most recent evidence of state overreach, an apparent violation of the fourth amendment rights of members of the <a href=\"https://atlsolidarity.org/\">Atlanta Solidarity Fund</a>, or ASF, a bail fund whose three members live together in a house that Atlanta police and the Georgia bureau of investigation raided in May 2023.</p> <p>Adams must now decide on a remedy that will not only address the state\u2019s apparent misconduct, but also \u201cdeter future conduct\u201d, as she put it.</p> <p>The case\u2019s trial will not begin until next year, but defense attorneys have filed dozens of motions based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct and other issues with the case \u2013 including several involving the ASF.</p> <p>The most dramatic moment in the all-day hearing occurred when Don Samuel, attorney for the ASF, wheeled 10 file boxes overflowing with papers into the courtroom. Someone had written the Atlanta address of the defendants\u2019 house in black marker on the sides of the boxes.</p> <p>Samuel picked out and held up such items as diaries, letters to a therapist, mammogram results and grade school report cards \u2013 more than 14 in total. With each one, the attorney asked Michael Carter, an agent with the Georgia bureau of investigation, on the witness stand: \u201cWas this legitimate to seize as evidence of charity fraud?\u201d \u2013 the state\u2019s main charge against the bail fund in alleging its participation in a criminal conspiracy.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d the detective repeatedly answered.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no attention paid to what the warrant said,\u201d Samuel asserted. \u201cYou treated it as a key to get in the front door and then do whatever you want [\u2026] You seized everything and then came up with a theory afterward.\u201d Samuel\u2019s motion argued that all evidence gathered during the raid should be excluded from the case.</p> <p>Adams seemed to agree with Samuel\u2019s concern. \u201cIt does seem to me that some items were seized outside the scope of the warrant,\u201d she said, addressing John Fowler, the deputy attorney general. \u201cHow can we deter future conduct? \u2026 How can we put guardrails for law enforcement?\u201d</p> <p>The ASF claims the state has subjected it to additional misconduct, including in a motion Samuel filed in June detailing how Fowler shared with police investigators and defense attorneys emails from two of the fund\u2019s members that contained privileged attorney-client communication. The state obtained the emails through a Google search warrant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/26/cop-city-protesters-atlanta\">The Guardian confirmed</a> the motion\u2019s allegations independently.</p> <p>Samuel petitioned the court in that motion to exclude both the attorney general and the police from continuing to prosecute the case. Adams denied the motion on 30 August, but wrote in her order that she was \u201cextremely troubled by the State\u2019s gross negligence when handling and disclosing potentially privileged communications\u201d and that she may decide in the future to exclude all the emails obtained from trial.</p> <p>\u201c[T]he State is strongly admonished that future misconduct will result in additional sanctions,\u201d she concluded.</p> <p>The most recent hearing also made clear that the state had blown all deadlines to share its multiple terabytes of evidence with defense, as attorneys representing two additional defendants had not received video and audio of their clients until days before.</p> <p>Chris Carraway, attorney for defendant Sonali Gupta, told the Guardian he received 25 gigabytes of evidence concerning his client on the Wednesday before the hearing \u2013 despite the court ordering Fowler to turn over all evidence by 17 May.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see evidence that the prosecution \u2026 is not up to the task they set for themselves,\u201d said Marlon Kautz, a member of the bail fund. \u201cThey\u2019re unable to meet the burden of responsibilities of handling evidence, and just kind of fumbling.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, he said, the state\u2019s case has a real-world impact, including on him and his housemates. The state holding onto their personal papers for more than a year is \u201cbeyond inconvenient. It\u2019s incredibly violating,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just pushing it [the case] along for as long as possible, to cause as much harm as possible to the 61 defendants, and to the movement in general,\u201d he added.</p> <p>As for the Swat-style raid last May, he said: \u201cIt seems clear the police who conducted the raid were not trying to respect the constitutional rights we had \u2013 they\u2019re not only willing to violate our fourth amendment rights, but didn\u2019t even seem aware [in court] that we had those rights.\u201d</p> <p>Kautz hopes the case can \u201cmake an example of instances where rights are blatantly violated \u2026 [and] can establish precedence for how political prosecutions are handled in the future\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Georgia prosecutors and police have repeatedly stretched the law or come under harsh criticism for their handling of a criminal conspiracy case involving protesters against a police-training center colloquially known as \u201cCop City\u201d, activists and experts say. The case has been pushed so recklessly that one of the subjects of the prosecution told the Guardian that their constitutional rights were being \u201cblatantly violated\u201d, after police took thousands of his personal papers in a Swat-style raid last year. Experts have told the Guardian the case is the largest use of so-called Rico statutes against a protest movement in US history. The law has historically been used to prosecute the Mafia or organized crime, but here it is being brought to bear against an environmental and social justice movement. The broad-based movement against the training center, now in its fourth year, has drawn national and global headlines, particularly after police shot and killed Manuel Paez Ter\u00e1n, or \u201cTortuguita\u201d, an environmental protester who was camped in a public park near the Cop City site, last year \u2013 the first such incident of its kind in US history. Opposition to the project has come from a wide range of local and national supporters, with concerns such as unchecked police militarization and the clearing of forests in an era of climate crisis. Atlanta police say the center is needed for \u201cworld-class\u201d training. The revelation about police seizing personal papers in apparent violation of the terms of a court-ordered search warrant come from recent courtroom testimon. The hearing on 11 October at the Fulton county superior court was one of several in the last few months where Judge Kimberly Esmond Adams considered motions to dismiss all or parts of the state\u2019s Rico indictment against 61 people, handed down by Georgia attorney general, Chris Carr, on 29 August 2023. It was the first to include multiple state witnesses. Adams expressed concerns about the most recent evidence of state overreach, an apparent violation of the fourth amendment rights of members of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund, or ASF, a bail fund whose three members live together in a house that Atlanta police and the Georgia bureau of investigation raided in May 2023. Adams must now decide on a remedy that will not only address the state\u2019s apparent misconduct, but also \u201cdeter future conduct\u201d, as she put it. The case\u2019s trial will not begin until next year, but defense attorneys have filed dozens of motions based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct and other issues with the case \u2013 including several involving the ASF. The most dramatic moment in the all-day hearing occurred when Don Samuel, attorney for the ASF, wheeled 10 file boxes overflowing with papers into the courtroom. Someone had written the Atlanta address of the defendants\u2019 house in black marker on the sides of the boxes. Samuel picked out and held up such items as diaries, letters to a therapist, mammogram results and grade school report cards \u2013 more than 14 in total. With each one, the attorney asked Michael Carter, an agent with the Georgia bureau of investigation, on the witness stand: \u201cWas this legitimate to seize as evidence of charity fraud?\u201d \u2013 the state\u2019s main charge against the bail fund in alleging its participation in a criminal conspiracy. \u201cNo,\u201d the detective repeatedly answered. \u201cThere was no attention paid to what the warrant said,\u201d Samuel asserted. \u201cYou treated it as a key to get in the front door and then do whatever you want [\u2026] You seized everything and then came up with a theory afterward.\u201d Samuel\u2019s motion argued that all evidence gathered during the raid should be excluded from the case. Adams seemed to agree with Samuel\u2019s concern. \u201cIt does seem to me that some items were seized outside the scope of the warrant,\u201d she said, addressing John Fowler, the deputy attorney general. \u201cHow can we deter future conduct? \u2026 How can we put guardrails for law enforcement?\u201d The ASF claims the state has subjected it to additional misconduct, including in a motion Samuel filed in June detailing how Fowler shared with police investigators and defense attorneys emails from two of the fund\u2019s members that contained privileged attorney-client communication. The state obtained the emails through a Google search warrant. The Guardian confirmed the motion\u2019s allegations independently. Samuel petitioned the court in that motion to exclude both the attorney general and the police from continuing to prosecute the case. Adams denied the motion on 30 August, but wrote in her order that she was \u201cextremely troubled by the State\u2019s gross negligence when handling and disclosing potentially privileged communications\u201d and that she may decide in the future to exclude all the emails obtained from trial. \u201c[T]he State is strongly admonished that future misconduct will result in additional sanctions,\u201d she concluded. The most recent hearing also made clear that the state had blown all deadlines to share its multiple terabytes of evidence with defense, as attorneys representing two additional defendants had not received video and audio of their clients until days before. Chris Carraway, attorney for defendant Sonali Gupta, told the Guardian he received 25 gigabytes of evidence concerning his client on the Wednesday before the hearing \u2013 despite the court ordering Fowler to turn over all evidence by 17 May. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to see evidence that the prosecution \u2026 is not up to the task they set for themselves,\u201d said Marlon Kautz, a member of the bail fund. \u201cThey\u2019re unable to meet the burden of responsibilities of handling evidence, and just kind of fumbling.\u201d At the same time, he said, the state\u2019s case has a real-world impact, including on him and his housemates. The state holding onto their personal papers for more than a year is \u201cbeyond inconvenient. It\u2019s incredibly violating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just pushing it [the case] along for as long as possible, to cause as much harm as possible to the 61 defendants, and to the movement in general,\u201d he added. As for the Swat-style raid last May, he said: \u201cIt seems clear the police who conducted the raid were not trying to respect the constitutional rights we had \u2013 they\u2019re not only willing to violate our fourth amendment rights, but didn\u2019t even seem aware [in court] that we had those rights.\u201d Kautz hopes the case can \u201cmake an example of instances where rights are blatantly violated \u2026 [and] can establish precedence for how political prosecutions are handled in the future\u201d.",

The policy uses, as one example, how if an LGBTQ+ employee is being bullied by workmates \u2013 even at a non-work event \u2013 it creates a hostile work environment for that employee when they return to the office and have to face their colleagues.</p> <p>It also points out situations in which employees are treated differently because they\u2019re pregnant or practice their religion.

We don\u2019t want to lose good people because they don\u2019t like their work environment. But there\u2019s a line here between harassment \u2013 which is unacceptable \u2013 and just being a bit irritating. Earlier this year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) updated its rules regarding harassment in the workplace. The policy uses, as one example, how if an LGBTQ+ employee is being bullied by workmates \u2013 even at a non-work event \u2013 it creates a hostile work environment for that employee when they return to the office and have to face their colleagues. It also points out situations in which employees are treated differently because they\u2019re pregnant or practice their religion. The policy even goes so far as to warn employers that when employees are on an online meeting they can be subject to a hostile work environment if someone \u2013 even if they\u2019re not an employee of the company \u2013 behaves disrespectfully. The EEOC is putting the onus now on the employer to recognize these situations and deal with them. HR experts are recommending updating policies, getting more training and establishing reporting mechanisms so managers can be avoid \u2013 or at least be aware of \u2013 these problems and address them. No one wants to feel uncomfortable at the office for these reasons. There should be specific policies \u2013 and penalties \u2013 to minimize these types of behaviors. But leaving an empty coffee cup in the conference room after a meeting? Dropping the F-bomb once in a while after a stressful client call? Sharing some office gossip? Who doesn\u2019t do this? I\u2019m guilty. So are you. Do we need to have a specific policy about showing up to meetings on time? And if people do this stuff, does this mean they get reported to HR? That all seems a little extreme to me. The office dynamic is complicated these days. There are now four generations of workers sharing an office. All of these workers have different interpretations of \u201cmanners\u201d. Some boomers I know still expect their co-workers to show up in coats and ties, not sporting tattoos and nose rings and smelling like a cannabis dispensary. Gen X-ers like me are often reprimanded for referring to people as \u201cguys\u201d. Some millennials think that attending a Zoom call with their dog barking in the background is perfectly normal. Younger people think their social justice activism spreads enlightenment throughout the office and is appreciated by their co-workers. And yet we all have to work together. Four generations traveling to trade shows and events, sharing conference rooms and Ubers, meeting on Zoom and Teams and pretending that our manners are fine and it\u2019s the other guy who has a problem. People can be messy. People can be profane. People can be disorganized. People are people. Targeting someone because of their sexual orientation or religion is harassment and there should be zero tolerance for that. But \u201cmanners\u201d is a matter of interpretation, so let\u2019s leave these issues out of policymaking and let the performance review process resolve them.",

The 2006 \u00adcomedy, starring Anne Hathaway as Andy, the put-upon assistant to Meryl Streep\u2019s glacial New York fashion magazine \u00adeditor, Miranda Priestly, was an enormous global hit \u00ad(taking $327m at the box office). As well as the planned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/09/the-devil-wears-prada-sequel-meryl-streep-anne-hathaway-emily-blunt-stanley-tucci\">sequel</a>, there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/feb/19/vanessa-williams-to-star-in-elton-johns-west-end-version-of-the-devil-wears-prada\">stage musical</a> opening at the Dominion theatre in London\u2019s West End at the end of this month, \u00adstarring Vanessa Williams as Priestly, with music by Elton John. Almost two decades after the \u00adoriginal, it appears the \u00adfranchise has been reawakened, but so too have the problematic issues surrounding it.</p> <p>The first point to be made about <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> is that it was, to employ \u00adfashion \u00advernacular, fabulous, \u00addarling! Based on Lauren Weisberger\u2019s 2003 novel, a thinly disguised account of her time working as Anna Wintour\u2019s \u00adassistant at US<em> Vogue</em>, it was a \u00adgenuinely witty film about \u00adfashion which, save for Ben Stiller\u2019s \u00adsublime <em>Zoolander</em>, are surprisingly rare. Curiously, for an industry teeming with big characters, cinematic takes have tended towards the laboured (Robert Altman\u2019s 1994 <em>Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter</em>), the misfiring (2009\u2019s <em>Confessions of a Shopaholic</em>) and the downright dreary (Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019s designer moping about like he\u2019d swallowed a pin cushion in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s <em>Phantom Thread</em> in 2018).</p> <p>Bright, sparky, acid, \u00adglamorous, <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> not only \u00adtiptoed in Louboutin heels past all the usual pitfalls of fashion \u00adcinema, it served up vivid characters: Hathaway\u2019s beleaguered ingenue; Emily Blunt\u2019s patronising Emily, and Stanley Tucci\u2019s gay fashion maven \u2013 roles that turbo-launched their careers into orbit. Streep\u2019s chicly vicious Wintour-esque turn as Priestly won her a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination.</p> <p>Moreover, the film was ultra-female: written by a woman, based on a book by a female author, built almost entirely around \u00admemorable female characters \u2013 none of which should be discounted when Hollywood still tends to view \u201cwomen\u2019s films\u201d with suspicion. There\u2019s much to admire about the comedy. But then it comes to the eating.</p>    <p>Too often, the \u00adattitudes to body standards seem stuck in a sizeist dark ages. In one scene, Andy deprives \u00adherself of a grilled cheese sandwich to fit in with the fashion set. In another, Emily talks about her new diet: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t eat anything, and, when I feel like I\u2019m about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.\u201d And, so on, all played for&nbsp;giggles.</p> <p>It\u2019s wince-making: reminiscent of the 1970s when women were hypnotised into dining on cottage cheese and lettuce leaves to achieve some mythical perfect shape. Even as a satire, <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> tapped into size anxiety, making the \u00adobjectively slim Andy fuss about her perfectly normal appetite. While Andy wasn\u2019t anorexic, she \u00adpersonified that low-grade eating disorder (not unease about eating too much, just about eating) that too often passes for \u201cnormal\u201d. Andy also represented (without the film seeming to realise it) how much fashion/fashion publishing has contributed to that pressure over the years.</p> <p>Even accepting <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> as a film of its time, there were no attempts to counter the size-zero tyranny of the early 00s, when the likes of Nicole Richie \u00adstaggered around with \u00adcavernous sack-like handbags to make themselves look (hurrah!) even thinner. Its own mania for skinniness was so amplified, it arguably glamorised and normalised disordered eating, as much as lampooning it.</p> <p>It would be one thing if this was no longer a problem in our switched-on, size-inclusive times, but it seems all is not well in the arena of body positivity. Recently, there have been complaints from alarmed fashion editors about the return of super-thinness to the Ozempic-infested catwalks. Reportedly, there are visibly skeletal models, some with the hairy arms that are an anorexic \u201ctell\u201d that the starved body is trying to heat itself. <em>Vogue Business</em>\u2019s latest size-\u00adinclusivity report says: \u201cThe body positivity movement has lost steam in mainstream culture as the \u00adpendulum has swung back to the glamorisation of thinness.\u201d</p> <p>So much for \u00ad#bodypos \u2013 it seems that the vogue for emaciation was just lying low, \u00adwaiting for the lip service to size inclusivity to pass. Is this the fault of <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>? Of course not. It isn\u2019t even just the fault of the fashion \u00adindustry. From influencers to TikTok, this poison has spread deep into the \u00adcultural water supply. The \u00adquestion for <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> concerns the changed climate it will be returning to: whether, for instance, the gen Z audience would be in any mood for \u201cnot eating\u201d jokes, should they be included.</p> <p>Another area that might clash with gen Z attitudes is how hard the original film pushes what could be described as the \u00ad\u201ccorporate abuse masquerading as \u00adprofessional audition\u201d theme: newbie Andy grovelling around Miranda Priestly. All of which looks somewhat \u00adjarring, nearly two decades later, when younger generations have been routinely interning for next to nothing, or zilch, conned into working for the exposure or \u00adexperience. And even these young people are viewed as the \u00ad\u201cfortunate\u201d ones who have the \u00adconnections and the family backing to work for next to nothing. While previous generations also \u201cpaid their dues\u201d, this was seen as the nursery slope to professional life, not the whole ski jump.</p>    <p>Enter gen Z: renowned for \u00adhaving a \u201cbratty\u201d, entitled attitude in the workplace, but who can blame them when they\u2019ve seen how \u00adprevious cohorts have been exploited? To put into this context, is the \u00adfashion greenhorn who just wants to breathe the fragrant air of the \u00adhallowed corridors of style, and who would do anything for a pair of Marc Jacobs shoes from the \u00adfashion \u00adcupboard, out of date? Are young people too clued up and angry these days? However aspirational the fashion world remains, if the sequel includes a young person, they can\u2019t be anything like Andy.</p> <p>There are other quibbles with <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>. In Priestly, it delivers yet another strong screen woman who\u2019s basically a \u00admonster. You have to wonder why so many powerful women in cinema are reduced to the level of Disney witches. As the sequel is reported to deal with Priestly on her uppers, forced to kowtow to the newly \u00addominant Emily, might this mean there\u2019ll be some humanising insights into sexist-ageist pressures?</p> <p>Likewise, the Tucci character \u2013 the amusing gay man, basically \u00adfollows the template set by Rupert Everett in <em>My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding</em> in 1997. Admittedly, I rather enjoy these performances, but still, in 2024, is this the only way gay male \u00adcharacters can get screen time? This would also be the time to complain about Andy\u2019s boyfriend, Nate, who spends most of the movie belittling her supposedly trivial career, yet is somehow upheld as the voice of (mansplaining) reason. However, a quick glance around reveals that people are already on to Nate as the film\u2019s true villain.</p> <p>Finally, there\u2019s us \u2013 the \u00adpublic. How are we going to watch the sequel? Still lazily waving through sexism, sizeism, ageism and \u00adstereotypes, so long as the clothes are snappy and the jokes good? <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> was a smash hit before fashion and the wider world corrected itself. It appears to be returning just as some of the bigger problems associated with the film entrench themselves again.</p> <p>It was a miracle the first time how they managed to make such a great comedy movie out of the fashion industry \u2013 where so much of it just isn\u2019t funny. It will be \u00adinteresting to see if they can pull it&nbsp;off&nbsp;again.</p>",

He had been shot dead by an assassin pretending to deliver a legal notice.</p> <p>The daylight murder marked a tragic new low in a crime wave that has seen a surge of racketeering and murder.

      "bodyText": "Late into the night, mothers chanted for justice outside their children\u2019s school in Lima after a teacher was gunned down in front of his students in the latest and most shocking example of a surge in gang violence in Peru. CCTV footage of the incident on Monday showed panicked children running inside the school as the body of Julio C\u00e9sar Pacheco lay slumped inside the blue metal gates of Julio C Tello in the working-class Ate Vitarte neighborhood in the capital\u2019s east. He had been shot dead by an assassin pretending to deliver a legal notice. The daylight murder marked a tragic new low in a crime wave that has seen a surge of racketeering and murder. The crisis sparked two days of strikes as workers expressed their fury at what they saw as dismal law enforcement, poor leadership by an unpopular government and a deliberate weakening of anti-crime legislation by the loathed congress. Bus operators and motorized-rickshaw taxi drivers went on strike in protest against the bloodletting. They were joined by shopkeepers, street vendors, artists, hairdressers, even soup kitchen workers, all of whom had been targets for protection racket gangs who had forced them to make daily or weekly payments or face grenade attacks or even death. In less than 12 hours on 8 October, seven murders occurred in Lima, despite a two-month state of emergency in 14 districts. At one march this week, protestors chanted: \u201cThey are killing us\u201d \u2013 meaning literally, but also economically, as extortion victims are mostly informal workers getting by day to day with what they earn to support themselves and their families. \u201cExtortion is not aimed at sectors with high economic capacity. It is mainly focused on the periphery, where there is almost no control or presence of law-enforcement agencies,\u201d said Erika Solis, a specialist in crime and violence, and a researcher at the Institute for Democracy and Human Rights at Peru\u2019s Pontifical Catholic University. President Dina Boluarte\u2019s response has been \u201cprimitive and almost always populist\u201d, Solis said, adding that it is aimed \u201cnot so much to undo crime or to reduce it, but to send a message\u201d. The proposed measures have included raising prison terms and deploying soldiers on the streets to combat \u201curban terrorism\u201d, which Solis described as a \u201cshort-term placebo\u201d that would not satisfy the demand for effective and timely measures.

Peru loses more than $1.6bn annually to extortion \u2013 0.7% of its national GDP \u2013 while insecurity costs the country 3.5%, equivalent to $9.28bn, according to Lima\u2019s Chamber of Commerce. The number of violent deaths recorded until mid-October this year \u2013 1,493 \u2013 has already surpassed the total number of homicides in 2023, according to Peru\u2019s registry of deaths. Peru\u2019s unpopular congress is under pressure to annul a controversial law, dubbed the \u201cpro-organized crime\u201d law, which experts argue weakens the fight against extortion and assassination by no longer classifying them as organized crime, which carries stiffer penalties.

Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City admitted to investigators he and a co-conspirator expected to die as IS martyrs as they opened fire on crowds on election day, according to charging documents. Warnings about IS-sponsored or -inspired attacks in the west have intensified in recent weeks. In a statement on the Tawhedi case, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, remarked there was a continuing need to \u201ccombat the ongoing threat that [IS] and its supporters pose to America\u2019s national security\u201d. Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, the UK\u2019s domestic intelligence service, described how his agency had \u201cone hell of a job\u201d managing the threat of the resurgent terrorist organization. Despite the talk from top officials, public perception still remains that IS was defeated or has somehow disappeared. But, experts say, before and after that incident, internal IS talk was anything but quiet: on chat boards and encrypted apps, both supporters and operatives alike have increasingly been discussing attacks on the west and the US homeland. The online conversations are being led by IS-Khorasan (IS-K), the branch based in Afghanistan that was behind the Moscow attack that killed 145 people in March. Khorasan is a reference to an ancient region that includes parts of what is modern-day Iran, Afghanistan and other bordering countries. IS-K has quickly become the most active international force of the terror group, having already carried out the deadly plot in Russia and another in Iran months before it. Days after Tawhedi\u2019s arrest, US officials later confirmed it was an IS-K operative allegedly directing the plot. In a propaganda poster it released in September, IS-K put American targets on notice as top of its hitlist. \u201c[IS-K] has recently reiterated its intent to target the US with a poster depicting one of its militants holding a grenade in front of the US Capitol building captioned \u2018you are next,\u2019\u201d said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism, a watchdog organization working with government agencies around the world.

      "body": "<p>Debt, and why governments need to reduce it, will top the agenda at this week\u2019s annual meetings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">the International Monetary Fund</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/worldbank\">World Bank</a> in Washington.</p> <p>Finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world will gather in the US capital alongside thinktank and charity bosses to discuss the state of the global economy and its ability to generate a higher standard of living.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves will be among those told to start to paying down debts accumulated in the crisis years since 2020.</p> <p>The IMF is expected to argue that the debt mountain is getting out of control. The US and China have borrowed heavily since the financial crash of 2008 to keep the wheels of their economies turning, returning again to the bond markets through the pandemic and more recently to support households and businesses hit by the inflation shock. The UK and France are among European countries that have trodden the same path.</p> <p>All of them have been rebuked by the IMF for allowing public debts to climb to 100% of annual national income.</p> <p>The UK is among a clutch of countries that includes Brazil, France, Italy and South Africa, where debt is expected to carry on rising without a concerted effort by ministers to reverse the trend. These are countries, says the IMF, where the underlying demands for more welfare and health spending could easily spiral.</p> <p>In a warning based on research that debt levels can run away from politicians without tough measures in place, it said: \u201cFuture debt levels could be even higher than projected, and much larger fiscal adjustments than currently projected are required to stabilise or reduce it with a high&nbsp;probability.\u201d</p> <p>As a benchmark, the proportion of debt to national income, or gross domestic product (GDP) is the most popular measure of debt sustainability. Italy\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is above 130%, while the US ratio stands at 124%. Greece has a ratio of about 160% and Japan\u2019s is more than 260%.</p> <p>The IMF forecasts that global public debt will exceed $100tn by the end of this year.</p> <p>The UK chancellor will travel to Washington with a relatively modest debt-to-GDP ratio that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/20/uk-debt-gdp-rachel-reeves\">only recently edged above 100%</a>. That shields her from the worst of the IMF\u2019s dismay, but she is still vulnerable to the accusation that the UK is not doing enough to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/21/developing-countries-face-worst-debt-crisis-in-history-study-shows\">developing nations crippled by debt payments</a>.</p> <p>While poorer countries tend to have lower debt-to-GDP ratios, they are weighed down by stratospheric interest rates that mean much higher borrowing costs relative to tax income.</p> <p>World Bank boss Ajay Banga will try to turn the attention of rich countries to the debts of the poorest countries, many of which are struggling to pay their monthly interest bills.</p> <p>A report by the anti-poverty charity Development Finance International (DFI) shows that debt servicing costs are absorbing an average 42% of spending in all 146 countries on the World Bank\u2019s list of the least well off, and 55% in Africa. DFI complains that these countries must use tax revenues to pay interest bills that would otherwise be deployed to improve basic health and education services and tackle the climate crisis. The alternative is to raise new debt to pay for the existing commitments.</p> <p>At a press conference before the meetings, Banga said debt cancellation was a difficult process now that most loans were complex and multilayered. He said some of the worst-hit countries were negotiating to secure debt forgiveness, but it was a long, hard road.</p> <p>However, he said debt forgiveness should be the aim and he was working on ways to ease service costs to improve development outcomes.</p> <p>Banga said the Bank had already answered calls for its share of debt relief in restructurings by providing billions of dollars in additional grants and discounted loans to debtor countries.</p> <p>Between $16bn and $17bn has gone to Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia and Ghana in their debt restructuring processes.</p> <p>\u201cEffectively, what we\u2019re doing is giving them the lifeline they need, whether you do it as a debt forgiveness or you give them a grant,\u201d Banga said. \u201cDebt forgiveness is required, but not from us. It\u2019s required from those creditors. That\u2019s the issue we\u2019re trying to work our way through.\u201d</p> <p>Reeves will be asked to play a part in offering more resources to poorer nations after several years of cuts to international aid by the previous Conservative government. But with a budget looming and Labour under pressure to devote every penny to pleasing the likes of the IMF to bring down debts, Banga is likely to be disappointed.</p>",

The US and China have borrowed heavily since the financial crash of 2008 to keep the wheels of their economies turning, returning again to the bond markets through the pandemic and more recently to support households and businesses hit by the inflation shock. The UK and France are among European countries that have trodden the same path. All of them have been rebuked by the IMF for allowing public debts to climb to 100% of annual national income. The UK is among a clutch of countries that includes Brazil, France, Italy and South Africa, where debt is expected to carry on rising without a concerted effort by ministers to reverse the trend. These are countries, says the IMF, where the underlying demands for more welfare and health spending could easily spiral. In a warning based on research that debt levels can run away from politicians without tough measures in place, it said: \u201cFuture debt levels could be even higher than projected, and much larger fiscal adjustments than currently projected are required to stabilise or reduce it with a high probability.\u201d As a benchmark, the proportion of debt to national income, or gross domestic product (GDP) is the most popular measure of debt sustainability. Italy\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is above 130%, while the US ratio stands at 124%. Greece has a ratio of about 160% and Japan\u2019s is more than 260%. The IMF forecasts that global public debt will exceed $100tn by the end of this year. The UK chancellor will travel to Washington with a relatively modest debt-to-GDP ratio that only recently edged above 100%. That shields her from the worst of the IMF\u2019s dismay, but she is still vulnerable to the accusation that the UK is not doing enough to support developing nations crippled by debt payments. While poorer countries tend to have lower debt-to-GDP ratios, they are weighed down by stratospheric interest rates that mean much higher borrowing costs relative to tax income. World Bank boss Ajay Banga will try to turn the attention of rich countries to the debts of the poorest countries, many of which are struggling to pay their monthly interest bills. A report by the anti-poverty charity Development Finance International (DFI) shows that debt servicing costs are absorbing an average 42% of spending in all 146 countries on the World Bank\u2019s list of the least well off, and 55% in Africa. DFI complains that these countries must use tax revenues to pay interest bills that would otherwise be deployed to improve basic health and education services and tackle the climate crisis. The alternative is to raise new debt to pay for the existing commitments. At a press conference before the meetings, Banga said debt cancellation was a difficult process now that most loans were complex and multilayered. He said some of the worst-hit countries were negotiating to secure debt forgiveness, but it was a long, hard road. However, he said debt forgiveness should be the aim and he was working on ways to ease service costs to improve development outcomes. Banga said the Bank had already answered calls for its share of debt relief in restructurings by providing billions of dollars in additional grants and discounted loans to debtor countries. Between $16bn and $17bn has gone to Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia and Ghana in their debt restructuring processes. \u201cEffectively, what we\u2019re doing is giving them the lifeline they need, whether you do it as a debt forgiveness or you give them a grant,\u201d Banga said. \u201cDebt forgiveness is required, but not from us. It\u2019s required from those creditors. That\u2019s the issue we\u2019re trying to work our way through.\u201d Reeves will be asked to play a part in offering more resources to poorer nations after several years of cuts to international aid by the previous Conservative government. But with a budget looming and Labour under pressure to devote every penny to pleasing the likes of the IMF to bring down debts, Banga is likely to be disappointed.",

Degrowthers certainly don\u2019t want less to be spent on health, education or the arts. Rather, these are sectors of the economy they want to see expand. They have work to do to show that it is possible to get rid of the bad growth without also jeopardising the good growth. Simply calling for higher taxes on the wealthy so that the growth is more evenly distributed doesn\u2019t really cut it.</p> <p>Yet, there is a third problem \u2013 the biggest of all \u2013 which is that degrowth has no resonance in low- and middle-income countries, where governments see by far the biggest policy challenge to be eradicating poverty.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/e789cf0e-816c-41ef-ad3a-471948f374ce\">report from the World Bank</a> this week illustrated the point, noting that on current trends it would take more than three decades to lift the near-700 million living on less than $2.15 a day out of extreme poverty. Moreover, 44% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 3 billion people \u2013 are surviving on less than $6.85 a day \u2013 which is the poverty benchmark the World Bank uses for upper-middle income countries such as Argentina and Brazil.</p> <p>Tackling extreme poverty for the 700 million on the lowest daily incomes does not come at a big cost for the planet because the poorest countries contribute so little to global emissions. The Bank estimates that lifting everybody above $2.15 a day would increase emissions by less than 5% above 2019 levels. It is a different story if the objective is to move the incomes of the 3 billion people above $6.85 a day. This would lead to an increase of 46% in emissions above 2019 levels.</p> <p>Even if countries in the rich west speed up the de-carbonisation of their economies the impact will be massively outweighed by the pro-growth, anti-poverty policies that will inevitably be pursued in other parts of the world. Understandably, poorer countries want the living standards rich countries enjoy and are not going to take kindly to suggestions that they need to grow more slowly for the benefit of the planet. They see degrowth as something thought up by people living in rich countries.</p> <p>All that said, the basic premise of the degrowthers \u2013 that global capitalism is running out of control \u2013 is surely correct. There\u2019s a genuine problem here, one sketched out by Kate Raworth in her book <a href=\"https://pg-online.leeds.ac.uk/blogs/what-is-doughnut-economics/\">Doughnut Economics</a>, which recognises the need to lift people out of poverty but in a way that is consistent with the planet\u2019s ecological boundaries. This is a more sellable idea than de-growth and is not that revolutionary a concept.</p> <p>At present, economic policy is governed by the idea that growth \u2013 measured by gross domestic product \u2013 should be maximised consistent with meeting an inflation target. Governments know that pressing too hard on the accelerator leads to self-defeating inflationary pressures. It\u2019s time to adopt the same approach to global heating.</p> <p>Just as there are policy instruments \u2013 taxes and interest rates \u2013 that enable governments to hit inflation targets so there are measures available to deliver decarbonised growth. They could, for example, levy higher carbon taxes to disincentivise use of fossil fuels. They could take action to reduce the debt of low-income countries to free up extra spending on tackling climate change. They could invest and regulate more firmly.</p> <p>Degrowthers say sustainable growth is also a fantasy. Let\u2019s hope they are wrong, because if it is and things go on as before, we will get degrowth eventually anyway, only in the most damaging form imaginable and when it\u2019s too late to change course.</p>",

Tackling extreme poverty for the 700 million on the lowest daily incomes does not come at a big cost for the planet because the poorest countries contribute so little to global emissions. The Bank estimates that lifting everybody above $2.15 a day would increase emissions by less than 5% above 2019 levels. It is a different story if the objective is to move the incomes of the 3 billion people above $6.85 a day. This would lead to an increase of 46% in emissions above 2019 levels. Even if countries in the rich west speed up the de-carbonisation of their economies the impact will be massively outweighed by the pro-growth, anti-poverty policies that will inevitably be pursued in other parts of the world. Understandably, poorer countries want the living standards rich countries enjoy and are not going to take kindly to suggestions that they need to grow more slowly for the benefit of the planet. They see degrowth as something thought up by people living in rich countries. All that said, the basic premise of the degrowthers \u2013 that global capitalism is running out of control \u2013 is surely correct. There\u2019s a genuine problem here, one sketched out by Kate Raworth in her book Doughnut Economics, which recognises the need to lift people out of poverty but in a way that is consistent with the planet\u2019s ecological boundaries. This is a more sellable idea than de-growth and is not that revolutionary a concept. At present, economic policy is governed by the idea that growth \u2013 measured by gross domestic product \u2013 should be maximised consistent with meeting an inflation target. Governments know that pressing too hard on the accelerator leads to self-defeating inflationary pressures. It\u2019s time to adopt the same approach to global heating. Just as there are policy instruments \u2013 taxes and interest rates \u2013 that enable governments to hit inflation targets so there are measures available to deliver decarbonised growth. They could, for example, levy higher carbon taxes to disincentivise use of fossil fuels. They could take action to reduce the debt of low-income countries to free up extra spending on tackling climate change. They could invest and regulate more firmly. Degrowthers say sustainable growth is also a fantasy. Let\u2019s hope they are wrong, because if it is and things go on as before, we will get degrowth eventually anyway, only in the most damaging form imaginable and when it\u2019s too late to change course.",

This is a man who talks of words as things that grow and of the world as something to be read, who throws a watch into a canal to demonstrate how time flies. Ever curious and easily delighted, Gary Lilburn\u2019s twinkling performance as the cheeky old storyteller is the beating heart of Harry McDonald\u2019s new stage adaptation of Ali Smith\u2019s novel Autumn.</p> <p>An uneven patchwork of a play, this intimate new production seeks kindness and care in our too-often apathetic world.

      "bodyText": "What a treat, years after reading the book, to finally go for a walk with Daniel Gluck. This is a man who talks of words as things that grow and of the world as something to be read, who throws a watch into a canal to demonstrate how time flies. Ever curious and easily delighted, Gary Lilburn\u2019s twinkling performance as the cheeky old storyteller is the beating heart of Harry McDonald\u2019s new stage adaptation of Ali Smith\u2019s novel Autumn. An uneven patchwork of a play, this intimate new production seeks kindness and care in our too-often apathetic world. With Daniel asleep in a care home for most of the play, the story is told in jumbled flashbacks as 11-year-old Elisabeth (a wide-eyed, forthright Rebecca Banatvala) shyly meets her old neighbour and quickly falls into a firm friendship that worries and baffles her mother (Sophie Ward, brows creased).

If we had a budget for losses, and that budget wasn\u2019t achieved in any one year \u2013 however much we were short \u2013 the benefit we created from not spending all that money on losses would go back to postmasters.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Stevens, counsel to the public inquiry, suggested that the \u201closses pool\u201d seemed designed to make the post office operators make up for losses or discrepancies at branches.</p> <p>\u201cThat is not my understanding,\u201d said Park, who said branch operators could ultimately end up benefiting if the losses being footed by the Post Office could be cut.</p> <p>\u201c[It might] encourage postmasters to run operationally robust branches and seek support for discrepancies when they first saw them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as a result of that the cost in our profit and loss account would be less, which would ultimately mean we would be able to give more remuneration to all our postmasters.\u201d</p> <p>Park said she could not say for certain whether the \u201closses pool\u201d option was still under discussion, because she had not attended a working group for the \u201clast month or so\u201d, but added: \u201cThis will form part of the working group looking at the options and alternatives we have [for cutting shortfall write-offs].\u201d</p> <p>Owen Woodley, the interim chief executive at the Post Office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/13/post-office-explores-taking-branch-owner-operators-court-again\">has said that</a> any action to recover established losses from postmasters would have to be handled only after obtaining \u201cwide endorsement\u201d, given the IT scandal and because that Horizon data would be needed to prove shortfalls.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>In my opinion, and I know this has been looked at, we need to make sure we have external expert assurance with that data given where we have been,\u201d Park told the inquiry. \u201cMy opinion is how we review and support discrepancies with subpostmasters now is not the same as in the past, which was awful.

The Post Office aims to start recovering these losses through more direct action, exploring a number of options including a return to the court system for the civil recovery of losses, which it stopped in 2018. Other options include planned deductions from branch operator remuneration over an agreed period of time, another practice it used to implement. The inquiry heard last week that another option being explored was setting up \u201csome form of \u2018losses pool\u2019 to which all postmasters contributed and from which repayments would be made\u201d. This option was noted in a paper of a meeting of the strategic executive group, the highest level leadership team at the Post Office, in July. \u201cThat was something suggested by one of our legal team,\u201d Melanie Park, the central operations director at the Post Office, told the hearing on Wednesday. \u201cThis is something [the losses] where we need to look at all options. If we had a budget for losses, and that budget wasn\u2019t achieved in any one year \u2013 however much we were short \u2013 the benefit we created from not spending all that money on losses would go back to postmasters.\u201d Sam Stevens, counsel to the public inquiry, suggested that the \u201closses pool\u201d seemed designed to make the post office operators make up for losses or discrepancies at branches. \u201cThat is not my understanding,\u201d said Park, who said branch operators could ultimately end up benefiting if the losses being footed by the Post Office could be cut. \u201c[It might] encourage postmasters to run operationally robust branches and seek support for discrepancies when they first saw them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as a result of that the cost in our profit and loss account would be less, which would ultimately mean we would be able to give more remuneration to all our postmasters.\u201d Park said she could not say for certain whether the \u201closses pool\u201d option was still under discussion, because she had not attended a working group for the \u201clast month or so\u201d, but added: \u201cThis will form part of the working group looking at the options and alternatives we have [for cutting shortfall write-offs].\u201d Owen Woodley, the interim chief executive at the Post Office, has said that any action to recover established losses from postmasters would have to be handled only after obtaining \u201cwide endorsement\u201d, given the IT scandal and because that Horizon data would be needed to prove shortfalls. \u201cIn my opinion, and I know this has been looked at, we need to make sure we have external expert assurance with that data given where we have been,\u201d Park told the inquiry. \u201cMy opinion is how we review and support discrepancies with subpostmasters now is not the same as in the past, which was awful. That external assurance would help everyone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In May, the UK government launched its <a href=\"https://prepare.campaign.gov.uk/\">\u201cPrepare\u201d emergency awareness campaign</a>, ominously encouraging people to stock up on things such as bottled water, a wind-up radio and non-perishable foodstuffs. I\u2019ve collected a few cans of soup but, more successfully, I\u2019ve quietly been stockpiling the Co-op\u2019s sea salt and chardonnay wine vinegar crisps (in the big bags), just in case. Like millions of British people, when I say I love crisps, I&nbsp;really mean it.</p> <p>Crisps are the ideal survival product, sealed and salted, but a great packet can also function as a private restaurant where you dine alone, crisp by crisp, intensely scrutinising the crunch, flavour and execution, like a Michelin inspector of snacks. They are as transporting as they are comforting \u2013 and unsurprisingly, they had a <a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/category-reports/the-covid-crisps-mountain-bagged-snacks-category-report-2021/655184.article\">good pandemic</a>, with Britons buying \u00a3441m more bagged snacks in 2020 than they did in 2019. They even helped morale during the blitz. At Smith\u2019s Crisps AGM in 1941, chairman Sir Herbert E Morgan noted that Londoners were taking the brand\u2019s crisps down to air raid shelters: \u201cAs in times of peace our crisps have been a standby, and an always reliable friend \u2013 they are additionally so these days,\u201d he told shareholders.</p> <p>It\u2019s rational that we should seek out our \u201creliable friend\u201d in times of need or uncertainty. Salt alone does uplifting things to the brain, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491403/#:~:text=Neural%20substrates%20and%20the%20mediation,use%20%5B140%2D142%5D.\">scientists have suggested</a>, based on studies of how it is cognitively gratifying to small mammals, at least. But crisps also reveal more complicated affections, including ideas of what Britain notices and likes about its own character.</p> <p>In the 1950s, food scientists began to finesse the art of imitative flavours in compounds, and since then crisps have been able to carry out an uncannily accurate and sometimes waspish national conversation. It shows up on shop shelves in special editions such as Walkers coronation chicken, in honour of King Charles, or Morrisons\u2019 \u2019nduja, as a vogueish nod to Shoreditch\u2019s favourite pizza topping, or Kettle Chips sea salt and crushed black peppercorns, as a hat tip to the Waitrose middle classes.</p> <p>The UK is perhaps the only nation to insert historical footnotes and social sarcasm into foil packets, while also imitating fads and trends steaming out of restaurant kitchens. This has been going on for decades, with 1990s crisps becoming a discussion of class via the introduction of \u201cposh\u201d crisps in fancy flavours and kettle/hand-cooked techniques. It\u2019s common to see caricatures of British social types as part of visual branding. And now in an age where we\u2019re fed tidbits of other people\u2019s social status online, crisps can function as accessories. Torres are for today\u2019s east London set what Marlboro Lights were to Soho late nights in the 1990s. </p>    <p>Our national snack obsession mostly involves a handful of unbeatable flavours, albeit spun off into eye-catching variations (think Kent Crisps\u2019 oyster and vinegar). PepsiCo\u2019s Walkers, for example, runs on classics that an entire nation never tires of, in situations that also have a timeless grip. Ready salted (the crisp sandwich); salt and vinegar (the pub); cheese and onion (the antisocial train journey); prawn cocktail (childhood); something beefy (lunch break boost). The latest wedding trend, meanwhile, is for nostalgic \u201c<a href=\"https://www.glamourpussweddings.com/crisp-walls\">crisp walls</a>\u201d that pin retro packets to a board, while florists are even offering \u201c<a href=\"https://baytreefloristiow.co.uk/flower-delivery-isle-of-wight/chocolate-sweet-and-crisp-bouquets/crisp-bouquet\">crisp bouquets</a>\u201d as a romantic alternative to red roses. Anya Hindmarch has a crisp-mould handbag, as does Balenciaga. Sales of 1990s favourites have also recently rocketed, as \u201cBritishcore\u201d trends on TikTok.</p> <p>As for how we came to be so intergenerationally bewitched by sliced, fried and salted potato slices, we\u2019re only just catching up with what the industrial, social and technological ride of the past half-century in particular has meant for our beloved snack. </p> <p>There are a few dates this story could rewind to. A purist would trek back to the so-called \u201cfurnaces of creation\u201d in Latin America, where wild potatoes were collected and spread to Europe from the 16th century onwards. Every crisp you buy owes something to the amazing fecundity of the Andes.</p>    <p>Closer to home, there is Cricklewood in 1919, where Frank Smith started his crisp factory behind a pub, or 1954, when meat rationing ended and cheese and onion powdered flavouring was born in Tayto\u2019s rented rooms on O\u2019Rahilly Parade in Dublin. An Edinburgh bakery in 1947, and a Leicester butcher in 1948, also saw the beginnings of Golden Wonder and Walker\u2019s, respectively. Dallas had a big year in 1961, as the Frito-Lay merger primed what began as two kitchen-table startups to become a global snack empire. All of these developments were important to the progress of crisps, and are part of a much longer chronicle.</p> <p>But when thinking about how Britain got deeply attached to crisps, one of the most telling phases came in the 1980s, as the country emerged from a decade of hard times. Food price inflation in the 1970s was \u201cdizzying\u201d as Delia Smith herself put it \u2013 rising 300% in 10 years. Food started to fortify snobbery around what you could afford being somehow indicative of who you were.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You could put people into crisp tribes depending on where you grew up. Crisps are almost like a member of the family</p> <footer> <cite>Larry Bush, ex-Pepsico</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Crisps had flown under the radar of such considerations until this point. From the 1920s until the 1970s, their biggest marketplace was the pub and hotel trades, functioning like wallpaper, in the background, designed to accompany other things \u2013 beer, picnics, cocktail parties, school lunch boxes. In 1961, 65% of crisps\u2019 market turnover came from the licensed trade, according to the Journal of Industrial Economics. By 1969, that figure had dropped to 25%. Supermarkets started to grow and other things were changing in British society too. Women were gaining better educational chances, and working more. Housing now included more flats, and an increasing portion of the affluent classes cooked for themselves. Crisps were marketed into this niche: tasty, but also time-saving.</p> <p>When Denis Healey\u2019s plans for value added tax enshrined crisps in the \u201cluxury\u201d taxable food category in 1974, the unease was palpable on both sides of the dispatch box. During a late-night debate in April 1974, Michael Shersby, Conservative MP for Uxbridge, asked the Commons: \u201cWhat about potato crisps, which are to bear the full rate of VAT? Many of my constituents find potato crisps a helpful, useful and convenient part of their diet. They eat them with salads and with other nutritious foods, but they will go up in price by 10%.\u201d </p>    <p>MPs also worried about what the rise would mean for small businesses, since crisps were seen as a plucky entrepreneurial sector, with regional competitors such as Lothian or Highlander playing into local loyalties. In the event, crisps managed to weather the addition of VAT. The product itself had improved, thanks to the arrival of continuous fryers from the US, and form-fill-seal machinery that clamped down the crisps\u2019 freshness with heat-sealing jaws. One crisp entrepreneur I spoke to, John Mudd, who began Real Crisps in south Wales, remembered children in the 1950s crying out during showings of westerns at the cinema in Cardiff, upset that the crisps they\u2019d bought from the tuckshop had gone stale. If crisps had become more expensive by the 1970s, they were at least a more reliable purchase. This, the Journal of Industrial Economics noted in 1974, helped to embed them as a repeat feature of British grocery baskets.</p> <p>By 1984 alone, Britons spent \u00a3805m on crisps and snacks, according to Mintel research, a figure that would pass \u00a31bn by the end of the decade. Walkers went on a hiring spree to get enough drivers to deliver crisps to the nation that had an evermore bottomless appetite for them, backed by TV ads and promises of wild new shapes and flavours. For a spell, Walkers Crisps truck drivers really looked the part. In dark blue Burtons suits and Walkers-motif ties, they criss-crossed sales routes from Leicester layered up in weatherproof coats, thermal underwear and thick boots, all of which came with the job. The suits were made to measure by a tailor who called into the factory \u2013 and Walkers paid for dry cleaning. On Fridays, hauliers could take home a box of free crisps each, if they wanted. The only thing that wasn\u2019t included in the deal was socks.</p> <p>By the end of the 1980s, Walkers had been bought by PepsiCo, which had the keys to the \u201cPentagon of snacks\u201d, the Frito-Lay headquarters in Dallas. Britain, which always liked to think of itself as the global crisp connoisseur, now lived in the expertise shadow of the Americans. PepsiCo did most things differently and a lot of stuff better, not least the art of marketing. When it came to launching Doritos in the UK in the 1990s, the Americans were unhappy with the British tortilla chip, so sent a team from Leicester to Modesto in California and beyond, to learn the American art of milling, toasting and frying. They slaved for months on return to the Coventry factory to get the British Dorito up to scratch. </p> <p>Walkers\u2019 livery is less visible on today\u2019s roads \u2013 contractors mostly deliver in their own vehicles, and the bespoke suits were replaced by overalls in the 1990s. The free box of crisps was also stopped \u2013 instead, drivers could fill a bin bag for a fiver.</p>    <p>You can love crisps to the ends of the earth, but there will still be one you haven\u2019t tried. If I mentioned to anyone that I was writing a book about crisps, I knew there would be immediate quizzing. Will you be including German paprika chips? What about Highlander tomato? What do you think of Torres fried egg? Are Pringles really crisps? (Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/may/21/pringles-vat-tax-crisps-snacks\">according to lengthy tax wranglings</a> pursued by HMRC.) I\u2019ve yet to come across someone without at least two or three strong opinions about crisps. Larry Bush, who was part of PepsiCo\u2019s British tortilla team (and now runs a wildlife park outside Bristol), told me: \u201cYou could put people into crisp tribes depending on where you grew up. Crisps are almost like a member of the family.\u201d</p> <p>This is curiously asymmetrical with the industry itself, which is tight-lipped and extremely competitive. It is cut-throat, rewarding bulk orders and purchasing power. This has been the case for almost 100 years \u2013 when Smith\u2019s Crisps was the undisputed market leader in the 1930s, for example, its smaller competitors fell away without Smith\u2019s even trying. It had got to market first a decade before, bagging the best sales routes and supplier contracts, and could not be beaten on wholesale price. Today, Kent Crisps stands out for being a rare example of an indie outfit, with a sole director, Laura Bounds, who told me that when she has bid for airline or cruise ship contracts, she has found \u201cbig crisp\u201d offering its product at a loss, just to gain market share.</p> <p>Every year as a nation we eat the weight of one of the world\u2019s largest container ships in crisp form (about 186,000 tonnes), which makes the game worth fighting for. But, in truth, it has been a struggle to keep a product consistent even as the world changes at&nbsp;speed; and as we expand our appetites to include \u201chealthy\u201d crisp variants, in baked, \u201cpopped\u201d and protein-based form, it will be harder keep the affair going exactly as it was.</p> <p>Crisps, after our Brexit divorce, appear to be having more fun than ever in Europe. Belgian brand Superbon, for example, is spicing up tradition with ideas such yellow paprika, while Breton makers Les Brets is giving Lay\u2019s a run for its money with bistro-worthy flavours including rotisserie chicken. Could it be that we told ourselves a lie all along, that other countries love crisps just as much as we do? We keep eating crisps in Britain not because we are the best at making them, or even the hungriest (that\u2019s Japan and the US), but because we\u2019re still enjoying the debates. Are \u201chigh\u201d crisps better than \u201clow\u201d ones? Is it true that the underside of Pringles is the best side to eat tongue-down first, coated with more flavour? Who does the best salt and vinegar? It\u2019s unresolvable, which is part of the fun. We love crisps as much as we\u2019re fond of the madness and unevenness of Britain itself. </p> <p><em>Crunch by Natalie Whittle (Faber, \u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "In May, the UK government launched its \u201cPrepare\u201d emergency awareness campaign, ominously encouraging people to stock up on things such as bottled water, a wind-up radio and non-perishable foodstuffs. I\u2019ve collected a few cans of soup but, more successfully, I\u2019ve quietly been stockpiling the Co-op\u2019s sea salt and chardonnay wine vinegar crisps (in the big bags), just in case. Like millions of British people, when I say I love crisps, I really mean it. Crisps are the ideal survival product, sealed and salted, but a great packet can also function as a private restaurant where you dine alone, crisp by crisp, intensely scrutinising the crunch, flavour and execution, like a Michelin inspector of snacks. They are as transporting as they are comforting \u2013 and unsurprisingly, they had a good pandemic, with Britons buying \u00a3441m more bagged snacks in 2020 than they did in 2019. They even helped morale during the blitz. At Smith\u2019s Crisps AGM in 1941, chairman Sir Herbert E Morgan noted that Londoners were taking the brand\u2019s crisps down to air raid shelters: \u201cAs in times of peace our crisps have been a standby, and an always reliable friend \u2013 they are additionally so these days,\u201d he told shareholders. It\u2019s rational that we should seek out our \u201creliable friend\u201d in times of need or uncertainty. Salt alone does uplifting things to the brain, scientists have suggested, based on studies of how it is cognitively gratifying to small mammals, at least. But crisps also reveal more complicated affections, including ideas of what Britain notices and likes about its own character. In the 1950s, food scientists began to finesse the art of imitative flavours in compounds, and since then crisps have been able to carry out an uncannily accurate and sometimes waspish national conversation. It shows up on shop shelves in special editions such as Walkers coronation chicken, in honour of King Charles, or Morrisons\u2019 \u2019nduja, as a vogueish nod to Shoreditch\u2019s favourite pizza topping, or Kettle Chips sea salt and crushed black peppercorns, as a hat tip to the Waitrose middle classes. The UK is perhaps the only nation to insert historical footnotes and social sarcasm into foil packets, while also imitating fads and trends steaming out of restaurant kitchens. This has been going on for decades, with 1990s crisps becoming a discussion of class via the introduction of \u201cposh\u201d crisps in fancy flavours and kettle/hand-cooked techniques. It\u2019s common to see caricatures of British social types as part of visual branding. And now in an age where we\u2019re fed tidbits of other people\u2019s social status online, crisps can function as accessories. Torres are for today\u2019s east London set what Marlboro Lights were to Soho late nights in the 1990s. Our national snack obsession mostly involves a handful of unbeatable flavours, albeit spun off into eye-catching variations (think Kent Crisps\u2019 oyster and vinegar). PepsiCo\u2019s Walkers, for example, runs on classics that an entire nation never tires of, in situations that also have a timeless grip. Ready salted (the crisp sandwich); salt and vinegar (the pub); cheese and onion (the antisocial train journey); prawn cocktail (childhood); something beefy (lunch break boost). The latest wedding trend, meanwhile, is for nostalgic \u201ccrisp walls\u201d that pin retro packets to a board, while florists are even offering \u201ccrisp bouquets\u201d as a romantic alternative to red roses. Anya Hindmarch has a crisp-mould handbag, as does Balenciaga. Sales of 1990s favourites have also recently rocketed, as \u201cBritishcore\u201d trends on TikTok. As for how we came to be so intergenerationally bewitched by sliced, fried and salted potato slices, we\u2019re only just catching up with what the industrial, social and technological ride of the past half-century in particular has meant for our beloved snack. There are a few dates this story could rewind to. A purist would trek back to the so-called \u201cfurnaces of creation\u201d in Latin America, where wild potatoes were collected and spread to Europe from the 16th century onwards. Every crisp you buy owes something to the amazing fecundity of the Andes. Closer to home, there is Cricklewood in 1919, where Frank Smith started his crisp factory behind a pub, or 1954, when meat rationing ended and cheese and onion powdered flavouring was born in Tayto\u2019s rented rooms on O\u2019Rahilly Parade in Dublin. An Edinburgh bakery in 1947, and a Leicester butcher in 1948, also saw the beginnings of Golden Wonder and Walker\u2019s, respectively. Dallas had a big year in 1961, as the Frito-Lay merger primed what began as two kitchen-table startups to become a global snack empire. All of these developments were important to the progress of crisps, and are part of a much longer chronicle. But when thinking about how Britain got deeply attached to crisps, one of the most telling phases came in the 1980s, as the country emerged from a decade of hard times. Food price inflation in the 1970s was \u201cdizzying\u201d as Delia Smith herself put it \u2013 rising 300% in 10 years. Food started to fortify snobbery around what you could afford being somehow indicative of who you were. Crisps had flown under the radar of such considerations until this point. From the 1920s until the 1970s, their biggest marketplace was the pub and hotel trades, functioning like wallpaper, in the background, designed to accompany other things \u2013 beer, picnics, cocktail parties, school lunch boxes. In 1961, 65% of crisps\u2019 market turnover came from the licensed trade, according to the Journal of Industrial Economics. By 1969, that figure had dropped to 25%. Supermarkets started to grow and other things were changing in British society too. Women were gaining better educational chances, and working more. Housing now included more flats, and an increasing portion of the affluent classes cooked for themselves. Crisps were marketed into this niche: tasty, but also time-saving. When Denis Healey\u2019s plans for value added tax enshrined crisps in the \u201cluxury\u201d taxable food category in 1974, the unease was palpable on both sides of the dispatch box. During a late-night debate in April 1974, Michael Shersby, Conservative MP for Uxbridge, asked the Commons: \u201cWhat about potato crisps, which are to bear the full rate of VAT?

A dolphin-spotting trip had seemed a wonderfully relaxing way to spend a morning out on the shimmering seas around Sagres, the Algarve\u2019s westernmost town, believed for centuries to be the very edge of the world.

As we glide away, I think how lucky we were to be the only boat out at sea, rather than one of the many that head out each day from the bigger resorts of Carvoeiro and Albufeira.</p> <p>Sagres itself is a slightly scrappy surfers\u2019 town, wind-lashed and sunny right through autumn (an average of six hours a day in November), flanked by empty scrubland, soaring cliffs and the vast stretches of ocean. Under Moorish rule for 500 years, it\u2019s from here that Henry the Navigator began the 15th-century expeditions that ushered in the Portuguese Golden Age of Exploration, the unassuming town a gateway to a whole undiscovered world.</p> <p>And yet Sagres wears its history lightly. The huge fortress on the top of the cliffs offers nothing more than unremarkable walls and vast blue skies, although the lack of information boards and tour groups somehow adds to the end-of-the-world feel.</p>    <p>\u201cPeople come to the Algarve expecting huge resorts and endless apartment blocks, but because the western end is a national park, there\u2019s much less development,\u201d says our guide, Paulo, over a lunch of garlicky mussels and salty local cheese with slabs of sourdough-like bread. \u201cSurfers come, and hikers \u2013 Sagres is on the Fisherman\u2019s Trail [a 140-mile coastal path from S\u00e3o Torpes in the Alentejo to Lagos on the Algarve] \u2013 but the whole area is quite under the radar.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>None of it is quite what I expected; less developed, more authentic, a tourist area that has retained its sense of self</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In late September, we\u2019re on the cusp of the seasonal transition from sunkissed beach breaks to blustery walking weeks, but the sun is still warm enough for an hour or two on Burgau beach, a great swathe of golden sand, stretching out beneath a cluster of low-slung, whitewashed houses, quiet bars and narrow streets, woven into the hillside. We spot walkers, following the steep Fisherman\u2019s Trail to the next beach at Salema, but can\u2019t quite persuade ourselves off our loungers to join them.</p> <p>Walking is an increasingly popular way to discover this stretch of coast and its hinterland, and this year the tourist board launched a website, <a href=\"https://www.algarvewalkingseason.com/\">algarvewalkingseason.com</a>, with details of walking festivals throughout the winter. We decide to tackle the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail \u2013 one of the Algarve\u2019s most popular \u2013 taking in Benagil beach with its spectacular sinkhole, and Praia da Marinha, famous for its dramatic grottoes and arches.</p> <p>Only four miles each way, it proves pretty taxing and we turn back halfway, although the views are more than worth it. In summer, the beaches below teem with people, with car parks full by early morning and every patch of sand covered. In autumn, the route is still popular, but the crowds are fewer, with the scenery even more beautiful in the low, late sun.</p>    <p>But this area of the Algarve is about more than just its coast. Our villa, the elegant Casa Pardal, is set in the hills 10 minutes north of Portim\u00e3o, a peaceful oasis surrounded by landscaped gardens, elegantly furnished with North African lanterns and carved wooden panels that are a legacy of the area\u2019s Moorish past. From here, it\u2019s an easy drive up to the mountain village of Monchique, said to be the greenest in the Algarve, where the narrow streets are dotted with art galleries and gift shops, and walking groups appear out of sidestreets clutching poles and empty water bottles.</p> <p>There are times when we glimpse the other, better-known Algarve, like lunchtime in the picturesque village of Ferragudo, where every restaurant table seems to be taken by British retirees, flocked from their apartment blocks in Praia da Rocha. But mostly we avoid it, driving down to Portim\u00e3o in the evenings to eat crispy-skinned bream at Taberna da Mar\u00e9 in the old fish market, and ambling around the pretty streets of Silves, once the capital of the Algarve, now a picturesque town dominated by the huge castle, one of most complete Moorish fortifications in the country.</p> <p>None of it is quite what I expected; less developed, more authentic, a tourist region that has retained far more of its sense of self than parts of the neighbouring Spanish coastline. It\u2019s my first time to the Algarve, but definitely not my last \u2013 although next time I\u2019ll pack walking boots rather than swimwear \u2013 and I won\u2019t let the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail beat me again.</p> <p><em>Casa Pardal, sleeps eight and costs from \u00a3</em><em>2,007 for seven nights (<a href=\"http://oliverstravels.com/\">oliverstravels.com</a>).

The huge fortress on the top of the cliffs offers nothing more than unremarkable walls and vast blue skies, although the lack of information boards and tour groups somehow adds to the end-of-the-world feel. \u201cPeople come to the Algarve expecting huge resorts and endless apartment blocks, but because the western end is a national park, there\u2019s much less development,\u201d says our guide, Paulo, over a lunch of garlicky mussels and salty local cheese with slabs of sourdough-like bread. \u201cSurfers come, and hikers \u2013 Sagres is on the Fisherman\u2019s Trail [a 140-mile coastal path from S\u00e3o Torpes in the Alentejo to Lagos on the Algarve] \u2013 but the whole area is quite under the radar.\u201d In late September, we\u2019re on the cusp of the seasonal transition from sunkissed beach breaks to blustery walking weeks, but the sun is still warm enough for an hour or two on Burgau beach, a great swathe of golden sand, stretching out beneath a cluster of low-slung, whitewashed houses, quiet bars and narrow streets, woven into the hillside. We spot walkers, following the steep Fisherman\u2019s Trail to the next beach at Salema, but can\u2019t quite persuade ourselves off our loungers to join them. Walking is an increasingly popular way to discover this stretch of coast and its hinterland, and this year the tourist board launched a website, algarvewalkingseason.com, with details of walking festivals throughout the winter. We decide to tackle the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail \u2013 one of the Algarve\u2019s most popular \u2013 taking in Benagil beach with its spectacular sinkhole, and Praia da Marinha, famous for its dramatic grottoes and arches. Only four miles each way, it proves pretty taxing and we turn back halfway, although the views are more than worth it. In summer, the beaches below teem with people, with car parks full by early morning and every patch of sand covered. In autumn, the route is still popular, but the crowds are fewer, with the scenery even more beautiful in the low, late sun. But this area of the Algarve is about more than just its coast. Our villa, the elegant Casa Pardal, is set in the hills 10 minutes north of Portim\u00e3o, a peaceful oasis surrounded by landscaped gardens, elegantly furnished with North African lanterns and carved wooden panels that are a legacy of the area\u2019s Moorish past. From here, it\u2019s an easy drive up to the mountain village of Monchique, said to be the greenest in the Algarve, where the narrow streets are dotted with art galleries and gift shops, and walking groups appear out of sidestreets clutching poles and empty water bottles. There are times when we glimpse the other, better-known Algarve, like lunchtime in the picturesque village of Ferragudo, where every restaurant table seems to be taken by British retirees, flocked from their apartment blocks in Praia da Rocha. But mostly we avoid it, driving down to Portim\u00e3o in the evenings to eat crispy-skinned bream at Taberna da Mar\u00e9 in the old fish market, and ambling around the pretty streets of Silves, once the capital of the Algarve, now a picturesque town dominated by the huge castle, one of most complete Moorish fortifications in the country. None of it is quite what I expected; less developed, more authentic, a tourist region that has retained far more of its sense of self than parts of the neighbouring Spanish coastline. It\u2019s my first time to the Algarve, but definitely not my last \u2013 although next time I\u2019ll pack walking boots rather than swimwear \u2013 and I won\u2019t let the Seven Hanging Valleys Trail beat me again.

Trump made his second visit to Scranton in as many months last week. \u201cGo get everyone you know and vote immediately,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/trump-rallies-crowd-in-scranton-ahead-of-election/article_ac973bca-8684-11ef-99a3-a3060fc388bf.html\">urged rallygoers</a>.</p> <p>But persuading any part of the deeply divided electorate to swap their vote looks difficult.</p>    <p>Harris may yet hold Scranton, said Berwood Yost, a Pennsylvania pollster, but that is \u201csurprising\u201d given the level of economic discontent in the city and the county. \u201cThe dissatisfaction with Biden is really high and views on personal finances are very negative, so Trump should be clearly ahead,\u201d Yost said. And yet polling <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-pennsylvania.html\">averages</a> show Harris ahead by a point in Pennsylvania, (firmly within the margin of error) which \u201cspeaks in part to some voters\u2019 concerns about Trump and his personal character\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2000, Democrats have won the county with as much as 63% support, but Hillary Clinton narrowly won with less than 50% of the 2016 vote. Biden\u2019s home-field advantage may have buoyed Dems in 2020 \u2013 he was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware, and he has name-checked the city throughout his long career and is still nicknamed \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s third senator\u201d. Biden beat Trump in the county by <a href=\"https://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/general/countybreakdownresults?countyName=LACKAWANNA&amp;officeId=1&amp;districtId=1&amp;ElectionID=83&amp;ElectionType=G&amp;IsActive=0&amp;isRetention=0\">53.7% to 45.3%</a>.</p> <p>Still, Scranton has become \u201cground zero for demonstrating the appeal of Trump and the Maga movement, and places that traditionally voted Democrat and ended up changing their stripes in a significant way\u201d, Yost said.</p> <h2>\u2018Way more optimistic\u2019</h2> <p>Once a powerhouse city in the nation\u2019s coal capital, Scranton\u2019s economy is now driven by small business, retail, healthcare, education and the service sector, said Satyajit Ghosh, a University of Scranton economist. Though there is no shortage of empty storefronts downtown, it is noticeably livelier than many similar Rust belt urban cores.</p> <p>University of Scranton\u2019s surveys of downtown businesses found owners in April had concerns about the current economic climate but were decidedly more optimistic about the next six months: \u201cWay more optimistic than they were a year ago,\u201d Ghosh said.</p>    <p>Yost\u2019s most <a href=\"https://www.fandmpoll.org/franklin-marshall-poll-release-september-2024/\">recent polling</a> put Harris up three points statewide and found the economy to be the top issue for 34% of residents. Other recent polling found 60% of Pennsylvanians said their economic situation was worse compared with 40% who say it was better or no different.</p> <p>James Simrell is part of the latter group. As he closed up his boxing gym in Steamtown, the lifelong Democrat was upbeat about Scranton\u2019s economy. His gym is just one of his three businesses, and all stay busy \u2013 he also designs jewelry and runs a small farm that produces butternut squash and pumpkins. He sells pumpkins to Blackwatch Cafe, and squash to Abe\u2019s Delicatessen, which uses it in their soup. \u201cEveryone is doing well,\u201d Simrell said.</p> <p>In contrast, the Trump economy was \u201cfalling apart\u201d as the former president left office amid a poorly managed pandemic, Simrell said. He has other reasons for not voting for Trump. His two adopted children are Black and Trump is \u201ca little bit prejudiced \u2013 it drives my wife crazy\u201d.</p> <p>Echoing longtime Democratic voters\u2019 sentiment, he added: \u201cMy mom and dad were Democrats and I follow what they believe, and Kamala\u2019s the best person to be president \u2013 she\u2019s not crazy.\u201d</p> <p>But lingering inflation is still a drag for Eric Flesher, who runs a collectibles and vintage store, Rock-N-Models. He likened the economy to a \u201ctightening sphincter\u201d.</p> <p>He declined to talk about politics, but said everything remained expensive: \u201cI\u2019m in a business that sells stuff that nobody needs unless they have disposable income, so it gets much more difficult\u201d when there is inflation, Flesher said.</p> <p>Flesher added that he disagreed with the \u201cmindset here that I should vote for someone because that\u2019s how my mom and dad voted \u2013 then you\u2019re just voting for a party and not a person\u201d, he added.</p> <h2>\u2018She\u2019s not the kind you can trust\u2019</h2> <p>The economic indicators in Scranton track those of the wider US. Inflation, which peaked at an annual rate of 9.1% in mid-2022, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/10/september-inflation-declines\">eased to 2.4%</a>. Prices are similarly down in Scranton, the economist Ghosh said. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the region was 3.9% in August, below the 4.2% national average.</p> <p>\u201cIn this area, which I\u2019ve covered for many years, I really haven\u2019t ever seen this strong of a performance in terms of employment,\u201d said Ghosh. Still, there\u2019s an after-effect of inflation that consumers feel, Ghosh added, and some high prices, like those for rent or food, are still hurting.</p> <p>Outside a Walmart in Dickson City, a retail hub just north of Scranton, husband and wife John and Carol Gardner still feel the pinch. The Mount Cobb residents used to pay $150-$200 a month on groceries, and now they pay twice that. Carol is out of a job on disability, while John assembles buffet trays for $12 an hour to make ends meet, even though he said he should be retired.</p>    <p>\u201cTrump at least made sure we could go shopping, and Biden is making sure we can\u2019t,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI hope the lady doesn\u2019t get in because we\u2019re going to go straight downhill \u2013 she\u2019s not the kind you can trust.\u201d</p> <p>The view is different at Bethel AME, a 153-year old Black church on downtown\u2019s west side. Pastor Mark Alexander sees an improving economy, and blames inflation on Trump.</p> <p>\u201cInflation was more so because of Covid, and how the former president handled that situation, because when you have supply chain interruptions and poor leadership guiding the nation, it exacerbates things,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve, not the president, decides rates, Alexander noted, and he pointed to low unemployment, the Chips Act \u2013 which is pouring billions into domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors \u2013 and Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill as evidence of the president\u2019s economic success.</p> <p>Moreover, at Bethel AME, there is \u201cexcitement for someone who looks like us and has experienced some of things we have gone through and comes from a middle-class upbringing\u201d, Alexander added. \u201cAs opposed to a billionaire who has no clue what it is like day to day for middle-class people,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true with younger people because Harris \u201cspeaks their language\u201d, Alexander added.</p> <p>For others, neither candidate is appealing. Mike Gilson owns a flooring business, a maintenance company, and manages artists and chefs. He said the economy was strong locally because its economic backbone was made up of longtime small businesses, and it fared better during the last session than most other areas because of that composition.</p>    <p>But the city\u2019s relatively strong economic standing is not persuading Gilson to vote for Harris. He said the president was a \u201cceremonial position\u201d and big corporations run the nation. \u201cIf the president actually wielded the power that people think they do then voting would make a lot more sense to me,\u201d Gilson said.</p> <p>History will decide which of Scranton\u2019s many voices will decide this election. Right now it is unclear whether the legacy of the city\u2019s most famous son will be enough to carry Harris over the line or finally hand Scranton and the state to Trump.</p> <p>With the race essentially a toss-up at this point, the key for either party is going to be turnout, Yost said. But in that battle, Trump may have an advantage \u2013 people who are less likely to vote have in recent elections voted for Trump.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats have to counter that by getting their voters to the polls,\u201d Yost said. \u201cThink about the election as a mosaic \u2013 there are many pieces and some are bigger than others, but they\u2019re all going to matter.\u201d</p>",

Carol is out of a job on disability, while John assembles buffet trays for $12 an hour to make ends meet, even though he said he should be retired. \u201cTrump at least made sure we could go shopping, and Biden is making sure we can\u2019t,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI hope the lady doesn\u2019t get in because we\u2019re going to go straight downhill \u2013 she\u2019s not the kind you can trust.\u201d The view is different at Bethel AME, a 153-year old Black church on downtown\u2019s west side. Pastor Mark Alexander sees an improving economy, and blames inflation on Trump. \u201cInflation was more so because of Covid, and how the former president handled that situation, because when you have supply chain interruptions and poor leadership guiding the nation, it exacerbates things,\u201d he said. The Federal Reserve, not the president, decides rates, Alexander noted, and he pointed to low unemployment, the Chips Act \u2013 which is pouring billions into domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors \u2013 and Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill as evidence of the president\u2019s economic success. Moreover, at Bethel AME, there is \u201cexcitement for someone who looks like us and has experienced some of things we have gone through and comes from a middle-class upbringing\u201d, Alexander added. \u201cAs opposed to a billionaire who has no clue what it is like day to day for middle-class people,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true with younger people because Harris \u201cspeaks their language\u201d, Alexander added. For others, neither candidate is appealing. Mike Gilson owns a flooring business, a maintenance company, and manages artists and chefs. He said the economy was strong locally because its economic backbone was made up of longtime small businesses, and it fared better during the last session than most other areas because of that composition. But the city\u2019s relatively strong economic standing is not persuading Gilson to vote for Harris. He said the president was a \u201cceremonial position\u201d and big corporations run the nation. \u201cIf the president actually wielded the power that people think they do then voting would make a lot more sense to me,\u201d Gilson said. History will decide which of Scranton\u2019s many voices will decide this election. Right now it is unclear whether the legacy of the city\u2019s most famous son will be enough to carry Harris over the line or finally hand Scranton and the state to Trump. With the race essentially a toss-up at this point, the key for either party is going to be turnout, Yost said. But in that battle, Trump may have an advantage \u2013 people who are less likely to vote have in recent elections voted for Trump. \u201cDemocrats have to counter that by getting their voters to the polls,\u201d Yost said. \u201cThink about the election as a mosaic \u2013 there are many pieces and some are bigger than others, but they\u2019re all going to matter.\u201d",

It is electric.</p> <p>Tension speeds the evening: in one of many extraordinary phrases, secrecy is said to be in the air, \u201clike bleach\u201d. I knew full well that our hero will have slept with his mother and killed his father, but found myself not only wishing but almost believing that things might turn out differently. Unforgettable images are sparely planted on Hildegard Bechtler\u2019s cleverly institutional design: a massive stain of blood on a glass panel; teenage children being hurled through swing doors; a stiletto heel advancing towards an eyeball. Yet each twist of the action is subtly disclosed and tethered to a 21st-century reality. Oedipus\u2019s father is killed in a car crash; Oedipus swears to seek out the truth that will destroy him as part of an election campaign; his snippy daughter Antigone wears an Oedipus T-shirt (in the style of Shepard Fairey\u2019s Obama). On display throughout the evening, a digital clock counts down the minutes to the result of the ballot \u2013 or a different revelation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The unconscious is everywhere, tripping characters\u2019 tongues, steering or blinding their eyes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A tremendous cast seem to have the complexes and complexities of the plot running through them like blood. A jostling family scene \u2013 down-to-earth and yet premonitory \u2013 anchors what follows. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/sep/15/june-watson-in-the-1970s-at-the-national-you-couldnt-rehearse-after-lunch-because-everybody-had-had-too-much-to-drink\">June Watson</a> towers and crumbles magnificently as the matter-of-fact mother who is \u2013 like so many here \u2013 not exactly what she seems. Michael Gould\u2019s Creon slips through the action like a warning shadow. Lesley Manville\u2019s Jocasta and Mark Strong\u2019s Oedipus are transfixing: magnetised by each other, aiming high; she translucent, he monumental.</p> <p>Irony snakes through the preposterous action. \u201cBaby!\u201d yelled out as a sexual endearment has a particular ring when the two lovers are more closely related than they know. A dig at the Freudian analysis for which the oedipal complex was to be so central is administered when a character complains that it does not help to talk. Yet the unconscious is everywhere, tripping characters\u2019 tongues, steering or blinding their eyes: \u201cJust because you don\u2019t see it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\u201d Next year Ella Hickson\u2019s new version of <em>Oedipus</em> will be staged at the Old Vic, starring Rami Malek and Indira Varma. Icke has already made Sophocles\u2019s drama look like a play for today.</p> <p>Timothy Sheader\u2019s first season as artistic director of the important Donmar has got off to a flying start.

      "bodyText": "There will surely not be a more powerful production in the UK this year. Robert Icke, who in 2015 created a searing 21st-century Oresteia, now brings to London his version of Oedipus, first seen in Amsterdam and Edinburgh in 2018. It is electric. Tension speeds the evening: in one of many extraordinary phrases, secrecy is said to be in the air, \u201clike bleach\u201d. I knew full well that our hero will have slept with his mother and killed his father, but found myself not only wishing but almost believing that things might turn out differently. Unforgettable images are sparely planted on Hildegard Bechtler\u2019s cleverly institutional design: a massive stain of blood on a glass panel; teenage children being hurled through swing doors; a stiletto heel advancing towards an eyeball. Yet each twist of the action is subtly disclosed and tethered to a 21st-century reality. Oedipus\u2019s father is killed in a car crash; Oedipus swears to seek out the truth that will destroy him as part of an election campaign; his snippy daughter Antigone wears an Oedipus T-shirt (in the style of Shepard Fairey\u2019s Obama). On display throughout the evening, a digital clock counts down the minutes to the result of the ballot \u2013 or a different revelation. A tremendous cast seem to have the complexes and complexities of the plot running through them like blood. A jostling family scene \u2013 down-to-earth and yet premonitory \u2013 anchors what follows. June Watson towers and crumbles magnificently as the matter-of-fact mother who is \u2013 like so many here \u2013 not exactly what she seems. Michael Gould\u2019s Creon slips through the action like a warning shadow. Lesley Manville\u2019s Jocasta and Mark Strong\u2019s Oedipus are transfixing: magnetised by each other, aiming high; she translucent, he monumental. Irony snakes through the preposterous action. \u201cBaby!\u201d yelled out as a sexual endearment has a particular ring when the two lovers are more closely related than they know. A dig at the Freudian analysis for which the oedipal complex was to be so central is administered when a character complains that it does not help to talk. Yet the unconscious is everywhere, tripping characters\u2019 tongues, steering or blinding their eyes: \u201cJust because you don\u2019t see it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\u201d Next year Ella Hickson\u2019s new version of Oedipus will be staged at the Old Vic, starring Rami Malek and Indira Varma. Icke has already made Sophocles\u2019s drama look like a play for today. Timothy Sheader\u2019s first season as artistic director of the important Donmar has got off to a flying start. Justin Martin\u2019s production of The Fear of 13 has something of the same crackle as his 2022 staging of Prima Facie with Jodie Comer \u2013 and an echo of the ingredients. The star billing (Adrien Brody of The Pianist); the plot hinging on a legal dispute \u2013 the real-life case of Nick Yarris, who spent 22 years on death row in Pennsylvania for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. It hits with fury. At the slovenly incompetence, the casual disregard of the legal assistance provided to America\u2019s poor. At the sheer bad luck of those trying to appeal: some crucial evidence is lost, some is contaminated; a packet containing crucial material bursts open in the post. \u201cI\u2019m going to the electric chair because of fucking FedEx,\u201d Brody snarls. Lindsey Ferrentino\u2019s script gets its drive from the plot and its emotion from the social implications. A thread of myth-making adds distinctiveness: Yarris is locked up because he \u201cconfessed\u201d to a murder he didn\u2019t commit. Loopy and musing, Brody is off-whack and beguiling. No wonder that his prison visitor (with a PhD in poetry) falls for him and the many words he learns in the library (\u201cincredulous\u201d is one of them): Nana Mensah is just right in her crispness and compassion.

Time-travelling does not always transport. Jodie ex-Doctor Who Whittaker, who first appears in The Duchess (of Malfi) crooning persuasively into a mic, her blazing white face and crimson dress like an image of bone and blood, is forthright and clear, but Zinnie Harris\u2019s updated version of John Webster\u2019s 1613 tragedy, first staged five years ago in Edinburgh, directed, as now, by Harris, and reviewed for the Observer by Clare Brennan, is a muddle.

      "body": "<p>For a phenomenon that has&nbsp;such visible results,&nbsp;there is huge secrecy around weight-loss drugs.</p> <p>Ellen lied to get her Wegovy pen. \u201cI put weights around my neck under my dressing gown when I got on the scales,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do the review and five \u00adminutes later, I got the approval.\u201d</p> <p>Like most of the hundreds of thousands of people in the UK who have taken weight-loss drugs in the past few years, Ellen went to an online pharmacy to pay her \u00adprescription. \u201cYou have to film it live \u2013 here\u2019s my passport, here\u2019s my body, here I am getting on the scales,\u201d she said.</p> <p>At 5ft 9in (1.75m) and 12 and a half stone (79kg), Ellen \u2013 not her real name \u2013 was barely \u00adoverweight. The hidden weights and a \u00adsudden height loss \u2013 \u201cI said I was 5ft 2in\u201d \u2013 were enough to get a prescription.</p> <p>\u201cI was on it for six months and I\u2019ve lost three stone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a touch lighter than I should be, but the plan was always to come down a bit more, to go up a bit.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not what Wegovy or Mounjaro were designed for \u2013 which was to help seriously obese people \u2013 nor Ozempic or Rybelsus, drugs to help diabetics manage their disease. All four are types of semaglutide, which mimics the hormone released by the body when eating food, GLP-1 . The essential effect is to make people lose their appetites.</p> <p>But they offer hope to those who had despaired of ever being able to lose weight, and to \u00adpoliticians \u00adgrappling with the problems of an obesity epidemic: more than a \u00adquarter of adults in England are \u00adliving with obesity and nearly two-thirds of those aged 18 or over are overweight at least.</p> <p>It\u2019s still not clear whether these injectable medications will be wonder drugs that are central to solving the obesity crisis, or sticking plasters \u2013 a temporary fix, with users simply regaining lost weight after they stop taking them.</p> <p>But there are already signs, three years after Wegovy began to be used in the US and barely a year since it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/04/nhs-in-england-to-start-prescribing-weight-loss-jab-wegovy-despite-low-supply\">officially launched in the UK</a>, that semaglutide medications are \u00adchanging the world \u2013 and \u00adchanging it in \u00adunexpected ways.</p> <h2>Fashion leads</h2> <p>The waif is back. At Berlin \u00adfashion week in July, Namilia sent a model on to the catwalk wearing an \u201cI heart Ozempic\u201d T-shirt, \u00adpushing into the open a \u00adconversation that had been going on behind the scenes: models taking Ozempic to&nbsp;be thinner.</p> <p>\u201cYou do get naturally thin 16- or 17-year-old girls who are sucked into the industry then told \u2018if you want to stay in it, you\u2019ve got to starve\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a really abusive grooming space,\u201d said Caryn Franklin, the former BBC <em>Clothes Show</em> presenter who is now a fashion and identity commentator.</p> <p>A campaign that she set up with supermodel Erin O\u2019Connor, All Walks Beyond The Catwalk, seemed to have worked \u2013 in 2017, major \u00adfashion houses signed up to a charter to protect models by \u00adbanning size zero, and plus-size models started to become visible at fashion shows.</p> <p>\u201cBut now we seem to be going back to thin models,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt feels like representation of \u00adaverage women was just a trend.\u201d</p> <p>Fashion editors have complained about the new wave sweeping the catwalk and those watching it. In the past few weeks, Chioma Nnadi of British<em> Vogue</em> described the \u201cnew cult of thinness\u201d as \u00ad\u201ctroubling\u201d. Anna Murphy of the <em>Times </em>said she was sad and angry at \u201cthe \u00aderasure of women\u201d, while Jo Ellison of the <em>Financial Times </em>said she was depressed at fashion\u2019s \u201cdangerously rail-thin aesthetic\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re really beginning to see this kind of \u00adcultural effect of Ozempic take place,\u201d Ellison said on the podcast <em>Life and Art from FT Weekend</em>.</p> <h2>Hollywood follows</h2>    <p>Fashion is the fastest culture vehicle, a taste leader, Franklin said. \u201cStylists who style starlets for the red carpet will go straight to a fashion house to get a sample garment,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then she\u2019s under pressure to fit it \u2013 the garments are designed and women have to fit in them. It\u2019s the wrong way round.\u201d</p> <p>Weight-loss drugs were \u201cjust another way of helping women destroy themselves through eating disorders,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That pressure applies to \u00adestablished stars too, trying to keep their place in Hollywood\u2019s \u00adpantheon or on TV screens, particularly in the US where Ozempic has been taken off-label \u2013 prescribed legally for a purpose for which it was not approved \u2013 since it was advertised in 2018. A few have spoken \u00adpublicly about taking the medications, such as Rebel Wilson, Kelly Clarkson and Amy Schumer, as well as older celebrities including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/02/oprah-ozempic-weight-loss-drug-weightwatchers\">Oprah Winfrey</a>, Elon Musk, Stephen Fry, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathy Bates, who has&nbsp;been keen to point out that most&nbsp;of her weight loss was from diet and exercise.</p> <p>But there is still plenty of secrecy in the image-dominated \u00adindustries, and plenty of speculation by fans who have a new have-they-haven\u2019t-they game to play on Reddit or Instagram about people in the \u00adspotlight, instead of gossiping about plastic surgery or Botox.</p> <h2>Social lives</h2> <p>As demand for weight-loss drugs has trickled down, some of the social impacts are starting to become clearer.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are secretive because they\u2019re ashamed of using this tool to do it,\u201d said Juls Abernethy, a women\u2019s wellness coach, therapist and cofounder of the Body Retreat, who has worked with several women looking for extra help to lose weight.</p> <p>None of them were prepared to tell their family or friends what they were doing. One hid her injectable pen among the condiments in her fridge so her husband wouldn\u2019t find it. People who feel ashamed of being fat, as if it were a moral failing, feel the same about using medication \u2013 of the fear of being seen to cheat, Abernethy said.</p> <p>\u201cWe talk about weight loss like a war,\u201d she said. \u201cBanish the bulge and fight the fat. It\u2019s supposed to be \u00addifficult. It\u2019s supposed to be \u00adarduous. And now you can pick up a pen for \u00a3150 or something.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen was more open about her methods. She shared her Wegovy pen with her husband, adjusting her dose to reduce the side effects of intense nausea that came when she did eat food.</p>    <p>She told her friends in London, but stopped discussing it with other people because it became difficult to deal with accusations that she was causing problems for diabetics (there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/30/prescription-of-diabetes-drug-ozempic-for-weight-loss-contributing-to-uk-shortage\">shortages of Ozempic for Type 2 diabetes \u00adsufferers</a> last year) or with endless questions about what it was like to inject \u00adherself in her midriff once a week.</p> <p>\u201cOur whole life used to be planned around food,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we stopped eating out because we\u2019d just order a starter, and it felt a bit cheap. Then we went to New York for a week and realised when we got there we\u2019d made no dinner reservations.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cfood noise\u201d \u2013 thoughts about when to eat and what to eat \u2013 simply disappeared, she said. During the six months she took Wegovy, the \u00adcouple \u201csaved an absolute \u00adfortune on food\u201d, she said. \u201cWe\u2019d get a Domino\u2019s \u00addelivered and two pizzas would last us three days. And, sadder for me, it really puts you off alcohol.\u201d</p> <h2>Weight-loss industry</h2>    <p>Abernethy is one of the few people still advertising weight-loss retreats, she said. \u201cMost people have changed their name or dropped the weight-loss element,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know why people aren\u2019t clicking, but over the course of this year, we\u2019ve definitely seen a downturn in our weight-loss retreat, which is \u00adgenerally our most popular. You can\u2019t ignore the Ozempic thing.\u201d</p> <p>For larger firms, it\u2019s a bigger problem. Sima Sistani stood down last month as chief executive of WW International, which owns WeightWatchers, after trying to turn around the company\u2019s fortunes.</p> <p>Its shares have fallen by 97% since 2021, even though it now offers a \u201cGLP-1 programme\u201d and offers semaglutide as part of its WeightWatchers Clinic business.</p> <h2>Food industry</h2> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of \u00adourselves \u2013 4.1m people are eligible to receive Wegovy,\u201d said Alfie Slade, government affairs lead at the Obesity Heath Alliance. \u201cAt the moment, we have capacity to treat 35,000 people a year on the NHS in specialist weight management clinics. The source of obesity is the broken food \u00adenvironment where companies have a financial incentive to sell the most profitable products, ones that are high in fat, salt and sugar.\u201d</p> <p>In 1983, grab bags and multipacks didn\u2019t exist, McDonald\u2019s had 1,000 outlets and KFC had a few hundred.

Research by JP Morgan suggests that \u00adpeople on GLP-1 drugs spend up to 17% less on food in the first six months, and Walmart said last year it was already seeing people buy less food, prompting investors to sell shares in PepsiCo and Mondel\u0113z.</p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 has responded by launching a line called Vital Pursuit \u2013 \u00adfrozen pizza, pasta and sandwiches that it bills as a \u201ccompanion for GLP-1 weight loss medication users\u201d.</p> <h2>Gyms</h2> <p>\u201cThough most of the weight loss is body fat, a downside of calorie deficit is that some of the weight lost is muscle,\u201d said Prof Lora Heisler, chair in human nutrition, Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen.</p> <p>Gyms have responded by \u00adreplacing treadmills and other \u00adcardio machines, previously seen as the best way to shed pounds, with more weight machines and free weights.</p> <p>There has been a longer-term shift towards people trying to gain muscle mass, which depletes as we age.

They lose water, then muscle mass.\u201d</p> <h2><br>Economic effects<br></h2> <p>Perhaps the least expected impact of the rise of semaglutide was on the share price of airlines. Analysts \u00adpredicted that lighter passengers would save fuel costs, with United Airlines saving $80m if average \u00adpassenger weights fell by 4.5kg.</p> <p>Denmark is another beneficiary. Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy and Ozempic, was estimated last year to be worth more than Denmark\u2019s annual GDP and the Danish government publishes figures with and without its new behemoth.</p> <p>Even publishers have felt an Ozempic effect. In the US, print sales in the \u201chealth and fitness\u201d category have fallen by 15% \u00adcompared to 4% overall, \u00adaccording to Circana. In the UK, fitness and diet books were down by 14% in 2023, compared with a 2% fall across&nbsp;the market, according to Nielsen BookData.</p> <p>Matthew Bell, a director at Frontier Economics, said obesity cost Britain about \u00a3100bn per year in lower quality of life for those \u00adliving with it and higher costs to the NHS. But discovering what \u00adproportion of people lose weight and keep it off would be important for \u00adunderstanding the real economic consequences of GLP-1 drugs, rather&nbsp;than the anecdotal evidence that has&nbsp;emerged so far.</p> <p>\u201cYou can use that data to \u00adunderstand the impact on different economic variables \u2013 \u00ademployment rates, productivity, purchasing \u00adhabits,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether weight-loss drugs will have the&nbsp;same impact as other \u00adtechnologies, such as smartphones or \u00adwashing machines.</p> <p>Statins, which help avoid hardening or narrowing of the \u00adarteries, have had an \u00adeconomic impact by preventing \u00adcountless deaths from heart attacks and strokes.</p> <p>\u201cThose drugs had knock-on effects,\u201d Bell said. \u201cPeople have a higher quality of life for longer, but towards the end of their life they may have more complex needs. And when large numbers of people live longer, that has impacts on pensions and a range of other economic decisions, including retirement ages.\u201d</p> <h2>Medical research</h2> <p>A lot of medical research \u00adfunding has focused on the outcomes of \u00adobesity, according to Naveed Sattar, professor of \u00adcardio\u00admetabolic \u00admedicine at the University&nbsp;of Glasgow and chair of the government\u2019s obesity healthcare goals programme. Obesity is associated with \u00addiabetes, kidney disease, heart \u00adfailure, heart attacks and strokes, as well as sleep apnoea, fatty liver \u00addisease and even skin conditions.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been slow to shift our \u00adpriorities to look at weight and interventions,\u201d Sattar said. \u201cPeople have come up with some very clever technologies to tackle diseases. But if we just use common sense and help people lose weight or stop them putting on weight, they wouldn\u2019t need that device.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers have been trying to work out how to reduce sleep apnoea, where the weight of the tongue causes it to collapse and occlude breathing. Some sufferers need machines at night to help them breathe, and researchers are trying to find ways to burn away fat cells in the tongue. Yet losing weight may be a simpler solution.</p> <p>It could be bad news for CFOs at some medical firms which have built their businesses treating those diseases. Cardiovascular disease has created a market worth $250bn (\u00a3192bn), and analysts suggested this could shrink by 10% by 2050.</p> <h2>Side effects</h2> <p>Ellen\u2019s loss of interest in alcohol as a result of taking Wegovy is backed up by research. A study from Loyola University in Chicago, published last week in <em>Addiction,</em> showed patients with addictions to alcohol or heroin who had been prescribed Ozempic were less likely to be hospitalised.</p> <p>Dr Riccardo De Giorgi from the University of Oxford\u2019s Medical Sciences Division, said trials \u00adinvestigating smoking are under way and there may be a positive effect for people with dementia.</p> <p>\u201cI would normally be quite careful and sceptical but one of the reasons why we have grounds to be optimistic is that we do see nice matching between what we see clinically and what we are seeing in pre-clinical and mechanistic studies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are also indications that it may reduce the risk of heart \u00adproblems, with the MHRA, the UK regulator, approving \u00adsemaglutide for prevention of heart attacks and strokes in July after studies \u00adsuggested it may reduce the risk of death by 20%. And researchers are examining the drugs\u2019 effects on \u00adfertility. Women who have previously struggled to have children say they have become pregnant after taking semaglutide for weight loss, leading to a host of #OzempicBabies posts on social media.</p> <p>But scientists have urged women not to take GLP-1 drugs in case there&nbsp;is any undiscovered risk caused by the drug, as happened with thalidomide.</p> <h2>Social media</h2>    <p>Semaglutide has proved divisive among those following the body positivity movement, a response to the aggression or prejudice directed at fat people. When Gabi Menard, a body positive influencer \u00adpopular&nbsp;on&nbsp;TikTok and Instagram, revealed that&nbsp;she had been taking Ozempic, she experienced a \u00adbacklash from her&nbsp;fans.</p> <h2>Mental health</h2> <p>For Juls Abernethy, there are deeper questions to address about weight loss and destructive eating habits.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started working with one client, all her anxieties around comfort eating, eating on her own, started to come out [after starting to use weight-loss drugs] . She had no appetite, so she started skin \u00adpicking, around her fingers. Her cuticles were raw, she\u2019d cause a scab and then she\u2019d pick at that.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, as her therapist, that was her general anxiety \u00admanifesting itself in a way that used to \u00adchannelled into food.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen is stopping her use of Wegovy, and said feeling hungry felt&nbsp;\u201cweird\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a girl \u2013 you\u2019re on a diet your whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always feel you\u2019re missing out, you\u2019re \u00adsacrificing something. But when you\u2019re taking it, you don\u2019t even think about eating. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re missing out. Suddenly, the sacrifice is back and I\u2019m sad to stop being like that. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For a phenomenon that has such visible results, there is huge secrecy around weight-loss drugs. Ellen lied to get her Wegovy pen. \u201cI put weights around my neck under my dressing gown when I got on the scales,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do the review and five minutes later, I got the approval.\u201d Like most of the hundreds of thousands of people in the UK who have taken weight-loss drugs in the past few years, Ellen went to an online pharmacy to pay her prescription. \u201cYou have to film it live \u2013 here\u2019s my passport, here\u2019s my body, here I am getting on the scales,\u201d she said. At 5ft 9in (1.75m) and 12 and a half stone (79kg), Ellen \u2013 not her real name \u2013 was barely overweight. The hidden weights and a sudden height loss \u2013 \u201cI said I was 5ft 2in\u201d \u2013 were enough to get a prescription. \u201cI was on it for six months and I\u2019ve lost three stone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a touch lighter than I should be, but the plan was always to come down a bit more, to go up a bit.\u201d It\u2019s not what Wegovy or Mounjaro were designed for \u2013 which was to help seriously obese people \u2013 nor Ozempic or Rybelsus, drugs to help diabetics manage their disease. All four are types of semaglutide, which mimics the hormone released by the body when eating food, GLP-1 . The essential effect is to make people lose their appetites. But they offer hope to those who had despaired of ever being able to lose weight, and to politicians grappling with the problems of an obesity epidemic: more than a quarter of adults in England are living with obesity and nearly two-thirds of those aged 18 or over are overweight at least. It\u2019s still not clear whether these injectable medications will be wonder drugs that are central to solving the obesity crisis, or sticking plasters \u2013 a temporary fix, with users simply regaining lost weight after they stop taking them. But there are already signs, three years after Wegovy began to be used in the US and barely a year since it was officially launched in the UK, that semaglutide medications are changing the world \u2013 and changing it in unexpected ways. Fashion leads The waif is back. At Berlin fashion week in July, Namilia sent a model on to the catwalk wearing an \u201cI heart Ozempic\u201d T-shirt, pushing into the open a conversation that had been going on behind the scenes: models taking Ozempic to be thinner. \u201cYou do get naturally thin 16- or 17-year-old girls who are sucked into the industry then told \u2018if you want to stay in it, you\u2019ve got to starve\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a really abusive grooming space,\u201d said Caryn Franklin, the former BBC Clothes Show presenter who is now a fashion and identity commentator. A campaign that she set up with supermodel Erin O\u2019Connor, All Walks Beyond The Catwalk, seemed to have worked \u2013 in 2017, major fashion houses signed up to a charter to protect models by banning size zero, and plus-size models started to become visible at fashion shows. \u201cBut now we seem to be going back to thin models,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt feels like representation of average women was just a trend.\u201d Fashion editors have complained about the new wave sweeping the catwalk and those watching it. In the past few weeks, Chioma Nnadi of British Vogue described the \u201cnew cult of thinness\u201d as \u201ctroubling\u201d. Anna Murphy of the Times said she was sad and angry at \u201cthe erasure of women\u201d, while Jo Ellison of the Financial Times said she was depressed at fashion\u2019s \u201cdangerously rail-thin aesthetic\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re really beginning to see this kind of cultural effect of Ozempic take place,\u201d Ellison said on the podcast Life and Art from FT Weekend. Hollywood follows Fashion is the fastest culture vehicle, a taste leader, Franklin said. \u201cStylists who style starlets for the red carpet will go straight to a fashion house to get a sample garment,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then she\u2019s under pressure to fit it \u2013 the garments are designed and women have to fit in them. It\u2019s the wrong way round.\u201d Weight-loss drugs were \u201cjust another way of helping women destroy themselves through eating disorders,\u201d she said. That pressure applies to established stars too, trying to keep their place in Hollywood\u2019s pantheon or on TV screens, particularly in the US where Ozempic has been taken off-label \u2013 prescribed legally for a purpose for which it was not approved \u2013 since it was advertised in 2018. A few have spoken publicly about taking the medications, such as Rebel Wilson, Kelly Clarkson and Amy Schumer, as well as older celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Elon Musk, Stephen Fry, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathy Bates, who has been keen to point out that most of her weight loss was from diet and exercise. But there is still plenty of secrecy in the image-dominated industries, and plenty of speculation by fans who have a new have-they-haven\u2019t-they game to play on Reddit or Instagram about people in the spotlight, instead of gossiping about plastic surgery or Botox. Social lives As demand for weight-loss drugs has trickled down, some of the social impacts are starting to become clearer. \u201cPeople are secretive because they\u2019re ashamed of using this tool to do it,\u201d said Juls Abernethy, a women\u2019s wellness coach, therapist and cofounder of the Body Retreat, who has worked with several women looking for extra help to lose weight. None of them were prepared to tell their family or friends what they were doing. One hid her injectable pen among the condiments in her fridge so her husband wouldn\u2019t find it. People who feel ashamed of being fat, as if it were a moral failing, feel the same about using medication \u2013 of the fear of being seen to cheat, Abernethy said. \u201cWe talk about weight loss like a war,\u201d she said. \u201cBanish the bulge and fight the fat. It\u2019s supposed to be difficult. It\u2019s supposed to be arduous. And now you can pick up a pen for \u00a3150 or something.\u201d Ellen was more open about her methods. She shared her Wegovy pen with her husband, adjusting her dose to reduce the side effects of intense nausea that came when she did eat food. She told her friends in London, but stopped discussing it with other people because it became difficult to deal with accusations that she was causing problems for diabetics (there were shortages of Ozempic for Type 2 diabetes sufferers last year) or with endless questions about what it was like to inject herself in her midriff once a week. \u201cOur whole life used to be planned around food,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we stopped eating out because we\u2019d just order a starter, and it felt a bit cheap. Then we went to New York for a week and realised when we got there we\u2019d made no dinner reservations.\u201d The \u201cfood noise\u201d \u2013 thoughts about when to eat and what to eat \u2013 simply disappeared, she said. During the six months she took Wegovy, the couple \u201csaved an absolute fortune on food\u201d, she said. \u201cWe\u2019d get a Domino\u2019s delivered and two pizzas would last us three days. And, sadder for me, it really puts you off alcohol.\u201d Weight-loss industry Abernethy is one of the few people still advertising weight-loss retreats, she said. \u201cMost people have changed their name or dropped the weight-loss element,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know why people aren\u2019t clicking, but over the course of this year, we\u2019ve definitely seen a downturn in our weight-loss retreat, which is generally our most popular. You can\u2019t ignore the Ozempic thing.\u201d For larger firms, it\u2019s a bigger problem. Sima Sistani stood down last month as chief executive of WW International, which owns WeightWatchers, after trying to turn around the company\u2019s fortunes. Its shares have fallen by 97% since 2021, even though it now offers a \u201cGLP-1 programme\u201d and offers semaglutide as part of its WeightWatchers Clinic business. Food industry \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves \u2013 4.1m people are eligible to receive Wegovy,\u201d said Alfie Slade, government affairs lead at the Obesity Heath Alliance. \u201cAt the moment, we have capacity to treat 35,000 people a year on the NHS in specialist weight management clinics. The source of obesity is the broken food environment where companies have a financial incentive to sell the most profitable products, ones that are high in fat, salt and sugar.\u201d In 1983, grab bags and multipacks didn\u2019t exist, McDonald\u2019s had 1,000 outlets and KFC had a few hundred. There are now 48,000 fast food outlets in England alone, and bans on junk food advertising have yet to come into effect. In the US, which has had longer to see the effects of weight-loss drugs emerging, companies that make and sell ultra-processed foods are identifying potential problems. Research by JP Morgan suggests that people on GLP-1 drugs spend up to 17% less on food in the first six months, and Walmart said last year it was already seeing people buy less food, prompting investors to sell shares in PepsiCo and Mondel\u0113z. Nestl\u00e9 has responded by launching a line called Vital Pursuit \u2013 frozen pizza, pasta and sandwiches that it bills as a \u201ccompanion for GLP-1 weight loss medication users\u201d. Gyms \u201cThough most of the weight loss is body fat, a downside of calorie deficit is that some of the weight lost is muscle,\u201d said Prof Lora Heisler, chair in human nutrition, Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen. Gyms have responded by replacing treadmills and other cardio machines, previously seen as the best way to shed pounds, with more weight machines and free weights. There has been a longer-term shift towards people trying to gain muscle mass, which depletes as we age. But there is also \u201cintense interest now in finding ways to block muscle loss during weight loss\u201d, Heisler added, with researchers looking for pharmaceutical solutions too. Eli Lilly is working on bimagrumab, which she said \u201chas shown some success in preclinical trials in protecting muscle from being lost\u201d while people take GLP-1 drugs. Nutrition is a wider issue for users of the drugs. Ruchi Bhuwania Lohia, founder of Wellness with Ruchi, said: \u201cWhen people come in, they can be quite nutrient deficient. They lose water, then muscle mass.\u201d Economic effects Perhaps the least expected impact of the rise of semaglutide was on the share price of airlines. Analysts predicted that lighter passengers would save fuel costs, with United Airlines saving $80m if average passenger weights fell by 4.5kg. Denmark is another beneficiary. Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy and Ozempic, was estimated last year to be worth more than Denmark\u2019s annual GDP and the Danish government publishes figures with and without its new behemoth. Even publishers have felt an Ozempic effect. In the US, print sales in the \u201chealth and fitness\u201d category have fallen by 15% compared to 4% overall, according to Circana. In the UK, fitness and diet books were down by 14% in 2023, compared with a 2% fall across the market, according to Nielsen BookData. Matthew Bell, a director at Frontier Economics, said obesity cost Britain about \u00a3100bn per year in lower quality of life for those living with it and higher costs to the NHS. But discovering what proportion of people lose weight and keep it off would be important for understanding the real economic consequences of GLP-1 drugs, rather than the anecdotal evidence that has emerged so far. \u201cYou can use that data to understand the impact on different economic variables \u2013 employment rates, productivity, purchasing habits,\u201d he said. It remains to be seen whether weight-loss drugs will have the same impact as other technologies, such as smartphones or washing machines. Statins, which help avoid hardening or narrowing of the arteries, have had an economic impact by preventing countless deaths from heart attacks and strokes. \u201cThose drugs had knock-on effects,\u201d Bell said. \u201cPeople have a higher quality of life for longer, but towards the end of their life they may have more complex needs. And when large numbers of people live longer, that has impacts on pensions and a range of other economic decisions, including retirement ages.\u201d Medical research A lot of medical research funding has focused on the outcomes of obesity, according to Naveed Sattar, professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow and chair of the government\u2019s obesity healthcare goals programme. Obesity is associated with diabetes, kidney disease, heart failure, heart attacks and strokes, as well as sleep apnoea, fatty liver disease and even skin conditions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been slow to shift our priorities to look at weight and interventions,\u201d Sattar said. \u201cPeople have come up with some very clever technologies to tackle diseases. But if we just use common sense and help people lose weight or stop them putting on weight, they wouldn\u2019t need that device.\u201d Researchers have been trying to work out how to reduce sleep apnoea, where the weight of the tongue causes it to collapse and occlude breathing. Some sufferers need machines at night to help them breathe, and researchers are trying to find ways to burn away fat cells in the tongue. Yet losing weight may be a simpler solution. It could be bad news for CFOs at some medical firms which have built their businesses treating those diseases. Cardiovascular disease has created a market worth $250bn (\u00a3192bn), and analysts suggested this could shrink by 10% by 2050. Side effects Ellen\u2019s loss of interest in alcohol as a result of taking Wegovy is backed up by research. A study from Loyola University in Chicago, published last week in Addiction, showed patients with addictions to alcohol or heroin who had been prescribed Ozempic were less likely to be hospitalised. Dr Riccardo De Giorgi from the University of Oxford\u2019s Medical Sciences Division, said trials investigating smoking are under way and there may be a positive effect for people with dementia. \u201cI would normally be quite careful and sceptical but one of the reasons why we have grounds to be optimistic is that we do see nice matching between what we see clinically and what we are seeing in pre-clinical and mechanistic studies,\u201d he said. There are also indications that it may reduce the risk of heart problems, with the MHRA, the UK regulator, approving semaglutide for prevention of heart attacks and strokes in July after studies suggested it may reduce the risk of death by 20%. And researchers are examining the drugs\u2019 effects on fertility. Women who have previously struggled to have children say they have become pregnant after taking semaglutide for weight loss, leading to a host of #OzempicBabies posts on social media. But scientists have urged women not to take GLP-1 drugs in case there is any undiscovered risk caused by the drug, as happened with thalidomide. Social media Semaglutide has proved divisive among those following the body positivity movement, a response to the aggression or prejudice directed at fat people. When Gabi Menard, a body positive influencer popular on TikTok and Instagram, revealed that she had been taking Ozempic, she experienced a backlash from her fans. Mental health For Juls Abernethy, there are deeper questions to address about weight loss and destructive eating habits. \u201cWhen I started working with one client, all her anxieties around comfort eating, eating on her own, started to come out [after starting to use weight-loss drugs] .

But when you\u2019re taking it, you don\u2019t even think about eating. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re missing out. Suddenly, the sacrifice is back and I\u2019m sad to stop being like that.

      "body": "<p>Last weekend, in answer to the question \u201cWhat was the last book you read?\u201d, Tory leadership contender Robert Jenrick said <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>. Lots to unpack there. First, some context: it was in the \u201cquickfire questions\u201d section of an interview in the <em>Daily Mail</em>, among the readers of which there may be one or two members of the Conservative party. Possibly even more. So, as a politics professional, Jenrick will have been focused on coming across well to them.</p> <p>It\u2019s tricky for him, though, because that\u2019s not the same thing as coming across well in general. It\u2019s not the wider public he\u2019s courting. Nor even Tory voters. No, he has to appeal to a constituency of people who make those who merely vote Conservative seem like hand-wringing woke hipsters. This is a group that, only two years ago, confidently selected Liz Truss to be prime minister. Admittedly the only other item on the menu was Rishi Sunak, but that still looks like a perverse choice to anyone sensible. Sunak has many detractors but there\u2019s only one of them who thinks Liz Truss was a better prime minister than him and that person\u2019s name is Liz Truss.</p> <p>Nevertheless it\u2019s this group whose support Jenrick must obtain, while at the same time remaining relatively plausible to everyone else because, if he wins, he\u2019ll eventually need some of their votes too. You can\u2019t go too mad and start advocating shooting dogs for urinating against war memorials or putting actors in prison for mumbling on TV. That\u2019s only going to be a short-term gain. This is what was in everyone\u2019s minds when the Jenrick team sat down to help him answer the question \u201cWhat was the last book you read?\u201d</p> <p>By the way, it is no reflection on Jenrick that I\u2019m suggesting his answer may be untrue. Let\u2019s not hold that against him \u2013 especially when there\u2019s so much else to choose from. Politicians have to lie a bit in that sort of questionnaire. They\u2019re trying to project an image and a snapshot of their reading habits won\u2019t always do that. What if he\u2019s just finished <em>The Flowering Shrub Expert</em> by DG Hessayon? Is he supposed to admit that and get pigeonholed as the shrub candidate?</p> <p>\u201cSo what shall we say?\u201d they must have pondered. \u201cHow do we want you to come across?\u201d The fact that the conversation that ensued ended in the selection of <em>A Tale of Two Cities </em>is, in a quiet way, one of the most inexplicable things in the universe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mel Stride seemed capable. Not amazing, but someone you might trust to book a table in a restaurant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Look, I get that <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> is reputed to be a good book. I have not read it, but Charles Dickens is a smashing writer and it is one of his most successful novels. And he is long dead and of stellar reputation so <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> is definitely Proper Literature. And English literature at that \u2013 doubly English as it is written in English by a person who is also English, something I imagine the Tory faithful would approve of. It\u2019s not some immigrant Pole like Joseph Conrad coming over here and taking all the novelist work.</p> <p>Also, because it\u2019s Dickens, it feels, as English literature goes, relatively approachable. There are more Disney and Muppets versions of Dickens\u2019s books than there are of George Eliot, Thomas Hardy or EM Forster. So, in defence of his choice of response, Jenrick is proclaiming himself a fan of highly respectable, yet relatively accessible, UK-based heritage fiction, all of which is thoroughly \u201con brand\u201d.</p> <p>The trouble is that it is <em>so</em> \u201con brand\u201d that it\u2019s a ridiculous answer to the question. It\u2019s like responding to \u201cWhat did you do at the weekend?\u201d by saying \u201cI spent it cutting taxes for hard-working families\u201d. I don\u2019t doubt that Jenrick has at some point read <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>. But he is suggesting that he\u2019s <em>just </em>read it. That in the middle of an incredibly busy and professionally challenging time in his life, he\u2019s waded through a long and dense Victorian novel. That seems really unlikely and odd. Does he want to come across as odd? Possibly. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/02/james-cleverly-conservative-leadership-bid-tories\">James Cleverly advocated the Tories becoming \u201cmore normal</a>\u201d and was knocked out of the leadership race a week later.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a notable aspect of this contest that, even though the Tory membership has not yet been involved and it\u2019s all been in the hands of MPs, the candidates have been eliminated in reverse order of shitness. (That\u2019s if you don\u2019t count Priti Patel, which I think is wise in all circumstances.) First Mel Stride, who seemed like a perfectly capable governmental figure. Not amazing, but someone you might trust to book a table in a restaurant. Then Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly, who I suppose are fine and would certainly know how to say \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the real question here\u201d when asked why they\u2019d forgotten to book.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/06/how-low-will-a-tory-go-in-order-to-stand-out-kemi-badenoch\">How low will a Tory go in order to stand out? | David Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now we\u2019re left with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/10/centrist-conservatives-refuse-back-badenoch-jenrick-tory-reform-group-leadership-candidates-party-right\">Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick</a>, who will book nothing but flights to Rwanda. She says some pretty extreme stuff. So does he nowadays. He used to say some much more moderate stuff but that was a different time.

Maybe he doesn\u2019t mean to imply that he read it recently. Perhaps he\u2019s suggesting that he studied it at school and hasn\u2019t read a book since. Is he pushing the old \u201cBritain is tired of experts\u201d agenda? Would the membership like that? \u201cGet your nose out of that tome, Starmer, you speccy twat, and help me throw some immigrants in the sea!\u201d Is that the idea? If so, I\u2019m not sure saying <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> is sufficient on its own to launch his radical new anti-intellectual approach.</p> <p>It\u2019s so baffling that I\u2019m forced to entertain the notion that he gave an honest answer to the question. That, weirdly, and with everything else that\u2019s going on in his life, Jenrick has genuinely just finished reading <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>. If that\u2019s true, I really think he should have made something up.</p>",

Would the membership like that? \u201cGet your nose out of that tome, Starmer, you speccy twat, and help me throw some immigrants in the sea!\u201d Is that the idea? If so, I\u2019m not sure saying A Tale of Two Cities is sufficient on its own to launch his radical new anti-intellectual approach. It\u2019s so baffling that I\u2019m forced to entertain the notion that he gave an honest answer to the question. That, weirdly, and with everything else that\u2019s going on in his life, Jenrick has genuinely just finished reading A Tale of Two Cities. If that\u2019s true, I really think he should have made something up.",

      "body": "<p>Click. Click. Click. I\u2019m vaguely aware of the sound of a camera shutter coming from somewhere above me. I push deep into my bottom, a dull, rising ache reverberating around my stomach and back. Click. Click. The noise is now in front of me, I think, but I can\u2019t focus on it, so great is the effort of pushing. I take a deep breath in and heave again, cheered on by two midwives and my partner holding my hand, bearing down to squeeze away the pain. Click. The sound comes again but, still, it\u2019s easy to tune out as another wave of pain begins to rise, along with a mild panic that my pushes are achieving nothing. And then, suddenly, I feel something beginning to descend within me, the weight of my baby moving down through the birth canal. Everything in the room fades away as I\u2019m consumed by the primal sensation of my baby preparing to leave my body. The feeling overwhelms me. It and I become tangled; elementally intertwined. I am nothing but this feeling.</p>    <p>I know, now, my birth photographer, the person behind the \u201cclicks\u201d, managed to capture this transcendental moment. In the images, my eyes are screwed up with effort, my chin is doubled on my neck, and my fingers are gripping my partner\u2019s hand so tightly they\u2019ve turned white. At the top of the taut hump of my stomach, a slight shadow appears to reveal the vague shape of a baby about to be born. The stills are strikingly visceral.</p> <p>During my pregnancy, each time I revealed my plans to have a photographer at the birth, I was met with a slightly different response: curiosity, concern, jealousy, disapproval. There was an overriding sense from most, though, that, in having someone take photos of my child\u2019s birth, I was engaging in an act of extreme vanity. \u201cIs nothing sacred?\u201d came the cry, again and again.</p>    <p>Historically more common in America, birth photography is, seemingly, on the rise in the UK. In 2024, BabyCentre registered 250 mentions on its UK forums compared with 77 in 2020 \u2013 an increase of 187%. Lacey Barratt, owner and director of the International Association of Professional Birth Photographers, says many of her photographers now make a full-time wage from the profession. \u201cThose of us who have been shooting births for a decade or longer can certainly attest that over time there has definitely been an increase in inquiries and bookings.\u201d A sign, perhaps, that millennial mothers have grown weary of saccharine sweet newborn photoshoots and instead want something grittier.</p> <p>A birth photography package costs in the region of between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000, depending on the offering. Many photographers provide doula support, too, and it is, perhaps, not a surprise that the popularity of birth photography has risen in line with the use of doulas in the UK: women are taking control of their most intimate of days.</p>    <p>My own birth photographer, Amy Lee, offers breath-work support for women in labour, in addition to photography. \u201cI\u2019m a birth partner,\u201d says Lee. In fact, she first trained as a photojournalist with a focus on war photography and I\u2019m struck by the similarities between the two: both bloody, both intimate, both requiring a photographer to be there and also not; to sit on the fringes of the frontline and observe, bear witness, through a lens. \u201cYou have to shoot fast, not get in the way, be invisible,\u201d she says of her work as a photojournalist, although this could surely apply to her work in a delivery room, too. In reality, Lee found the reasons she chose not to pursue war photography were why she enjoys birth photography. \u201cI wasn\u2019t somebody who could just stand back and witness,\u201d she says, explaining that, during labour she acts as an advocate for her clients. There are further similarities between the two vocations, though, not least in establishing what should and shouldn\u2019t be seen; what is and isn\u2019t intrusive. Unlike in photojournalism, however, in birth photography, the line between what\u2019s invasive and what isn\u2019t is dictated by the subjects of the images: the clients decide what they want shot. \u201cThere are certain moments that some people tend to be extremely private about, whereas other people are quite happy to share those,\u201d says Lee. \u201cFor me, intrusiveness comes when you\u2019re crossing the boundaries of people\u2019s values.\u201d</p>    <p>Establishing those boundaries is something Lee takes seriously. We meet three times before my due date, including once with my partner, Stuart, in which we also discuss his needs. (They agree on a \u201csafe word\u201d to use if he wants her to leave.) As well as talking us through the practicalities \u2013 when to call her; how long she takes to arrive; what she brings (snacks and a roll mat to kip on if needed) \u2013 she also goes through the types of photos we\u2019re comfortable having. Do I want a crowning shot? Skin-to-skin? The first feed? My placenta? As we talk, parameters are drawn up, with Lee taking note of where our red lines are. She advises us to contact the hospital: their red lines are just as important and, although one doesn\u2019t need permission to bring a photographer to a birth, it\u2019s respectful to ask, especially considering that staff are likely to appear in photos. (This fastidious regard for others continues into labour with Lee checking in with each new staff member in order to gain consent. Everyone gives it, gladly.) Our pre-birth meetings feel like a combination of NCT classes and wedding planning, albeit with the proviso that, with birth, there\u2019s only so much you can control.</p>    <p><em><strong>For many, this is the beauty</strong></em> of birth photography. Lynsey Harrison, 36, has had her three births photographed for this reason. \u201cYou can\u2019t pose for a photo during birth,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s natural, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s raw.\u201d Harrison praises her own birth photographer for capturing \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cgraphic\u201d scenes. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to looking at our own vaginas and blood running down our legs, or seeing ourselves naked from various angles and perspectives while pushing out a baby,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to see those photos, because I want to be reminded of how powerful I was.\u201d For others, though, birth can be a traumatic event; not one they want to be reminded of.</p>    <p>Dr Kim Thomas, CEO of the Birth Trauma Association, says that for most women who approach them, birth has been intensely frightening and, often, involved a medical emergency, such as the use of forceps or a caesarean. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see that capturing the moment of birth would be anything other than distressing,\u201d she says. A close friend of mine, who has birth trauma from her first birth, confirms this, saying she would have found photos of her labour extremely triggering. \u201cIt would serve as snapshots of an experience I\u2019m desperate to forget.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m aware then that my desire to have a photographer at the birth of my second child came from a position of privilege: I had a positive experience at my first. So positive, in fact, that it implanted in me a deep curiosity about my body. Like Lynsey, I wanted to look back and see what it was capable of; to reread the story, the narrative arc, of one of the most momentous days of my life.</p>    <p>I\u2019d be lying, though if I said the presence of a photographer didn\u2019t affect the way I prepared. Having previously been determined to have an epidural \u2013 I\u2019d had one in my first labour and loved it \u2013 I dabbled, for a while, with the notion of a water birth, thinking, slightly madly, that the photos would be better, more dynamic. I didn\u2019t do any hypnobirthing or rehearse birth affirmations, but I did get highlights and a pedicure. I also became increasingly anxious about having an unplanned caesarean, not because of the impracticalities of recovery with a toddler, but because it would have an impact on the photos I\u2019d get. According to the rules at my hospital, second birth partners, including photographers, have to leave the room as soon as a situation becomes an emergency.</p> <p>On the day, none of my fears came to fruition. Once the contractions ramped up, any desire to get pictures in the pool evaporated and I requested an epidural. Lee, having liaised with my partner, arrived as the anesthesia was being placed, bringing with her a bag of snacks and cups of tea, a testament to the fact that a good birth photographer is, first and foremost, a good birth partner.</p>    <p>In fact, my abiding memory of having her there is not the click of her camera, but the conversation we had, once my epidural had kicked in, about the joys and challenges of raising boys \u2013 she has one; I was about to have two. It was a level of intimacy I hadn\u2019t anticipated and it made me feel more powerful than any affirmation could have done. And I don\u2019t remember her being there at the point of birth, because she\u2019d made herself invisible as she captured moments I\u2019d later look back on in wonder.</p> <p><em><strong>Lee says she wants</strong></em> her work to empower women and normalise birth so it\u2019s no longer something to be hidden or deemed messy, unsightly, or frightening. Birth is bloody and beautiful and those things can, she argues, coexist within our consciousness. Too often, blood is depicted as a warning; something to be feared. \u201cActually,\u201d Lee says, \u201cblood is life.\u201d Looking at images of birth, she adds, is the best way to normalise it. \u201cIf we [women] can\u2019t look at it ourselves then what hope do we have?\u201d</p> <p>This raises an interesting question about who my photos are for. Lynsey has hers in albums that she looks at with her children the night before their birthdays. A few others, chosen with visitors in mind, are on display around her house. So will I put mine on my mantelpiece? Share them on WhatsApp with friends and family? Upload them to social media?</p>    <p>Instagram, of course, may not allow them: the app bans nude images. While its guidelines claim nudity in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after birth moments are OK, some birth accounts, such as Megan Rossiter\u2019s Birth-ed, have given up sharing such images as they found they were constantly at risk of being shut down. \u201cI stopped in March,\u201d says Rossiter. \u201cAnything that\u2019s not a nipple or mid vaginal birth is still OK. Anything else seems to be either hidden or removed or blocks my account in some way.\u201d</p> <p>That said, while movements such as the Empowered Birth Project campaign to allow uncensored images of childbirth on the app, agree with Lee that to see is to educate, inform and celebrate, I can\u2019t help but feel a tug of conflict. Dr Kim Thomas tells me women who approach her organisation say they find seeing images of birth on social media \u201cextremely triggering\u201d, something my friend can attest to. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look at anything birth related for the first two years,\u201d she says.</p>    <p>Probably, then, the photos \u2013 the most intimate ones, at least \u2013 are just for my partner and me. Certainly, I\u2019ve enjoyed looking back at them at my own pace, with my sleeping newborn in my arms. I\u2019ve been struck by how familiar the baby in the images looks: we didn\u2019t know him at the time, but we do now. Sometimes I worry what he will make of the photographs when he grows up; after all, he\u2019s the only person in the room whose permission we didn\u2019t seek.</p> <p>And then I\u2019m struck by the care displayed by the team around me and captured in the stills and am grateful we\u2019ll get to share that with him. One photo shows the student midwife who delivered him locking eyes with me as I push, her expression bright and joyful. Another has her gently tucking my hair behind my ear as I try to latch my new baby, an act of such tenderness my eyes filled with tears as soon as I saw it.</p>    <p>In the end, it isn\u2019t a photo of me actually giving birth that takes my breath away. Instead, it\u2019s one taken just afterwards, in the limbo land between life and not-quite-life, when my baby was still caught between two worlds: inside and outside; before and after. The photograph is brutal, bloody, beautiful. It\u2019s of the umbilical cord, not yet cut, snaking outwards from the darkness of within into the bright light of the hospital room. In the picture, I can see my second-degree tear \u2013 then brand new, now something I am intimately familiar with \u2013 and, even in the stillness of the photo, the silvery grey cord that appears to pulse with the life it\u2019s given my baby for nine months.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a photograph I\u2019ll share \u2013 on social media or elsewhere \u2013 but it is one I\u2019ll cherish. And it\u2019s a moment \u2013 the last time I was physically one with my child \u2013 I\u2019d never have seen had I not invited someone with a camera into my birth. What, really, could be more sacred than that?</p>",

Probably, then, the photos \u2013 the most intimate ones, at least \u2013 are just for my partner and me. Certainly, I\u2019ve enjoyed looking back at them at my own pace, with my sleeping newborn in my arms. I\u2019ve been struck by how familiar the baby in the images looks: we didn\u2019t know him at the time, but we do now. Sometimes I worry what he will make of the photographs when he grows up; after all, he\u2019s the only person in the room whose permission we didn\u2019t seek. And then I\u2019m struck by the care displayed by the team around me and captured in the stills and am grateful we\u2019ll get to share that with him. One photo shows the student midwife who delivered him locking eyes with me as I push, her expression bright and joyful. Another has her gently tucking my hair behind my ear as I try to latch my new baby, an act of such tenderness my eyes filled with tears as soon as I saw it. In the end, it isn\u2019t a photo of me actually giving birth that takes my breath away. Instead, it\u2019s one taken just afterwards, in the limbo land between life and not-quite-life, when my baby was still caught between two worlds: inside and outside; before and after. The photograph is brutal, bloody, beautiful. It\u2019s of the umbilical cord, not yet cut, snaking outwards from the darkness of within into the bright light of the hospital room. In the picture, I can see my second-degree tear \u2013 then brand new, now something I am intimately familiar with \u2013 and, even in the stillness of the photo, the silvery grey cord that appears to pulse with the life it\u2019s given my baby for nine months. It\u2019s not a photograph I\u2019ll share \u2013 on social media or elsewhere \u2013 but it is one I\u2019ll cherish. And it\u2019s a moment \u2013 the last time I was physically one with my child \u2013 I\u2019d never have seen had I not invited someone with a camera into my birth. What, really, could be more sacred than that?",

Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moldova has gravitated between pro-western and pro-Russian courses, but under Sandu the impoverished country has accelerated its push to escape Moscow\u2019s orbit amid its war in neighbouring Ukraine. Sandu, a former World Bank official, was elected president in November 2020, riding a wave of popularity as an anti-corruption reformer with a pro-European agenda. Polls tip Sandu to win in the first round and suggest that up to 65% support joining the EU, though the sitting president could face a more difficult path if forced into a second-round runoff.

The candidate most likely to push Sandu into a possible second round is the Russia-friendly Alexandr Stoianoglo, a softly spoken former prosecutor general who was dismissed by Sandu and is polling at 10%. Speaking to the Guardian, he urged people to boycott the referendum or vote \u201cno\u201d, describing it as a \u201ccynical\u201d move to boost Sandu\u2019s popularity. Stoianoglo denied that he was working on behalf of Russia. But he declined to criticise the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and called for improved relations with Moscow. \u201cThe level of Russian interference in Moldova is highly exaggerated,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Sandu\u2019s allies consider Sunday\u2019s vote to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Moldova to make a decisive break from its Soviet past. \u201cWe have a unique opportunity: Moldova has a pro-European president, parliament, and government. The EU is open to our membership, with all countries backing accession talks last June,\u201d said Ro\u015fca, the president\u2019s adviser. \u201cMoldova\u2019s survival as a democracy is on the line, and the geopolitical stakes are higher than ever.\u201d",

Not only did they go to sleep for them immediately, they remained in their beds throughout two of the three nights, a record we have not achieved in the past six months. There were no tantrums, and our 14-step contingency plan for emergencies relating to bone breakage, kidnapping, fire or flood went thankfully unused. They even remembered how house keys worked throughout this period, doubtless thankful of the reminders I\u2019d given them before we left.</p> <p>Looking at these updates as they came to us in Ireland, I did feel that mild twinge of annoyance you get when your children behave better for others than yourself, but was overjoyed that we could enjoy Sarah and George\u2019s beautiful wedding without fear of returning to a pile of charred rubble, or a pair of grim-faced in-laws intent on faking their deaths and moving to Peru.</p> <p>As the Stansted Express bore us home, a WhatsApp message informed us nana and grandad were with our kids in the local park. The message wasn\u2019t from them, mind you, but our friend, Sarah. She and her son, George (yes, they have the same names as the happy couple), had bumped into Sean and Marian an hour earlier, and they were all spending a pleasant sunny Saturday ambling through the playground and eating ice-cream.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I did feel that mild twinge of annoyance you get when your children behave better for others than yourself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is very typical. The world bends to meet my in-laws and they bend right back. To be with Marian in a restaurant is like attending a gala with a minor royal.

      "bodyText": "Having left our children with nana and grandad for three days, the inevitable came to pass. Not only did they go to sleep for them immediately, they remained in their beds throughout two of the three nights, a record we have not achieved in the past six months. There were no tantrums, and our 14-step contingency plan for emergencies relating to bone breakage, kidnapping, fire or flood went thankfully unused. They even remembered how house keys worked throughout this period, doubtless thankful of the reminders I\u2019d given them before we left. Looking at these updates as they came to us in Ireland, I did feel that mild twinge of annoyance you get when your children behave better for others than yourself, but was overjoyed that we could enjoy Sarah and George\u2019s beautiful wedding without fear of returning to a pile of charred rubble, or a pair of grim-faced in-laws intent on faking their deaths and moving to Peru. As the Stansted Express bore us home, a WhatsApp message informed us nana and grandad were with our kids in the local park. The message wasn\u2019t from them, mind you, but our friend, Sarah. She and her son, George (yes, they have the same names as the happy couple), had bumped into Sean and Marian an hour earlier, and they were all spending a pleasant sunny Saturday ambling through the playground and eating ice-cream. This is very typical. The world bends to meet my in-laws and they bend right back. To be with Marian in a restaurant is like attending a gala with a minor royal. People fuss over her as if she\u2019s taken time from her busy schedule to cut the ribbon at a youth centre. Whether it\u2019s an elderly Italian man barraging her with flirty flattery in a Hackney taverna, or a heavily tattooed young woman in a Walthamstow caf\u00e9, her stern exterior dissolved by questions from Marian about the fashion degree she\u2019s doing, and whether she\u2019s enjoying it.

Working across live performance, film, dance, art and fashion, he has released nine solo albums, including 2015\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.maxrichter-sleep.com/en/\">Sleep</a></em>, an eight-and-a-half-hour work based on the neuroscience of sleeping; 2020\u2019s <em>Voices</em>, inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and <em>In a Landscape</em>, released last month. A new ballet, <em><a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/maddaddam-details\">MaddAddam</a></em>, a collaboration between Richter and choreographer Wayne McGregor, with Margaret Atwood as a creative consultant, opens at the Royal Opera House on 14 November.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve got a busy </strong><strong>autumn ahead. Tell us about </strong><em><strong>In a Landscape</strong></em><strong> first \u2013 a more intimate, personal album for you.<br></strong>It is. It\u2019s an album about polarities, which are all around us in the world, and how we can reconcile them. We live in a time where one of the biggest challenges is that people who have different opinions basically can\u2019t talk to one another any more. This record is a small appeal to try to harmonise these differences, by working with materials that we might think of as in opposition \u2013 found sounds and composed music, the human world and the natural world \u2013 trying to put these things together in a fruitful relationship.</p>    <p><strong>What extremes do you come across in your day-to-day life?<br></strong>So much of our media consumption now is driven algorithmically, which is very difficult to avoid.

We\u2019re all surfing on this wave that is mediated by extreme emotions.</p> <p><strong>How do we resist that?<br></strong>Everyone needs to develop their own strategies, whether that\u2019s taking time out using systems to mute various apps, or leaving your phone at home, or changing your habits. It\u2019s particularly challenging for parents whose kids have grown up with this environment all around them, where DM-ing one another on a platform is the norm. You\u2019ve just got to encourage the idea that every interaction doesn\u2019t have to be online.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eurovision is a perfect evening of craziness.

How does streaming sit with you as an artist?<br></strong><em>Sleep</em> is 10 years old next year, unbelievably, so we\u2019re going to play some more concerts around it, and doing the concerts is great. As for streaming, the fact that people can explore the musical universe simply by following their affections and curiosity is amazing. As a kid, if I wanted to hear a piece of music I didn\u2019t know, I had to take a risk \u2013 make that bus trip, go either to the record library or the shop. Now, of course, it\u2019s just a click. But the economics of streaming are very problematic. It\u2019s put huge pressure on artists in terms of making a living.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve talked before about loving musicians </strong><strong>such as techno </strong><strong>DJ Jeff Mills</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood</strong><strong> working in the classical field.

Then again, he\u2019s always been a really interesting artist. [Caribbean-Belgian jazz musician] Nala Sinephro\u2019s new album is great too. She was an artist in residence at our studio a little while ago, so it was brilliant to hear the record she\u2019s made.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re also a fan of </strong><strong>Chic</strong><strong> and played with the </strong><strong>Future Sound</strong><strong> of London</strong><strong>. Are you a secret raver?<br></strong>I\u2019m a low-key raver! You know, I got into composing music because I love all kinds of music. With Chic, there are so many things about their work that I love. A lot of their songs sound like mantras, full of a rhythmic sort of repetitiveness, which really ties into systems music for me [like the work of Steve Reich and Philip Glass]. It\u2019s also amazingly well played and produced.</p>    <p><strong>I also understand you love Eurovision. Why?</strong><br>It\u2019s just a perfect evening of craziness, isn\u2019t it? You suspend all notions of genre and taste and it all just kind of\u2026 happens. I genuinely love it.

I used to tell myself that the nuts added an extra nutritional layer (indeed, a whole campaign has been made about that). Flake was the glamorous choice (eagle-eyed readers may remember it was one of my first, heady buys with my own money). Crunchie was the one I would buy the most.</p> <p>The Snickers/Marathon debate has raged for years, some people refuse to call it a Snickers, even though it was only known as a Marathon for 22 years of its nearly 100-year history, and even then only in the UK and Ireland, and stopped being a Marathon in 1990 \u2013 fully <em>34 years ago</em>. Now, and for a limited time \u2013 until December \u2013 for those who want to buy a Marathon, you can get them in Morrisons stores. No doubt they will sell for far more come January, via eBay, if that\u2019s your jam.</p> <p>What was my jam this week was <strong>Luisa\u2019s</strong> 75% Solomon Islands Toasted Almonds bar, \u00a34.95/50g. I love Luisa\u2019s mini, yet chunky-sized, bars. The chocolate was stand out: bright, keen, smooth, creamy, impressing. If I were writing a report card for it, it would have it all going on.</p> <p>Maybe it should be called the Teacher\u2019s Pet bar.

Every time I get a delivery of chocolate, and the driver makes a comment about it, and I ask: \u2018Would you like to try some?\u2019 the answer is invariably: \u2018Ah no, I\u2019m a Dairy Milk/Fruit and Nut kinda person\u2019 (these are the most likely to be mentioned, although occasionally it might be a Twirl). As I said a few weeks ago, one of my favourites was always a Snickers, or Marathon bar, as it was once known. I used to tell myself that the nuts added an extra nutritional layer (indeed, a whole campaign has been made about that). Flake was the glamorous choice (eagle-eyed readers may remember it was one of my first, heady buys with my own money). Crunchie was the one I would buy the most. The Snickers/Marathon debate has raged for years, some people refuse to call it a Snickers, even though it was only known as a Marathon for 22 years of its nearly 100-year history, and even then only in the UK and Ireland, and stopped being a Marathon in 1990 \u2013 fully 34 years ago. Now, and for a limited time \u2013 until December \u2013 for those who want to buy a Marathon, you can get them in Morrisons stores. No doubt they will sell for far more come January, via eBay, if that\u2019s your jam. What was my jam this week was Luisa\u2019s 75% Solomon Islands Toasted Almonds bar, \u00a34.95/50g. I love Luisa\u2019s mini, yet chunky-sized, bars. The chocolate was stand out: bright, keen, smooth, creamy, impressing. If I were writing a report card for it, it would have it all going on. Maybe it should be called the Teacher\u2019s Pet bar. A glorious treat for those of you who like to go 70% and beyond. Follow Annalisa on X @AnnalisaB",

It goes behind the scenes at every turn. Speedy speaks the language, acts as diplomat, takes gravely beautiful pictures; the suicidal king has himself looted his Christian country\u2019s churches. All the objects in the photograph appear in reality, before our very eyes, along with their newly complicated stories. Look twice, and think again: that might be Locke\u2019s motto.</p> <p>What to call his show at the British Museum: a dialogue, an experience, a shocking revelation? It is all these, and something else. The Guyanese-British artist has spent two years in the vaults, from which he has chosen more than 200 exhibits not just because of how they look, or indeed what they are, but for the strange tales that they carry.</p> <p>The show opens with Locke talking amiably on screen, surrounded by plastic storage crates and file boxes that spill right out into the gallery. The objects are grouped like small still lifes around specific portraits, such as Alemayehu, in plywood cases. Yellow cards offer stories, ideas and Locke\u2019s own ebullient ruminations. The past is forever in the present.</p> <p>And looking down from the top of these cases are his curious figures, the largest of them half the size of life: a Greek chorus of observers. A golden conquistador wears a feathered helmet, a shaman peers through fluttering robes, a carnival spectre has a skull mask. One wears a Benin T-shirt, another jeans, a third is in armour, superbly articulated out of cardboard \u2013 modern sculptures based on ancient masks, medieval breastplates, limewood carvings \u2013 whole traditions of world art, fashioned out of junk. It would be an overstatement to say that you have become an exhibit to these effigies, in turn, but something of that switch is intended.</p>    <p>Locke puts the emphasis on visibility. Here is a portrait of Charles II, the merry monarch, plus the usual evidence that he was a closet Catholic. But alongside is his <a href=\"https://encyclopediavirginia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12854_c8df6dcad690f94.jpg\">1663 charter</a> for the Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa. Does his faith really matter more than his involvement in human enslavement? The issue is what\u2019s displayed. \u201cWhich history we remember depends on what\u2019s been made visible for you.\u201d</p> <p>Locke shows beautiful prints of London\u2019s East India Docks in 1802, \u201clike Heathrow and Harwich and Rotterdam all rolled into one\u201d, as he says. One quay was nicknamed \u201cBlood Alley\u201d because the sugar sacks rubbed the skin off workers\u2019 backs. But there are no people in these images: they were devised as soothing propaganda.</p> <p>Here are shining brass discs pillaged from Benin City by British troops in 1897. Look closer and you see that they are missing sections of rim; look closer still and you see the violent burn marks. Here are trays of glass beads traded for coffee, oil and enslaved people; those exchanged for human beings are <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/E_Af1863-0717-3\">oddly faceted</a>, like jewels: as if to make a necklace of people.</p> <p>Your sight is sharpened.

The <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/EA_Am-EPH-AOA-B2-11\">white girl</a> in this 19th-century photograph turns out to be an enslaved person (the African American bloodline invisible yet disastrous). Count the innumerable bars rising like a miniature ladder on a Victorian medal and you realise that the British simply didn\u2019t have the cash to keep churning out new medals for all the African conflicts.</p> <p>The show is copiously stuffed: infinite riches in a single room. And Locke\u2019s own art is comparatively diffident and tactful; a few of his political paintings on colonial share certificates, and his Victorian busts decked in the baubles of empire. Though I wish Locke\u2019s effigies of observers were better lit to reveal his exceptional gift for expressive nuance.</p>    <p>But in the end, as he says at the start, this enterprise is all about dialogue. It is Locke\u2019s power of noticing that matters, and that compels you to notice all the anomalies too \u2013 the jug that belonged to Richard II yet somehow ends up in Ghana; the 16th-century African statue of a Portuguese mercenary fighting on their side against Europe; the weird affinity between Alemayehu and the other kidnapped \u201cgodsons\u201d of Queen Victoria, between Speedy\u2019s beard and the lion\u2019s mane. More than his figures, it is Locke\u2019s attentiveness that counts, discovering secrets, spotting paradoxes, asking unexpected questions: he is himself the ultimate observer.</p> <p><strong>Haegue Yang</strong>, born in South Korea in 1971, also conjures art out of junk.

Now Penguin is to bring out the first big English edition under its Allen Lane imprint in November. This news follows last week\u2019s announcement that the Nobel prize in literature has gone to Han Kang, the writer who now becomes not only the first Korean to win the prize, but also the first Asian woman. Han, 53, whose books include The Vegetarian and Human Acts, has seen her international sales figures rapidly swell in the last few days. More than one million copies of her works have been bought since she was named as laureate. When the Swedish Academy rang to break the news about the Nobel prize, Han\u2019s first instinct was to claim the glory for her homeland. \u201cI grew up with Korean literature, which I feel very close to,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I hope this news is nice for Korean literature readers, and my friends and writers.\u201d The mass-market fiction trade is also seeing a boost in the appeal of stories from South Korea. Recent bestsellers include Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Book Club by Hwang Bo-reum; Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-joo; and Barack Obama\u2019s 2017 favourite, Pachinko by the Korean-American Min Jin Lee. Won-Pyung Sohn\u2019s hit, Almond, came out the same year and will be followed up next year with Counterattacks at Thirty: A Novel. So the publication of Lee\u2019s bundle of 470 lyrical insights on 14 November will mark the next, higher-brow stage of a K-culture wave that first saw K-Pop music sweep across Britain a decade ago. Neatly, the poet\u2019s book now numbers BTS band members among its many Korean fans. The original youth music trend has since been matched by the success of a string of influential South Korean television dramas such as the Netflix hit Squid Game and the award-winning films Parasite and Decision to Leave. Now the publishing world is enjoying this awakening appetite. The award-winning Swedish translator Anton Hur, known for his work on the bestseller I Want to Die But I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, discovered the Lee Seong-bok collection in a Seoul bookshop and was instantly beguiled. Eventually he persuaded Seattle-based Sublunary to take the risk of publishing. Soon quotes were appearing all over social media, with admirers ranging from novelist RO Kwon to rapper Kim Nam-joon. And as Hur has pointed out, the market is ballooning. Until last year, there were only 10 or so Korean books published in English each year.

      "body": "<p>Will the unsurprising yet significant fact that Kamala Harris is a woman decisively&nbsp;tip the knife-edge US election in Donald Trump\u2019s favour? Democrat jitters grow as the campaign&nbsp;enters its final two weeks. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dead-heat-trump-pulls-even-harris-nbc-news-poll-rcna174201\">Polls predict a dead heat</a> nationally. Trump is edging ahead in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/elections/president/2024/battleground-states\">key battleground states.</a> Misogyny, hidden and pernicious, may make a crucial difference.</p> <p>It\u2019s frankly incredible that Trump, a convicted crook, cheat and sexual predator, is still in the race \u2013 and alarming that likeable, uninspiring Harris has not already sewn it up. Each day brings more wild Trump bombast about mass deportations, \u201cenemies within\u201d or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/racist-history-trump-pet-eating-immigrant\">pet-eating Haitians</a>. His lies and threats explode like cluster bombs. He behaves like a fool.</p> <p>Yet Trump has traction. Voters generally rate Republicans more highly on core issues: the economy, inflation, borders, crime, global insecurity. That doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a Trump win. Most Americans <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/political-leaders\">view him unfavourably</a>. But Harris, hamstrung by Joe Biden\u2019s unpopular legacy and a paucity of eye-catching policy ideas, looks vulnerable.</p> <p>One issue that could ultimately swing this tightest of tight races is rarely mentioned by either candidate: gender. Unlike Hillary Clinton, the misogynists\u2019 favourite 2016 target, Harris has downplayed the potentially historic nature of her candidacy.

Democrat jitters grow as the campaign enters its final two weeks. Polls predict a dead heat nationally. Trump is edging ahead in key battleground states. Misogyny, hidden and pernicious, may make a crucial difference. It\u2019s frankly incredible that Trump, a convicted crook, cheat and sexual predator, is still in the race \u2013 and alarming that likeable, uninspiring Harris has not already sewn it up. Each day brings more wild Trump bombast about mass deportations, \u201cenemies within\u201d or pet-eating Haitians. His lies and threats explode like cluster bombs. He behaves like a fool. Yet Trump has traction. Voters generally rate Republicans more highly on core issues: the economy, inflation, borders, crime, global insecurity. That doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a Trump win. Most Americans view him unfavourably. But Harris, hamstrung by Joe Biden\u2019s unpopular legacy and a paucity of eye-catching policy ideas, looks vulnerable. One issue that could ultimately swing this tightest of tight races is rarely mentioned by either candidate: gender. Unlike Hillary Clinton, the misogynists\u2019 favourite 2016 target, Harris has downplayed the potentially historic nature of her candidacy. But derogatory, demeaning sexism remains a factor. \u201cWomen \u2013 and women candidates \u2013 are subject to toxic and misogynistic standards that are often perpetuated in public and by the media,\u201d the Emily\u2019s List pressure group warned this summer. \u201cStereotypes and tropes centred around diminishing the qualifications, leadership, looks, relationships and experience of women candidates for office are always part and parcel with her campaign. This is exacerbated for women of color.\u201d Rather than challenge Harris openly on gender, Trump digs and jibes indirectly, persistently talking about the need for \u201cstrength\u201d in leading the country and bashing America\u2019s enemies. \u201cStrength\u201d is his code for \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cmanly\u201d. His running mate, JD Vance, has cut out the \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d talk \u2013 but his foul sexism lives on behind glib words.

      "body": "<p>I have now heard so many Labour people quiver that Rachel Reeves\u2019 looming budget is a \u201cmake or break\u201d event that I\u2019ve given up counting. Whether or not it will deserve such hyperbolic billing, it is certainly true that the first Labour budget in 14 years is the most significant moment since the election, both for the chancellor\u2019s reputation and the standing of the government as a whole. When Ms Reeves gets up before the Commons on 30 October, she will do so accompanied by a great weight of expectation. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d says one member of the cabinet. \u201cHugely important,\u201d agrees another. \u201cIt sets the course for the rest of the parliament.\u201d A third senior minister describes it as \u201ca milestone budget\u201d with \u201cseveral big jobs to do\u201d. The first is to clear the decks of the dire fiscal legacy left by the Tories. The second is to do what she can for dilapidated public services. The third challenge, the most critical for the long term, is to change the arc of Britain\u2019s story by putting the country on a trajectory towards higher growth. No pressure then, chancellor.</p> <p>Land the budget well and Ms Reeves will settle nerves about the economy and give the government a clearer sense of direction while \u2013 or so her colleagues hope \u2013 drawing a line under a damaging period dominated by the debilitating dripfeed of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/16/more-ministers-declare-free-gifts-keir-starmer-decision-to-repay-6000\">revelations about freebies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/sue-gray-resigns-as-keir-starmer-chief-of-staff-downing-street\">nasty office politics at Number 10</a>. Land the budget badly and the unravelling we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks will get more dangerous. One Treasury insider remarks: \u201cEvery budget has a lot of risks to it \u2013 and this one is a huge budget.\u201d</p> <p>The interminably long build-up to the event is a consequence of the chancellor ordering an audit of the inheritance from the Tories before she did anything else, arm-wrestling between the Treasury and spending ministers over departmental funding, and the Office for Budget Responsibility then needing time to mark the chancellor\u2019s maths. Politics abhors a vacuum. It has been filled with endless rumour-mongering. The appetite for speculation among journalists has been fuelled by hints and winks, nudges and steers from ministers and their aides <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/18/rachel-reeves-expected-to-extend-stealth-freeze-on-income-tax-thresholds\">about what might be coming</a>. The rightwing media has been straining to curdle the blood of affluent Britons by telling them that Ms Reeves will squeeze their pips until they squeak. The Conservative party is itching for an \u201cI told you so\u201d moment when it can claim vindication for its pre-election warnings that Labour would hike taxes more than it was prepared to admit during the campaign. The chancellor will be entitled to puncture their hypocritical posturing by reminding everyone about the Tory legacy: national debt as a proportion of GDP at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/20/uk-debt-gdp-rachel-reeves\">its highest level since the early 1960s</a> and the tax take as a share of national income <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/governments-record-tax-2010-24\">at its largest since the late 1940s</a>. She also has excellent grounds for arguing that tough decisions are demanded because the fiscal plans left by the previous mismanagement were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/23/head-of-obr-says-lack-of-budget-details-led-to-work-of-fiction-forecasts-last-year\">works of fiction</a>. There\u2019s scope for argument about the precise size of the \u201cblack hole\u201d bequeathed by the Conservatives, but it is a debate about whether it is gigantic or merely enormous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The unquiet ghosts of Liz Truss and Kamikaze Kwarteng, authors of the disastrous meltdown of 2022, still haunt the corridors of Great George Street</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While she can scornfully shrug at Tory criticism, the chancellor will be more nervous about the reception she will receive from the debt markets. She has been signalling an intention to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/23/rachel-reeves-defends-labour-cuts-winter-fuel-allowance\">recast the fiscal rules</a> to allow more scope for capital investment on infrastructure projects designed to enhance Britain\u2019s economic potential. She\u2019s flagged this in advance to test how much more government borrowing will be tolerated by the vigilantes of the bond market before they throw a wobbly about UK debt. Treasury officials sometimes liken increasing debt to feeling your way towards a cliff edge in a blindingly dense fog. A government only discovers when it has stepped over the precipe when it suddenly finds itself plunging into the abyss. The unquiet ghosts of Liz Truss and Kamikaze Kwarteng, authors of the disastrous meltdown of two years ago, still haunt the corridors of Great George Street. A repeat of that kind of catastrophe would be career-destroying for Ms Reeves. \u201cBorrowing spree\u201d is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/18/infrastructure-taskforce-to-help-chancellor-avoid-financial-sector-turmoil\">not the kind of headline she is seeking to generate</a>. So my hunch is that the chancellor is going to be relatively cautious about how far she relaxes the rules on debt.</p> <p>While keeping a wary eye on the bond market, she also has to watch out for dissent from within the cabinet. When Labour was in opposition, she didn\u2019t have too much trouble from colleagues who accepted she had a veto over spending ambitions she regarded as unaffordable. They swallowed the medicine because they were desperate to be in power and largely bought into the idea that they would not win without convincing voters that Labour would be a trustworthy custodian of the national finances. Her colleagues warmed to the concept of an \u201ciron chancellor\u201d when it was a campaigning tool; many of them are cooling on it now she is in post and telling them that government involves unavoidably unpleasant trade-offs. </p> <p>In the past few days, we\u2019ve been given a glimpse of some of the tensions between the chancellor and spending ministers who think their departments are getting the rough end of the Treasury stick. Letters have been sent to Sir Keir Starmer, in a rather vain attempt to appeal to him over the head of his chancellor, protesting about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/rachel-reeves-tax-rises-spending-cuts-budget\">Treasury\u2019s spending plans for some departments</a>. The authors of these bitter billets include Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Lou Haigh, the transport secretary. It is heartening to see that the art of letter-writing is being kept alive by these members of the cabinet, but wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to put in a phone call to the prime minister or send him a text? In my experience, letters of dissent are frequently written in the hope or the intent that they will be leaked \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/rachel-reeves-tax-rises-spending-cuts-budget\">as these ones duly were</a>. They are only the letters we know about. One cabinet minister tells me they suspect that the majority of its members have been at it.</p> <p>The news on spending won\u2019t be all bleak. I will be astonished if Ms Reeves does not direct additional resources towards some of the most politically sensitive areas. The NHS will get more, in part to help address waiting lists, and this she will use to justify her tax increases. The cabinet dissent is emanating from ministers whose departments do not enjoy the same level of protection as the health service.</p> <p>There is also a lot of trepidation about this budget among Labour backbenchers. It is fair to say that very few Labour folk join the party or stand for parliament because their lodestar is \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d. They are in politics to help the disadvantaged, to improve public services and to spread opportunities more widely. They will be judging Ms Reeves against those criteria. We\u2019ve already seen a furious backlash, including a hostile vote at the Labour conference, against the means-testing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/25/labour-leadership-loses-conference-vote-on-winter-fuel-payments\">winter fuel payment to pensioners</a>. Another pressure point on the chancellor is growing demands <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/12/pressure-mounts-on-rachel-reeves-to-drop-dangerous-13bn-cut-to-benefits-for-disabled\">to abandon reductions to benefits for people with disabilities</a>, which were pencilled in by the Tories before they left office. </p> <p>The biggest audience for the budget is the electorate. Here two competing impulses are in play. The <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/\">rapidity of the slide in Labour\u2019s approval ratings</a> since July has had an unnerving effect on the party. A lot of Labour MPs would like the budget to include at least a few crowd-pleasers to sweeten the gruel. Against that is the argument that the optimum time to do difficult stuff is now, when memories of the mess left by the Tories are still fresh and the next election is far away. The chancellor\u2019s team are pre-selling the budget as a \u201cwiping the slate clean\u201d event that will involve up to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9jdgprv7ko\">\u00a340bn of increases to taxes and trims to spending</a>. Ms Reeves\u2019s people are encouraging comparisons with significant \u201ccorrection\u201d budgets of the past, such as George Osborne\u2019s austerity budget of 2010 and the fiscal retrenchments implemented by Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke in the wake of Black Wednesday in the early 1990s.

      "bodyText": "I have now heard so many Labour people quiver that Rachel Reeves\u2019 looming budget is a \u201cmake or break\u201d event that I\u2019ve given up counting. Whether or not it will deserve such hyperbolic billing, it is certainly true that the first Labour budget in 14 years is the most significant moment since the election, both for the chancellor\u2019s reputation and the standing of the government as a whole. When Ms Reeves gets up before the Commons on 30 October, she will do so accompanied by a great weight of expectation. \u201cIt\u2019s massive,\u201d says one member of the cabinet. \u201cHugely important,\u201d agrees another. \u201cIt sets the course for the rest of the parliament.\u201d A third senior minister describes it as \u201ca milestone budget\u201d with \u201cseveral big jobs to do\u201d. The first is to clear the decks of the dire fiscal legacy left by the Tories. The second is to do what she can for dilapidated public services. The third challenge, the most critical for the long term, is to change the arc of Britain\u2019s story by putting the country on a trajectory towards higher growth. No pressure then, chancellor. Land the budget well and Ms Reeves will settle nerves about the economy and give the government a clearer sense of direction while \u2013 or so her colleagues hope \u2013 drawing a line under a damaging period dominated by the debilitating dripfeed of revelations about freebies and nasty office politics at Number 10. Land the budget badly and the unravelling we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks will get more dangerous. One Treasury insider remarks: \u201cEvery budget has a lot of risks to it \u2013 and this one is a huge budget.\u201d The interminably long build-up to the event is a consequence of the chancellor ordering an audit of the inheritance from the Tories before she did anything else, arm-wrestling between the Treasury and spending ministers over departmental funding, and the Office for Budget Responsibility then needing time to mark the chancellor\u2019s maths. Politics abhors a vacuum. It has been filled with endless rumour-mongering. The appetite for speculation among journalists has been fuelled by hints and winks, nudges and steers from ministers and their aides about what might be coming. The rightwing media has been straining to curdle the blood of affluent Britons by telling them that Ms Reeves will squeeze their pips until they squeak. The Conservative party is itching for an \u201cI told you so\u201d moment when it can claim vindication for its pre-election warnings that Labour would hike taxes more than it was prepared to admit during the campaign. The chancellor will be entitled to puncture their hypocritical posturing by reminding everyone about the Tory legacy: national debt as a proportion of GDP at its highest level since the early 1960s and the tax take as a share of national income at its largest since the late 1940s. She also has excellent grounds for arguing that tough decisions are demanded because the fiscal plans left by the previous mismanagement were works of fiction. There\u2019s scope for argument about the precise size of the \u201cblack hole\u201d bequeathed by the Conservatives, but it is a debate about whether it is gigantic or merely enormous. While she can scornfully shrug at Tory criticism, the chancellor will be more nervous about the reception she will receive from the debt markets. She has been signalling an intention to recast the fiscal rules to allow more scope for capital investment on infrastructure projects designed to enhance Britain\u2019s economic potential. She\u2019s flagged this in advance to test how much more government borrowing will be tolerated by the vigilantes of the bond market before they throw a wobbly about UK debt. Treasury officials sometimes liken increasing debt to feeling your way towards a cliff edge in a blindingly dense fog. A government only discovers when it has stepped over the precipe when it suddenly finds itself plunging into the abyss. The unquiet ghosts of Liz Truss and Kamikaze Kwarteng, authors of the disastrous meltdown of two years ago, still haunt the corridors of Great George Street. A repeat of that kind of catastrophe would be career-destroying for Ms Reeves. \u201cBorrowing spree\u201d is not the kind of headline she is seeking to generate. So my hunch is that the chancellor is going to be relatively cautious about how far she relaxes the rules on debt. While keeping a wary eye on the bond market, she also has to watch out for dissent from within the cabinet. When Labour was in opposition, she didn\u2019t have too much trouble from colleagues who accepted she had a veto over spending ambitions she regarded as unaffordable. They swallowed the medicine because they were desperate to be in power and largely bought into the idea that they would not win without convincing voters that Labour would be a trustworthy custodian of the national finances. Her colleagues warmed to the concept of an \u201ciron chancellor\u201d when it was a campaigning tool; many of them are cooling on it now she is in post and telling them that government involves unavoidably unpleasant trade-offs. In the past few days, we\u2019ve been given a glimpse of some of the tensions between the chancellor and spending ministers who think their departments are getting the rough end of the Treasury stick. Letters have been sent to Sir Keir Starmer, in a rather vain attempt to appeal to him over the head of his chancellor, protesting about the Treasury\u2019s spending plans for some departments. The authors of these bitter billets include Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Lou Haigh, the transport secretary. It is heartening to see that the art of letter-writing is being kept alive by these members of the cabinet, but wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to put in a phone call to the prime minister or send him a text? In my experience, letters of dissent are frequently written in the hope or the intent that they will be leaked \u2013 as these ones duly were. They are only the letters we know about. One cabinet minister tells me they suspect that the majority of its members have been at it. The news on spending won\u2019t be all bleak. I will be astonished if Ms Reeves does not direct additional resources towards some of the most politically sensitive areas. The NHS will get more, in part to help address waiting lists, and this she will use to justify her tax increases. The cabinet dissent is emanating from ministers whose departments do not enjoy the same level of protection as the health service. There is also a lot of trepidation about this budget among Labour backbenchers. It is fair to say that very few Labour folk join the party or stand for parliament because their lodestar is \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d. They are in politics to help the disadvantaged, to improve public services and to spread opportunities more widely. They will be judging Ms Reeves against those criteria. We\u2019ve already seen a furious backlash, including a hostile vote at the Labour conference, against the means-testing of the winter fuel payment to pensioners. Another pressure point on the chancellor is growing demands to abandon reductions to benefits for people with disabilities, which were pencilled in by the Tories before they left office. The biggest audience for the budget is the electorate. Here two competing impulses are in play. The rapidity of the slide in Labour\u2019s approval ratings since July has had an unnerving effect on the party. A lot of Labour MPs would like the budget to include at least a few crowd-pleasers to sweeten the gruel. Against that is the argument that the optimum time to do difficult stuff is now, when memories of the mess left by the Tories are still fresh and the next election is far away. The chancellor\u2019s team are pre-selling the budget as a \u201cwiping the slate clean\u201d event that will involve up to \u00a340bn of increases to taxes and trims to spending. Ms Reeves\u2019s people are encouraging comparisons with significant \u201ccorrection\u201d budgets of the past, such as George Osborne\u2019s austerity budget of 2010 and the fiscal retrenchments implemented by Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke in the wake of Black Wednesday in the early 1990s. Those precedents aren\u2019t soothing jangled nerves in the Labour party. In the circumstances she must contend with, the chancellor never had a chance of producing a budget to please everyone. Her aim is to win some respect for being willing to make tough choices to put Britain on a firmer footing for the future. What her more anxious colleagues fear is a budget that ends up satisfying no one while aggravating everyone. \u201cMake or break\u201d may not be such an exaggeration. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>There is perhaps nothing more 2020s than taking a sensitive, morally fraught issue loaded with complexity and nuance, and casting it as progress and kindness versus indifference and obdurate conservatism. When even senior members of the clergy fall into this trap, it is a sign of just how much social media has collapsed public discourse into a simple question of right or wrong.</p> <p>The debate about assisted dying has become depressingly reductionist, but I was still taken aback when the former archbishop of Canterbury George Carey last week chose to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/18/george-carey-archbishop-c-of-e-bishops-lords-back-assisted-dying-bill\">mirror its flaws</a> rather than adopt a more careful tone. He urged bishops in the House of Lords to back Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying because it is \u201cnecessary, compassionate and principled\u201d, saying: \u201cThe sad history of scientific exploration\u2026 is that church leaders have often shamefully resisted change. Let\u2019s not follow that trend.\u201d He implied that bishops had a duty to reflect the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Anglicans who support legalisation.</p> <p>These comments epitomise so much of what\u2019s wrong with the debate. First, like many of the strongest proponents of legalising assisted dying, Carey fails to acknowledge there are ethical concerns on both sides of the debate. Of course we should feel moved by appeals from individuals with painful health conditions likely to be terminal and who want to be prescribed lethal drugs to end their own lives.</p> <p>But, as I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/07/conflicted-legalising-assisted-dying-sonia-sodha\">written before</a>, there are good reasons to believe that the safeguards that have been proposed to date \u2013 the need for a terminal diagnosis where someone might reasonably be expected to have less than six to 12 months left to live; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/16/vulnerable-people-not-at-risk-from-proposed-assisted-dying-law-says-mp\">signing off of each request</a> by two doctors and possibly a judge \u2013 will not prevent some individuals from being pressurised into a state-sanctioned wrongful death.</p> <p>The motivation could come from relatives or carers, or from not wanting to be a burden, or the fact that they simply can\u2019t access the palliative care needed to live a dignified life. And Carey linking his colleagues\u2019 concerns about assisted dying to \u201cshameful\u201d resistance of change is a troubling sleight of hand to imply that his own support for assisted dying occupies a higher moral plane.</p> <p>Last week, I took part in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/mb9k3uTC3vw\">event on assisted dying</a> at King\u2019s College London that adopted a starkly different frame: a focus on the detailed questions and concerns that a panel of five speakers thought would need to be discussed and answered by parliamentarians before any vote to legalise it. The panel included a palliative care consultant, two MPs (one a psychiatrist, the other a health policy specialist) and a leading KC who specialises in the law on mental capacity and health ethics, and who represented the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/11/noel-conway-assisted-dying-campaigner-dies-at-home-aged-71\">Noel Conway</a> in his legal challenge to overturn the criminalisation of assisted dying. None of us expressed opposition to the moral principle, but everyone spoke to the questions of how assisted dying could be safely legalised that had arisen for them as a result of their professional work.</p> <p>I gleaned new insights from their expertise \u2013 for example on the issue of whether establishing someone\u2019s mental capacity to choose death could function as a safeguard around consent. Alex Ruck Keene&nbsp;KC said that, in his experience of training doctors on the mental health capacity act, there remain gaps in understanding even in relation to existing law.</p> <p>Ben Spencer MP, a psychiatrist whose specialism is treatment in the absence of consent,&nbsp;highlighted the difficulties in carrying out a capacity test for consent to an intervention, and his view that such tests would not pick up coercion or act as a meaningful safeguard.</p> <p>On the issue of a terminal diagnosis with a specific time left to live, we talked about how difficult it is to predict that accurately. Keene has since said that he believes it would be \u201cquite possible\u201d that the courts would entertain <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/10/17/assisted-dying-bill-ontario-canada-report-kim-leadbeater/\">discrimination-based challenges</a> to the limits of any assisted dying legislation; other lawyers have also raised this. Canada expanded the availability of assisted dying in 2021 to those without terminal conditions; a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1unC_cl_1o3frTexUuFrCZq8f8wJcltlV/view\">new report</a> last week highlighted some troubling cases, including an isolated man in his 40s with inflammatory bowel disease and substance abuse and mental health issues, who opted for an assisted death after being proactively offered it in a psychiatry assessment.</p> <p>The second troubling thing about Carey\u2019s intervention is the oversimplifying of public opinion to try to strong-arm parliamentarians into supporting legalisation regardless of any qualms. Assisted dying campaigners have sent personalised emails to MPs telling them polling shows the vast majority of their constituents back it. But the reality of public attitudes is more nuanced; new data from King\u2019s shows that, while a minority of the public feels strongly either way, around <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/14587oct-assisted-dying-survey-friday-4-oct.pdf\">six in 10</a> say they only tend to support or oppose, neither support or oppose, or don\u2019t know; and a majority of supporters say they would probably change their mind if someone were pressurised into it.</p> <p>A 2021 <a href=\"https://www.dyingwell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Survation-Assisted-Dying-Survey-July-2021-Summary-3.pdf\">Survation poll</a> highlighted that just 43% of the public correctly identify \u201cassisted dying\u201d as giving someone with terminal illness lethal&nbsp;drugs to end their life; 42%&nbsp;think it is giving people the right to stop life-prolonging treatment, and 10%&nbsp;hospice-type care. MPs obviously do not exist to translate basic polling into legislative votes: they need to assure themselves that any&nbsp;safeguards could reduce the risk&nbsp;of abuse, and how they will monitor how well they are working.</p> <p>There is something disheartening about the way this is playing out. There\u2019s been no pre-legislative deep dive into these safeguarding issues; instead, we have a prime minister gung-ho about a parliamentary vote as a way of honouring a promise he made to a celebrity campaigner, and a legislative process that, because it is a private member\u2019s bill, is ill-equipped for the scrutiny needed. Informed and well-founded concerns have been dismissed as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/16/vulnerable-people-not-at-risk-from-proposed-assisted-dying-law-says-mp\">scaremongering</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Where I take some comfort is my conversations with a handful of thoughtful MPs who understand how complicated this is. There will of course be more who are similarly chewing this over, and between them, I hope they can shift the debate from emotionally fraught appeals to compassion and towards a forensic examination of the balance of risks and how safeguards may or may not operate. We desperately need that to happen before parliament even thinks about taking a decision on the principle.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "bodyText": "There is perhaps nothing more 2020s than taking a sensitive, morally fraught issue loaded with complexity and nuance, and casting it as progress and kindness versus indifference and obdurate conservatism. When even senior members of the clergy fall into this trap, it is a sign of just how much social media has collapsed public discourse into a simple question of right or wrong. The debate about assisted dying has become depressingly reductionist, but I was still taken aback when the former archbishop of Canterbury George Carey last week chose to mirror its flaws rather than adopt a more careful tone. He urged bishops in the House of Lords to back Labour MP Kim Leadbeater\u2019s private member\u2019s bill to legalise assisted dying because it is \u201cnecessary, compassionate and principled\u201d, saying: \u201cThe sad history of scientific exploration\u2026 is that church leaders have often shamefully resisted change. Let\u2019s not follow that trend.\u201d He implied that bishops had a duty to reflect the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Anglicans who support legalisation. These comments epitomise so much of what\u2019s wrong with the debate. First, like many of the strongest proponents of legalising assisted dying, Carey fails to acknowledge there are ethical concerns on both sides of the debate. Of course we should feel moved by appeals from individuals with painful health conditions likely to be terminal and who want to be prescribed lethal drugs to end their own lives. But, as I\u2019ve written before, there are good reasons to believe that the safeguards that have been proposed to date \u2013 the need for a terminal diagnosis where someone might reasonably be expected to have less than six to 12 months left to live; the signing off of each request by two doctors and possibly a judge \u2013 will not prevent some individuals from being pressurised into a state-sanctioned wrongful death. The motivation could come from relatives or carers, or from not wanting to be a burden, or the fact that they simply can\u2019t access the palliative care needed to live a dignified life. And Carey linking his colleagues\u2019 concerns about assisted dying to \u201cshameful\u201d resistance of change is a troubling sleight of hand to imply that his own support for assisted dying occupies a higher moral plane. Last week, I took part in an event on assisted dying at King\u2019s College London that adopted a starkly different frame: a focus on the detailed questions and concerns that a panel of five speakers thought would need to be discussed and answered by parliamentarians before any vote to legalise it. The panel included a palliative care consultant, two MPs (one a psychiatrist, the other a health policy specialist) and a leading KC who specialises in the law on mental capacity and health ethics, and who represented the late Noel Conway in his legal challenge to overturn the criminalisation of assisted dying. None of us expressed opposition to the moral principle, but everyone spoke to the questions of how assisted dying could be safely legalised that had arisen for them as a result of their professional work. I gleaned new insights from their expertise \u2013 for example on the issue of whether establishing someone\u2019s mental capacity to choose death could function as a safeguard around consent. Alex Ruck Keene KC said that, in his experience of training doctors on the mental health capacity act, there remain gaps in understanding even in relation to existing law. Ben Spencer MP, a psychiatrist whose specialism is treatment in the absence of consent, highlighted the difficulties in carrying out a capacity test for consent to an intervention, and his view that such tests would not pick up coercion or act as a meaningful safeguard. On the issue of a terminal diagnosis with a specific time left to live, we talked about how difficult it is to predict that accurately. Keene has since said that he believes it would be \u201cquite possible\u201d that the courts would entertain discrimination-based challenges to the limits of any assisted dying legislation; other lawyers have also raised this. Canada expanded the availability of assisted dying in 2021 to those without terminal conditions; a new report last week highlighted some troubling cases, including an isolated man in his 40s with inflammatory bowel disease and substance abuse and mental health issues, who opted for an assisted death after being proactively offered it in a psychiatry assessment. The second troubling thing about Carey\u2019s intervention is the oversimplifying of public opinion to try to strong-arm parliamentarians into supporting legalisation regardless of any qualms. Assisted dying campaigners have sent personalised emails to MPs telling them polling shows the vast majority of their constituents back it. But the reality of public attitudes is more nuanced; new data from King\u2019s shows that, while a minority of the public feels strongly either way, around six in 10 say they only tend to support or oppose, neither support or oppose, or don\u2019t know; and a majority of supporters say they would probably change their mind if someone were pressurised into it. A 2021 Survation poll highlighted that just 43% of the public correctly identify \u201cassisted dying\u201d as giving someone with terminal illness lethal drugs to end their life; 42% think it is giving people the right to stop life-prolonging treatment, and 10% hospice-type care. MPs obviously do not exist to translate basic polling into legislative votes: they need to assure themselves that any safeguards could reduce the risk of abuse, and how they will monitor how well they are working. There is something disheartening about the way this is playing out. There\u2019s been no pre-legislative deep dive into these safeguarding issues; instead, we have a prime minister gung-ho about a parliamentary vote as a way of honouring a promise he made to a celebrity campaigner, and a legislative process that, because it is a private member\u2019s bill, is ill-equipped for the scrutiny needed. Informed and well-founded concerns have been dismissed as \u201cscaremongering\u201d. Where I take some comfort is my conversations with a handful of thoughtful MPs who understand how complicated this is. There will of course be more who are similarly chewing this over, and between them, I hope they can shift the debate from emotionally fraught appeals to compassion and towards a forensic examination of the balance of risks and how safeguards may or may not operate. We desperately need that to happen before parliament even thinks about taking a decision on the principle. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      "body": "<p>Few of us can escape the feeling that our hard-earned cash doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to. Thanks to a perfect storm of the pandemic and cost of living crisis, prices of many everyday luxuries have risen over the last few years. Whether it\u2019s a flat white at a local coffee shop, olive oil in the supermarket or a pint at the pub, you\u2019ve probably become accustomed to thinking, \u201c<em>How</em> much?\u201d as you begrudgingly tap your bank card.</p> <p>But what\u2019s making certain items more expensive, and how can you tell if you\u2019re being ripped off? Is buying cheap a false economy, and are some items worth splashing out on? You may want to consider not just the cost but also the quality, sustainability of materials and ethical production of goods \u2013 after all, is it a bargain if you\u2019re replacing it within a year? Here, industry experts unpack just how much we should be paying for everything \u2013 from chicken and butter to jeans and bed linen.</p> <h2><strong>A bottle of wine</strong></h2> <p><strong>Price range \u00a38-\u00a315</strong></p> <p>All kinds of costs go into making wine: maintaining the vineyards, picking the grapes, fermenting and ageing the wine, bottles, shipping costs and VAT. So how can some cost a fiver? \u201cFixed costs such as bottles and shipping duty will come to about \u00a32.70 a bottle plus VAT. At \u00a34.95, the value of the wine is less than the value of the bottle and VAT. The quality is very stretched,\u201d says Pierre Mansour, director of wine at the Wine Society. \u201cIt indicates someone or something along the chain is being negatively affected, say a vineyard with high yields, which can mean poor quality, or a producer under pressure from a retailer to hit a price point.\u201d</p> <p>For a \u00a37 bottle, Mansour says 10% will go towards the wine, which \u201cstill isn\u2019t enough\u201d. \u201cMy advice is to spend between \u00a38 and \u00a315, the higher the better. The sweet spot is \u00a312.

You\u2019ve got a fabric upper, a rubber outer sole and some form of mid-sole. It\u2019s the foam in the mid-sole that\u2019s probably the biggest determinant of the price. As a brand\u2019s range gets more expensive, it\u2019s usually the foam that improves the most,\u201d says Nick Harris-Fry, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/theruntesters\">the Run Testers</a>. That\u2019s because improving the foam, and making it more lightweight, will affect your running performance, and the product development requires lots of research.</p> <p>Harris-Fry says that big brands such as Nike and Brooks price their trainers similarly but many frequently release new models of long-running products. By looking out for older models in the sales, you can make some big savings. </p> <p>As for sustainable options, he recommends brands such as Veja and Allbirds. That said, these shoes may not be as advanced on the technical and performance side as other brands whose main focus isn\u2019t sustainability.</p> <p>\u201cYou can get a pair of shoes for between \u00a320 and \u00a350, but for those prices you might sacrifice comfort, protection and durability,\u201d Harris-Fry says. \u201cThey\u2019re probably not designed to be used for lots of running.\u201d</p> <p>When you get into more technical racing shoes that have things such as carbon plates in them, he says, these can cost as much as \u00a3500. Hardcore runners may want a more technical shoe to shave time off their PBs, but for most people, it\u2019s not necessary. \u201cI think over \u00a3160 feels steep.

On top of that, you\u2019ve got to haul the milk to the cheese dairy or factory. Small cheesemakers may buy milk only when they need it, and that can cost up to 20p a litre extra.\u201d</p> <p>Quicke says that labour costs can be as much as the milk for small-batch cheeses, while in a big factory, the work is done by machines and labour costs are lower. \u201cA large dairy makes as much in a day as we do in a year,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe best quality cheese will be handmade, small-batch,\u201d says Morgan McGlynn, cheese expert on Channel 4\u2019s Sunday Brunch and owner of <a href=\"https://www.cheesesonline.co.uk/\">Cheeses of Muswell Hill</a> in London. \u201cThere are entirely acceptable cheeses made on a large scale and matured in vacuum packs, but they will lack the complexity, interest and provenance you find in an artisan cheddar.

It also uses significantly less water than conventional cotton, but it currently makes up less than 1% of cotton production,\u201d Standley says.

This year, the International Olive Council expects just under 2.3m tonnes of olives will be produced, compared with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/07/extra-virgin-olive-oil-prices-global-production\">3.4m in 2022</a>. \u201cPrices have gone up substantially in the last year or two, both for branded and supermarket own-label oils,\u201d says olive oil expert <a href=\"https://www.judyridgway.co.uk/\">Judy Ridgway</a>.</p> <p>This is something that Cristina Stribacu, founder of Greek olive oil producer Li\u00e1 Cultivators, has experienced first-hand. \u201cWith climate change, the yearly production often decreases, but the costs remain the same,\u201d she says. \u201cProducing high-quality extra virgin olive oil involves substantial costs for maintaining the grove, labour, materials and sustainable practices. We never use pesticides. Instead, workers clean everything manually three to four times a year, make compost and preserve the rich biodiversity.\u201d</p> <p>Stribacu says there has been a 60% price hike on glass bottles over the last three years (a bottle that used to cost \u20ac0.60 to \u20ac0.70 now costs more than \u20ac1.10; premium bottles have risen from \u20ac1.20 to up to \u20ac2), and the cost of labour has increased by 70% because of a shortage of workers.</p> <p>Even if something is sold as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the quality can differ. \u201cHigh-quality EVOO, priced between \u00a320 and \u00a340 for 500ml, is often made purely from the first cold extracted oil of fresh olives. It adheres to strict production standards and usually comes from a single source or a reputable producer,\u201d Stribacu says. \u201cLow-cost EVOO, at about \u00a310 for 500ml, might be a blend of EVOO with lower-grade olive oil. It can be mixed with oils from various sources, which can compromise its purity and flavour.\u201d</p> <p>When buying olive oil, Ridgway suggests aiming for between \u00a312 and \u00a320 for 500ml. \u201cAt the lower end of the market you get what you pay for. After \u00a312 or so you will get a reasonably good oil with improvements as the price increases. From \u00a320 it may be a mixed bag of OK, good and very good.

Each pair takes two and a half hours to make.\u201d Ates says that he has visited factories abroad making high-street brand jeans in just 18 minutes using automated machines operated by low-paid workers. The labour costs were about 1% of the retail price, meaning 70p for a pair of jeans that will sell for \u00a370.</p> <p>\u201cCountries such as Bangladesh, China, India and Turkey play a big role in mass production with lower labour costs, allowing brands to keep prices affordable on the British high street,\u201d Vakilzadeh says. \u201cHowever, this raises important questions about sustainability and fair labour practices, so it\u2019s crucial to do your research beforehand.\u201d According to Vakilzadeh, M&amp;S is a good option when it comes to how its jeans fit, but \u201ctheir durability can be a bit hit and miss\u201d. For mid-range options, she recommends brands such as Baukjen, Me+Em, Cos and Levi\u2019s.</p> <p>Ates suggests spending at least \u00a380. \u201cIt will be better quality and made in better environments. If the jeans are \u00a325 to \u00a350, I would question the ethics.\u201d Vakilzadeh says that jeans below \u00a3100 \u201coften compromise on fabric quality, craftsmanship and durability\u201d.

Basic versions cost \u00a35 to \u00a310; super premium products retail at \u00a3200-plus. Budget moisturisers typically include standard ingredients to moisturise the skin effectively. Mid-range products, about \u00a320 to \u00a360, often incorporate more advanced ingredients, such as ceramides or antioxidants, and may have better textures or absorption properties. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t spend more than \u00a330 on a moisturiser.\u201d At the lower end, she advises steering clear of anything under \u00a35.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always need the most expensive option \u2013 it\u2019s best to focus on ingredient quality and suitability for your skin type,\u201d Mahto says. For oily or acne-prone skin, she recommends a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturiser; dry skins will benefit from richer, cream-based formulations with ingredients such as ceramides or hyaluronic acid; for sensitive skin, look for fragrance-free options.</p> <p>As well as a daily moisturiser, it\u2019s important to wear facial sunscreen to protect your skin from UV rays. Mahto advises using one with broad-spectrum protection (UVA and UVB) and a minimum SPF of 30. \u201cBudget options (\u00a35 to \u00a315) typically use basic chemical UV filters and may have heavier textures or leave a white cast. Mid-range sunscreens (\u00a315 to \u00a330) often offer better textures, faster absorption and additional benefits such as hydration or anti-ageing ingredients. High-end sunscreens (\u00a330 to \u00a350-plus) tend to include advanced formulations, such as mineral filters and added antioxidants, and are designed for superior skin feel and protection.\u201d Depending on your budget and specific needs, Mahto suggests spending between \u00a310 and \u00a360: \u201cAnything over that would need to be very special in terms of formulation for me to part with my own money.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Dr Anjali</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Mahto\u2019s picks</strong></p>    <p><strong>Mid-range</strong><em> <br></em>Moisturiser, Eucerin hyaluron-filler day cream, \u00a334 for 50ml<br><a href=\"https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/eucerin-hyaluron-filler-day-cream-spf30-50ml/12510292/\"><sub>lookfantastic.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub> </p>    <p>Sunscreen,<em> </em>Heliocare 360 oil-free gel, \u00a331 for 50ml<br><a href=\"https://heliocare.co.uk/products/oil-free-gel\"><sub>heliocare.co.uk</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Splurge<br></strong>Moisturiser, Alumier MD Hydralight, \u00a358.50 for 50ml<br><a href=\"https://uk.alumiermd.com/products/hydralight\"><sub>uk.alumiermd.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub> </p>    <p>Sunscreen, Shiseido Urban Environment Age Defense oil-free SPF30, \u00a328.80 for 30ml<br><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/shiseido-urban-environment-oil-free-suncare-emulsion-spf-30-30ml/p6189475\"><sub>johnlewis.com</sub></a><br></p> <h2><strong>Butter</strong></h2> <p><strong>Price range \u00a32.75-\u00a34.50 for 250g</strong></p>    <p>For ethically and sustainably sourced butter, look for products made with British milk, says Ed Ayton, Abel &amp; Cole\u2019s sustainability and ethics adviser. \u201cWe have excellent animal welfare laws in the UK and most dairies here are grass-based, so cows spend a lot of time outdoors,\u201d he explains. That said, most butter packets don\u2019t include details of how the animals are raised, which is why it\u2019s best to buy organic \u2013 this means cows spend as much time outdoors as the weather allows. \u201cOrganic standards prohibit artificial fertilisers, so organic farmers often grow more clover, which gives milk higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.\u201d </p> <p>Jonny Crickmore is the co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.fenfarmdairy.co.uk/\">Fen Farm Dairy</a>, which makes Bungay raw butter. It costs between \u00a36 and \u00a39 for 200g, and the higher price reflects the more labour-intensive production process \u2013 staff spend 50 to 60 hours a week hand-making 500kg of butter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three or four people making this small quantity, whereas in a factory you would have one person doing 50 or 100 times that,\u201d he says. Making it by hand and using milk fresh from the milking parlour means the product has more flavour.</p> <p>In terms of cost, Ayton says \u201cgood butter rarely costs less than \u00a311 a kg\u201d, equivalent to \u00a32.75 for 250g. The good news is organic butter isn\u2019t necessarily dearer. \u201cThere\u2019s more parity with conventional dairy prices, so you can go for a brand that takes better care of animals and the environment without spending much more.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Guardian Feast team\u2019s picks</strong></p>    <p><strong>Mid-range<br></strong>Kerrygold pure Irish butter, \u00a32.30 for 250g<br><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/kerrygold-irish-butter-14859011\"><sub>ocado.com</sub></a></p> <p> <strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong></p>    <p><strong>Splurge</strong><br>Ampersand cultured butter, \u00a37.50 for 210g<br><a href=\"https://www.dukeshill.co.uk/products/ampersand-cultured-butter\"><sub>dukeshill.co.uk</sub></a></p> <p> <strong><br></strong></p> <h2><strong>A flat white</strong></h2> <p><strong>Price range \u00a33.50-\u00a34.50</strong></p> <p>\u201cA kilo of raw espresso beans will cost between \u00a315 and \u00a320. Typically, a double shot of espresso weighs about 17g to 21g,\u201d says Tom Saxon, who has worked in the coffee industry for 10 years and founded <a href=\"https://www.batchcoffee.co.uk/\">Batch Coffee Club</a>. \u201cPer double shot of espresso, the cost of raw materials is between 25p and 42p. Milk costs roughly \u00a31.50 for two pints, so the milk for a flat white costs 20p.\u201d</p> <p>There are other costs to consider, too. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to estimate how much it costs to employ somebody to make a flat white. The minimum time it would take is 20 seconds if they\u2019re making several coffees at once, up to about 60 seconds,\u201d Saxon says. If they\u2019re being paid the living wage of \u00a312 an hour, this would amount to between 6p and 20p a flat white. You also need to factor in the wages of wait staff, and covering quieter times.</p> <p>\u201cOther costs include gas, electricity and water. I\u2019d estimate another 20p per flat white,\u201d Saxon adds. Then there are things like the cost of waste coffee and milk, rent and equipment (espresso machines can be \u00a320,000, Saxon says). All these costs will be more affordable for mainstream high-street brands: \u201cThey can produce a cup of coffee much cheaper than an independent brand because it\u2019s lower quality and bought in bulk; milk and packaging will be cheaper as they buy in huge quantities.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s more expensive, Saxon recommends buying speciality coffee if possible. \u201cCoffee farmers make no money in some harvests because the C-price \u2013 the lowest price that coffee can be traded for \u2013 is so low that the sale doesn\u2019t cover their costs.\u201d If this happens, farmers may have to grow other crops, or move and leave their farm. \u201cBy buying speciality coffee, you can be sure the coffee farmer has been paid well above fair trade prices.\u201d </p> <p>With all that in mind, you should pay \u201cbetween \u00a33.50 and \u00a34.50 for a flat white\u201d.

And what does it actually mean? \u201cBedding comes in lots of different fabrics and weaves, all of which feel different against your skin. Natural fibres, such as cotton, linen and bamboo, will be more luxurious and often more costly,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lifeofaninteriorstylist/?hl=en\">Laurie Davidson</a>, a writer and stylist who specialises in interiors. \u201cWhen it comes to cotton bedding, many believe the higher the thread count \u2013 the number of threads woven together per square inch of fabric \u2013 the better the quality. Actually, it\u2019s the quality of the cotton threads the bed linen is woven from that makes it feel soft.\u201d Egyptian cotton is often said to be the best cotton for bed linen, and the feel improves with each use. It comes from a different plant (<em>Gossypium </em><em>barbadense</em>) from regular cotton, meaning it has extra-long fibres, which produce thread that\u2019s thinner but stronger than other cottons, and can be woven into a luxurious, durable fabric.</p> <p>When choosing bedding, a lot of it comes down to personal preference. \u201cYou might prefer to lie on cool and crisp linen, while others might like silk or a cosy feel to sheets,\u201d Davidson says. She recommends looking out for things such as breathability and insulation properties, as well as thread count. \u201cIf you hold the bedding up to the light and can see through it, then it\u2019s going to be more breathable. If you prefer linen bedding, Belgian or French flax is generally regarded as the highest quality.

The cost of socks is impacted by needle count, elastic quality, size and toe linking [the process of closing the toe seam of a sock]. Higher needle counts and seamless toes increase the price because they provide better quality and comfort,\u201d says personal stylist Alex Standley. Needle count refers to the number of needles in the machine that makes the socks \u2013 and it can have a big impact on quality and price. \u201cA higher needle count, such as 200 needles, results in a denser and finer fabric, enhancing durability, comfort and quality. This process requires more time and effort, increasing manufacturing costs and making it a more premium price point.\u201d </p> <p>As for prices, Standley says socks can range from \u00a32 to \u00a340 for a pair. \u201cCheaper socks often use lower-quality materials such as polyester and human-made fibres, while premium options use naturally derived materials such as merino wool for better durability and comfort,\u201d she says. \u201cExpect to pay between \u00a310 and \u00a320 for good quality socks. Ethically and sustainably made socks may cost more because of higher production standards and paying a living wage.\u201d</p> <p>At the lower end of the scale, Standley says socks under \u00a35 \u201cwill probably have compromised on quality, longevity and supply chain standards\u201d, while \u201cpaying over \u00a330 might be excessive unless they offer specific benefits such as enhanced durability or sustainability\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Alex Standley\u2019s picks</strong></p>    <p><strong>Mid-range<br></strong>For women, Colorful Standard classic organic socks, \u00a39 <br><a href=\"https://colorfulstandard.com/en-gb/products/women-classic-organic-sock-socks-scarlet-red-female\"><sub>colorfulstandard.com</sub></a></p>    <p>For men, Community Clothing sports cotton calf socks, \u00a319 for three<strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://communityclothing.co.uk/collections/mens-socks/products/sports-cotton-sock-calf-3-pack-white-flame-red-stripe\"><sub>communityclothing.co.uk</sub></a></p>    <p><strong>Splurge<br></strong>For women, Genevieve Sweeney sparkly gold and merino cashmere socks, \u00a364 <br><a href=\"https://www.genevievesweeney.com/product/sock-gift-set-sparkly-gold-merino-cashmere/\"><sub>genevievesweeney.com</sub></a></p>    <p>For men, Joseph Turner cashmere socks, \u00a359 <strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.josephturner.co.uk/cashmere-socks-sand_mascassnd\"><sub>josephturner.co.uk</sub></a></p> <h2><strong>A pint of beer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Price range \u00a34-\u00a36</strong></p> <p>When it comes to beer, there are many variables \u2013 the raw ingredients, the type and quality of malt and hops, and the process. \u201cSome beers are produced quickly at a huge scale in automated brewhouses, while higher-end beers might be made in smaller quantities, have longer maturation times or use more time-consuming methods,\u201d says Tom Stainer, chief executive of <a href=\"https://camra.org.uk/\">Camra</a>.</p> <p>Paul Jones, owner and managing director at <a href=\"https://cloudwaterbrew.co/\">Cloudwater</a>, a craft brewery in Manchester, says people assume that because craft beer is often more expensive, those breweries are making more money. \u201cThe opposite is true,\u201d he says. \u201cCraft beer brewers charge more because they use more resources.\u201d</p> <p>Jones explains that when a pub or bar buys a keg of beer, \u201chalf of the cost is tax and the other half is ingredients and whatever sliver of margin the brewery makes\u201d.

Thanks to a perfect storm of the pandemic and cost of living crisis, prices of many everyday luxuries have risen over the last few years. Whether it\u2019s a flat white at a local coffee shop, olive oil in the supermarket or a pint at the pub, you\u2019ve probably become accustomed to thinking, \u201cHow much?\u201d as you begrudgingly tap your bank card. But what\u2019s making certain items more expensive, and how can you tell if you\u2019re being ripped off? Is buying cheap a false economy, and are some items worth splashing out on? You may want to consider not just the cost but also the quality, sustainability of materials and ethical production of goods \u2013 after all, is it a bargain if you\u2019re replacing it within a year? Here, industry experts unpack just how much we should be paying for everything \u2013 from chicken and butter to jeans and bed linen. A bottle of wine Price range \u00a38-\u00a315 All kinds of costs go into making wine: maintaining the vineyards, picking the grapes, fermenting and ageing the wine, bottles, shipping costs and VAT. So how can some cost a fiver? \u201cFixed costs such as bottles and shipping duty will come to about \u00a32.70 a bottle plus VAT. At \u00a34.95, the value of the wine is less than the value of the bottle and VAT. The quality is very stretched,\u201d says Pierre Mansour, director of wine at the Wine Society. \u201cIt indicates someone or something along the chain is being negatively affected, say a vineyard with high yields, which can mean poor quality, or a producer under pressure from a retailer to hit a price point.\u201d For a \u00a37 bottle, Mansour says 10% will go towards the wine, which \u201cstill isn\u2019t enough\u201d. \u201cMy advice is to spend between \u00a38 and \u00a315, the higher the better. The sweet spot is \u00a312. Compared with a \u00a37 bottle, a \u00a312 bottle gets you four times as much value \u2013 a better return on your investment in terms of the wine\u2019s taste, quality and balance.\u201d If you\u2019re wondering why some supermarkets can sell wine much cheaper, Mansour says this is all about scale. \u201cThey focus on a smaller range but buy in huge volumes, often distressed stock \u2013 excess a producer is trying to sell off quickly. It\u2019s not sustainable or ethical. It might come at the cost of quality, the environment or the people producing the wine.\u201d Pierre Mansour\u2019s picks Mid-range The Wine Society Generation Series Rioja 2020 (Mansour\u2019s business), \u00a312.50 thewinesociety.com Splurge Brazin Old Vine Zinfandel Lodi 2020, \u00a317.99 waitrosecellar.com Running shoes Price range \u00a3100-\u00a3140 \u201cThe materials involved in running shoes are fairly simple and cheap. You\u2019ve got a fabric upper, a rubber outer sole and some form of mid-sole. It\u2019s the foam in the mid-sole that\u2019s probably the biggest determinant of the price. As a brand\u2019s range gets more expensive, it\u2019s usually the foam that improves the most,\u201d says Nick Harris-Fry, co-founder of the Run Testers. That\u2019s because improving the foam, and making it more lightweight, will affect your running performance, and the product development requires lots of research. Harris-Fry says that big brands such as Nike and Brooks price their trainers similarly but many frequently release new models of long-running products. By looking out for older models in the sales, you can make some big savings. As for sustainable options, he recommends brands such as Veja and Allbirds. That said, these shoes may not be as advanced on the technical and performance side as other brands whose main focus isn\u2019t sustainability. \u201cYou can get a pair of shoes for between \u00a320 and \u00a350, but for those prices you might sacrifice comfort, protection and durability,\u201d Harris-Fry says. \u201cThey\u2019re probably not designed to be used for lots of running.\u201d When you get into more technical racing shoes that have things such as carbon plates in them, he says, these can cost as much as \u00a3500. Hardcore runners may want a more technical shoe to shave time off their PBs, but for most people, it\u2019s not necessary. \u201cI think over \u00a3160 feels steep.

On top of that, you\u2019ve got to haul the milk to the cheese dairy or factory. Small cheesemakers may buy milk only when they need it, and that can cost up to 20p a litre extra.\u201d Quicke says that labour costs can be as much as the milk for small-batch cheeses, while in a big factory, the work is done by machines and labour costs are lower. \u201cA large dairy makes as much in a day as we do in a year,\u201d she says. \u201cThe best quality cheese will be handmade, small-batch,\u201d says Morgan McGlynn, cheese expert on Channel 4\u2019s Sunday Brunch and owner of Cheeses of Muswell Hill in London. \u201cThere are entirely acceptable cheeses made on a large scale and matured in vacuum packs, but they will lack the complexity, interest and provenance you find in an artisan cheddar. The price gap between them will often be two or three times the cost a kg.\u201d Is there a minimum price to aim for? \u201cIf a cheese was under \u00a35 a kg, I would give it a miss,\u201d McGlynn says. She also advises going to the supermarket deli counter where they\u2019ll cut portions of cheese for you. \u201cThere will be a quick turnover of product and it will be the best quality.\u201d Morgan McGlynn\u2019s picks Mid-range M&amp;S Cornish Cove mature cheddar, \u00a34.25 for 350g ocado.com Splurge Westcombe cheddar, \u00a37 for 250g westcombedairy.com A cotton T-shirt Price range \u00a325-\u00a375 \u201cYou could expect to pay anything from \u00a35 to \u00a3250 for a cotton T-shirt \u2013 and the difference in price has to do with many factors,\u201d says Alex Standley, personal stylist and owner of Luxe Leopard Lifestyle. \u201cFor example, whether the brand uses conventional or organic cotton, the percentage of human-made fibres in the T-shirt, whether the brand pays its workers a living wage, where the T-shirt is produced, stitching quality and brand mark-ups \u2013 often for designer T-shirts, you pay a high percentage for the name.\u201d It\u2019s also important to note that cotton is an environmentally intensive crop to produce. According to the WWF, making a cotton T-shirt requires 2,700 litres of water \u2013 enough drinking water for one person for 900 days. \u201cOrganic cotton is a sustainable option that avoids synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. It also uses significantly less water than conventional cotton, but it currently makes up less than 1% of cotton production,\u201d Standley says. She suggests looking out for the Global Organic Textile Standard on a T-shirt label, which \u201censures that the product is environmentally sustainable and better quality, as well as having better working conditions and fair wages throughout the supply chain\u201d. But what\u2019s a reasonable price to pay? \u201cI personally wouldn\u2019t pay more than \u00a375 for a good quality T-shirt.

This year, the International Olive Council expects just under 2.3m tonnes of olives will be produced, compared with 3.4m in 2022. \u201cPrices have gone up substantially in the last year or two, both for branded and supermarket own-label oils,\u201d says olive oil expert Judy Ridgway. This is something that Cristina Stribacu, founder of Greek olive oil producer Li\u00e1 Cultivators, has experienced first-hand. \u201cWith climate change, the yearly production often decreases, but the costs remain the same,\u201d she says. \u201cProducing high-quality extra virgin olive oil involves substantial costs for maintaining the grove, labour, materials and sustainable practices. We never use pesticides. Instead, workers clean everything manually three to four times a year, make compost and preserve the rich biodiversity.\u201d Stribacu says there has been a 60% price hike on glass bottles over the last three years (a bottle that used to cost \u20ac0.60 to \u20ac0.70 now costs more than \u20ac1.10; premium bottles have risen from \u20ac1.20 to up to \u20ac2), and the cost of labour has increased by 70% because of a shortage of workers. Even if something is sold as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), the quality can differ. \u201cHigh-quality EVOO, priced between \u00a320 and \u00a340 for 500ml, is often made purely from the first cold extracted oil of fresh olives. It adheres to strict production standards and usually comes from a single source or a reputable producer,\u201d Stribacu says. \u201cLow-cost EVOO, at about \u00a310 for 500ml, might be a blend of EVOO with lower-grade olive oil. It can be mixed with oils from various sources, which can compromise its purity and flavour.\u201d When buying olive oil, Ridgway suggests aiming for between \u00a312 and \u00a320 for 500ml. \u201cAt the lower end of the market you get what you pay for. After \u00a312 or so you will get a reasonably good oil with improvements as the price increases. From \u00a320 it may be a mixed bag of OK, good and very good.

Each pair takes two and a half hours to make.\u201d Ates says that he has visited factories abroad making high-street brand jeans in just 18 minutes using automated machines operated by low-paid workers. The labour costs were about 1% of the retail price, meaning 70p for a pair of jeans that will sell for \u00a370. \u201cCountries such as Bangladesh, China, India and Turkey play a big role in mass production with lower labour costs, allowing brands to keep prices affordable on the British high street,\u201d Vakilzadeh says. \u201cHowever, this raises important questions about sustainability and fair labour practices, so it\u2019s crucial to do your research beforehand.\u201d According to Vakilzadeh, M&amp;S is a good option when it comes to how its jeans fit, but \u201ctheir durability can be a bit hit and miss\u201d. For mid-range options, she recommends brands such as Baukjen, Me+Em, Cos and Levi\u2019s. Ates suggests spending at least \u00a380. \u201cIt will be better quality and made in better environments. If the jeans are \u00a325 to \u00a350, I would question the ethics.\u201d Vakilzadeh says that jeans below \u00a3100 \u201coften compromise on fabric quality, craftsmanship and durability\u201d. She says that heavy denim is more durable; anything with more than 3% elastane or Lycra loses its shape faster. A good finish on pockets and flies means jeans will last longer.

Personally, I wouldn\u2019t spend more than \u00a330 on a moisturiser.\u201d At the lower end, she advises steering clear of anything under \u00a35. \u201cYou don\u2019t always need the most expensive option \u2013 it\u2019s best to focus on ingredient quality and suitability for your skin type,\u201d Mahto says. For oily or acne-prone skin, she recommends a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturiser; dry skins will benefit from richer, cream-based formulations with ingredients such as ceramides or hyaluronic acid; for sensitive skin, look for fragrance-free options. As well as a daily moisturiser, it\u2019s important to wear facial sunscreen to protect your skin from UV rays. Mahto advises using one with broad-spectrum protection (UVA and UVB) and a minimum SPF of 30. \u201cBudget options (\u00a35 to \u00a315) typically use basic chemical UV filters and may have heavier textures or leave a white cast. Mid-range sunscreens (\u00a315 to \u00a330) often offer better textures, faster absorption and additional benefits such as hydration or anti-ageing ingredients. High-end sunscreens (\u00a330 to \u00a350-plus) tend to include advanced formulations, such as mineral filters and added antioxidants, and are designed for superior skin feel and protection.\u201d Depending on your budget and specific needs, Mahto suggests spending between \u00a310 and \u00a360: \u201cAnything over that would need to be very special in terms of formulation for me to part with my own money.\u201d Dr Anjali Mahto\u2019s picks Mid-range Moisturiser, Eucerin hyaluron-filler day cream, \u00a334 for 50ml lookfantastic.com Sunscreen, Heliocare 360 oil-free gel, \u00a331 for 50ml heliocare.co.uk Splurge Moisturiser, Alumier MD Hydralight, \u00a358.50 for 50ml uk.alumiermd.com Sunscreen, Shiseido Urban Environment Age Defense oil-free SPF30, \u00a328.80 for 30ml johnlewis.com Butter Price range \u00a32.75-\u00a34.50 for 250g For ethically and sustainably sourced butter, look for products made with British milk, says Ed Ayton, Abel &amp; Cole\u2019s sustainability and ethics adviser. \u201cWe have excellent animal welfare laws in the UK and most dairies here are grass-based, so cows spend a lot of time outdoors,\u201d he explains. That said, most butter packets don\u2019t include details of how the animals are raised, which is why it\u2019s best to buy organic \u2013 this means cows spend as much time outdoors as the weather allows. \u201cOrganic standards prohibit artificial fertilisers, so organic farmers often grow more clover, which gives milk higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.\u201d Jonny Crickmore is the co-owner of Fen Farm Dairy, which makes Bungay raw butter. It costs between \u00a36 and \u00a39 for 200g, and the higher price reflects the more labour-intensive production process \u2013 staff spend 50 to 60 hours a week hand-making 500kg of butter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three or four people making this small quantity, whereas in a factory you would have one person doing 50 or 100 times that,\u201d he says. Making it by hand and using milk fresh from the milking parlour means the product has more flavour. In terms of cost, Ayton says \u201cgood butter rarely costs less than \u00a311 a kg\u201d, equivalent to \u00a32.75 for 250g. The good news is organic butter isn\u2019t necessarily dearer. \u201cThere\u2019s more parity with conventional dairy prices, so you can go for a brand that takes better care of animals and the environment without spending much more.\u201d Guardian Feast team\u2019s picks Mid-range Kerrygold pure Irish butter, \u00a32.30 for 250g ocado.com Splurge Ampersand cultured butter, \u00a37.50 for 210g dukeshill.co.uk A flat white Price range \u00a33.50-\u00a34.50 \u201cA kilo of raw espresso beans will cost between \u00a315 and \u00a320. Typically, a double shot of espresso weighs about 17g to 21g,\u201d says Tom Saxon, who has worked in the coffee industry for 10 years and founded Batch Coffee Club. \u201cPer double shot of espresso, the cost of raw materials is between 25p and 42p. Milk costs roughly \u00a31.50 for two pints, so the milk for a flat white costs 20p.\u201d There are other costs to consider, too. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to estimate how much it costs to employ somebody to make a flat white. The minimum time it would take is 20 seconds if they\u2019re making several coffees at once, up to about 60 seconds,\u201d Saxon says. If they\u2019re being paid the living wage of \u00a312 an hour, this would amount to between 6p and 20p a flat white. You also need to factor in the wages of wait staff, and covering quieter times. \u201cOther costs include gas, electricity and water. I\u2019d estimate another 20p per flat white,\u201d Saxon adds. Then there are things like the cost of waste coffee and milk, rent and equipment (espresso machines can be \u00a320,000, Saxon says). All these costs will be more affordable for mainstream high-street brands: \u201cThey can produce a cup of coffee much cheaper than an independent brand because it\u2019s lower quality and bought in bulk; milk and packaging will be cheaper as they buy in huge quantities.\u201d While it\u2019s more expensive, Saxon recommends buying speciality coffee if possible. \u201cCoffee farmers make no money in some harvests because the C-price \u2013 the lowest price that coffee can be traded for \u2013 is so low that the sale doesn\u2019t cover their costs.\u201d If this happens, farmers may have to grow other crops, or move and leave their farm. \u201cBy buying speciality coffee, you can be sure the coffee farmer has been paid well above fair trade prices.\u201d With all that in mind, you should pay \u201cbetween \u00a33.50 and \u00a34.50 for a flat white\u201d. And how much is too much? \u201cI would say \u00a35 is,\u201d Saxon says, with the caveat that this can depend on where you are in the UK, and the beans used.

And what does it actually mean? \u201cBedding comes in lots of different fabrics and weaves, all of which feel different against your skin. Natural fibres, such as cotton, linen and bamboo, will be more luxurious and often more costly,\u201d says Laurie Davidson, a writer and stylist who specialises in interiors. \u201cWhen it comes to cotton bedding, many believe the higher the thread count \u2013 the number of threads woven together per square inch of fabric \u2013 the better the quality. Actually, it\u2019s the quality of the cotton threads the bed linen is woven from that makes it feel soft.\u201d Egyptian cotton is often said to be the best cotton for bed linen, and the feel improves with each use. It comes from a different plant (Gossypium barbadense) from regular cotton, meaning it has extra-long fibres, which produce thread that\u2019s thinner but stronger than other cottons, and can be woven into a luxurious, durable fabric. When choosing bedding, a lot of it comes down to personal preference. \u201cYou might prefer to lie on cool and crisp linen, while others might like silk or a cosy feel to sheets,\u201d Davidson says. She recommends looking out for things such as breathability and insulation properties, as well as thread count. \u201cIf you hold the bedding up to the light and can see through it, then it\u2019s going to be more breathable. If you prefer linen bedding, Belgian or French flax is generally regarded as the highest quality. It has natural breathability and insulation properties, and is one of the most long-lasting fabrics you can choose. It\u2019s also eco-friendly, renewable and biodegradable,\u201d Davidson says. As for price? \u201cAnything under \u00a350 for a double bedding set is likely not to be the best quality. For mid-range you\u2019re probably looking at \u00a3150 up,\u201d Davidson says. She recommends John Lewis\u2019s own-brand bedding, as well as Dunelm, where you\u2019ll find the Dorma brand. \u201cDorma holds a royal warrant and supplies the royal household, so it\u2019s good enough for the king! Scooms is also a great online choice.\u201d Laurie Davidson\u2019s picks Mid-range Scooms double duvet cover, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, \u00a3209 scooms.com Splurge Secret Linen double duvet cover, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, \u00a3330 secretlinenstore.com A pair of socks Price range \u00a310-\u00a320 You might not give them as much thought as the rest of your wardrobe, but socks can vary hugely in terms of price, quality and comfort. \u201cSocks can be made using a variety of different materials such as nylon, cotton and wool. The cost of socks is impacted by needle count, elastic quality, size and toe linking [the process of closing the toe seam of a sock]. Higher needle counts and seamless toes increase the price because they provide better quality and comfort,\u201d says personal stylist Alex Standley. Needle count refers to the number of needles in the machine that makes the socks \u2013 and it can have a big impact on quality and price. \u201cA higher needle count, such as 200 needles, results in a denser and finer fabric, enhancing durability, comfort and quality. This process requires more time and effort, increasing manufacturing costs and making it a more premium price point.\u201d As for prices, Standley says socks can range from \u00a32 to \u00a340 for a pair. \u201cCheaper socks often use lower-quality materials such as polyester and human-made fibres, while premium options use naturally derived materials such as merino wool for better durability and comfort,\u201d she says. \u201cExpect to pay between \u00a310 and \u00a320 for good quality socks. Ethically and sustainably made socks may cost more because of higher production standards and paying a living wage.\u201d At the lower end of the scale, Standley says socks under \u00a35 \u201cwill probably have compromised on quality, longevity and supply chain standards\u201d, while \u201cpaying over \u00a330 might be excessive unless they offer specific benefits such as enhanced durability or sustainability\u201d.

Paul Jones, owner and managing director at Cloudwater, a craft brewery in Manchester, says people assume that because craft beer is often more expensive, those breweries are making more money. \u201cThe opposite is true,\u201d he says. \u201cCraft beer brewers charge more because they use more resources.\u201d Jones explains that when a pub or bar buys a keg of beer, \u201chalf of the cost is tax and the other half is ingredients and whatever sliver of margin the brewery makes\u201d. Stainer says the profit a pub makes is squeezed, too. \u201cFive years ago pubs made just under 30p profit a pint sold, with the average national pint price about \u00a33.80. In 2024, pubs make an average profit of 12p a pint, despite the price rising to \u00a34.80.\u201d It also depends on location. \u201cSomeone in London might not bat an eyelid at a \u00a36 pint,\u201d Stainer says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re paying much more than the national average \u2013 about \u00a35 a pint \u2013 and there isn\u2019t a reason (it\u2019s a particularly special beer, say, or in spectacular surroundings), you may want to consider if you\u2019re being ripped off.\u201d Beer writer Melissa Cole\u2019s picks Mid-range Camden Hells lager, 4.6%, \u00a318 for 12 330ml cans camdentownbrewery.com Splurge Fuller\u2019s vintage ale 2024, 8.4%, \u00a36 for 500ml waitrose.com Cleaning spray Price range \u00a31.50-\u00a34 How much you pay for a cleaning spray may depend on how enthusiastic you are about cleaning, but it\u2019s worth giving it some thought. \u201cMost people go for the cheapest, but it\u2019s not always the best,\u201d says Lynsey Crombie, TV cleaning expert and author of The 15-Minute Clean. Cheaper sprays are more likely to smell strongly of chemicals and may not be as effective: \u201cYou end up using more.\u201d At the higher end, there\u2019s a Diptyque spray that costs \u00a335, but Crombie believes this is too expensive. \u201cYou\u2019re paying for a luxury glass bottle and a nice label and smell. But a good washing-up liquid cleans almost any surface, so why would you spend \u00a335?\u201d In a supermarket, she advises paying \u00a31.50 to \u00a32.50, and recommends Cif and Flash, M&amp;S\u2019s Italian lemon and ginger kitchen surface cleaner and Sainsbury\u2019s Greencare range. For a fully eco-friendly clean, she suggests Method\u2019s products, at about \u00a34 each. \u201cFor everyday cleaning, if you pay more than \u00a34, you\u2019re being ripped off.\u201d Lynsey Crombie\u2019s picks Mid-range Cif multipurpose cleaner spray, lavender and blue fern, \u00a32 for 750ml sainsburys.co.uk Splurge Method anti-bac multi surface cleaner spray, wild rhubarb, \u00a33.75 for 828ml sainsburys.co.uk A whole chicken Price range \u00a312-\u00a322 for 1.4kg What to look for in a supermarket bird? \u201cThe word organic. Certification requires slow-growing breeds to be used,\u201d says Abel &amp; Cole\u2019s Ed Ayton. This is key because some birds are bred to reach full size in 35 days, so their breast and thigh muscles grow quicker than their bones can keep up with. Isn\u2019t free-range good enough? \u201cIt means outdoor space is offered, but doesn\u2019t offer much indication of welfare factors such as breeding or stockmanship.\u201d Sutton Hoo Chicken in Suffolk specialises in slow-grown birds that retail for about \u00a320 for a 2kg chicken, while a supermarket bird could be \u00a36. \u201cOne massive thing is the scale of the operations,\u201d says general manager Will Waterer. \u201cA chicken shed can have 40,000 chickens in it, and a farm could have four or five of those. It would take us two years to produce what an average indoor farm can in five weeks.\u201d Then there\u2019s how much food a chicken needs to eat to gain weight. \u201cAn indoor chicken needs 1.5kg of feed to put on 1kg,\u201d Waterer says. \u201cWhen you slow the process, you get better flavour and a higher welfare chicken.\u201d His birds need 3kg of feed to gain 1kg. Not everyone can spend \u00a320 on a chicken, but Waterer says it\u2019s best to go for free-range and organic if you can. The lowest Ayton would pay is \u00a312 for a 1.4kg bird: \u201cLess and I\u2019d be concerned about what\u2019s being compromised.\u201d Guardian Feast team\u2019s picks Pipers Farm properly free range whole chicken, from \u00a313.75 pipersfarm.com Splurge Label Rouge chicken, \u00a327.45 for 1.8kg thegingerpig.co.uk The Guardian\u2019s journalism is independent.

Shortly after tea on the second day of the second Test \u2013 day seven, if you will \u2013 they had scored 1,034 runs in the series for the loss of just nine wickets, ticking along at 5.4 runs an over. But after the deluge of records came something akin to Squid Game. The tourists lost 18 for 224 in just 59.3 overs as they largely tried to sweep their way out of trouble on a surface that, if not a full-blown minefield, had certainly become no man\u2019s land by the end.</p> <p>Unlike the Oval five weeks ago, where England phoned in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/sep/09/brilliant-nissanka-leads-sri-lanka-to-emphatic-test-victory-over-england\">sloppy outing against Sri Lanka</a> and blew their chance of a perfect home summer, this latest defeat was far less self-inflicted and so the philosophical outlooks of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum were not unreasonable.</p> <p>Which is not to say it should be written off as simply the wrong side of a coin toss. Had they squeezed a bit more out of their first innings, and not dropped the catches that helped Salman Ali Agha add 71 runs with the tail, the final target, while still guaranteed to be a tough ask, would have been far lower.</p> <p>Given Rawalpindi is one of the most soporific tracks on the circuit, evidenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/05/ben-stokes-england-stunning-test-win-pakistan-mind-blowing-cricket\">England\u2019s mind-boggling win</a> there two years ago, it will be interesting to see if the ground staff can issue a repeat prescription of heavy spin for the third Test.</p> <p>Do so and things will open up further for Pakistan against an England team who, after that 4-1 defeat in India earlier this year, are clearly fallible when their aggression meets livelier conditions. Ollie Pope\u2019s 196 in Hyderabad was an outlier at the time \u2013 he played 75 false shots, no other player survived more than 29 in the match \u2013 and has become increasingly so since.</p>    <p>It may be that for perhaps the first time under McCullum, belief slightly drained away during this Test, making way for a fatalistic view of the surface and that flurry of sweeps. Although given the shot\u2019s past profitability, and the historical precedent that suggested their pursuit of 297 was always moonshot at best, they will be wary of an over-correction during the debrief. As Salman showed, proactivity was a better bet than poking around in survival mode, even if he did not get the broom out for every delivery.</p> <p>An intriguing aspect of the wash-up was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/18/i-was-a-tired-grumpy-old-man-ben-stokes-says-sorry-to-england-teammates\">Stokes chastising himself</a>. Not for the second-innings stumping when his bat flew off like Fred Astaire tossing his cane mid- routine, rather for losing his temper in the field when those two chances went down off Salman and denied the hugely impressive Brydon Carse.</p> <p>Playing his first Test since tearing a hamstring in August, Stokes spent the bulk of it emitting uber-upbeat fumes for his players \u2013 broad smiles and bum pats fuelling what, overall, was another strong outing in the field \u2013 but felt he let himself and them down in that particular moment. That Stokes felt the need to apologise in the dressing room says a bit about his captaincy, which has been underpinned by an emotional intelligence that few predicted during his tearaway years.</p> <p>One example came this summer when Shoaib Bashir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/21/england-west-indies-second-test-day-four-match-report\">spun England to victory</a> against West Indies at Trent Bridge. Knowing Bashir would dominate the back pages the following morning, Stokes is said to have broken away from the celebrations to phone the overlooked Jack Leach and stress his importance to the setup. Right now, there are few captains more attuned to the feelings of their charges.</p> <p>The greater challenge for Stokes \u2013 beyond continuing his comeback as a fully fledged all-rounder \u2013 is a personal one, having averaged 15 with the bat in his last 11 innings in Asia and found left-arm spin particularly vexing.</p> <p>With England not scheduled to tour the subcontinent until Bangladesh in early 2027, this week\u2019s third Test could easily be the 33-year-old\u2019s last in this part of the world. If so, then addressing that barren streak and helping secure the series win would be a pretty handy way to sign off.</p>",

Unlike the Oval five weeks ago, where England phoned in a sloppy outing against Sri Lanka and blew their chance of a perfect home summer, this latest defeat was far less self-inflicted and so the philosophical outlooks of Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum were not unreasonable. Which is not to say it should be written off as simply the wrong side of a coin toss. Had they squeezed a bit more out of their first innings, and not dropped the catches that helped Salman Ali Agha add 71 runs with the tail, the final target, while still guaranteed to be a tough ask, would have been far lower. Given Rawalpindi is one of the most soporific tracks on the circuit, evidenced by England\u2019s mind-boggling win there two years ago, it will be interesting to see if the ground staff can issue a repeat prescription of heavy spin for the third Test. Do so and things will open up further for Pakistan against an England team who, after that 4-1 defeat in India earlier this year, are clearly fallible when their aggression meets livelier conditions. Ollie Pope\u2019s 196 in Hyderabad was an outlier at the time \u2013 he played 75 false shots, no other player survived more than 29 in the match \u2013 and has become increasingly so since. It may be that for perhaps the first time under McCullum, belief slightly drained away during this Test, making way for a fatalistic view of the surface and that flurry of sweeps. Although given the shot\u2019s past profitability, and the historical precedent that suggested their pursuit of 297 was always moonshot at best, they will be wary of an over-correction during the debrief. As Salman showed, proactivity was a better bet than poking around in survival mode, even if he did not get the broom out for every delivery. An intriguing aspect of the wash-up was Stokes chastising himself. Not for the second-innings stumping when his bat flew off like Fred Astaire tossing his cane mid- routine, rather for losing his temper in the field when those two chances went down off Salman and denied the hugely impressive Brydon Carse. Playing his first Test since tearing a hamstring in August, Stokes spent the bulk of it emitting uber-upbeat fumes for his players \u2013 broad smiles and bum pats fuelling what, overall, was another strong outing in the field \u2013 but felt he let himself and them down in that particular moment. That Stokes felt the need to apologise in the dressing room says a bit about his captaincy, which has been underpinned by an emotional intelligence that few predicted during his tearaway years. One example came this summer when Shoaib Bashir spun England to victory against West Indies at Trent Bridge. Knowing Bashir would dominate the back pages the following morning, Stokes is said to have broken away from the celebrations to phone the overlooked Jack Leach and stress his importance to the setup. Right now, there are few captains more attuned to the feelings of their charges. The greater challenge for Stokes \u2013 beyond continuing his comeback as a fully fledged all-rounder \u2013 is a personal one, having averaged 15 with the bat in his last 11 innings in Asia and found left-arm spin particularly vexing. With England not scheduled to tour the subcontinent until Bangladesh in early 2027, this week\u2019s third Test could easily be the 33-year-old\u2019s last in this part of the world. If so, then addressing that barren streak and helping secure the series win would be a pretty handy way to sign off.",

Two of France\u2019s biggest clubs, Lyon and Marseille, have led the way in rebelling against what they say amounts to a surrender to the all-powerful Qataris; at least according to French media, that is. The league has so far declined to commenton the matter.</p> <p>The trigger for the unrest is the decision of the French League, LFP, to accept a payment of \u20ac16.4m (\u00a313.7m) made by the Qatar Tourism Authority, to be shared equally between Ligue\u2019s 18 clubs in exchange for advertising the Visit Qatar brand.</p> <p>This is meant to be a sweetener to complement the Qatari-owned beIN Sports\u2019 purchase of some TV domestic rights at a knockdown price. Lyon and Marseille now say they will not play ball. Lyon, owned by the American investor John Textor, who also has stakes in Botafogo, Molenbeek and Crystal Palace, raged at LFP\u2019s \u201cincompetence\u201d and said it considered the LFP-Visit Qatar partnership as \u201ca violation of [Lyon\u2019s] rights\u201d and so were \u201cnull and void\u201d.</p> <p>Marseille followed suit, letting it be known that under no circumstances would they allow Qatar to tarnish their jersey. Given the club\u2019s poisonous rivalry with PSG, this was to be expected.</p>    <p>When the sponsorship proposal was first made, nobody seemed to care much about what it entailed for each of the clubs. All of them voted in favour. The windfall was modest \u2013 \u20ac730,000 (\u00a3608,000) per club in L1, \u20ac170,000 (\u00a3142,000) in L2 - but welcome all the same, given the catastrophic drop in domestic TV rights which has seen LFP fall well short of its optimistic valuation of those rights at \u20ac1bn per season for the 2024-29 cycle.</p> <p>Some context is needed here. LFP had first burned its bridges with L1\u2019s established broadcaster Canal+ before being burnt themselves in the collapse of the deal they had signed with Spanish company Mediapro in 2018. Cap in hand, LFP had to accept a far more modest offer from Amazon Prime and beIN. But even that discounted deal was better than what a desperate LFP had to accept last summer, when none of the expected bidders made a move, and the domestic rights were sold for less than half of what had been expected.</p> <p>Canal+, which has decided to turn its back on L1, now pays more \u2013 half a billion euros \u2013 for the rights to Uefa club competitions than L1 is making for the sale of all of its domestic rights, something which a TV rights specialist described as \u201cinsane\u201d.</p> <p>Given that Ligue 1 clubs derive at least half of their revenue \u2013 70% of which goes on players\u2019 wages \u2013 from what the majority of them now face is not another bump in the road, but an existential threat.</p> <p>This explains why those most in danger, those who \u201cmake up the numbers\u201d as another L1 executive put it, have so far refrained from joining the protest. They need Qatar\u2019s money. \u201cThe LFP is run by and for the big guys, those who get their money from taking part in European competitions, not us,\u201d said an L1 club chairman who wished to remain anonymous.</p> <p>\u201cThe balance has gone. What Lyon and Marseille are saying about the Visit Qatar deal is nonsense. There\u2019s never been any plan to have their names on our shirts. It\u2019s up to each club to value what they can offer Visit Qatar in counterpart for their money, but naming was never part of the discussion.\u201d</p> <p>Why, then, would Lyon and Marseille make such a fuss? One explanation is that some of the bigger clubs, which, in private, will support the stance of the rebels, are not happy that the money from the Qatar Tourism Authority is to be shared equally, when the \u20ac1.5bn deal passed between LFP and the US private equity fund CVC Partners in 2022 was heavily weighted in favour of PSG and clubs which had the best Uefa ranking coefficient.</p> <p>The case of Marseille is different, when the very idea of promoting anything related to Qatar will drive even moderate supporters to distraction. A solution will have to be found, as this rebellion\u2019 has prompted beIN Sports to withhold the payment of \u20ac80m it owes LFP so far. This, in itself, is perhaps the lesson of this crisis. In the end, in French football, it is still Qatar which holds the cards that matter.</p>",

Two of France\u2019s biggest clubs, Lyon and Marseille, have led the way in rebelling against what they say amounts to a surrender to the all-powerful Qataris; at least according to French media, that is. The league has so far declined to commenton the matter. The trigger for the unrest is the decision of the French League, LFP, to accept a payment of \u20ac16.4m (\u00a313.7m) made by the Qatar Tourism Authority, to be shared equally between Ligue\u2019s 18 clubs in exchange for advertising the Visit Qatar brand. This is meant to be a sweetener to complement the Qatari-owned beIN Sports\u2019 purchase of some TV domestic rights at a knockdown price. Lyon and Marseille now say they will not play ball. Lyon, owned by the American investor John Textor, who also has stakes in Botafogo, Molenbeek and Crystal Palace, raged at LFP\u2019s \u201cincompetence\u201d and said it considered the LFP-Visit Qatar partnership as \u201ca violation of [Lyon\u2019s] rights\u201d and so were \u201cnull and void\u201d. Marseille followed suit, letting it be known that under no circumstances would they allow Qatar to tarnish their jersey. Given the club\u2019s poisonous rivalry with PSG, this was to be expected. When the sponsorship proposal was first made, nobody seemed to care much about what it entailed for each of the clubs. All of them voted in favour. The windfall was modest \u2013 \u20ac730,000 (\u00a3608,000) per club in L1, \u20ac170,000 (\u00a3142,000) in L2 - but welcome all the same, given the catastrophic drop in domestic TV rights which has seen LFP fall well short of its optimistic valuation of those rights at \u20ac1bn per season for the 2024-29 cycle. Some context is needed here. LFP had first burned its bridges with L1\u2019s established broadcaster Canal+ before being burnt themselves in the collapse of the deal they had signed with Spanish company Mediapro in 2018. Cap in hand, LFP had to accept a far more modest offer from Amazon Prime and beIN. But even that discounted deal was better than what a desperate LFP had to accept last summer, when none of the expected bidders made a move, and the domestic rights were sold for less than half of what had been expected. Canal+, which has decided to turn its back on L1, now pays more \u2013 half a billion euros \u2013 for the rights to Uefa club competitions than L1 is making for the sale of all of its domestic rights, something which a TV rights specialist described as \u201cinsane\u201d. Given that Ligue 1 clubs derive at least half of their revenue \u2013 70% of which goes on players\u2019 wages \u2013 from what the majority of them now face is not another bump in the road, but an existential threat. This explains why those most in danger, those who \u201cmake up the numbers\u201d as another L1 executive put it, have so far refrained from joining the protest. They need Qatar\u2019s money. \u201cThe LFP is run by and for the big guys, those who get their money from taking part in European competitions, not us,\u201d said an L1 club chairman who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cThe balance has gone. What Lyon and Marseille are saying about the Visit Qatar deal is nonsense. There\u2019s never been any plan to have their names on our shirts. It\u2019s up to each club to value what they can offer Visit Qatar in counterpart for their money, but naming was never part of the discussion.\u201d Why, then, would Lyon and Marseille make such a fuss? One explanation is that some of the bigger clubs, which, in private, will support the stance of the rebels, are not happy that the money from the Qatar Tourism Authority is to be shared equally, when the \u20ac1.5bn deal passed between LFP and the US private equity fund CVC Partners in 2022 was heavily weighted in favour of PSG and clubs which had the best Uefa ranking coefficient. The case of Marseille is different, when the very idea of promoting anything related to Qatar will drive even moderate supporters to distraction. A solution will have to be found, as this rebellion\u2019 has prompted beIN Sports to withhold the payment of \u20ac80m it owes LFP so far. This, in itself, is perhaps the lesson of this crisis. In the end, in French football, it is still Qatar which holds the cards that matter.",

Thank you. Thank you for making me feel so very welcome. Thank you.\u201d</p> \n<p>And he was away.</p> \n<p>From there, the royal tour returned to Admiralty House, the grand official residence of the governor general perched on Sydney Harbour, to meet the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley, and the governor general, Sam Mostyn. Mostyn <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/australias-governor-general-on-charles-visit-and-the-republic-question/ik8w0o14v\">told SBS</a> television last week she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be having long conversations about the potential for Australia to become a republic but instead wanted to \u201cshow him a modern Australia\u201d.</p> \n<p>This is Charles\u2019s 17th visit to Australia. The <a href=\"https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-3066223944/view?partId=nla.obj-3066233096#page/n5/mode/1up\">itineraries of previous visits</a> highlight how pared back this one is, with the king suspending cancer treatment to be here. He will only visit Sydney and Canberra, and only attend a handful of events.</p> \n<p>In 1983 he brought his new wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, with him. It was not her first visit to Australia \u2013 in 1981 she had come to visit her mother, Frances Ruth Shand Kydd, who was living on a sheep farm near Yass. But it was her first as Charles\u2019s wife.</p> \n<p>Australia embraced the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d but Diana said later that her popularity <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-18/charles-diana-1983-australia-tour/104471508\">had sparked Charles\u2019 jealousy</a> and increased the marital tension.</p> \n<p>An article in the Canberra Times about the 1983 visit said: \u201cYes the princess, on her first official visit to Australia, is of far more interest than her consort who after all comes here almost as often as Michael Parkinson or Rolf Harris (although of course he is far more welcome than them).\u201d</p> \n<p>The flag-waving crowds on this trip appeared equally delighted with both Camilla and Charles.</p> \n<p>The royal pair will now go to Canberra. There will be a welcome to country and smoking ceremony, after which the king will lay a wreath in the Hall of Memory at the Australian War Memorial. The couple will then greet the public on the way to the <a href=\"https://www.awm.gov.au/visit/exhibitions/forourcountry\">For our Country memorial</a>, followed by a trip to Parliament House.</p> \n<p>Later in the afternoon they will plant a tree each on the grounds of Yarralumla, then head to the Botanic Gardens where they will hear about the impacts of the climate emergency on flora.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday they will return to the NSW capital for events including a barbecue in western Sydney and a public appearance at Sydney Opera House.</p> \n<p>They will leave on Wednesday, when the king will fly to Samoa for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "King Charles III did not linger long at the luncheon put on in his honour, at the second scheduled event of his short Australian visit. And his gift to the gathering was a reminder of the fleeting passage of time. There was a menu fit for a king, and very Sydney: chargrilled asparagus and olive dust; marinated octopus and squid ink wafer; barramundi and duck confit. But the sovereign was gone before the first course. He addressed the gathering at NSW\u2019s Parliament House, he offered an hourglass as a present, told lawmakers the \u201csands of time\u201d would encourage \u201cbrevity\u201d, and left within 10 minutes of his arrival in the hall, not to be seen again in public until Monday. Earlier, King Charles and Queen Camilla began their day at St Thomas\u2019 Anglican church in North Sydney. It was technically the third day of their six-day tour of Australia \u2013 but apart from some handshakes on landing on Friday night, it was the public\u2019s first chance to see the couple after a rest day on Saturday. The schedule has been designed not to overly tire the king, who is being treated for cancer. Inside the church the bishop of North Sydney, Christopher Edwards, asked for world peace while protesters outside held aloft banners saying \u201cEmpire built on genocide\u201d and \u201cDecolonise\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Hundreds of fans lined the street outside and waved Australian flags (the Australian Monarchist League had pledged to hand out thousands of them). In an unplanned moment, the king and queen went to greet the crowds, with police scrambling to ensure they were protected. Well-wishers thrust bunches of flowers into the queen\u2019s hands, with the blooms then swiftly whisked away by aides. A supporter tootled on a flute, while chants of \u201cAlways was, always will be, Aboriginal land\u201d floated on the spring breeze. The royals\u2019 motorcade moved from there to Parliament House, where the king was heralded by trumpets and a voice crying \u201cHooray\u201d. NSW\u2019s legislative council, the first government formed in Australia, celebrates its bicentenary this year. Charles was given a tour by the legislative council\u2019s president, Ben Franklin, and the usher of the Black Rod, representing another ancient tradition Australia inherited from the UK (the usher was traditionally from an order of knights called the Most Noble Order of the Garter and served the monarch in the British House of Lords). The king stopped to admire the Gumbaynggirr/Bundjalung artist Kim Healey\u2019s Ngurra Jagun (homeland or home country) artwork commissioned for the bicentenary before taking to the stage. \u201cHaving been with you for your 150th anniversary, I am delighted and proud to be able to return to the parliament of NSW in order to celebrate the occasion of your bicentenary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fascinating, I think, to reflect back to 200 years ago, and thinking about those times makes me wonder what that inaugural handful of members of the NSW legislative council would make of this parliament today, and of how this great state has progressed.\u201d He described how the original council members (King George IV appointed just five of them before the council was later expanded) were \u201csqueezed into the old government house\u201d. \u201cFrom that vantage point, regardless of their optimism, it was no doubt impossible to imagine what is now the vast and vibrant state of NSW, which has grown and evolved alongside this legislature, to reflect on the story of this institution and this state is to see the promise and power of representative democracy,\u201d he said, adding that democracy had an \u201cextraordinary capacity for innovation, compromise and adaptability, as well as stability\u201d. The crowd chuckled when he said it was \u201cslightly worrying\u201d that he had first come to Australia nearly 60 years ago. In the spirit of marking the \u201cpassage of time\u201d, he presented the hourglass speech timer to the parliament to \u201cbear witness\u201d on its next chapter. It brought more laughs, with the king poetically opting to turn the hourglass himself, then departing as the sand slowly ran through the bulb. \u201cWith the sands of time encouraging brevity, it just remains for me to say what a great joy it is to come to Australia for the first time as sovereign and to renew a love of this country and its people which I have cherished for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thank you. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel so very welcome. Thank you.\u201d And he was away. From there, the royal tour returned to Admiralty House, the grand official residence of the governor general perched on Sydney Harbour, to meet the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley, and the governor general, Sam Mostyn. Mostyn told SBS television last week she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be having long conversations about the potential for Australia to become a republic but instead wanted to \u201cshow him a modern Australia\u201d. This is Charles\u2019s 17th visit to Australia. The itineraries of previous visits highlight how pared back this one is, with the king suspending cancer treatment to be here. He will only visit Sydney and Canberra, and only attend a handful of events. In 1983 he brought his new wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, with him. It was not her first visit to Australia \u2013 in 1981 she had come to visit her mother, Frances Ruth Shand Kydd, who was living on a sheep farm near Yass. But it was her first as Charles\u2019s wife. Australia embraced the \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d but Diana said later that her popularity had sparked Charles\u2019 jealousy and increased the marital tension. An article in the Canberra Times about the 1983 visit said: \u201cYes the princess, on her first official visit to Australia, is of far more interest than her consort who after all comes here almost as often as Michael Parkinson or Rolf Harris (although of course he is far more welcome than them).\u201d The flag-waving crowds on this trip appeared equally delighted with both Camilla and Charles. The royal pair will now go to Canberra. There will be a welcome to country and smoking ceremony, after which the king will lay a wreath in the Hall of Memory at the Australian War Memorial. The couple will then greet the public on the way to the For our Country memorial, followed by a trip to Parliament House. Later in the afternoon they will plant a tree each on the grounds of Yarralumla, then head to the Botanic Gardens where they will hear about the impacts of the climate emergency on flora. On Tuesday they will return to the NSW capital for events including a barbecue in western Sydney and a public appearance at Sydney Opera House. They will leave on Wednesday, when the king will fly to Samoa for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting.",

The great merit of the Wealth Gap Risk Register report (full declaration: I chair its editorial advisory board) is that it makes the case for a more equitable distribution of wealth \u2013 not in terms of socialism or the superior morality of collective action; instead, it invokes the much more powerful and unarguable principle: fairness.</p> <p>A fair society is one where the distribution of income, wealth, opportunity and risk is such that it would not matter where and to whom you were born.

      "body": "<p>In early 2023, Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, chief executive of the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, and its UK corporate vice-president Pinder Sahota, met in Whitehall with the then health secretary Steve Barclay, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and various health and Treasury officials. They discussed the possibilities of a pilot scheme to improve obesity care in the UK.</p> <p>According to internal documents obtained by the <em>Observer</em>, Novo Nordisk wanted \u201cdata from the Department for Work and Pensions\u201d to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/18/obesity-jab-maker-data-to-profile-benefits-claimants\">help profile</a> those who are most likely to return to the labour market\u201d. These individuals could then be targeted with Wegovy, the brand name for the company\u2019s weight-loss drug semaglutide.</p> <p>Simon Capewell, emeritus professor of public health at Liverpool University, observed that \u201ctargeting people in the interests of the state, for economic reasons, rather than prioritising the person\u2019s own interests and health\u201d was \u201cunethical\u201d. He also questioned the scientific \u201chonesty\u201d of a pilot scheme testing the efficacy of a drug in helping individuals back into the labour market, but using people who were already \u201cconsidered by the DWP to be borderline for just returning to work\u201d.

      "bodyText": "In early 2023, Lars Fruergaard J\u00f8rgensen, chief executive of the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, and its UK corporate vice-president Pinder Sahota, met in Whitehall with the then health secretary Steve Barclay, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and various health and Treasury officials. They discussed the possibilities of a pilot scheme to improve obesity care in the UK. According to internal documents obtained by the Observer, Novo Nordisk wanted \u201cdata from the Department for Work and Pensions\u201d to \u201chelp profile those who are most likely to return to the labour market\u201d. These individuals could then be targeted with Wegovy, the brand name for the company\u2019s weight-loss drug semaglutide. Simon Capewell, emeritus professor of public health at Liverpool University, observed that \u201ctargeting people in the interests of the state, for economic reasons, rather than prioritising the person\u2019s own interests and health\u201d was \u201cunethical\u201d. He also questioned the scientific \u201chonesty\u201d of a pilot scheme testing the efficacy of a drug in helping individuals back into the labour market, but using people who were already \u201cconsidered by the DWP to be borderline for just returning to work\u201d. It would \u201cbe a marvellous bit of marketing for the company\u201d. That Novo Nordisk study never materialised. Eighteen months later, though, a pilot study is being launched, to test not Wegovy but Mounjaro, the market name for tirzepatide, an anti-diabetic and weight-loss injection produced by the US pharmaceutical giant Lilly. The government trumpeted Lilly\u2019s presence at last week\u2019s \u201cinvestment summit\u201d and hailed the company\u2019s \u00a3279m stake in helping \u201cdevelop transformative medicines\u201d and \u201ctrial innovative approaches to treating obesity\u201d.

Drugs such as Wegovy or Mounjaro may well prove useful in helping individuals reduce weight, though their efficacy is far from certain, nor their side effects properly understood. That, though, is significantly different from a government strategy to use them as a means of bringing people back into the labour market.

Narconon UK was ordered by the watchdog to address a \u201crange of shortfalls\u201d after an investigation identified breaches of charity law and issues with management. The charity, which runs a private rehab facility in rural East Sussex, must also be more transparent about its treatment approach and links to the Church of Scientology, the Charity Commission said. The regulatory action comes after a nine-month investigation by the Observer revealed how people seeking help for drug and alcohol issues at Narconon\u2019s Heathfield facility were subjected to psychological drills akin to those used in Scientology\u2019s \u201cauditing\u201d process.

      "body": "<p>Autumn now seems officially to be John le Carr\u00e9 season, given that this is the fourth year running since the author\u2019s death in 2020 we\u2019ve had a new book by or about him: first came the posthumously published novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/12/silverview-by-john-le-carre-review-the-last-complete-masterwork\">Silverview</a></em>, then an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/oct/16/a-private-spy-letters-of-john-le-carre-edited-by-tim-cornwell-the-secret-heart-by-suleika-dawson-review-john-le-carre-laid-bare\">edition of his letters</a>, as well as a memoir by his lover Sue \u201cSuleika\u201d Dawson (<em>The Secret Heart</em>), before last year\u2019s follow-up expos\u00e9 by his biographer Adam Sisman, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/15/the-secret-life-of-john-le-carre-by-adam-sisman-review\">The Secret Life of John le Carr\u00e9</a>,</em> documenting other lovers the espionage writer hadn\u2019t wanted mentioned in his lifetime.</p> <p>Considering the drift of those books, it\u2019s maybe unsurprising if we\u2019ve lost sight of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s achievements as a novelist, especially in his early years. His first big hit, <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em> (1963), which mapped a thwarted romance on to geopolitical intrigue in divided Berlin, accelerated the spy genre\u2019s 20th-century breakaway from jingoistic tub-thumping and gung-ho adventure. By the time of <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em> (1974), an ensemble psychodrama in which the British plot against one another as much as against the Soviets, le Carr\u00e9\u2019s narrative energy is generated more by gnarly workplace tensions rather than conventional derring-do, which is nonetheless tinglingly present in the book\u2019s shattering finale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/14/john-le-carre-obituary\">John le Carr\u00e9 obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Karla\u2019s Choice</em>, perhaps the most intriguing of the le Carr\u00e9-related publications to have appeared since his death, puts these achievements front and centre. Set after <em>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</em> but before <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>, it\u2019s a new mission for the spymaster George Smiley, from the pen of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s son, novelist Nick Harkaway, who makes clear that while this might have been a book he was born to write, it was far from easy. He describes sending the manuscript to the author Joe Hill, Stephen King\u2019s son, \u201cone of the few people on Earth who can claim to understand the scale of my fear around this book\u201d, and the extent to which it\u2019s a family affair supplies an off-page frisson that he doesn\u2019t shy away from in a winning foreword. (Will the book succeed? \u201cWe\u2019re about to find out.\u201d)</p> <p>Set in 1963, it centres on a vanished Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, B\u00e1n\u00e1ti, a Soviet spy whose cover as a London literary agent has been blown after a failed attempt on his life by a Moscow assassin. When the incident rings alarm bells at the Circus \u2013 le Carr\u00e9\u2019s fictionalised MI6 \u2013 it drags Smiley out of retirement (not for the first time, as we know) in an effort to turn B\u00e1n\u00e1ti into a British asset. The attempt \u2013 unsurprisingly unsmooth \u2013 involves a German double agent previously seen orchestrating a climactic double murder in <em>The Spy Who Came </em><em>in </em><em>from the Cold</em>, as well as \u2013 no spoiler this, given the title \u2013 Karla, the codenamed Russian infiltrator first seen in <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Slow-burn tension give way to agonising jeopardy as cat-and-mouse games explode into crunching hand-to-hand combat or street gun battles </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In true le Carr\u00e9 style, though, Karla only appears here two-thirds of the way in; Harkaway faithfully reproduces his father\u2019s rhythms at the level of sentence and plot alike, with slow-burn tension giving way to agonising jeopardy as cat-and-mouse games explode into crunching hand-to-hand combat or street gun battles. There\u2019s a grippingly cinematic escape scene set in Budapest, as well as a lapel-grabbing speech about \u201cthe English mistake\u201d (geopolitical ignorance, essentially). And of course there\u2019s the jargon of the spy trade \u2013 \u201chandwriting\u201d, \u201cbabysitters\u201d, \u201cproduct\u201d \u2013 and lessons in what it takes to succeed: someone mentions training in a dormitory with \u201ca hundred different kinds of lavatory\u201d (\u201cnothing... more likely to blow your cover than an inability to contend with bathroom facilities you supposedly had been using from birth\u201d). Dry comedy ripples throughout: one Soviet spy, asked his price for defecting, says he wants to star in a film with Peter Sellers.</p> <p>There\u2019s clearly an attempt to broaden the horizons of the original books \u2013 in any case, hardly so exclusively masculine as sometimes portrayed \u2013 but Harkaway misses no chance to bring the women of the Circus closer to the spotlight. Much of the action involves B\u00e1n\u00e1ti\u2019s employee, Susanna, another Hungarian, who is his assistant at the literary agency, left to pick up the pieces after his disappearance. As Smiley draws her into the plot to turn her former boss, she learns the ropes of spycraft \u2013 a neat way to avoid clunky exposition for the reader coming to le Carr\u00e9\u2019s world for the first time. Nor is Harkaway quite so reliant on delivering plot twists via Conradian nested monologues involving recollected interrogations or minutes and reports, a staple of the original Smiley novels. (Don\u2019t fret, though, those are still here \u2013 expertly negotiated \u2013 to say nothing of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s occasionally reader-foxing tic of referring to the same character by both name and surname, seemingly at random.)</p> <p>For fans, there\u2019s much to enjoy. The collegiality witnessed here among the Circus crew \u2013 Toby Esterhase, Jim Prideaux, Bill Haydon and co \u2013 oozes pathos in view of the in-fighting and paranoia to come in <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>; ditto the agonising scene in which Smiley tries to make amends for missing a holiday with his wife by surprising her in Vienna, only to be told by the concierge at her hotel that she\u2019s busy with her husband \u2013 a sign of further torment ahead. You needn\u2019t be a le Carr\u00e9 nut to enjoy it, though, and while we\u2019re undoubtedly in something of a glut of sequels and reboots, it\u2019s far from unimaginative fan service. A loving tribute to a complicated father (as Harkaway\u2019s dedication seems to acknowledge) as well as an excellent novel in its own right, and only the first of a new series, at least to judge from a broad hint dropped in the end matter. I can\u2019t wait.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Karla\u2019s Choice: A John le Carr\u00e9 Novel</em> by Nick Harkaway is published by Viking (\u00a322).

      "bodyText": "Autumn now seems officially to be John le Carr\u00e9 season, given that this is the fourth year running since the author\u2019s death in 2020 we\u2019ve had a new book by or about him: first came the posthumously published novel Silverview, then an edition of his letters, as well as a memoir by his lover Sue \u201cSuleika\u201d Dawson (The Secret Heart), before last year\u2019s follow-up expos\u00e9 by his biographer Adam Sisman, The Secret Life of John le Carr\u00e9, documenting other lovers the espionage writer hadn\u2019t wanted mentioned in his lifetime. Considering the drift of those books, it\u2019s maybe unsurprising if we\u2019ve lost sight of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s achievements as a novelist, especially in his early years. His first big hit, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963), which mapped a thwarted romance on to geopolitical intrigue in divided Berlin, accelerated the spy genre\u2019s 20th-century breakaway from jingoistic tub-thumping and gung-ho adventure. By the time of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1974), an ensemble psychodrama in which the British plot against one another as much as against the Soviets, le Carr\u00e9\u2019s narrative energy is generated more by gnarly workplace tensions rather than conventional derring-do, which is nonetheless tinglingly present in the book\u2019s shattering finale. Karla\u2019s Choice, perhaps the most intriguing of the le Carr\u00e9-related publications to have appeared since his death, puts these achievements front and centre. Set after The Spy Who Came in from the Cold but before Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, it\u2019s a new mission for the spymaster George Smiley, from the pen of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s son, novelist Nick Harkaway, who makes clear that while this might have been a book he was born to write, it was far from easy. He describes sending the manuscript to the author Joe Hill, Stephen King\u2019s son, \u201cone of the few people on Earth who can claim to understand the scale of my fear around this book\u201d, and the extent to which it\u2019s a family affair supplies an off-page frisson that he doesn\u2019t shy away from in a winning foreword. (Will the book succeed? \u201cWe\u2019re about to find out.\u201d) Set in 1963, it centres on a vanished Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9, B\u00e1n\u00e1ti, a Soviet spy whose cover as a London literary agent has been blown after a failed attempt on his life by a Moscow assassin. When the incident rings alarm bells at the Circus \u2013 le Carr\u00e9\u2019s fictionalised MI6 \u2013 it drags Smiley out of retirement (not for the first time, as we know) in an effort to turn B\u00e1n\u00e1ti into a British asset. The attempt \u2013 unsurprisingly unsmooth \u2013 involves a German double agent previously seen orchestrating a climactic double murder in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, as well as \u2013 no spoiler this, given the title \u2013 Karla, the codenamed Russian infiltrator first seen in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. In true le Carr\u00e9 style, though, Karla only appears here two-thirds of the way in; Harkaway faithfully reproduces his father\u2019s rhythms at the level of sentence and plot alike, with slow-burn tension giving way to agonising jeopardy as cat-and-mouse games explode into crunching hand-to-hand combat or street gun battles. There\u2019s a grippingly cinematic escape scene set in Budapest, as well as a lapel-grabbing speech about \u201cthe English mistake\u201d (geopolitical ignorance, essentially). And of course there\u2019s the jargon of the spy trade \u2013 \u201chandwriting\u201d, \u201cbabysitters\u201d, \u201cproduct\u201d \u2013 and lessons in what it takes to succeed: someone mentions training in a dormitory with \u201ca hundred different kinds of lavatory\u201d (\u201cnothing... more likely to blow your cover than an inability to contend with bathroom facilities you supposedly had been using from birth\u201d). Dry comedy ripples throughout: one Soviet spy, asked his price for defecting, says he wants to star in a film with Peter Sellers. There\u2019s clearly an attempt to broaden the horizons of the original books \u2013 in any case, hardly so exclusively masculine as sometimes portrayed \u2013 but Harkaway misses no chance to bring the women of the Circus closer to the spotlight. Much of the action involves B\u00e1n\u00e1ti\u2019s employee, Susanna, another Hungarian, who is his assistant at the literary agency, left to pick up the pieces after his disappearance. As Smiley draws her into the plot to turn her former boss, she learns the ropes of spycraft \u2013 a neat way to avoid clunky exposition for the reader coming to le Carr\u00e9\u2019s world for the first time. Nor is Harkaway quite so reliant on delivering plot twists via Conradian nested monologues involving recollected interrogations or minutes and reports, a staple of the original Smiley novels. (Don\u2019t fret, though, those are still here \u2013 expertly negotiated \u2013 to say nothing of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s occasionally reader-foxing tic of referring to the same character by both name and surname, seemingly at random.) For fans, there\u2019s much to enjoy. The collegiality witnessed here among the Circus crew \u2013 Toby Esterhase, Jim Prideaux, Bill Haydon and co \u2013 oozes pathos in view of the in-fighting and paranoia to come in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; ditto the agonising scene in which Smiley tries to make amends for missing a holiday with his wife by surprising her in Vienna, only to be told by the concierge at her hotel that she\u2019s busy with her husband \u2013 a sign of further torment ahead. You needn\u2019t be a le Carr\u00e9 nut to enjoy it, though, and while we\u2019re undoubtedly in something of a glut of sequels and reboots, it\u2019s far from unimaginative fan service. A loving tribute to a complicated father (as Harkaway\u2019s dedication seems to acknowledge) as well as an excellent novel in its own right, and only the first of a new series, at least to judge from a broad hint dropped in the end matter. I can\u2019t wait. \u2022 Karla\u2019s Choice: A John le Carr\u00e9 Novel by Nick Harkaway is published by Viking (\u00a322).

      "body": "<p>A month before she died, the acclaimed dialect coach Joan Washington recorded a poem to be played on her daughter\u2019s wedding day. Washington died on 2 September 2021 from lung cancer, concluding a 38-year marriage to the actor and diarist Richard E Grant. Olivia, the couple\u2019s daughter, celebrated her marriage this past September at the house Grant and Washington shared in London. Grant wore an elegant tuxedo, his blue eyes startling, and the house was swollen with flowers. His speech included \u201call the things a father says. You want it to be as humorous and as heartfelt as possible, in that combination, so people aren\u2019t stabbing themselves with their forks.\u201d But the family couldn\u2019t bring themselves to play Washington\u2019s recording: \u201cIt would have wiped everybody out.\u201d The event, with Washington absent, was bittersweet. \u201cThat\u2019s the brutal bit,\u201d Grant goes on. \u201cYou so want to share that with her,\u201d and then, referring to Olivia, \u201cNot having her mum there\u2026\u201d He trails off.</p> <p>Grant and I are meeting at a hotel in Richmond, a brisk uphill walk from his home. He has arrived punctually, impeccably clothed and groomed, with a watch on each wrist, his dark hair greying slightly now at 67 years old. Olivia\u2019s celebrations are fresh in his memory. In the end, someone close to the family read Washington\u2019s selected poem. Olivia was supported by, among others, three women in the congregation, all good friends of Grant\u2019s, who have \u201cappointed themselves her fairy godmothers, like something from <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>.\u201d The thought seems to cheer him. \u201cThey took her to buy her wedding dress. They took her to lunch. They\u2019ve offered themselves up as mother mentors\u2026\u201d He shrugs in astonishment.</p>    <p>I ask who they are. </p> <p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will sound <em>name-droppy</em>.\u201d</p> <p>This is at odds with the man I was expecting to meet. Grant has been one of the UK\u2019s best-loved actors since 1987, when he appeared as a perpetually drunk out-of-work actor in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/withnail-i\">Withnail and I</a></em>. But since Washington\u2019s death he has become almost as well-known for sharing, with remarkable candour, across <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/richard.e.grant/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> and in his <a href=\"https://www.richard-e-grant.com/archives/diary/\">diaries</a>, his experience of bereavement and grief. Last year he published <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/26/a-pocketful-of-happiness-by-richard-e-grant-review-tigger-and-his-one-true-love\">A Pocketful of Happiness</a></em>, a memoir that charts Washington\u2019s illness. The book is named for an instruction Washington gave to Grant while she was unwell: to look for moments of joy in the everyday, a sudden downpour, the changing of the seasons, the ability to run gleefully alongside a river. In it are the gritty, sometimes banal details of terminal illness: the scans, the diagnoses, the sharing of diagnoses with friends, the slow and desperate descent into loss. And yet mixed with all the bad news is Grant\u2019s other life, that of an actor still active in Hollywood, taking meetings, conducting an impromptu Oscar campaign, having dinner with well-known friends. The book is as name-droppy as a celebrity diary could get, in exactly the way readers would hope for. And it, too, is bittersweet.</p> <p>In person, Grant is charming and strikingly open and quick to laugh \u2013 entertaining company, even while discussing loss. </p> <p>I ask how his grief has changed over the past three years. </p> <p>\u201cI suppose you get used to the unreality of not having that person there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found so difficult is not having her to download to, to download everything that has happened in my day.\u201d When Washington was becoming ill, beginning to prefer solitude over parties, Grant began to feel increasingly isolated. A psychotherapist suggested he was suffering withdrawal symptoms \u2013 the illness was slowly extracting Washington from his life. \u201cThis platitude that \u2018time heals\u2019\u2026\u201d he goes on, but the thought seems to vanish briefly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it does. I think you navigate your way around it. You never get over it.

When you\u2019ve gone through a bereavement, you think: it\u2019s just another job, it will pass. You become more third eye. Things have less impact on you.

You think, \u2018My God, am I going to be fired today?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask if he can recall something that might have bothered him five years ago that no longer bothers him now. \u201cThere\u2019s always one person on a job who drives everybody crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for you. I would come home and have a rant about what this person was doing. But now, because I don\u2019t have somebody to rant to, it\u2019s forced me to, I suppose, take a step back. I think: it really doesn\u2019t matter, in the scheme of things. Which I know is a <em>terrible</em> clich\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Grant grew up in </strong></em><em><strong>Swaziland,</strong></em> now Eswatini, as part of an expat society trapped in the dying breaths of empire. He arrived in London in 1982, hoping to become an actor. In his diaries he writes frequently about his ambition at the time, a great drive to play a role in the world. Partway through our meeting, I ask if he\u2019s as ambitious as he once was. \u201cOh, I think that if you\u2019re a son of a narcissist, it is probably the greatest motivation to keep that ambition alive,\u201d he says. He is referring to his mother, Leonne Esterhuysen. \u201cShe died a year ago, she was 93, and she withheld approval right up until her last breath. The lifelong habit to prove yourself to somebody, that doesn\u2019t go away just because the person\u2019s died\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people who have had more stable upbringings than I had who are less driven, less ambitious. The drive comes as a result of trying to prove wrong all the people I grew up with \u2013 who mocked the notion of me becoming a professional actor.\u201d</p>    <p>Grant\u2019s father Henrik was Swaziland\u2019s head of education. His mother was a homemaker. Grant describes his upbringing as \u201cunrestricted\u201d. Among adults there was \u201ca laxity, maybe, in the moral compass,\u201d he says, because it felt a little like everyone was on holiday. He describes the expat life as centring on \u201cthe three \u2018B\u2019s: boredom, booze and bonking.\u201d When Grant was 10, he awoke from a nap to find his mother having sex with his father\u2019s best friend \u2013 they were all together in a car. \u201cSaw my mother bonking,\u201d is how he puts it to me. Grant kept the discovery to himself. When the pressure of his silence became too much, he let the secret spill out into the diary he has kept ever since.</p> <p>A year later, Grant\u2019s parents divorced. He sided with his father, the cuckolded party, and became estranged from his mother, who eventually moved to South Africa. Soon afterward, Grant\u2019s father fell into alcoholism, and he became verbally and physically abusive. \u201cMy father hadn\u2019t been a heavy drinker before then,\u201d he says, \u201cbut once she left, he drank a bottle of Johnnie Walker scotch daily until he died \u2013 the next 30 years.\u201d At work, Grant\u2019s father would be \u201ccharming, erudite, funny, a very engaged person\u201d. At home he would become \u201can unrecognisable monster\u201d.</p> <p>Grant believes that his childhood ended when his parents divorced, when he was 11. \u201cI was having to parent my parent,\u201d he says, \u201con a nightly basis.\u201d</p> <p>I ask what that involved, exactly. </p> <p>\u201cTrying to get him into bed. Getting out of the way when he got violent. Answering the phone and lying to people. Saying, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s in the bath\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s not back from work\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s gone out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Once, Grant had the idea to fix his father\u2019s alcoholism by pouring his drink \u2013 12 or so bottles of scotch \u2013 down the drain. His father walked in on the attempt and brought a gun to the back of Grant\u2019s head. Grant ducked and escaped into the garden, where his father eventually found him, and took a shot. The bullet missed, only because, Grant thinks, his father was already drunk.</p> <p>While Grant recalls this story he seems unfazed. \u201cIt was the one and only time he had a gun to my head,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that night was a kind of watershed moment for him.\u201d His father had remarried by this time, and Grant believes his stepmother removed the gun from the home. \u201cBut the drinking continued.\u201d</p> <p>When I call these events abuse, he smiles, and I ask why. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so long ago now. And if you know that as the norm of your adolescence\u2026 It\u2019s relative to somebody who\u2019s been held in a cellar for 10 years and impregnated by an incestuous father. What I had is not that.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if the word \u201cabuse\u201d seems overblown.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think it has become a word that in the current conversation is applied to everything. Somebody can say a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 has been abusive towards me, my boss has been abusive. There are so many variations.\u201d</p> <p>In his diaries, Grant writes with great fondness about his father. He recalls watching his name appear on the end credits of <em>Withnail and I</em> and feeling the overwhelming desire for his father to have witnessed his success. His father, who once described Grant as \u201can overwound clock\u201d because of his remarkable energy, had worried his son was escaping Swaziland to \u201clive a life wearing makeup and tights and narrowly avoiding buggery,\u201d Grant says. \u201cHis abiding terror was that I would become destitute.\u201d</p>    <p>He goes on, \u201cI loved and adored him. Who he became when he was drunk was not who he was. If he\u2019d been like that all day long, I would have run away. But he was so filled with remorse, it was clear that the alcoholism was something he had difficulty controlling.\u201d Grant supported him until he died, in 1981. \u201cHe had been cuckolded and robbed. And I saw first-hand the cost of what that did to him.\u201d On his deathbed, his father had whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped loving your mother.\u201d</p> <p>In 1999, aged 42, Grant experienced a kind of nervous breakdown. \u201cI was angry and unhappy with my life and career,\u201d he has written, and \u201cbecame convinced I was paralysed.\u201d (Grant\u2019s father was also 42 when the divorce occurred.) Worried for her husband, Washington called Steve Martin, a longtime friend, who passed on the name of an analyst who convinced Grant to reconcile with his mother. \u201cIt took 18 months,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we had a conversation in which she finally said three magic words: \u2018Please forgive me.\u2019\u201d It was the first time Grant had revealed to his mother what he had witnessed in the car. \u201cAnd she cried, which I\u2019d never seen her do before.\u201d The conversation was the \u201cgreatest epiphany\u201d of Grant\u2019s life. \u201cI went from holding on to resentment and anger towards someone to forgiving them, and all of the pain shifted instantaneously.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, Grant came to the conclusion that all secrets are toxic, and that laying bare his life could become a therapeutic act. \u201cMy thinking went, if you\u2019re open about everything, it can feel like protection. What can somebody say to you? What\u2019s the worst that can happen? You can\u2019t be wrongfooted. If somebody\u2019s going to take a pot-shot at you, you think, \u2018Well, OK, go ahead, I\u2019m not hiding anything.\u2019\u201d He gives this as the reason for publishing his diaries, and for sharing frank moments of happiness on Instagram, where he has amassed several hundred thousand followers. If his life is already made public, there is no reason for people to come looking for more.</p> <p>When Washington first became unwell, she asked Grant and their daughter not to share the news with friends. \u201cWe argued about it,\u201d Grant says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t speak to us for two days.\u201d Grant felt obliged to, and he worried the lying would become too much. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to being 11 years old, having to say, \u2018Oh, no, dad\u2019s at work,\u2019 or \u2018Sorry, Joan\u2019s not available.\u2019\u201d When they did announce the news, Washington \u201cexperienced an avalanche of generosity and love, and she apologised.\u201d Grant shrugs a beautiful, mournful shrug. \u201cShe said, \u2018OK, I see the value in this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><em>The Franchise starts on Monday on Sky Comedy and NOW</em></p> <p><em>Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Dani Guinsberg using Daimon Barber Haircare &amp; Facetheory Skincare; fashion assistant Sam Deaman; photographer\u2019s assistant Tom Frimley; digital tech by Claudia Gschwend; shot on location at The Petersham Hotel</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A month before she died, the acclaimed dialect coach Joan Washington recorded a poem to be played on her daughter\u2019s wedding day. Washington died on 2 September 2021 from lung cancer, concluding a 38-year marriage to the actor and diarist Richard E Grant. Olivia, the couple\u2019s daughter, celebrated her marriage this past September at the house Grant and Washington shared in London. Grant wore an elegant tuxedo, his blue eyes startling, and the house was swollen with flowers. His speech included \u201call the things a father says. You want it to be as humorous and as heartfelt as possible, in that combination, so people aren\u2019t stabbing themselves with their forks.\u201d But the family couldn\u2019t bring themselves to play Washington\u2019s recording: \u201cIt would have wiped everybody out.\u201d The event, with Washington absent, was bittersweet. \u201cThat\u2019s the brutal bit,\u201d Grant goes on. \u201cYou so want to share that with her,\u201d and then, referring to Olivia, \u201cNot having her mum there\u2026\u201d He trails off. Grant and I are meeting at a hotel in Richmond, a brisk uphill walk from his home. He has arrived punctually, impeccably clothed and groomed, with a watch on each wrist, his dark hair greying slightly now at 67 years old. Olivia\u2019s celebrations are fresh in his memory. In the end, someone close to the family read Washington\u2019s selected poem. Olivia was supported by, among others, three women in the congregation, all good friends of Grant\u2019s, who have \u201cappointed themselves her fairy godmothers, like something from Sleeping Beauty.\u201d The thought seems to cheer him. \u201cThey took her to buy her wedding dress. They took her to lunch. They\u2019ve offered themselves up as mother mentors\u2026\u201d He shrugs in astonishment. I ask who they are. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will sound name-droppy.\u201d This is at odds with the man I was expecting to meet. Grant has been one of the UK\u2019s best-loved actors since 1987, when he appeared as a perpetually drunk out-of-work actor in Withnail and I. But since Washington\u2019s death he has become almost as well-known for sharing, with remarkable candour, across Instagram and in his diaries, his experience of bereavement and grief. Last year he published A Pocketful of Happiness, a memoir that charts Washington\u2019s illness. The book is named for an instruction Washington gave to Grant while she was unwell: to look for moments of joy in the everyday, a sudden downpour, the changing of the seasons, the ability to run gleefully alongside a river. In it are the gritty, sometimes banal details of terminal illness: the scans, the diagnoses, the sharing of diagnoses with friends, the slow and desperate descent into loss. And yet mixed with all the bad news is Grant\u2019s other life, that of an actor still active in Hollywood, taking meetings, conducting an impromptu Oscar campaign, having dinner with well-known friends. The book is as name-droppy as a celebrity diary could get, in exactly the way readers would hope for. And it, too, is bittersweet. In person, Grant is charming and strikingly open and quick to laugh \u2013 entertaining company, even while discussing loss. I ask how his grief has changed over the past three years. \u201cI suppose you get used to the unreality of not having that person there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found so difficult is not having her to download to, to download everything that has happened in my day.\u201d When Washington was becoming ill, beginning to prefer solitude over parties, Grant began to feel increasingly isolated. A psychotherapist suggested he was suffering withdrawal symptoms \u2013 the illness was slowly extracting Washington from his life. \u201cThis platitude that \u2018time heals\u2019\u2026\u201d he goes on, but the thought seems to vanish briefly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it does. I think you navigate your way around it. You never get over it. And I\u2019m not actively trying to get over it, either.\u201d I ask what has helped. \u201cI write to her every night,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you write?\u201d I ask. \u201cEverything,\u201d he says. \u201cStuff I know would amuse her.\u201d He looks at me steadily. \u201cI\u2019ll describe what you look like. What you\u2019re wearing. How old you are. Do you have kids. All of that. She would want to know what your accent is, because that was her speciality. She would ask, \u2018What did Alex sound like? What is the shape of his mouth? Does it open when he talks?\u2019\u201d The questions hang between us for a moment. \u201cI have no spiritual or religious delusion that I\u2019m ever going to get a reply. But after 38 years of marriage, I can hear what her response would be. It feels as close a connection as I can have. And I\u2019ve found it very hopeful, that at the end of the day I\u2019m having a conversation.\u201d Grant and Washington met in 1983 when he, a mostly out- of-work actor, convinced her, an established professional, to give him private dialect lessons despite not having enough money.

Grant has written that his marriage is \u201cthe story of my adult life\u201d and that \u201cwe began a conversation in 1983 and we never stopped.\u201d When I bring this up he says, \u201cWell, it officially ended,\u201d and then: \u201cThe ongoing conversation is now in written form.\u201d Grant believes discussion was the bedrock of his marriage. \u201cThe physical intimacy\u2026\u201d he begins. \u201cEven if you\u2019re in five hours of tantric sex with someone, it\u2019s relative to the amount of time in your day \u2013 it\u2019s a very small amount of time.

This idea seems to diminish his ability and range as an actor: he was Oscar-nominated in 2019 for Can You Ever Forgive Me; he stole the show in Emerald Fennell\u2019s Saltburn; he has appeared in some of the UK\u2019s greatest comedies and dramas and comedy-dramas, including How To Get Ahead in Advertising (1989), in which he sometimes wears on his neck a boil in the shape of a second face. But Grant agrees with Washington\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe way my career has gone, the majority of things I\u2019ve done have been supporting roles, which puts you very much in the flavour department,\u201d he says. This is true of Grant\u2019s latest project, The Franchise, a TV series in which he plays a poison-tongued actor making his way through the filming of a superhero movie \u2013 a role perfect in its intermittent impact. When we meet, Grant has yet to see a finished episode. But he trusts its writers, Armando Iannucci and Jon Browne, and the series director, Sam Mendes, none of whom he\u2019d worked with previously. \u201cI\u2019d met Sam before. And Armando.

He arrived in London in 1982, hoping to become an actor. In his diaries he writes frequently about his ambition at the time, a great drive to play a role in the world. Partway through our meeting, I ask if he\u2019s as ambitious as he once was. \u201cOh, I think that if you\u2019re a son of a narcissist, it is probably the greatest motivation to keep that ambition alive,\u201d he says. He is referring to his mother, Leonne Esterhuysen. \u201cShe died a year ago, she was 93, and she withheld approval right up until her last breath. The lifelong habit to prove yourself to somebody, that doesn\u2019t go away just because the person\u2019s died\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people who have had more stable upbringings than I had who are less driven, less ambitious. The drive comes as a result of trying to prove wrong all the people I grew up with \u2013 who mocked the notion of me becoming a professional actor.\u201d Grant\u2019s father Henrik was Swaziland\u2019s head of education. His mother was a homemaker. Grant describes his upbringing as \u201cunrestricted\u201d. Among adults there was \u201ca laxity, maybe, in the moral compass,\u201d he says, because it felt a little like everyone was on holiday. He describes the expat life as centring on \u201cthe three \u2018B\u2019s: boredom, booze and bonking.\u201d When Grant was 10, he awoke from a nap to find his mother having sex with his father\u2019s best friend \u2013 they were all together in a car. \u201cSaw my mother bonking,\u201d is how he puts it to me. Grant kept the discovery to himself. When the pressure of his silence became too much, he let the secret spill out into the diary he has kept ever since. A year later, Grant\u2019s parents divorced. He sided with his father, the cuckolded party, and became estranged from his mother, who eventually moved to South Africa. Soon afterward, Grant\u2019s father fell into alcoholism, and he became verbally and physically abusive. \u201cMy father hadn\u2019t been a heavy drinker before then,\u201d he says, \u201cbut once she left, he drank a bottle of Johnnie Walker scotch daily until he died \u2013 the next 30 years.\u201d At work, Grant\u2019s father would be \u201ccharming, erudite, funny, a very engaged person\u201d. At home he would become \u201can unrecognisable monster\u201d. Grant believes that his childhood ended when his parents divorced, when he was 11. \u201cI was having to parent my parent,\u201d he says, \u201con a nightly basis.\u201d I ask what that involved, exactly. \u201cTrying to get him into bed. Getting out of the way when he got violent. Answering the phone and lying to people. Saying, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s in the bath\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s not back from work\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s gone out.\u2019\u201d Once, Grant had the idea to fix his father\u2019s alcoholism by pouring his drink \u2013 12 or so bottles of scotch \u2013 down the drain. His father walked in on the attempt and brought a gun to the back of Grant\u2019s head. Grant ducked and escaped into the garden, where his father eventually found him, and took a shot. The bullet missed, only because, Grant thinks, his father was already drunk. While Grant recalls this story he seems unfazed. \u201cIt was the one and only time he had a gun to my head,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that night was a kind of watershed moment for him.\u201d His father had remarried by this time, and Grant believes his stepmother removed the gun from the home. \u201cBut the drinking continued.\u201d When I call these events abuse, he smiles, and I ask why. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so long ago now. And if you know that as the norm of your adolescence\u2026 It\u2019s relative to somebody who\u2019s been held in a cellar for 10 years and impregnated by an incestuous father. What I had is not that.\u201d I ask if the word \u201cabuse\u201d seems overblown. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think it has become a word that in the current conversation is applied to everything. Somebody can say a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 has been abusive towards me, my boss has been abusive. There are so many variations.\u201d In his diaries, Grant writes with great fondness about his father. He recalls watching his name appear on the end credits of Withnail and I and feeling the overwhelming desire for his father to have witnessed his success. His father, who once described Grant as \u201can overwound clock\u201d because of his remarkable energy, had worried his son was escaping Swaziland to \u201clive a life wearing makeup and tights and narrowly avoiding buggery,\u201d Grant says. \u201cHis abiding terror was that I would become destitute.\u201d He goes on, \u201cI loved and adored him. Who he became when he was drunk was not who he was. If he\u2019d been like that all day long, I would have run away. But he was so filled with remorse, it was clear that the alcoholism was something he had difficulty controlling.\u201d Grant supported him until he died, in 1981. \u201cHe had been cuckolded and robbed. And I saw first-hand the cost of what that did to him.\u201d On his deathbed, his father had whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve never stopped loving your mother.\u201d In 1999, aged 42, Grant experienced a kind of nervous breakdown. \u201cI was angry and unhappy with my life and career,\u201d he has written, and \u201cbecame convinced I was paralysed.\u201d (Grant\u2019s father was also 42 when the divorce occurred.) Worried for her husband, Washington called Steve Martin, a longtime friend, who passed on the name of an analyst who convinced Grant to reconcile with his mother. \u201cIt took 18 months,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we had a conversation in which she finally said three magic words: \u2018Please forgive me.\u2019\u201d It was the first time Grant had revealed to his mother what he had witnessed in the car. \u201cAnd she cried, which I\u2019d never seen her do before.\u201d The conversation was the \u201cgreatest epiphany\u201d of Grant\u2019s life. \u201cI went from holding on to resentment and anger towards someone to forgiving them, and all of the pain shifted instantaneously.\u201d Around this time, Grant came to the conclusion that all secrets are toxic, and that laying bare his life could become a therapeutic act. \u201cMy thinking went, if you\u2019re open about everything, it can feel like protection. What can somebody say to you? What\u2019s the worst that can happen? You can\u2019t be wrongfooted. If somebody\u2019s going to take a pot-shot at you, you think, \u2018Well, OK, go ahead, I\u2019m not hiding anything.\u2019\u201d He gives this as the reason for publishing his diaries, and for sharing frank moments of happiness on Instagram, where he has amassed several hundred thousand followers. If his life is already made public, there is no reason for people to come looking for more. When Washington first became unwell, she asked Grant and their daughter not to share the news with friends. \u201cWe argued about it,\u201d Grant says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t speak to us for two days.\u201d Grant felt obliged to, and he worried the lying would become too much. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to being 11 years old, having to say, \u2018Oh, no, dad\u2019s at work,\u2019 or \u2018Sorry, Joan\u2019s not available.\u2019\u201d When they did announce the news, Washington \u201cexperienced an avalanche of generosity and love, and she apologised.\u201d Grant shrugs a beautiful, mournful shrug. \u201cShe said, \u2018OK, I see the value in this.\u2019\u201d The Franchise starts on Monday on Sky Comedy and NOW Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Dani Guinsberg using Daimon Barber Haircare &amp; Facetheory Skincare; fashion assistant Sam Deaman; photographer\u2019s assistant Tom Frimley; digital tech by Claudia Gschwend; shot on location at The Petersham Hotel",

Before we go, here are the major stories from Sunday: King Charles and Queen Camilla have made their first appearance on their visit to Australia, attending a Sydney church; The Queensland LNP has officially launched its election campaign, with the family of a stabbing victim helping to open the event; The Queensland opposition leader promised to introduce mandatory isolation periods for children in youth detention if they assault guards; In his first address since landing in Australia, King Charles praised democracy and the legacy of governmental process in a speech to NSW parliament; Labor senator Murray Watt dismissed the federal Coalition\u2019s proposal to remove housing efficiency regulations to speed up development as a \u201croad to nowhere\u201d. Jane Hume has backed in Peter Dutton over an exchange with an ABC journalist where the leader of the opposition accused the ABC of being \u201cactivist\u201d. We\u2019ll pick things up again tomorrow. Tasmania\u2019s government has promised to maintain the state\u2019s momentum after reshuffling cabinet after the departure of two ministers in the space of a week. The premier, Jeremy Rockliff, announced on Sunday the return of former minister Jacquie Petrusma and the addition of former Sorell mayor Kerry Vincent, in changes forced by the resignations of his deputy and then finance minister. As the government approaches the 200-day mark since being elected \u2026 I am confident that the refreshed cabinet will keep Tasmania moving forward. When asked during the announcement whether a reshuffle so early in a parliamentary term will mean certainty, Rockliff said: \u201cIt\u2019s an indication that we\u2019re getting on with the job.\u201d Petrusma will be given the health, veterans\u2019 affairs and Aboriginal affairs portfolios, the latter of which she has previously held, while Vincent will become minister for infrastructure and local government. Michael Ferguson resigned as deputy premier and treasurer on Monday as pressure mounted due to his oversight of delays and cost blowouts in the delivery of new $900m Spirit of Tasmania ferries. The already unsteady minority government was rocked again on Friday when Nic Street said he would be leaving his ministerial position after facing mental health struggles. He was the minister for finance, local government, and sport and events. The premier\u2019s portfolio has been halved in the reshuffle, with the infrastructure portfolio given to Vincent and the small business and consumer affairs portfolio handed to Felix Ellis. Guy Barnett, who took up the role of deputy premier the day after Ferguson resigned, adds treasurer to his job description while retaining the roles of attorney-general and justice minister. The new fiscal portfolio could offer a significant challenge to the Treasurer after the state budget forecast net debt more than doubling to $8.6bn in 2027/28. Asked about balancing the roles, Barnett told journalists he was \u201cvery confident\u201d and does not \u201cmind hard work\u201d. \u2013 AAP New Zealand is experiencing never-before-seen levels of emigration, with a large number of Kiwis heading for Australia. In the year to August, Stats NZ reports a record 134,000 people migrated from New Zealand. In the year before, 115,000 did so, meaning a quarter of a million people, or almost 5% of the population, have left in the past two years. New Zealand saw 188,800 migrant arrivals in the year to August 2024 (down 17% on the same period in 2023) meaning net migration was a gain of 53,800 people. The ABS holds data on the number of NZ citizens moving to Australia, which is running at the highest level in over a decade. In the year to March, about 47,000 made the move, for a net loss of almost 30,000. This is largely viewed a function of New Zealand\u2019s post-pandemic economic malaise, in and out of recession for two years. However, privately, some New Zealand leaders hold concerns Australia\u2019s open door is exacerbating the brain drain. The finance minister, Nicola Willis, has sought to blame the country\u2019s previous Labour government for the situation. It\u2019s a reflection of the situation the country was left in after six years of a Labour government. We had an economy that had a dire cost-of-living crisis, inflation out of control, interest rates had skyrocketed, and that has had a punishing effect on the economy. The opposition leader, Chris Hipkins, meanwhile, says emigration is a \u201cvote of no confidence in the current government\u201d. In the building and construction sector we are seeing an exodus of talent, there 10,000 fewer jobs in that sector now than \u2026 just one year ago. A lot of those people are highly skilled people who are in demand around the world so they\u2019ve jumped on a plane and they\u2019ve got other work. \u2013 AAP Residents in nuclear target areas mixed on Coalition plan to replace coal-fired power plants Some nights, when the wind blows from the east, Yvonne Johnstone goes to sleep to the hum of the Tarong power station. Occasionally, she finds ash from the coal-fired plant scattered among the vegetables and fruit trees of her five-acre block. \u201cIt forms a ring,\u201d she says. As if it\u2019s gone up in a cloud and then fallen. Johnstone doesn\u2019t think twice about it \u2013 but what of federal opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s proposal to build a nuclear reactor within cooee of her smartly painted, corrugated iron home? Dutton and the Coalition\u2019s proposal is to build seven nuclear power plants across Australia along with two proposed small modular reactors. The opposition wants them in Tarong and Callide in Queensland; Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales; Collie in Western Australia; Loy Yang in Victoria; and the former site of the Northern power station in Port Paterson, South Australia. The sites are mostly in Coalition seats. The Queensland LNP\u2019s leader, David Crisafulli, facing an election, has been steadfast in his defiance of Dutton\u2019s plan for the Queensland sites. He says he would oppose them if elected at the 26 October poll and has repeatedly ruled out repealing the state\u2019s nuclear ban under any circumstances. But Dutton, a fellow Queenslander, has previously suggested overriding state legislation. \u201cWhen you hear nuclear, of course you start to panic,\u201d Johnstone, a retired biscuit factory worker, says. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that they can\u2019t just have something that dangerous in a suburb. I\u2019m a person that buries her head in the sand, I suppose, and gets on with what I want to do. For more on this story, read the full feature story by Guardian Australia\u2019s Joe Hinchliffe: Independent senator David Pocock has been buoyed by the outcome of the ACT election, which rewarded independent candidates over the traditional parties. Pocock said that the swings away from the major parties in the ACT and NSW showed the public had a desire for change. This shows there is a growing, rather than a diminishing, appetite from Australians for people in parliament who are there to directly represent the community, not major parties or vested interests. The finance minister (and former ACT chief minister), Katy Gallagher, meanwhile, said that while Labor had continued its reign in the territory, the outcome showed that people were looking away from the major parties, saying: \u201cIt could continue\u201d. We\u2019re going to have to campaign hard to hold those (Canberra-based) seats and in the Senate as well. There\u2019s a rusted-on Liberal vote in this town. Senator Pocock took Green-Labor votes, he only took a very small percentage of Liberal votes. \u2013 AAP Analysts on the lookout for jobs comments from RBA deputy governor The Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s second-in-command will have an opportunity to opine on a robust jobs readout as anxious borrowers await good news. A fireside chat with RBA deputy governor, Andrew Hauser, is on the agenda at the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s global markets conference on Monday, where he is likely to face questions on the labour market. Any insights into the trajectory for interest rates will be welcomed by stretched borrowers, with hopes for cuts earlier than the February 2025 \u2013 or later \u2013 timeline pencilled in by most economists. The 64,100 jobs added to the economy comfortably beat expectations and the unemployment rate held at 4.1% from a downwardly revised figure in August. September\u2019s inarguably hot labour market figures sparked questions for the inflation outlook and when easing could be expected. \u2013 AAP Auction activity remains stable Auction activity has remained stable this weekend with 2,510 auctions to be held. This is just below the 2,598 held last week and a gain on the 2,463 auctions that occurred at the same time last year. Based on results collected so far, CoreLogic\u2019s summary found that the preliminary clearance rate was 67.5% across the country, which is higher than the 65.7% preliminary rate recorded last week but well above the 60.8% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 713 of 978 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 70.5% Melbourne: 754 of 1069 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 69.2% Brisbane: 170 0f 227 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 47.6% Adelaide: 82 of 145 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 72% Canberra: 45 of 71 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 55.6% Tasmania: One auction to be held. Perth: Seven of 19 auctions held. Stripping Mike Pezzullo of Order of Australia honours should have been more \u2018transparent\u2019, Jane Hume says The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, says the decision to strip an Order of Australia honour from former top bureaucrat, Mike Pezzullo, should be more transparent. Speaking on Sky this morning, Hume said: I feel that perhaps if we\u2019re going to create integrity and trust in the merit system, well, perhaps these decisions should be made transparent. Pezzullo\u2019s appointment as an officer to the Order of Australia was stripped on 26 September 2024, according to a document signed by the official secretary to the governor general, but not publicly available until Thursday. The former home affairs department secretary was sacked in November 2023 after an independent inquiry found he had breached the government\u2019s code of conduct at least 14 times, including for using his power for personal benefit. The inquiry had been probing a series of text messages he had sent to a Liberal party insider in an alleged attempt to influence political processes. On Friday, Pezzullo said the decision to remove his appointment didn\u2019t \u201camount to a hill of beans in this crazy world\u201d. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, told Sky on Sunday the decision was a matter for the Council of the Order of Australia and played no role in it. [Pezzullo] was a long-term, career public servant in Canberra. He did many good things, but this is a matter for the council. They\u2019ve had a look at it, they\u2019ve considered it against their criteria and they made a recommendation to the Governor-General. Royals\u2019 tour of Sydney concludes, heads to Canberra tomorrow King Charles\u2019s formal itinerary has concluded for the day, after a visit with the governor-general, Sam Mostyn, and the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley. Just one photographer and one TV camera were allowed to accompany the king on the reception at Admiralty House \u2013 the official residence of the governor-general in Kirribilli. Locals had their first chance to spot the king outside St Thomas\u2019 Anglican church earlier today, prior to his speech at NSW parliament house. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll be off to Canberra, where there is a packed schedule. The trip will start with an official greeting party with a welcome to country and smoking ceremony, after which he will lay a wreath in the Hall of Memory at the Australian War Memorial. The king and queen will then greet the public on the way to the For our Country memorial, followed by a trip to Parliament House. Later in the afternoon, the royal couple will plant a tree each on the grounds of Government House, and head to the Botanic Gardens where they\u2019ll hear about the impacts of climate change on flora. ABC journalists\u2019 questions to Dutton not biased but \u2018activist\u2019, Hume says Sky host, Andrew Clennell, asked whether Jane Hume would \u201ccaution\u201d the opposition leader over his reaction as the federal election campaign nears. Hume responded: I think that the questions that are being asked of Peter Dutton potentially come from a more activist position, an ideological position, and particularly from the national broadcaster, we would expect a level of balance in not just their reporting, but in the way that the questions are framed. Hume dismissed the suggestion Dutton\u2019s response was related to the journalists\u2019 gender, before saying there would be no cuts to ABC funding. Hume said she didn\u2019t think the ABC journalists were \u201cbiased\u201d but thought \u201cthey were activists\u201d. That\u2019s very different. The opposition finance spokesperson, Jane Hume, has defended Peter Dutton\u2019s recent clashes with ABC journalists, claiming the questions took \u201cactivist\u201d and \u201cideological\u201d approaches. At a press conference in Western Australia on Friday, ABC journalist Bridget McArthur asked how the opposition leader could claim there was wide support for a nuclear reactor in Collie, a town in the state\u2019s south-west. Dutton responded: \u201cHow do you know that they don\u2019t [support it]?\u201d The journalist said she had spoken to a number of people in Collie while adding she hadn\u2019t seen Dutton speak to a \u201csingle member of the public\u201d. Before being cut off, Dutton accused the ABC journalist of being an advocate: \u201cYou can all be advocates and play your games \u2026\u201d The reporter said: I don\u2019t have a bias, you might have a bias against the ABC \u2026 I ask [energy minister] Chris Bowen the kind of questions I ask you and I promise you I don\u2019t [have a bias]. Dutton replied: Well, you can be an advocate or be a journalist, but I think the ABC, using taxpayers\u2019 money \u2026 The journalist disputed the question as coming from an advocacy position, saying she wanted to know why Dutton hadn\u2019t \u201cmet with the people\u201d. Dutton responded: I think your job is to be impartial. Australia reviewing all military export permits to Israel Australia is carrying out a review of all 66 defence-related export permits for Israel that were approved prior to the Gaza conflict. Guardian Australia understands the review is being done in a similar manner to the UK government\u2019s recent reassessment of arms licences to Israel, with the outcome to be announced \u201cin coming months\u201d. Sources said the Department of Defence was weighing up each permit on a case-by-case basis and considering how it fits with Australia\u2019s international obligations, including with respect to human rights. A defence spokesperson confirmed the review was progressing: As circumstances in the Middle East evolve, Australia continues to scrutinise pre-existing export permits to Israel to ensure they align with our calibrated approach. The federal government has repeatedly stated that Australia \u201chas not supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years\u201d, and it continues to maintain that position. But the government has faced criticism for failing to be transparent about what each permit covers. It has also defended Australia\u2019s supply of parts for the global supply chain for the F-35 fighter aircraft. Israel has used F-35 aircraft in Gaza. For more this story, read the full report by Guardian Australia\u2019s Daniel Hurst: Status quo \u2018not an option\u2019, Jacinta Allan says of taller buildings plan Victorian premier Jacinta Allan has announced that her government will intervene in the planning process to build thousands more homes near public transport centres across Melbourne. In a press conference today, Allan said her government would increase density in 50 inner-Melbourne areas near public transport to help them \u201cbecome places where we can build more quality homes\u201d: This is where these homes should go, close too public transport, close to jobs and services and schools, and close to opportunity, particularly for those who might want to live in the area where they grew up, they might want to live close to mum and dad or other family, because that\u2019s where we get our support from. The premier also took aim at Liberal party members who attended the press conference as part of a protest citing concerns about alleged plans to build 20-storey tower blocks in the area: The status quo is not an option. We are faced with a choice. We are faced with a choice in 2024 we can either continue to accept the status quo, we can continue to respond to the loudest voices who want to block, who want to block every single project, like the Liberal party have done for year upon year, or we can take a choice and go down a path of facing into those challenges, working with industry on their challenges, but most importantly, working with the Victorian community to build more homes, to provide more opportunities for Victorians to be able to get into a home, start a family, build their long-term wealth and have the secure future that they deserve. Under the plan \u201ctaller buildings\u201d of between 10 and 20 storeys near the stations will be allowed, and low-rise apartments and townhouses of between three and six storeys alongside existing homes in the \u201cwalkable catchments\u201d surrounding them will be allowed. The premier describe claims that the government will allow significant numbers of 20-storey high-rise apartments as \u201cmischief\u201d saying that the government will engage in a \u201cstreet by street, community by community\u201d consultation process about \u201chow to build more homes in the right locations with the train services, the tram services, the local infrastructure, the schools and open space that go alongside building communities, alongside building homes: Why would anyone want to stand in the way of addressing this most critical issue that young Victorians face week in, week out. Fellowship program established with donation from king The Association of Commonwealth Universities will launch a fellowship program for those looking to work on issues affecting island nations who are members of the British Commonwealth. Known as Commonwealth small island development nations, or \u201cSids\u201d, these countries are some of the most vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks. The announcement has been timed with King Charles\u2019 visit to Australia and will open up opportunities for mid-career professionals, undergraduates and PhD students to access support to work on issues including climate change and inequality. The king\u2019s Commonwealth fellowship programme has been \u201cinspired\u201d by the king and established with a personal donation from the monarch. Activities included in the program will take place in-country and emphasise local impact and retaining skills and talent. King Charles said the program was an extension of his belief in \u201cthe power of education to improve lives and unite communities across the Commonwealth and beyond\u201d: There is so much we can learn from one another as we work together within the Commonwealth to tackle the major challenges of our age and, as these Fellowships do in Small Island Developing States, to address them where they are felt most acutely. It is my fervent hope that these new Fellowships will play a significant role in furthering the free exchange of knowledge and advancing the spirit of mutual support that lies at the heart of our Commonwealth - today, tomorrow and towards a brighter future for all. Prof Colin Riordan, ACU secretary general and chief executive, said the program would provide important opportunities: Creating opportunities and facilitating knowledge exchange are at the heart of what we do, and drawing on our longstanding expertise in scholarships and the local knowledge of our member universities in Commonwealth Small Island Developing States, we are proud to work in partnership with our members in a range of Commonwealth countries to support the delivery of this important SIDS-focussed legacy programme in His Majesty\u2019s name. Teal independent claims Liberal heartland seat of Pittwater in NSW byelection A Climate 200-backed independent is on track to secure a comfortable victory in the latest contest between the Liberal party and teal candidates. The Liberals were defending three heartland seats in northern Sydney byelections on Saturday, and were on track to easily hold two of those as votes were counted on Saturday night. The independent Jacqui Scruby, a Climate 200-backed former adviser to federal MPs Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps, opened up a large lead over Liberal opponent Georgia Ryburn in Pittwater. Late in the evening the NSW Electoral Commission reported Scruby was ahead with 55% of the two-party preferred count. While the rising cost of living played a role in the campaign, much of it whittled down to who was from the area known as the \u201cinsular peninsula\u201d. For more on this story, read the full report: Investigators give all-clear after bomb threat on Wellington-to-Sydney flight Australian federal police have given the all-clear after a bomb threat onboard a plane stuck on the tarmac at Sydney airport. A member of staff raised the alarm after a safety issue was detected on a plane carrying 150 passengers from Wellington at 5.40pm yesterday. An AFP spokesperson said the plane had been \u201cisolated\u201d at the end of the tarmac while an investigation took place: About 4.50pm yesterday, AFP members at Sydney Airport responded to reports of an incident on board a flight enroute to the airport. Upon landing, the aircraft was isolated at the end of a runway away from the airport\u2019s terminals. A thorough search of the aircraft, as well as the luggage and all passengers on board, was undertaken and nothing suspicious was found. Investigations are continuing. The AFP will provide updates at the appropriate time. Murray Watt repeats government\u2019s stance ruling out changing tax concessions for investment properties Murray Watt was also pressed on ABC\u2019s Insiders this morning about the Albanese government\u2019s appetite to change tax concessions for residential property investors. The housing debate has revolved around whether changes to capital gains tax discounts and negative gearing could help get more Australians into home ownership. It was Labor\u2019s policy between 2016 and 2021 to halve CGT discounts from 50% to 25% and to limit negative gearing to newly built homes only. It was dumped after former leader Bill Shorten took the proposal to two federal elections and lost. The topic reared its head again this week after some federal Labor MPs suggested reducing CGT discounts could help win back voters after backlash against Anthony Albanese\u2019s decision to buy a $4.3m waterfront home on the NSW Central Coast in the middle of a housing crisis. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, appeared to definitively rule out negative gearing on Thursday but other frontbenchers have been more cautious on their phrasing. Still, Watt wasn\u2019t willing to budge today, despite repeated attempts by the show\u2019s host, David Speers. Watt said it was \u201cnot part of our plan\u201d: I haven\u2019t received any [department] advice to my knowledge that [CGT or negative gearing changes] will make a substantial difference to housing supply. Asked whether he personally supported keeping the generous tax concessions, he said: I haven\u2019t put that case within government \u2026 as the owner of one home that is heavily mortgaged to the bank, [benefiting from negative gearing and CGT concessions is] not something that I\u2019m planning to do any time soon. And as I say, I haven\u2019t put that view forward to my colleagues, and I\u2019m not aware of my other colleagues having decided to do that either. The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, appeared on ABC\u2019s Insiders program this morning where he dismissed the opposition\u2019s new housing policy as \u201cpretty much exactly the same\u201d as Labor\u2019s. Yesterday Peter Dutton announced a $5bn housing plan to kickstart greenfield housing developments across the country on a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d basis. The funding, in the form of grants and concessional loans, will go to industry and local and state governments to enabling infrastructure like water, power, sewerage \u2013 a role usually left to state and territory governments. Dutton also announced a 10-year freeze to building code changes, if elected. The opposition claims up to 500,000 houses could be built as a result of the plan. Similarly, the Albanese government\u2019s housing support program has offered $500m to state, territory and local governments until mid-2025 as part of its pledge to build 1.2m homes by the end of the decade. Watt said today: It\u2019s pretty revealing that after all of this time, the only plan that Peter Dutton has put forward is pretty much exactly the same plan that we\u2019ve had operating for months \u2026 what [Dutton]\u2019s talking about is a road to nowhere. He\u2019ll provide the infrastructure works \u2013 the same works that we are providing \u2013 but he won\u2019t be providing the housing, which we\u2019re providing, at the end of those roads. How the king\u2019s visit to NSW parliament unfolded Several hundred people lined Macquarie Street to watch King Charles\u2019s arrival at the NSW state parliament. He stepped out of a black car wearing a beige suit and a pale pink pocket square, and was greeted at the entrance by the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley, and state parliament dignitaries. He was visiting to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the NSW upper house. First, he was led by the legislative council president, Ben Franklin, to a new painting in the parliament\u2019s lobby by the Gumbaynggirr and Bundjalung artist Kim Healey, which was commissioned to mark the legislative council\u2019s bicentenary. It features the Southern Cross, to guide both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. It\u2019s the first Indigenous artwork in parliament. The king asked whether it was painted; Franklin answered in the affirmative. He then moved to the dining room, where the premier, Chris Minns, the chief justice, Andrew Bell, and parliamentarians were waiting. Police trumpeters played as he walked into the room. He was introduced as the king of Australia, and, as someone shouted \u201chooray\u201d, one of the guests laughed. Many of the parliamentarians held up their phones to photograph him as he walked to the lectern. He spoke to a few as he walked into the room. King Charles was introduced by Franklin, who described the monarch\u2019s visit as a privilege. The king then addressed the gathering. After departing, he stopped for a moment to greet people in the crowd, shook hands with several of them and thanked them for their good wishes. \u2013 Jordan Baker, pool reporter Marking the passage of time King Charles said democracy had an \u201cextraordinary capacity for innovation, compromise and adaptability, as well as stability\u201d. The king first visited Australia six decades ago, and he said it had continued to uphold \u201cstrong representative tradition\u201d. In the spirit of marking the \u201cpassage of time\u201d, he presented an hourglass speech timer to the parliament, to \u201cbear witness\u201d on parliament\u2019s next chapter. \u2018Democratic systems must evolve to remain fit for purpose,\u2019 king says King Charles continued to reflect on how original council members were \u201csqueezed into the old government house\u201d and moved into borrowed rooms in the current building: From that vantage point, regardless of their optimism, it was no doubt impossible to imagine what is now the vast and vibrant state of New South Wales, which has grown and evolved alongside this legislature, to reflect on the story of this institution and this state is to see the promise and power of representative democracy. Generations of voices have been brought together throughout discussion and debate, grappling with each day\u2019s challenges and opportunities, holding power to account and driving meaningful change. Democratic systems must evolve, of course, to remain fit for purpose, but they are nevertheless essentially sound systems. King Charles wasted no time at NSW parliament today, arriving at the bicentenary luncheon and departing in less than 10 minutes. The guests stood for his arrival and departure and were instructed to remain seated throughout proceedings, with many eagerly filming the event on their iPhones and iPads (yes, someone brought an iPad). His speech celebrated democracy and the legacy of Australia\u2019s governmental process, with some reminiscing on his previous trips to the nation before he became sovereign: Having been with you for your 150th anniversary, I am delighted and proud to be able to return to the parliament of New South Wales in order to celebrate the occasion of your bicentenary. It is fascinating, I think, to reflect back to 200 years ago, and thinking about those times makes me wonder what that inaugural handful of members of the New South Wales legislative council would make of this parliament today, and of how this great state has progressed. King presents speech timer hourglass to NSW parliament King Charles has given a short address to the NSW parliament where he presented a gift to the chamber: It is, in fact, an hourglass. A speech timer \u2026 [laughter] to sit in the chamber and bear witness to the legislative council\u2019s next chapter. So with the sands of time encouraging brevity \u2026 [laughter] it just remains for me to say what a great joy it is to come to Australia for the first time as sovereign and to renew a love of this country and its people which I have cherished for so long. Crowds queue for glimpse of royals at Sydney church As the king and queen left the church, they were greeted by hundreds of cheering people, all hoping to catch a glimpse or snap a photo. Among them were Helen Hetrelezis and her brothers, who arrived at the church at 7.45am \u2013 almost three hours before the church service. Their efforts paid off and Hetrelezis was granted a few moments with Camilla after church: We spoke about her visit, I asked the queen about her stay, she said she was enjoying Sydney very much. In an unplanned moment, the king and queen went to greet the crowds on the other side of the church, with police scrambling to ensure they were protected. Archbishop Kanishka Raffel said it was a \u201cdelight\u201d to have the royal couple attend the local service: It has been a great pleasure and privilege. It was lovely for this local church to welcome the sovereign King Charles and Queen Camilla. As the royal couple were whisked away in their motorcade, their staff carried dozens of flowers and gifts, while crowds cheered. The family of stabbing victim Vyleen White has helped the Queensland Liberal National party to launch its election campaign. The LNP is promising to introduce \u201cadult time for adult crime\u201d amid claims of a youth crime \u201ccrisis\u201d in the state. White\u2019s death in February was one of several events that has pushed law-and-order issues to the forefront of the campaign. White\u2019s daughter, Cindy Micaleff, told the crowd of LNP candidates and members in Ipswich she spoke to both the premier, Steven Miles, and the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, after her mother\u2019s death. She said Crisafulli came alone, with no cameras, and listened to her father: In our family\u2019s hour of need, both men came to our home. But there was only one who is a true leader. We as a family will not allow her death to be in vain. Queensland LNP leader, David Crisafulli, says the party will introduce \u201cmandatory isolation periods\u201d for young people who assault youth detention workers. Crisafulli has announced a new \u201cdetention with purpose\u201d policy, which will put children in isolation for bad behaviour. He also says education in youth detention will be compulsory. There have been longstanding concerns about the amount of education children receive in Queensland\u2019s youth detention system; much of that has been due to the extent that children are kept in isolation. Crisafulli said children in detention would be punished \u2013 for example having televisions removed from their cells \u2013 if they do not behave: Access to food is a human right \u2026 access to a television is not. It\u2019s a privilege. And it should be earned with good behaviour, it should be a reward for good behaviour. This policy is not about money. It\u2019s about demonstrating a new way. It\u2019s about showing kids they have the structure to turn their life around. Guests are arriving for the NSW parliament\u2019s bicentenary luncheon and it\u2019s quite an affair, with native floral bouquets and branded royal chocolates on the tables. Among them is the premier, Chris Minns, and a number of state MPs lucky enough to nab an invite. A logo created for today\u2019s events encourages attenders to: Reflect, celebrate, imagine. More from royal couple\u2019s Sunday service at Sydney church King Charles and Queen Camilla were greeted by warm weather as they made their first public appearance in Australia during an intimate Sunday morning service at St Thomas\u2019 Anglican church in North Sydney. Upon arrival, the royal couple were greeted by crowds that wrapped around the church\u2019s property, hoping to catch a glimpse of them. As Charles and Camilla made their way to the front of church, children waving Australian flags cheered and shook hands with the couple. The queen, wearing a pale green Anna Valentine dress and straw hat, was given flowers by the church minister\u2019s wife, Ellie Mantle, as she entered the church. Once inside, the royal couple were bathed in sunlight that poured through the door and stained glass windows. Dozens of phones pointed in their direction while excited whispers echoed through the room. Despite the important guests, the service was restricted to the local congregation, with only a few special guests allowed to attend, including Australia\u2019s governor general, Sam Mostyn, and the governor of NSW, Margaret Beazley. Bishop Christopher Edwards delivered a prayer, asking for the protection of the king and queen, along with a hope the upcoming commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa would be prosperous. He also asked for world peace and an end to wars. The service also featured hymns, prayers and readings from the Old and New Testaments (Isaiah 52:13-53:12 and Acts 8:26-40). Finally, the church\u2019s minister, Michael Mantle, thanked the king and queen for their attendance and said it was an honour to host them. The royal couple also signed two Bibles in black pen, including one that belonged to Australia\u2019s first minister, Richard Johnson, who was also the chaplain for the first fleet. \u2013 Laura Chung, pool reporter Affluent areas along train lines to be rezoned in Victorian government housing push The Victorian Labor government is set to seize planning control of some of Melbourne\u2019s most affluent suburbs in an effort to build thousands more homes, setting the stage for a fight with the opposition and local governments. The premier, Jacinta Allan, will announce an overhaul of planning rules in 50 inner-Melbourne areas located near public transport, including in Brighton, Malvern and Toorak, to allow for greater density. She will argue young people are now \u201clocked out\u201d of these areas \u2013 despite being close to jobs, transport and services \u2013 due to low availability and high property prices. Twenty-five of the 50 new \u201cactivity centres\u201d to be unveiled on Sunday include Armadale, Hawksburn, Malvern and Toorak stations on the Frankston railway line, Auburn, Hawthorn and Glenferrie on the Belgrave-Lilydale line and North Brighton, Middle Brighton, Hampton and Sandringham on the Sandringham line. For more on this story, read the full report from Guardian Australia\u2019s Benita Kolovos: King to address NSW parliament King Charles is fresh off a church service and about to address the NSW legislative council on his third day down under. Australia\u2019s first parliament is celebrating its bicentenary as the oldest parliament in Australia, and what better occasion is there to welcome our monarch? His majesty won\u2019t be eating but the luncheon program is quite a showstopper, with entrees of chargrilled asparagus and marinated octopus followed by barramundi or confit of duck and lemon meringue pie with native desert lime. Reporters are being offered triangle sandwiches and complimentary mints. Formalities will be held with the king, followed by an address from the winner of the inaugural NSW parliament regional public speaking competition, Sophia Huckel, chair of Australian history at the University of Sydney, Prof Kirsten McKenzie, and leader of the government in the legislative council, Penny Sharpe. After his address, the king will be off to receive the governor general, followed by the governor of NSW. The Queensland LNP\u2019s campaign launch is about to get under way. The polls appear to be tightening but most still predict that the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, will be elected premier in a week\u2019s time. Abortion rights have become a key campaign issue and pro-choice and union protesters have gathered outside the event at Ipswich, which is normally Labor heartland. Some protesters have been calling out at LNP candidates, asking them \u201cHow are you going to vote?\u201d, amid the prospect of a conscience vote on abortion and party candidates refusing to outline personal views. Voters go to the polls on 26 October. ACT Labor extends record run to hold government in territory election Australia\u2019s \u201cforever government\u201d has lived up to its name, with Labor retaining power to extend its record reign in the ACT beyond a quarter of a century. The ACT Labor leader, Andrew Barr, already the longest-serving political leader in the country, fended off a negative swing and an independent surge to win his third election as chief minister. While there was still more counting to be done, he told supporters he was confident he could once again form a progressive government with the support of a five-member crossbench: \u201cWe will take the progressive, practical and proven policies we have taken to this election and enact them in government with the support, I hope, of a progressive crossbench that sees value in investing in public housing, public health and public education. With more than three-quarters of votes tallied, the ABC\u2019s election guru, Antony Green, predicted Labor would cling on to their 10 seats while the Greens would hold three, amounting to the 13 needed to form government in the 25-member legislative assembly. The Liberals were on track to pick up one seat under their leader Elizabeth Lee, matching Labor on 10, but still saw their share of the vote decline by 0.7%. For more on this story, read the full report: King Charles and Queen Camilla have made their first public appearance in Australia. The royals briefly met with children outside St Thomas Anglican church in North Sydney before attending a church service. The couple flew into Australia on Friday but spent two days recovering from the flight, making Sunday morning their first appearance. Crowds turned out for a chance to meet the king and queen before an official meet-and-greet at 11.30am. The couple was also met by a small group of protesters, with one holding a sign that read \u201cdecolonise\u201d. The trip marks King Charles\u2019s first trip to Australia since becoming king. The itinerary has been heavily pared back due to the king\u2019s cancer diagnosis \u2013 the treatment for which has been stopped to enable the trip. And welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. King Charles and Queen Camilla are kicking of their first visit to Australia since the coronation in 2022. The itinerary, which was tightened after the king\u2019s cancer diagnosis, began on Sunday with a church service at St Thomas\u2019 Anglican church in North Sydney. Labor has declared victory in the ACT election, extending the party\u2019s two-decade hold over the nation\u2019s capital despite a swing against it. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, retains the position he has held since 2014 and his party will secure power with the Greens, who have held on to three seats, with two others going to independents. I\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs and I\u2019ll be taking the blog through the day. With that, let\u2019s get started \u2026",

      "body": "<p>Contrasting reactions to the chance killing by Israeli soldiers of Hamas\u2019s top leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/yahya-sinwar-final-moments-israeli-infantry-tracked-him-down\">Yahya&nbsp;Sinwar</a>, offer a chastening guide to the dismal, dead-end politics of the Middle East. Sinwar, reputed mastermind of the 7 October 2023 massacre of about 1,200 Israelis, has paid a fitting price for his crimes. It would have been preferable had he faced trial. The same holds true of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political chief, assassinated by Israel in Tehran in July. Yet both these men lived by the sword. They knew the score.</p> <p>The killing is being widely described as a watershed moment that could presage an end to the multi-fronted war that erupted after 7 October. It is likened in importance to the US assassination of Osama bin Laden, who plotted the 9/11 attacks \u2013 and was similarly celebrated in Israel and western capitals last week. Yet such sweeping assessments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/17/yahya-sinwar-hamas-gaza-netanyahu-israel-war\">may be premature</a>.</p> <p>The unyielding reactions of the main players give no grounds for optimism that Sinwar\u2019s death has changed the fundamentals of the conflict or brought it any closer to resolution. This is disappointing but unsurprising. Much innocent blood continues to be shed on all sides, primarily in besieged Gaza refugee camps such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/israel-gaza-airstrikes-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-death\">Jabalia</a>. Why imagine yet another killing will bring peace?</p> <p>The US alone is out of tune with this negative chorus. After opposing a ceasefire for months, president Joe Biden now wants to use Sinwar\u2019s death to increase pressure to stop the Gaza fighting and forge a hostage deal. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/yahya-sinwar-hamas-leader-killing-israel-biden-ceasefire-calls\">ceasefire, he believes</a>, is the key to de-escalation in&nbsp;Lebanon and would reduce the risk of an Israel-Iran war. \u201cLet\u2019s make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace [and] a better future in Gaza without Hamas,\u201d he&nbsp;said.</p> <p>Yet, as so often in the past year, no one directly involved seems to be paying much attention to Biden. US&nbsp;weakness and indecision, dramatised by Washington\u2019s failure to condemn brutal Israeli army tactics in Gaza and ensure the unobstructed delivery of humanitarian aid, has been further underscored by numerous, futile diplomatic interventions. Israel\u2019s hard-right coalition, led by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/18/israels-netanyahu-vows-gaza-war-not-over-after-sinwars-alleged-killing\">does not want peace</a>. It wants total victory, at&nbsp;all costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/israel-yayha-sinwar-killing-reaction-netanyahu\">In Israel, Sinwar\u2019s killing brings catharsis, if not clarity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Defying significant domestic as well as American pressure, Netanyahu insists the war will go on. He knows outrage at the Palestinian death toll \u2013 <a href=\"https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2024/10/18/health-ministry-in-gaza-says-war-death-toll-at-42-500\">now about 42,500</a> \u2013 is hurting Biden and Kamala Harris, ahead of next month\u2019s US election. But he doesn\u2019t care. He calculates that Biden will not halt arms supplies. And he hopes likeminded Donald Trump, a foe to Palestinian rights and justice, will beat Harris on 5 November.</p> <p>Reaction to Sinwar\u2019s killing from Hamas and its allies in what Iran calls the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d has been similarly uncompromising. Sinwar\u2019s deputy, Khalil al-Hayya, insisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting\">nothing had changed</a>. Sinwar\u2019s \u201cbanner will not fall\u201d, he said, and he would be replaced. Hamas demands Israel halt the war, end its occupation of Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners before it will accept a ceasefire and release the estimated 100 Israeli hostages still unaccounted for.</p> <p>This show of defiance contains an element of bravado. Hamas has been badly damaged. Its new leaders must be more flexible in any resumed peace talks. They should free the hostages immediately. Yet the group\u2019s statements again confound those in Israel and the west who think an ideology and a cause can be destroyed with bullets and bombs. Ideas, even bad ones, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/18/sinwar-dead-hamas-gaza-israel-history-resistance/\">don\u2019t die that easily</a>.</p> <p>Intransigence was on display in Lebanon, too, where Israel is pursuing an expanded military intervention to halt rocket attacks from Hamas\u2019s ally, <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/hezbollah-escalate-war-against-israel-after-sinwar-death\">Hezbollah</a>. Israel\u2019s assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has not deterred its fighters any more than Sinwar\u2019s death has apparently deterred Hamas. Hezbollah is now threatening <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-vows-escalation-after-sinwars-death-iran-says-resistance-will-endure/\">further escalation</a>.

      "bodyText": "Contrasting reactions to the chance killing by Israeli soldiers of Hamas\u2019s top leader, Yahya Sinwar, offer a chastening guide to the dismal, dead-end politics of the Middle East. Sinwar, reputed mastermind of the 7 October 2023 massacre of about 1,200 Israelis, has paid a fitting price for his crimes. It would have been preferable had he faced trial. The same holds true of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political chief, assassinated by Israel in Tehran in July. Yet both these men lived by the sword. They knew the score. The killing is being widely described as a watershed moment that could presage an end to the multi-fronted war that erupted after 7 October. It is likened in importance to the US assassination of Osama bin Laden, who plotted the 9/11 attacks \u2013 and was similarly celebrated in Israel and western capitals last week. Yet such sweeping assessments may be premature. The unyielding reactions of the main players give no grounds for optimism that Sinwar\u2019s death has changed the fundamentals of the conflict or brought it any closer to resolution. This is disappointing but unsurprising. Much innocent blood continues to be shed on all sides, primarily in besieged Gaza refugee camps such as Jabalia. Why imagine yet another killing will bring peace? The US alone is out of tune with this negative chorus. After opposing a ceasefire for months, president Joe Biden now wants to use Sinwar\u2019s death to increase pressure to stop the Gaza fighting and forge a hostage deal. A ceasefire, he believes, is the key to de-escalation in Lebanon and would reduce the risk of an Israel-Iran war. \u201cLet\u2019s make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace [and] a better future in Gaza without Hamas,\u201d he said. Yet, as so often in the past year, no one directly involved seems to be paying much attention to Biden. US weakness and indecision, dramatised by Washington\u2019s failure to condemn brutal Israeli army tactics in Gaza and ensure the unobstructed delivery of humanitarian aid, has been further underscored by numerous, futile diplomatic interventions. Israel\u2019s hard-right coalition, led by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, does not want peace. It wants total victory, at all costs. Defying significant domestic as well as American pressure, Netanyahu insists the war will go on. He knows outrage at the Palestinian death toll \u2013 now about 42,500 \u2013 is hurting Biden and Kamala Harris, ahead of next month\u2019s US election. But he doesn\u2019t care. He calculates that Biden will not halt arms supplies. And he hopes likeminded Donald Trump, a foe to Palestinian rights and justice, will beat Harris on 5 November. Reaction to Sinwar\u2019s killing from Hamas and its allies in what Iran calls the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d has been similarly uncompromising. Sinwar\u2019s deputy, Khalil al-Hayya, insisted nothing had changed. Sinwar\u2019s \u201cbanner will not fall\u201d, he said, and he would be replaced. Hamas demands Israel halt the war, end its occupation of Gaza and free Palestinian prisoners before it will accept a ceasefire and release the estimated 100 Israeli hostages still unaccounted for. This show of defiance contains an element of bravado. Hamas has been badly damaged. Its new leaders must be more flexible in any resumed peace talks. They should free the hostages immediately. Yet the group\u2019s statements again confound those in Israel and the west who think an ideology and a cause can be destroyed with bullets and bombs. Ideas, even bad ones, don\u2019t die that easily. Intransigence was on display in Lebanon, too, where Israel is pursuing an expanded military intervention to halt rocket attacks from Hamas\u2019s ally, Hezbollah. Israel\u2019s assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has not deterred its fighters any more than Sinwar\u2019s death has apparently deterred Hamas. Hezbollah is now threatening further escalation. At the same time, Iran is urging anti-Israel militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to maintain the \u201cspirit of resistance\u201d and fight on. Israel\u2019s military response to Iran\u2019s firing of 181 ballistic missiles at the country earlier this month, while delayed, is certainly coming. This imminent prospect of renewed, head-to-head confrontation is another reason to question whether Sinwar\u2019s killing really marks a turning point \u2013 or is another grim milestone on the road to hell. Israeli analysts suggest Netanyahu, who has long sought a showdown with Iran to halt its nuclear programme and stymie region-wide subversion, now sees an opportunity. His tail is up, as are his poll ratings. He believes he is winning, and by doing so, can absolve his guilt for 7 October security failures. Biden is weak, the US distracted by its election. The usual restraints are loosening. Will Netanyahu choose this juncture to go in for the kill? On the evidence of the past 12 months, there is little this dangerous man will not do.

The Israeli autopsy carried out on Sinwar concluded that he died from a gunshot wound to his head, at odds with the initial Israel Defense Forces (IDF) version which implied he was killed by a tank shell fired into the wrecked building where he made his last stand. The IDF released footage of a tank firing at the building in Rafah\u2019s Tel al-Sultan refugee camp, and the military spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said: \u201cWe identified him as a terrorist inside a building, fired at the building and then went in to search.\u201d However, according to Chen Kugel, the director of Israel\u2019s national forensic institute, who carried out the autopsy, the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head. In an interview with the New York Times, Kugel did not speculate on who fired the fatal shot, whether it was during a skirmish with Israeli soldiers before the tank round was fired, or after he was found in the rubble of the building, or by Sinwar himself so as not to be taken alive. Sinwar had a pistol with him, which some Israeli reports said had previously belonged to an IDF military intelligence officer, Mahmoud Hir a-Din, a Druze from the Galilee region, who was killed during a secret mission in Gaza in 2018. The intrigue surrounding Sinwar\u2019s death has fuelled a martyr\u2019s cult that spread explosively across social media from the moment the Hamas leader was confirmed dead. The fact that he was killed in combat fatigues and a combat vest after firing and hurling grenades at Israeli soldiers, even lashing out at an IDF drone with a wooden baton thrown with his one remaining working arm in a final gesture of defiance, sets Sinwar apart from his predecessors who were assassinated while they were on the run. When the long-serving Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was assassinated by missiles fired by an IDF helicopter gunship in 2004, he was being pushed along in a wheelchair after prayers in a Gaza mosque. There was little of his body left to photograph, but imagined pictures of the fatal missile strike became part of the iconography which almost instantly appeared on walls across the occupied territories, along with images of the white-bearded leader ascending to heaven. Pictures of Yassin are still common in Gaza and the West Bank, often showing him in the company of more recent martyrs.

The lines from Praise for the High Shadow say: \u201cBesiege your siege \u2026 there is no escape. Your arm has fallen, so pick it up and strike your enemy \u2026 There is no escape and I fell near you, so pick me up and strike your enemy with me \u2026 You are now free, free and free.\u201d Darwish wrote the poem at another low point for the Palestinian cause, in a boat taking him and other activists and militants from Beirut to Tunisia after Israel\u2019s devastating war in Lebanon in 1982 aimed at destroying the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Darwish\u2019s poetry recalls the horror of the shelling of Beirut and the massacres of Palestinians and Lebanese Shia Muslims at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon at that time. The themes of mass death in the face of international indifference and inaction, combined with the longing for someone to strike back, resonate with Palestinians today after Gaza\u2019s destruction.

Senior Canadian police officials accused Indian diplomats of being involved in \u201ccriminal\u201d activities on Canadian soil, ranging from homicide and targeted assassinations to extortion, intimidation and coercion against members of the Canadian Sikh community.</p> <p>They alleged that Indian diplomats \u2013 including the high commissioner himself \u2013 were implicated not only in the high profile killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/advocate-separate-sikh-state-india-shot-dead-canada-hardeep-singh-nijjar-temple\">gunned down outside a gurdwara in a suburb of Vancouver</a> last June, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/india-canada-expel-top-diplomats-escalating-row-sikh-activists-death-hardeep-singh-nijjar\">also linked to other murders on Canadian soil</a>. The diplomats had even worked with a gang run by India\u2019s most notorious mob boss to get their dirty work done, they alleged.</p> <p>Two days later, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau doubled down on the claims. Testifying before a public inquiry, he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/justin-trudeau-testimony-india\">Canada had clear intelligence linking Indian diplomats to \u201cdrive-by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder in and across Canada\u201d.</a> India, added Trudeau, had made a \u201chorrific mistake\u201d in violating Canadian sovereignty.</p> <p>It was a considerable escalation of a diplomatic row that has torpedoed India-Canada relations, beginning last year when Trudeau stood up in parliament and said there were \u201ccredible allegations\u201d linking the Indian government to the killing of Nijjar \u2013 an accusation India rejected as \u201cabsurd\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, allegations of an India campaign of transnational violence and harassment have emerged not only in Canada but in the US, UK and Pakistan, where prominent Sikh activists say they have received threats to their lives.</p> <p>Western officials and the Sikh community claim that what has been laid bare is a far-reaching \u2013 if often clumsily implemented \u2013 policy of transnational repression targeting the Sikh diaspora by the government of prime minister Narendra Modi. Canadian officials reportedly say they have evidence that orders of alleged threats and harassment came from the very top levels of Indian government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/amit-shah-narendra-modi-right-hand-man-india\">right up to the powerful home minister Amit Shah, who is considered Modi\u2019s right hand man.</a></p> <p>India has repeatedly rejected all the allegations, emphasising that such killing are not government policy , and Canada\u2019s latest allegations were met with a flurry of outraged denials. New Delhi described the claims as \u201cpreposterous imputations\u201d and \u201cludicrous\u201d statements, and accused Trudeau of a political vendetta. They have also accused Canada of providing a safe haven to Sikh terrorists.</p> <p>But by Friday morning, India had woken to fresh allegations, this time from the US. An \u201cIndian government employee\u201d, named as Vikash Yadav, was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/17/vikash-yadak-indian-spy-charged\">charged over a plot to murder a prominent Sikh activist and US citizen</a>, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in New York last year. At the time the murder was planned, Yadav was working as an intelligence official under the office of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and had been a longtime employee of the Indian government.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1373831/dl\">new indictment added further details to the alleged assassination plot </a>against Pannun, initially revealed by US department of justice prosecutors late last year.</p> <p>In what read like the script of a B movie, US investigators alleged that an Indian agent in New Delhi \u2013 previously referred to just as CC1 but now revealed as Yadav \u2013 had hired an Indian middleman in New York to help orchestrate a plot to murder Pannun. Panuun, a lawyer and US citizen, is a known fireband Sikh separatist and has been designated as a terrorist by the India government.</p> <p>However, it is alleged the plot was foiled after the assassin Yadav and his middleman recruited to kill Pannun awkwardly turned out to be an undercover US officer. The suspected middleman, named as Nikhil Gupta, fled to the Czech Republic, where he was arrested and later deported back to the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/indian-suspect-in-plot-to-kill-sikh-separatist-extradited-to-us\">where he has entered a not guilty plea</a>. On Friday, the FBI released a wanted notice for Yadav and it believed the US will seek his extradition from India, where he is still believed to be \u201cat large\u201d.</p> <p>India has sought to portray the Indian and Canadian incidents as unconnected but, according to US investigators, they are inextricably linked. As the Pannun murder plot was being planned out, Gupta had mentioned a \u201cbig target\u201d in Canada, just days before Nijjar was gunned down, it is claimed. Then, hours after Nijjar\u2019s death, Yadav allegedly sent his middleman a video clip of Nijjar\u2019s dead body.</p> <p>The justice department made it clear they believed Pannun\u2019s killing was \u201ca grave example\u201d of an increasing trend of transnational repression \u2013 a term defined as foreign governments taking violent and illegal actions beyond their own territory. Without directly mentioning the geopolitical implications evidently at play, they also emphasised that they would hold those responsible to account \u201cregardless of their position or proximity to power\u201d.</p> <p>India is now scrambling to reject allegations that it has become a rogue international actor that has illegally violated the sovereign territory of not one but two of its western allies. Not long ago, such killings were never considered part of India\u2019s intelligence playbook. But since he came to power a decade ago, Modi\u2019s muscular nationalist agenda has come to define his agenda both at home and abroad, as he seeks to push India to superpower status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/04/indian-government-assassination-allegations-pakistan-intelligence-officials\">Indian government ordered killings in Pakistan, intelligence officials claim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/04/indian-government-assassination-allegations-pakistan-intelligence-officials\">previous Guardian investigation</a>, which linked India to up to 20 killings over the border in Pakistan since 2020, intelligence officials described how the Modi government had become emboldened to carry out attacks on dissidents on foreign soil.

But it gets ingrained as a habit when it evolves as a coping mechanism or a survival strategy. If they grow up in a punitive atmosphere, children lie to avoid punishment or criticism, to protect themselves from emotional pain, or to please authority figures. In these formative years, the lie becomes a tool to navigate a world where their true feelings and behaviours might not be fully accepted or understood. The seeds of adult lying are sown when a child feels their authentic self is in some way unacceptable or dangerous to reveal. This might happen in environments where there is a high level of control, where emotions are not openly expressed or validated, or where the child perceives that they can only earn love and approval by presenting a version of themselves that conforms to others\u2019 expectations.

He\u2019s great \u2013 funny, loyal, kind, enterprising \u2013 but, over the years, I\u2019ve noticed he embellishes things, sometimes just to be funny, or to get sympathy. He\u2019ll tell an anecdote and I\u2019ll know things didn\u2019t go the way he told it. Or he\u2019ll say he\u2019s got five projects on the go and I\u2019ll know for a fact it\u2019s just two. He\u2019ll also pretend he doesn\u2019t drink, eat meat or smoke, depending on who we\u2019re with and, of course, I know he does all three. Everyone exaggerates at some point, so it hasn\u2019t worried me too much, but sometimes he\u2019ll tell what I consider to be a more serious lie. In terms of housework, I do all the cleaning. I\u2019ve brought up chore division a couple of times and he insists he does clean, he just does it while I\u2019m out, so I don\u2019t see it. I would know immediately if I came home and something had been cleaned, however sloppily. The lying concerns me more than the unfair division of labour. I recently came back from being away with my girlfriend and my car had been moved and was full of sweet wrappers with a fuller tank than I left it with. He said he had to move it because there was a temporary no parking sign. I checked on the council website, there hadn\u2019t been. I\u2019m not an idiot.

Because we do need to find something to celebrate here. The lighting really is a model of its kind. A combination of dangling downlights and strategically positioned lamps on the bare wooden tables means there\u2019s enough illumination to see everything without sparking up the smartphone torch. And yet the rest of the room, with its sandstone-coloured walls and undulating grey leather banquettes, like pilates rollers, is held in a moody, intimate glow. I\u2019d urge restaurant designers to go have a look and take notes. Possibly quite quickly.</p> <p>Because the problem with that terrific lighting is it also enables you to see everything that\u2019s about to happen to you in acute detail, and it\u2019s not always pretty. Maroto feels like a restaurant conceived in one long brainstorming session, during which everyone got bored and just settled for ideas, which sounded convincing, so they all could go home, regardless of whether they made the slightest bit of sense or not. It\u2019s next to the Brazilian consulate just north of London\u2019s Oxford Street and occupies the space of what was, for less than year, a restaurant called Bossa, from much-decorated Brazilian chef Alberto Landgraf. The new iteration takes the name of the bar underneath that continued trading after Bossa\u2019s closure. Google translate tells me <em>maroto</em> is the Portuguese for naughty, and that\u2019s certainly a word you could use if you were feeling kind. I am not kind.</p>    <p>As well as a few sharing dishes \u2013 a whole chicken for \u00a3110, a fish for \u00a3105 \u2013 the heart of the menu is that \u201cfive flavour experience\u201d. To quote directly: \u201cEach main dish is accompanied by a unique seasoning representing one of the five flavours. Sweet \u2013 Salty \u2013 Spicy \u2013 Sour \u2013 Umami.\u201d This sets off the first alarm bell. \u201cSpicy\u201d is not one of the recognised five flavours. The other one is \u201cbitter\u201d. But I assume that didn\u2019t work with the concept. No worries: at these prices we\u2019ll all end up bitter enough as it is. What you get is a small, plain, well-cooked chicken breast for \u00a319 or three meagre slices of beef for \u00a332, with the same five flavours dotted around both bare, grey plates, like splodges on an artist\u2019s palette. There\u2019s an under-seasoned chilli mayo for the rogue spicy, an acidulated guacamole for sour, soy-marinated mushrooms for umami, a not very salty truffle mayo for salty and what they describe as a \u201cdark marmalade\u201d for sweet.</p>    <p>\u201cBut don\u2019t have the marmalade with the meat,\u201d the waiter says quickly, after describing the plate. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go with it.\u201d So why are you serving it? He shrugs. \u201cIt is just my opinion.\u201d The opinion seemingly being that the whole damn idea doesn\u2019t really work, does it, but what can you do? None of those flavours makes you think, \u201cWow, this gives me a whole new perspective on chicken breast.\u201d It just makes you think, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if the kitchen had bothered to choose the right sauce to go with it?</p> <p>This weirdness was preceded by a long wait, given there were only nine of us in there, and before that by some dispiriting starters. One was a splodge of refried beans topped by a room-temperature lump of bronzed pork belly that was half cool white fat. Another was described as a hen egg with cep and truffle. There was no sign of either of those, but there was an astringent foaming pond of what tasted like a parmesan cream surrounding an underboiled egg. When you cut in it leaked not just yolk, but sputum-like undercooked white.</p>    <p>Not everything was terrible. Slices of cured sea bass in a bright yellow, citrus-boosted sauce, topped with a pretty flower formed out of ribbons of yellow courgette, was inoffensive. The best dish was a side of rice, mushrooms and beans cooked in a ceramic pot, to which we were invited to add a soy-mirin broth. It was rustic and humble and satisfying. It cost \u00a313. Despite the insistence that this is a Brazilian-inspired restaurant, it felt like the one dish that genuinely engaged with that food culture. I couldn\u2019t help wondering what the staff of the consulate next door make of it all.</p> <p>Dessert was a brown sugar tart that had a nice enough filling but a soggy, damp pastry shell and a truly appalling chocolate mousse that had been piped into a rose, perhaps a while before, because it had set hard. It tasted mostly of fat. As the waiter cleared these dishes, he made the terrible mistake of asking: \u201cWhich is your favourite?\u201d This assumes that one of them definitely is, rather than that you think they should both be put in a burlap sack and dropped in the nearest canal to put them out of our misery. Currently, there is a very short wine list with the cheapest bottle, a Verdejo, at \u00a360. The sommelier told me it would soon be longer and that the entry price would drop to a mere \u00a345. Rejoice!</p>    <p>Some people question the value of angry, negative reviews like this. I was genuinely intrigued by the five flavour thing. If a kitchen could come up with four main courses, all of which paired brilliantly with five different accompaniments \u2013 so 20 permutations \u2013 that would be an achievement worth writing about. But if, at the end of a \u00a3100-a-head meal like this, I conclude it\u2019s a terrible restaurant and I really can\u2019t recommend that anybody should go there, I need to say so. If I had any doubts about this, it was clinched for me by a trip to one of the gender-neutral loos which, at 9.30pm on a Tuesday night when the restaurant was only a quarter full, housed a sanitary and hand towel bin that was full to overflowing. None of the staff seemed to care, so I\u2019m not sure why I should. I\u2019ll post a picture of it to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jayrayner1/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>, because that\u2019s always an aid to the digestion.</p>    <p>Three minutes\u2019 walk away from Maroto on Wigmore Street is a branch of the Lebanese restaurant group <a href=\"https://www.comptoirlibanais.com/\">Comptoir Libanais</a>, where I happened to grab a quick lunch earlier that day: kofte, salad, rice, some crunchy pickles on the side, and exceedingly good coffee, for \u00a325.

Scruby said she would await the outcome of counting of postal and prepoll votes but said the results so far showed voters \u201cappreciate a different way of doing politics\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very exciting testament that people understand community representation and that independents represent them in the way they want to be represented and they\u2019re effective and can deliver,\u201d she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email She said existing independents in the NSW parliament, such as the member for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, had demonstrated the value of working \u201cpolicy by policy\u201d and assessing proposals on their merits, rather than a \u201ctwo party [system] of government and opposition and opposing for opposition\u2019s sake\u201d. \u201cI think people are excited by that. It\u2019s a more representative and businesslike approach to policy development,\u201d she said. The Pittwater byelection, triggered by criminal charges being laid against the sitting MP, Rory Amon, which he has denied, was held alongside those in Epping and Hornsby. The latter two were sparked by the resignations of the former premier Dominic Perrottet and the former treasurer Matt Kean. The Liberal candidates, Monica Tudehope and James Wallace, were on track to triumph easily in those races, in which Labor did not field candidates. Scruby said it had been an honour to run alongside Ryburn and it was unfortunate it had \u201ctaken a scandal for the Liberal party to preselect a woman\u201d. \u201cIt was absolutely fantastic to see two professional women with families standing in this electorate,\u201d she said. Ryburn in her speech on Saturday night said although the count was ongoing, the path to victory was difficult. \u201cWhat the people of Pittwater told me is that they were so grateful in this campaign to have two strong, competent and intelligent women fighting for our community,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile Jacqui and I have our differences, I do believe she loves Pittwater and I respect that. \u201cThe biggest difference, though, between me and Jacqui Scruby is that I am some part of something bigger, so much bigger than myself, and each and every one of us play a role.\u201d Ryburn told the crowd \u201cwhile the teal candidates like to push the narrative that they are the David and we are the Goliath, this isn\u2019t the case\u201d. She said the Liberal party had \u201ctaken the high road and run a solid campaign while the teals, the most righteous of them all, slandered us in the media\u201d. Executive director of Climate 200, Byron Fay, said the result in Pittwater was an indication that community independents could deliver. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication the community continues to look for an alternative to the duopoly \u2013 that is, the major parties,\u201d he said.

And the only way to defeat him is to fight Putin.\u201d</p>    <p>Although the Belarusian army has not been deployed in Ukraine, Lukashenko allowed Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops to enter the country through Belarus in February 2022, making it a co-aggressor in the war. Since then, integration between Moscow and Minsk has accelerated, with Belarus now, in effect, a Russian proxy.</p> <p>On the other side of the frontline, the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski regiment, made up of hundreds of Belarusians, fights on the side of Ukraine. They range from former IT specialists to police officers such as Hranouski.</p> <p>Sitting in his military uniform, he took deep breaths and regular drags on a stream of cigarettes as he reflected on everything he left behind in Belarus \u2013 work, family and friends.

Hranouski got along well with his colleagues, sharing the day-to-day burden of being a policeman \u2013 resolving petty neighbourhood disputes and maintaining order.</p> <p>But when he looks back now, Hranouski is dismissive of many of the people with whom he served. \u201cThey\u2019re not particularly smart and they don\u2019t critically analyse information.

In fact, that\u2019s almost a requirement to work for this system.\u201d</p>    <p>When the protests began in August 2020, Hranouski saw his colleagues torturing and mocking protesters to prop up the regime. Triggered by accusations of election fraud, the protests brought hundreds of thousands of Belarusians on to the streets nationwide.

That moment proved I was wrong.\u201d</p> <p>On 16 August 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/belarus-prepares-for-biggest-protest-yet-after-week-of-anger\">Minsk witnessed the largest protest to date</a>, with more than 200,000 citizens flooding on to the streets to demonstrate against the dictatorship. \u201cIt was unbelievable \u2013 I was standing in the police cordon, looking at this sea of people, thinking they would sweep us away and we\u2019d drop our shields. But they turned back,\u201d Hranouski said sadly. \u201cThat was the moment I realised the revolution had failed and things would only get worse.\u201d</p> <p>He resigned from the police in September that year. He was allowed to leave the force, but the authorities were relentless in persecuting any ex-colleagues who dared to challenge the regime. Over the following months, Hranouski received a tip-off from his contacts within the system that a criminal case was being prepared against him.</p> <p>He packed his documents and belongings and decided to flee to Kharkiv, as he had a friend who lived there. Back then, before the full-scale war, it was still possible to cross the border to Ukraine by bus.</p> <p>Once in Kharkiv, Hranouski joined the Ukrainian army, prepared to fight against Russia. What he did not expect was that, in 2022, Belarus would become a co-aggressor in the conflict, with many of his former colleagues still standing by the regime\u2019s side.</p> <p>In September that year, he joined the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski regiment after its troops shared their vision of fighting not only for Ukraine but also for a Belarus free from dictatorship.</p> <p>The regiment\u2019s mission states that it hopes for the \u201cliberation of Belarus through the liberation of Ukraine\u201d, believing that Ukrainian victory in the war would trigger the collapse of the Putin regime and, by extension, the Lukashenko dictatorship in Belarus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/22/observer-view-belarus-rogue-regime-relationship-russia\">The Observer view on Belarus\u2019s rogue regime and its ties to Russia | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since he joined, Hranouski has fought in dozens of frontline battles, survived the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/surrounded-and-outgunned-ukraines-tank-crews-prepare-for-battle-of-bakhmut\">siege of Bakhmut</a> and lost four close friends on the battlefield.</p> <p>Lukashenko\u2019s government recently declared the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski regiment <a href=\"https://racyja.com/en/politics/the-dictatorial-regime-recognized-kalinouski-regiment-as-a-terrorist-organization/\">a terrorist organisation</a> and began detaining the relatives of those serving in Ukraine. In Belarus, Hranouski faces multiple criminal charges, including for mercenary activity, participating in an extremist organisation and high treason.</p> <p>Most of his former colleagues consider him a traitor. Hranouski suggests it is because independent thought is not allowed inside the police, only blind obedience of orders.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is focused on their own wellbeing. In Belarus, the average policeman earns about 900 Belarusian rubles [\u00a3210] a month \u2013 just enough to rent a one-bedroom flat in Minsk and buy food. It\u2019s no surprise that many frustrated, small-minded people would turn on each other for a tiny bonus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He tried to maintain contact with a few \u201creasonable\u201d ex-friends, but eventually the communication faded, he said. Now their shared past in Belarus no longer matters, and he said it does not bother him that there could be former comrades on the other side of the lines. \u201cI watched my Ukrainian brother get torn apart right in front of me at the beginning of the invasion. Why would I care about those who support the killers?\u201d</p>",

He was allowed to leave the force, but the authorities were relentless in persecuting any ex-colleagues who dared to challenge the regime. Over the following months, Hranouski received a tip-off from his contacts within the system that a criminal case was being prepared against him. He packed his documents and belongings and decided to flee to Kharkiv, as he had a friend who lived there. Back then, before the full-scale war, it was still possible to cross the border to Ukraine by bus. Once in Kharkiv, Hranouski joined the Ukrainian army, prepared to fight against Russia. What he did not expect was that, in 2022, Belarus would become a co-aggressor in the conflict, with many of his former colleagues still standing by the regime\u2019s side. In September that year, he joined the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski regiment after its troops shared their vision of fighting not only for Ukraine but also for a Belarus free from dictatorship. The regiment\u2019s mission states that it hopes for the \u201cliberation of Belarus through the liberation of Ukraine\u201d, believing that Ukrainian victory in the war would trigger the collapse of the Putin regime and, by extension, the Lukashenko dictatorship in Belarus. Since he joined, Hranouski has fought in dozens of frontline battles, survived the siege of Bakhmut and lost four close friends on the battlefield. Lukashenko\u2019s government recently declared the Kastu\u015b Kalino\u016dski regiment a terrorist organisation and began detaining the relatives of those serving in Ukraine. In Belarus, Hranouski faces multiple criminal charges, including for mercenary activity, participating in an extremist organisation and high treason. Most of his former colleagues consider him a traitor. Hranouski suggests it is because independent thought is not allowed inside the police, only blind obedience of orders. \u201cEveryone is focused on their own wellbeing. In Belarus, the average policeman earns about 900 Belarusian rubles [\u00a3210] a month \u2013 just enough to rent a one-bedroom flat in Minsk and buy food. It\u2019s no surprise that many frustrated, small-minded people would turn on each other for a tiny bonus,\u201d he said. He tried to maintain contact with a few \u201creasonable\u201d ex-friends, but eventually the communication faded, he said. Now their shared past in Belarus no longer matters, and he said it does not bother him that there could be former comrades on the other side of the lines. \u201cI watched my Ukrainian brother get torn apart right in front of me at the beginning of the invasion. Why would I care about those who support the killers?\u201d",

But troubles looming over Volkswagen, where unions are battling threats of layoffs and factory closures, have raised questions not just about its future but the wider European car industry. Those fears have been fuelled by China muscling in on the EU\u2019s home turf with its cheaper electric vehicles, and the slow death of the combustion engine. The EU, US and Canada have announced plans to limit sales of Chinese-made electric vehicles with tariffs, but some European car manufacturers warn they will have a cannibalistic effect on a sector that was once the envy of the world, expediting the closure of plants in places like Germany. The sense of urgency across the European industry was plain to see at the this Paris motor show, where Chinese manufacturers underlined their determination to eat into the European market, the biggest open to them after the US slapped 100% tariffs on electric vehicle imports. Under spotlights on the cavernous floor of the Porte de Versailles expo centre, nine Chinese companies unveiled new cars and strategic plans to make further inroads in Europe. Tariffs have been met with mixed reactions from the continent\u2019s car bosses. Carlos Tavares, the boss of Stellantis, owner of Citro\u00ebn, Fiat, Vauxhall and Jeep brands, said the cumulative effect of the EU tariffs would lead to further erosion of the European industry.

Her campaign called Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania rally \u201cjunk\u201d, saying he had focused on the issue \u201cmost important to voters in this election: a deceased golfer\u2019s \u2018anatomy\u2019.\u201d In Atlanta, Harris said Trump was \u201ccruel\u201d for how he talked about the grieving family of a Georgia mother who died after complications from an abortion pill. Harris blamed Amber Thurman\u2019s death on Georgia\u2019s abortion restrictions and referenced a clip of Trump at a Fox News town hall. When asked about the Thurman family joining a separate media call, Trump reportedly said \u201cwe\u2019ll get better ratings, I promise.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump still refuses to take accountability, to take any accountability, for the pain and the suffering he has caused,\u201d Harris said. Harris repeated her call for a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and said it was important to seize the opportunity provided by the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Harris dodged a question on whether Arab American and Muslim anger over US support for Israel could cost her the election in the battleground state of Michigan, but said she would continue speaking out about the tragic loss of innocent lives. \u201cI speak publicly all the time about the fact that there are so many tragic stories coming from Gaza,\u201d Harris said. Donald Trump election news and updates In Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Trump said Harris is further to the left than Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, adding \u201cYou have to tell Kamala Harris that you\u2019ve had enough, that you just can\u2019t take it any more.\u201d Trump underscored the importance of the eastern state\u2019s electoral college delegates to the overall election: \u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign may be failing to reach thousands of voters they hope to turn out in Arizona and Nevada, with roughly a quarter of door-knocks done by America Pac flagged by its canvassing app as potentially fraudulent, according to leaked data and people familiar with the matter. The Trump campaign earlier this year outsourced the bulk of its ground game to America Pac, the political action committee founded by Elon Musk, betting that spending millions to turn out Trump supporters, especially those who don\u2019t typically vote, would boost returns. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Early voting also began on Saturday in Nevada, where Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Las Vegas. The former president poked fun at Trump, telling the audience \u201cwe don\u2019t need to see what an older, loonier Donald trump with no guard rails looks like.\u201d Billionaire Mark Cuban \u2013 who has emerged as an energetic campaign surrogate for Harris \u2013 has told the Guardian that Trump\u2019s planned tariffs could put \u201csmall retailers and manufacturers out of business.\u201d \u201cSmall businesses don\u2019t have the pricing elasticity of larger companies. They can\u2019t pass on the incremental and administrative costs associated with tariffs.\u201d Elsewhere another billionaire \u2013 Elon Musk \u2013 campaigned for Trump in Pennsylvania. Speaking in Harrisburg, he announced he would start to randomly distribute cash awards \u2013 $1m each day until the election \u2013 to a registered voter in the state who signed his organisation\u2019s petition. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has taken an increasingly visible role in Trump\u2019s campaign and has donated almost $75m to his political organisation America PAC.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal National party leader, David Crisafulli, has promised to introduce \u201cmandatory isolation periods\u201d for children who assault workers in youth detention, as the Queensland opposition formally launched its state election campaign on Sunday. Speaking to a crowd of LNP candidates and party faithful in Ipswich, Crisafulli focused much of his remarks on what he has dubbed the state\u2019s \u201cyouth crime crisis\u201d. The opposition leader was introduced by Cindy Micallef, the daughter of a stabbing victim, Vyleen White. Crisafulli announced a new detention policy, dubbed \u201cdetention with purpose\u201d, which he said would include \u201cminimum isolation periods for youth who commit assault in detention\u201d. Experts have long been concerned at the extent of the use of \u201cseparation\u201d in Queensland\u2019s youth detention centres and believe the practice is a key reason why 96% of children reoffend after release. Guardian Australia revealed last year that some children held at the Cleveland youth detention centre in Townsville were receiving little or no education or rehabilitation programs, largely due to the amount of time they were held in solitary confinement. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Crisafulli said his plan would be to make education \u201ccompulsory\u201d in youth detention. He told reporters afterwards that stronger punishments for assaulting workers would help to attract more workers and in turn reduce the extent to which children were isolated due to staff shortages. He also said the LNP would introduce a \u201cprivilege-based system\u201d and that televisions in cells, for instance, would be a reward for good behaviour. \u201cIf the state is taking over responsibility for their care, we must make sure they use their time to become better people, not better criminals,\u201d he said. \u201c[Youth crime] is a topic this government hasn\u2019t wanted to speak about the entire campaign,\u201d he said. The premier, Steven Miles, responded on Sunday saying: \u201cmandatory solitary confinement will not prevent a single crime\u201d. \u201cThe fact is, education is already mandatory in our detention facilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been doing over time is increasing access to schooling and increasing access to health care services because so many of the young people entering our detention system are suffering from mental health, alcohol and drug abuse issues.\u201d In front of a crowd of about 150 loyalists, Crisafulli implored Queenslanders \u201cwherever they live, whatever they do, however they\u2019ve voted before \u2026 to vote for a fresh start\u201d. Outside the venue, union and pro-choice protesters called on candidates and others attending to \u201ctell us how you\u2019re going to vote\u201d on abortion, amid speculation of a conscience vote to restrict abortion rights in the next parliament. Crisafulli and the LNP have repeatedly said they have \u201cruled out\u201d changes to the state\u2019s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion but candidates have all refused to say how they would vote if a reform bill came before the next parliament. The deputy opposition leader, Jarrod Bleijie, joked that the protesters \u201cwent a little quiet earlier so I went out and gave them a wave\u201d. Bleijie predicted intensifying attacks in the final week of the campaign, with polls tightening slightly but still pointing to a comfortable LNP win. \u201cThe union movement, I\u2019d say they haven\u2019t even started yet. The money they\u2019ll spend in the next few days to cling to power, you\u2019ve seen nothing like it before.\u201d \u2022 On 20 October 2024 the headline of this story was changed to clarify that the policy would apply to young offenders who assault prison guards",

      "body": "<p>Kamala Harris highlighted the threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights and Donald Trump\u2019s apparent exhaustion at a rally Saturday in south Atlanta, continuing a full-court press for votes in Georgia as early voting breaks records here.</p> \n<p>The race continues to appear close in Georgia, with polls suggesting the Republican nominee holds a one-point lead in the state. Trump has made multiple appearances in Georgia and has a rally with Turning Point Action planned in Gwinnett county, outside Atlanta, next week.</p> \n<p>However, the National Rifle Association canceled a planned Saturday rally with Trump in Savannah, citing a \u201cscheduling conflict\u201d. Trump has also canceled several news interviews over the last week.</p> \n<p>The Trump campaign has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-energy-exhausted-harris-election-9991a8973f6d22b8955d01cf0b169cb3\">angrily pushed back</a> against a suggestion raised by a staffer that Trump had been exhausted by the appearances. But Harris has seized the idea as a rallying cry.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd now, he\u2019s ducking debates, and canceling interviews because of exhaustion,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd when he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed that he tends to go off script and ramble, and generally for the life of him can\u2019t finish a thought? \u2026 Folks are exhausted with someone trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. We\u2019re exhausted. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s time to turn the page on that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris returned to familiar themes on a day of perfect Atlanta weather, describing the \u201copportunity economy\u201d as one that brings down the cost of living for prescription medication, groceries and housing through anti-price-gouging initiatives, while providing financial support for new parents and entrepreneurs.</p> \n<p>Extending Medicare coverage for home healthcare services would prevent working adults from having to quit a productive job or spend down savings to take care of aging parents. \u201cIt\u2019s about dignity,\u201d she said in the city\u2019s Lakewood Amphitheater.</p> \n<p>Harris will attend services Sunday at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, a majority-Black megachurch in the heart of Atlanta\u2019s Black suburbs in south DeKalb county. New Birth and other large Black churches in Georgia traditionally organize a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push on Sunday early voting days.</p> \n<p>As of 5pm Saturday, about 1.3 million Georgians had cast ballots early in person, more than double the 2020 pace on the fifth day of early voting in Georgia.

      "bodyText": "Kamala Harris highlighted the threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights and Donald Trump\u2019s apparent exhaustion at a rally Saturday in south Atlanta, continuing a full-court press for votes in Georgia as early voting breaks records here. The race continues to appear close in Georgia, with polls suggesting the Republican nominee holds a one-point lead in the state. Trump has made multiple appearances in Georgia and has a rally with Turning Point Action planned in Gwinnett county, outside Atlanta, next week. However, the National Rifle Association canceled a planned Saturday rally with Trump in Savannah, citing a \u201cscheduling conflict\u201d. Trump has also canceled several news interviews over the last week. The Trump campaign has angrily pushed back against a suggestion raised by a staffer that Trump had been exhausted by the appearances. But Harris has seized the idea as a rallying cry. \u201cAnd now, he\u2019s ducking debates, and canceling interviews because of exhaustion,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd when he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed that he tends to go off script and ramble, and generally for the life of him can\u2019t finish a thought? \u2026 Folks are exhausted with someone trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. We\u2019re exhausted. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s time to turn the page on that.\u201d Harris returned to familiar themes on a day of perfect Atlanta weather, describing the \u201copportunity economy\u201d as one that brings down the cost of living for prescription medication, groceries and housing through anti-price-gouging initiatives, while providing financial support for new parents and entrepreneurs. Extending Medicare coverage for home healthcare services would prevent working adults from having to quit a productive job or spend down savings to take care of aging parents. \u201cIt\u2019s about dignity,\u201d she said in the city\u2019s Lakewood Amphitheater. Harris will attend services Sunday at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, a majority-Black megachurch in the heart of Atlanta\u2019s Black suburbs in south DeKalb county. New Birth and other large Black churches in Georgia traditionally organize a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d push on Sunday early voting days. As of 5pm Saturday, about 1.3 million Georgians had cast ballots early in person, more than double the 2020 pace on the fifth day of early voting in Georgia. In 2020, about 2.7 million out of 5 million voters cast ballots early in person, with more than two-thirds of votes cast before election day.
