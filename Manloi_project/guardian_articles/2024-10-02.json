Council leaders are concerned town halls are at risk of becoming \u201ccare authorities\u201d focused primarily on the provision of care packages to an expanding number of at-risk children and frail adults at the expense of other services. Some top-tier councils are already spending as much as 70-80% of their annual revenue budget on adults and children\u2019s social care \u2013 up from about 50% a decade ago \u2013 and say costs in these areas are rising and increasingly unsustainable. Without more government funding, even stripping back mandatory non-care services such as waste collection to legal minimum levels may not be enough to prevent authorities from effective bankruptcy, the County Councils Network (CCN) said.

A recent survey of the CCN\u2019s 37 member authorities suggested that as many as 16 county or unitary councils were at risk of insolvency by 2026 if ministers failed to address the financial and service demand challenges facing local government, the CCN said. By law, councils must provide educational services, child and adult social care, waste collection, public health services, planning and housing services, road maintenance and library provision. However, the precise level of statutory provision is not easily defined \u2013 many councils have lawfully closed many of their libraries.

Ministers would therefore have no choice but to radically rethink the statutory responsibilities placed upon councils to prevent six in 10 declaring bankruptcy by 2028.\u201d Top-tier councils\u2019 financial challenges are fuelled by record numbers of children taken into care \u2013 councils are charged more than \u00a3250,000 a year for some specialist placements \u2013 and growing numbers of disabled adults and vulnerable older people. They are also reeling from the rapid increase in Send services, the cost of which has more than doubled to \u00a39bn in the past decade, and rising bills for providing home to school transport for disabled children.

      "bodyText": "The number of people out of work due to ill health is growing by 300,000 a year, according to fresh analysis by a leading health thinktank. People of working age who quit their job due to ill health were also three times less likely to return to employment than those in good health, adding to the number of people claiming disability benefits, the Health Foundation said. Official data has dashed hopes that the effects of the pandemic would fade and the labour market would return to the situation seen before the pandemic. The foundation said that, in addition to 4 million working-age people out of work with ill health, there were now 3.9 million people with work-limiting health conditions in employment \u2013 an increase of 1.5 million since 2013. Indicating that the UK has seen a significant increase in the number of working-age people with disabilities that affect how they do their job, the foundation\u2019s report showed that these workers were three times more likely to leave the workforce than those in good health. While unemployment has increased only slightly since the onset of high inflation and the cost of living crisis in 2021, the number of people suffering mental and physical health issues has soared. Reports from the Bank of England have highlighted how a lack of workers in key industries has forced employers to pay higher wages, preventing prices from stabilising and having knock-on effects on the economy. Bank officials kept interest rates at 5% at their last meeting, saying they wanted to see more data indicating a return to previous levels of participation in the labour market, easing price pressures, before they cut the cost of borrowing. The foundation said the report\u2019s findings were part of an interim study by the Commission for Healthier Working Lives, to examine the growing challenges of working-age ill health. Drawing on insights from employers, experts and the public, the report argues that the government needs to adopt new measures to support people with health conditions and help them back to work when possible. The report said that support for workers with health conditions \u201coften comes too late or is absent\u201d. It said: \u201cFewer than half of UK workers have access to occupational health services, the fit note system is ineffective and statutory sick pay is less generous than in other countries.\u201d \u201cWhile many employers want to help, they often lack the capacity or knowledge, especially smaller businesses,\u201d it said. Sacha Romanovitch, chair of the Commission for Healthier Working Lives, said ministers needed to develop a strategy that supports a healthier workforce. In the run-up to this month\u2019s budget, and an employment white paper expected in the autumn, Romanovitch said the government needed to clear the backlog of \u201cAccess to Work\u201d claims \u201cso that people with disabilities and health conditions receive the support they are entitled to without delay\u201d. She added that there also needed to be a review of working practices in the public sector where rates of work-related ill health have soared. \u201cThe evidence in this report shows that, despite common misconceptions, many people with long-term health conditions are eager to work and can contribute meaningfully to the economy, yet often lack the support and flexibility they need,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, Liberal MP Ben Hood introduced a bill to the South Australian parliament that would require anyone seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days to give birth. Joanna Howe, a law professor and anti-abortion advocate, supports Hood, <a href=\"https://thedailyaus.com.au/stories/bill-introduced-in-south-australia-to-ban-abortions-after-28-weeks/\">asserting</a> that women \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d want this bill to pass.</p> <p>I find myself questioning who these women might be and wondering if any of them have faced the heart-wrenching decision to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester.</p> <p>After enduring two painful ectopic pregnancies and a miscarriage, I longed for my daughter Asha. My pregnancy was far from straightforward; I alternated between the excitement of becoming her mother and intense anxiety about everything that could go wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If these women were forced to give birth, who would we be protecting?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I experienced bleeding and had ultrasounds that consistently indicated Asha was smaller than she should be, I tried to raise the alarm. Initially, my doctors dismissed my concerns, convinced that I must have my dates wrong. But at 28 weeks, when Asha was the size of a 22-week-old foetus, they conducted tests.</p> <p>Hearing the results still haunts me. Asha had something called triploidy, a genetic condition characterised by an extra set of chromosomes. The doctors were surprised she had survived so long, explaining that most babies with triploidy rarely made it past the first or second trimester.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/26/a-south-australian-mps-mad-anti-abortion-bill-shows-the-culture-wars-are-far-from-over\">A South Australian MP\u2019s mad anti-abortion bill shows the culture wars are far from over | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I soon learned that Asha\u2019s chances of survival weren\u2019t good: few babies with triploidy live through birth, and if they do, most suffer and die within hours or days. Carrying a baby with triploidy also poses significant risks to the mother. This left me with two options: continue the pregnancy, knowing that Asha would likely die \u2013 in utero, at birth, or shortly thereafter. Or I could seek approval for a late-term abortion.</p> <p>My doctors made it clear that only I could make the decision, but I would have to get permission from a panel of medical professionals if I chose to terminate.</p> <p>Asha was 29 weeks along at this stage, and the thought of waiting for her to die inside me filled me with dread. Imagining her death during labour or shortly after was no better. Conversely, a termination meant choosing to end her life on my terms and taking responsibility for that. Both felt wrong. I was racked with guilt and uncertainty. It was unbearable.</p>    <p>A week later, I went into hospital for a termination. I had to be induced, and I gave birth to Asha, weighing only 600 grams. She was beautiful, like a delicate doll with my own lips and nose. After holding her for hours, I gently bathed and dressed her and took photos and footprints of her perfect tiny feet. My closest family members held her. And for the rest of the night, I cradled her in my arms, unwilling to let go.</p> <p>In the morning, she felt so cold and when her skin began to change colour, I knew I had to say goodbye. The nurse took her away, but I struggled to leave the hospital and face her empty room back home.</p>    <p>Ben Hood can\u2019t possibly comprehend these experiences. He claims that we need to protect the most vulnerable from termination. He cites the 47 terminations conducted in South Australia over an 18-month period after the threshold of 22 weeks and 6 days. A closer look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/south-australia-late-term-abortion-bill-liberal-party-greens-ntwnfb\">shows</a> that 80% of these cases were due to risks to the mother\u2019s health, while the remainder involved foetal anomalies.</p> <p>If these women were forced to give birth, who would we be protecting?</p> <p>Howe claims that Hood\u2019s legislation is not anti-woman or anti-abortion, yet it completely disregards people like me. No one wants to find themselves in the position of having to make such a choice. Even more importantly, no one wants someone else dictating such a deeply personal decision for them and their baby. These choices are never made lightly and are often the result of heartbreaking circumstances.</p> <p>Forcing a woman to give up her autonomy in such situations completely undermines her humanity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/26/a-south-australian-mps-mad-anti-abortion-bill-shows-the-culture-wars-are-far-from-over\">Van Badham questioned</a> whether Hood\u2019s bill may be strategic in nature, igniting moral outrage. It speaks to the culture wars and echoes Trumpism, fanning the flames of moral absolutism and division; a move made by someone who is trying to gain more power. But we do not need culture-war inspired proposals or more powerful politicians; we need compassion. Shaming women who face what I lived through is cruel. We should support them, for they must make a near-impossible choice.</p> <p>\u2022 Ruth Milne is a writer based in Perth, Australia.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Liberal MP Ben Hood introduced a bill to the South Australian parliament that would require anyone seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days to give birth. Joanna Howe, a law professor and anti-abortion advocate, supports Hood, asserting that women \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d want this bill to pass. I find myself questioning who these women might be and wondering if any of them have faced the heart-wrenching decision to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester. After enduring two painful ectopic pregnancies and a miscarriage, I longed for my daughter Asha. My pregnancy was far from straightforward; I alternated between the excitement of becoming her mother and intense anxiety about everything that could go wrong. When I experienced bleeding and had ultrasounds that consistently indicated Asha was smaller than she should be, I tried to raise the alarm. Initially, my doctors dismissed my concerns, convinced that I must have my dates wrong. But at 28 weeks, when Asha was the size of a 22-week-old foetus, they conducted tests. Hearing the results still haunts me. Asha had something called triploidy, a genetic condition characterised by an extra set of chromosomes. The doctors were surprised she had survived so long, explaining that most babies with triploidy rarely made it past the first or second trimester. I soon learned that Asha\u2019s chances of survival weren\u2019t good: few babies with triploidy live through birth, and if they do, most suffer and die within hours or days. Carrying a baby with triploidy also poses significant risks to the mother. This left me with two options: continue the pregnancy, knowing that Asha would likely die \u2013 in utero, at birth, or shortly thereafter. Or I could seek approval for a late-term abortion. My doctors made it clear that only I could make the decision, but I would have to get permission from a panel of medical professionals if I chose to terminate. Asha was 29 weeks along at this stage, and the thought of waiting for her to die inside me filled me with dread. Imagining her death during labour or shortly after was no better. Conversely, a termination meant choosing to end her life on my terms and taking responsibility for that. Both felt wrong. I was racked with guilt and uncertainty. It was unbearable. A week later, I went into hospital for a termination. I had to be induced, and I gave birth to Asha, weighing only 600 grams. She was beautiful, like a delicate doll with my own lips and nose. After holding her for hours, I gently bathed and dressed her and took photos and footprints of her perfect tiny feet. My closest family members held her. And for the rest of the night, I cradled her in my arms, unwilling to let go. In the morning, she felt so cold and when her skin began to change colour, I knew I had to say goodbye. The nurse took her away, but I struggled to leave the hospital and face her empty room back home. Ben Hood can\u2019t possibly comprehend these experiences. He claims that we need to protect the most vulnerable from termination. He cites the 47 terminations conducted in South Australia over an 18-month period after the threshold of 22 weeks and 6 days. A closer look shows that 80% of these cases were due to risks to the mother\u2019s health, while the remainder involved foetal anomalies. If these women were forced to give birth, who would we be protecting? Howe claims that Hood\u2019s legislation is not anti-woman or anti-abortion, yet it completely disregards people like me. No one wants to find themselves in the position of having to make such a choice. Even more importantly, no one wants someone else dictating such a deeply personal decision for them and their baby. These choices are never made lightly and are often the result of heartbreaking circumstances. Forcing a woman to give up her autonomy in such situations completely undermines her humanity. Van Badham questioned whether Hood\u2019s bill may be strategic in nature, igniting moral outrage. It speaks to the culture wars and echoes Trumpism, fanning the flames of moral absolutism and division; a move made by someone who is trying to gain more power. But we do not need culture-war inspired proposals or more powerful politicians; we need compassion. Shaming women who face what I lived through is cruel. We should support them, for they must make a near-impossible choice. \u2022 Ruth Milne is a writer based in Perth, Australia.

      "bodyText": "Special counsel prosecutors intend to make Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president Mike Pence and efforts to recruit fake Trump electors the centerpiece of the criminal prosecution against the former president, according to a sprawling legal brief that was partly unsealed on Wednesday. The redacted brief, made public by the presiding US district judge Tanya Chutkan, shows prosecutors are relying extensively on Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Pence to support the charge that Trump conspired to obstruct the January 6 certification of the election results. And prosecutors used an equally voluminous portion of the 165-page brief to express their intent to use evidence of Trump trying to get officials in seven key swing states to reverse his defeat to support the charges that he conspired to disenfranchise American voters. The brief\u2019s principal mission was to convince Chutkan to allow the allegations and evidence buttressing the superseding indictment against Trump to proceed to trial, arguing that it complied with the US supreme court\u2019s recent ruling that gave former presidents immunity for official acts. As part of the ruling, the court ordered Chutkan to sort through the indictment and decide which of the allegations against Trump should be tossed because of the immunity rules and which could proceed to trial. The brief was the first round of that process that could take months to resolve and involve hearings to decide what allegations should be kept. Chutkan has the power to decide how much of the indictment can be kept and what evidence can be presented by prosecutors as she makes her decision. According to the redacted brief, prosecutors want to use Trump\u2019s conversations with Pence in the lead-up to the January 6 Capitol attack, interactions between Trump and Pence and other private actors, as well as interactions between White House aides and private actors. The bottom line from prosecutors was that each of the episodes reflected Trump acting not as president but as a candidate for office, which meant the default presumption that conversations between Trump and Pence were official could be rebutted. For instance, prosecutors argued that evidence of Trump using personal lawyers Rudy Giuliani or John Eastman to pressure Pence should be permitted, since using private actors to commit a crime would not be an official act of the presidency or infringe on the functioning of the executive branch. At the White House on 4 January 2021, prosecutors wrote, Trump deliberately excluded his White House counsel from attending a meeting with Pence \u2013 meaning the only attorney in the room was Eastman. \u201cIt is hard to imagine stronger evidence that the conduct is private than when the president excludes his White House counsel and only wishes to have his private counsel present,\u201d the brief said. And on a 5 January 2021 phone call, prosecutors wrote, Trump and Eastman were the only ones on the line to make a final effort to pressure Pence to drop his objections and agree not to count slates of electors for Joe Biden when he presided over the congressional certification the next day. \u201cFor the defendant\u2019s decision to include private actors in the conversation with Pence about his role at the certification makes even more clear that there is no danger to the executive branch\u2019s functions and authority, because it had no bearing on any executive branch authority,\u201d it said. Prosecutors added that the conversations between Trump and Pence that they wanted to present at trial should be allowed because there was nothing official about them discussing electoral prospects as candidates for office. Referencing previously undisclosed evidence, prosecutors showed that Pence at various points suggested that \u201cthe process was over\u201d and that Trump consider running again in 2024 \u2013 key evidence that Trump was on notice from his own running mate that he had lost the election. And prosecutors reiterated that charging the most damning evidence that Trump\u2019s lawyers knew they were violating the law \u2013 emails where Eastman asked Pence\u2019s counsel Greg Jacob to consider one more \u201cminor violation\u201d of the Electoral Count Act \u2013 did not impact the functioning of the executive branch. The expansive brief also included prosecutors asking to take to trial evidence of Trump\u2019s effort to pressure state officials to reverse the results and his effort to then rely on fake slates of electors. The response from Trump\u2019s lawyers is almost certain to be that Trump was calling state officials because he was executing the clause in the US constitution that the president has a duty to ensure the general election was run without interference or fraud. But prosecutors included a pre-emptive rebuttal: \u201cAlthough countless federal, state, and local races also were on the same ballots \u2026 the defendant focused only on his own race, the election for president, and only on allegations favoring him as a candidate in targeted states he had lost.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>One million people in England now vape despite never having been regular smokers, a seven-fold increase in just three years, according to research that has prompted alarm among health experts.</p> <p>Rates of e-cigarette use among adults who had never regularly smoked were stable until 2021, when one in 200 \u2013 about 133,000 people \u2013 were vapers. However, the proportion has increased sharply to one in 28 in 2024 \u2013 1,006,000 people \u2013 a study <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00183-X/fulltext\">published in The Lancet Public Health journal</a> suggests.</p> <p>Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics also published this week show 5.1 million people aged 16 or over in Britain \u2013 about one in 10 \u2013 use e-cigarettes. Vaping rates were highest among those aged 16 to 24, at 15.8%, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2023\">the ONS found</a>.</p> <p>Prof Nick Hopkinson, a respiratory physician and chair of Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cVaping has helped millions of adults quit smoking and is much less harmful than smoking. However, it is not risk-free and high levels of use among young people and growing use among never smokers is a concern.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Sanjay Agrawal, the Royal College of Physician\u2019s special adviser on tobacco, said \u201curgent action\u201d was required to tackle the rise in vaping among young people and those who had never smoked.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhile e-cigarettes remain a valuable tool for helping smokers quit, it is essential that their use doesn\u2019t create new public health risks, particularly among children.\u201d </p> <p>The Lancet study led by UCL found that most of the people now using e-cigarettes who had never regularly smoked were vaping daily and over a sustained period. The dramatic increase was largely driven by young adults, with one in seven 18- to 24-year-olds (14%) in England who never regularly smoked now using e-cigarettes, the researchers said.</p> <p>They warned that banning disposable vapes, which the government plans to do, was unlikely to fix the problem because some brands had already launched reusable products. Instead, they suggested, there should be stricter regulation to make the products look less appealing.</p> <p>Prof Jamie Brown, of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care and a senior author of the study, said: \u201cThese findings are a reminder that action is required to try to minimise vaping among young people who have never previously smoked. However, a balancing act is required to avoid deterring smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit.</p> <p>\u201cBanning disposables, as the UK government currently plans, is unlikely to fix the issue as popular brands have already launched reusable products with very similar designs and prices.</p> <p>\u201cA sensible next step would be to introduce stricter regulation around product appearance, packaging and marketing, as those are less likely to reduce the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation \u2013 unlike, for instance, flavour bans.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that overall vaping prevalence appears to have levelled off since 2023 may reassure policymakers that it would be reasonable to begin with these measures and assess their impact.\u201d</p> <p>The Lancet study looked at survey data collected between 2016 and 2024 from 153,073 adults in England, of whom 94,107 had never regularly smoked tobacco. People were classed as never-regular-smokers if they said: \u201cI have never been a smoker (smoked for a year or more).\u201d</p>    <p>Before 2021, the proportion of never-regular-smokers who vaped in England was low, at an average of 0.5% between 2016 and 2020. This increased to 3.5% by April 2024 \u2013 just over 1 million vapers. Among these, more than half (an estimated 588,000) were aged between 18 and 24, the study found.</p> <p>The researchers also found that in recent years people who had never regularly smoked tended to be younger, more were women, and more were drinking at increasing or higher-risk levels.</p> <p>They also tended to have been vaping for longer, were more likely to use disposable devices and the highest-strength nicotine e-liquids, and bought products from supermarkets or convenience stores.</p> <p>The lead author, Dr Sarah Jackson of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, said: \u201cThe public health impact of this substantial rise in vaping among people who have never regularly smoked will depend on what these people would otherwise be doing.</p> <p>\u201cIt is likely that some would have smoked if vaping were not an available option. In this case, vaping is clearly less harmful. However, for those who would not have gone on to smoke, vaping regularly over a sustained period poses more risk than not vaping.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00166-X/fulltext\">a second study published simultaneously in the Lancet Public Health</a> concluded that accelerating measures to eliminate tobacco smoking could help boost life expectancy and prevent millions of premature deaths worldwide by 2050.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00185-3/fulltext\">A third study also published at the same time in the same journal</a> suggested that banning the sale of tobacco to people born between 2006 and 2010 could prevent 1.2m deaths from lung cancer worldwide by 2095.</p> <p>In a statement, the Department of Health and Social care said that while vapes can be an effective way for adults to stop smoking, \u201cwe have always been clear children and adult non-smokers should not vape . . . The Tobacco and Vapes bill will protect future generations from the harms of tobacco and nicotine, saving thousands of lives and easing pressures on the NHS.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 3 October 2024 to include a comment from the Department of Health and Social Care received after publication.</p>",

Rates of e-cigarette use among adults who had never regularly smoked were stable until 2021, when one in 200 \u2013 about 133,000 people \u2013 were vapers. However, the proportion has increased sharply to one in 28 in 2024 \u2013 1,006,000 people \u2013 a study published in The Lancet Public Health journal suggests. Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics also published this week show 5.1 million people aged 16 or over in Britain \u2013 about one in 10 \u2013 use e-cigarettes. Vaping rates were highest among those aged 16 to 24, at 15.8%, the ONS found. Prof Nick Hopkinson, a respiratory physician and chair of Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u201cVaping has helped millions of adults quit smoking and is much less harmful than smoking. However, it is not risk-free and high levels of use among young people and growing use among never smokers is a concern.\u201d Prof Sanjay Agrawal, the Royal College of Physician\u2019s special adviser on tobacco, said \u201curgent action\u201d was required to tackle the rise in vaping among young people and those who had never smoked. He said: \u201cWhile e-cigarettes remain a valuable tool for helping smokers quit, it is essential that their use doesn\u2019t create new public health risks, particularly among children.\u201d The Lancet study led by UCL found that most of the people now using e-cigarettes who had never regularly smoked were vaping daily and over a sustained period. The dramatic increase was largely driven by young adults, with one in seven 18- to 24-year-olds (14%) in England who never regularly smoked now using e-cigarettes, the researchers said. They warned that banning disposable vapes, which the government plans to do, was unlikely to fix the problem because some brands had already launched reusable products. Instead, they suggested, there should be stricter regulation to make the products look less appealing. Prof Jamie Brown, of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care and a senior author of the study, said: \u201cThese findings are a reminder that action is required to try to minimise vaping among young people who have never previously smoked. However, a balancing act is required to avoid deterring smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit. \u201cBanning disposables, as the UK government currently plans, is unlikely to fix the issue as popular brands have already launched reusable products with very similar designs and prices. \u201cA sensible next step would be to introduce stricter regulation around product appearance, packaging and marketing, as those are less likely to reduce the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation \u2013 unlike, for instance, flavour bans. \u201cThe fact that overall vaping prevalence appears to have levelled off since 2023 may reassure policymakers that it would be reasonable to begin with these measures and assess their impact.\u201d The Lancet study looked at survey data collected between 2016 and 2024 from 153,073 adults in England, of whom 94,107 had never regularly smoked tobacco. People were classed as never-regular-smokers if they said: \u201cI have never been a smoker (smoked for a year or more).\u201d Before 2021, the proportion of never-regular-smokers who vaped in England was low, at an average of 0.5% between 2016 and 2020. This increased to 3.5% by April 2024 \u2013 just over 1 million vapers. Among these, more than half (an estimated 588,000) were aged between 18 and 24, the study found. The researchers also found that in recent years people who had never regularly smoked tended to be younger, more were women, and more were drinking at increasing or higher-risk levels. They also tended to have been vaping for longer, were more likely to use disposable devices and the highest-strength nicotine e-liquids, and bought products from supermarkets or convenience stores. The lead author, Dr Sarah Jackson of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, said: \u201cThe public health impact of this substantial rise in vaping among people who have never regularly smoked will depend on what these people would otherwise be doing. \u201cIt is likely that some would have smoked if vaping were not an available option. In this case, vaping is clearly less harmful. However, for those who would not have gone on to smoke, vaping regularly over a sustained period poses more risk than not vaping.\u201d Separately, a second study published simultaneously in the Lancet Public Health concluded that accelerating measures to eliminate tobacco smoking could help boost life expectancy and prevent millions of premature deaths worldwide by 2050. A third study also published at the same time in the same journal suggested that banning the sale of tobacco to people born between 2006 and 2010 could prevent 1.2m deaths from lung cancer worldwide by 2095. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social care said that while vapes can be an effective way for adults to stop smoking, \u201cwe have always been clear children and adult non-smokers should not vape . . . The Tobacco and Vapes bill will protect future generations from the harms of tobacco and nicotine, saving thousands of lives and easing pressures on the NHS.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 3 October 2024 to include a comment from the Department of Health and Social Care received after publication.",

      "bodyText": "Ben Fisher\u2019s match report is in, so I\u2019ll call it quits. What a night for the Villans. Here\u2019s that massive Champions League table, which will put a smile on Unai\u2019s face. Ignore the technical hiccup at the bottom. Emi Mart\u00ednez speaks to TNT after his late heroics: \u201cIt\u2019s unreal, it\u2019s the loudest Villa Park I\u2019ve heard since I joined the club. It\u2019s a club that\u2019s moving forward, that\u2019s the main reason why I stayed at this football club, I love playing here, I love the fans. \u201cWe are committed defensively more in Champions League, I think we need to transmit that into Premier League now, we are conceding some sloppy goals in the Premier League.\u201d On Dur\u00e1n: \u201cHe\u2019s been on fire. He came back with a different mentality this season. He\u2019s willing to work hard, pushing Ollie all the way, they can play together. \u201cIt\u2019s a night we\u2019ll remember for a long time.\u201d Bayern\u2019s unbeaten start to the season is over, and Villa have two wins from two in the Champions League. Villa Park erupts! It\u2019s the same scoreline as 1982. 90+6 min: Mart\u00ednez saves again! It\u2019s another stunner, diving to his right to deny a header from Kane, an effort that looked dead-set to be the equaliser. 90+5 min: Kane lines up for the shot \u2026 his deflected effort goes out for a corner. 90+4 min: Diego Carlos gets a yellow for handball and Bayern have a free-kick from just outside the box. What a chance this is \u2026 90+3 min: Palhinha\u2019s effort from range is blocked as Bayern run out of ideas. 90+1 min: Mart\u00ednez delivers a brilliant save for Villa, denying the onrushing Gnabry from close range after a killer ball in from the left. And now the keeper is down, seeking treatment. It\u2019s pure gamesmanship. 90 min: Kane receives the ball with his back to goal by the D but Pau Torres gets in the way. 89 min: Corner for Bayern with San\u00e9 to deliver \u2026 it\u2019s headed away by Jhon Dur\u00e1n at the near post. He\u2019s everywhere. 88 min: Diego Carlos, once again, is a wall out on the right for Villa, cutting out Musiala\u2019s ball. 87 min: Diego Carlos heads away inside the box, cutting out a cross from the left. 85 min: Bayern make two more changes, with Laimer and Kim off, Tel and Goretzka on. 84 min: Now to see if Villa can hold on. He\u2019s done it again! It\u2019s a stunning finish from the sub who can\u2019t stop scoring. The ball comes from Pau Torres in defence, and Dur\u00e1n tries to run in behind Upamecano. The centre-half is next to him but Dur\u00e1n notes that Neuer is \u2013 as per \u2013 off his line. From 20 yards or so, Dur\u00e1n uses the bounce expertly to lash a first-time hit over the keeper\u2019s head and into the net. 79 min: It\u2019s another wasted set-piece for Bayern, with Kimmich finding the safe hands of Mart\u00ednez. 78 min: Maatsen gets a little too excited in the press, bringing Laimer down to give Bayern a free-kick on the right. 77 min: The search for a clearcut chance continues, Villa\u2019s off-the-ball shape offering Bayern no space for destruction. 76 min: Palhinha replaces Pavlovic in Bayern\u2019s midfield. 75 min: The set-piece doesn\u2019t cause Villa any bother, with the hosts continuing to defend well. 74 min: Barkley is dispossessed in midfield as Bayern press forward, and a blocked cross leads to a corner. 73 min: Philogene gets on the end of a Dur\u00e1n flick-on but kicks out for a goalkick under pressure from a Bayern shirt. 71 min: It\u2019s all a bit quiet at present \u2026 though Musiala wins a free-kick to open up a crossing position from the right. Kimmich goes short with it as Bayern opt to keep knocking it about, unwilling to force it into the mixer. 70 min: Villa bring off Watkins for their super-sub Jhon Dur\u00e1n. 66 min: Gnabry earns a yellow for a rather silly challenge, bringing Watkins down inside the Bayern half. San\u00e9 replaces Olise for Bayern. 64 min: Torres saves Villa with a block in the area after Jamal Musiala, who came on at the break, jinks his way through the middle with those electric feet. 62 min: Barkley is immediately effective, bursting into space through the middle, but he can\u2019t nail the final through ball into the box. 60 min: Time for a change or two. Ross Barkley and Ian Maatsen replace Onana and Bailey (!), who came on for Ramsey in the first half! 57 min: \u2026 and after patient buildup they go down the left, with a cross finding Olise in the middle, his volley inside the area blocked by a Villa shirt. 56 min: Bayern circle the ball around, searching for a gap to cut through \u2026 54 min: There\u2019s a VAR check for a handball from Konsa inside the Villa box \u2026 which can obviously go any way nowadays. Villa survive it before Kimmich has a corner meet the sidenetting. 52 min: Gnabry has moved to the left wing this half and is starting to cause a bit of bother, providing Konsa a test after the defender handled Coman well in the first half. 51 min: Gnabry drives from the left, slides in Davies for a cut-back cross \u2026 the ball is deflected out for a Bayern corner. 50 min: Upamecano drives into Villa\u2019s half to take down Watkins \u2026 the defender needs to be a bit more careful. 49 min: Bayern\u2019s break from Villa\u2019s corner is disrupted before the visitors build again, Kimmich continuing to drop deep into the right-back position to control the game and its tempo. 48 min: Philogene skips down the left and shows off some stepovers before winning a corner. 46 min: Amadou Onana is still on Villa despite looking as if he was in a bit of discomfort in the first half. And we\u2019re back. Here\u2019s how things have gone elsewhere in Europe. Half-time wisdom from David Horn: \u201cOnce you\u2019ve sung \u2018Philogene\u2019 to the tune of \u2018Billie Jean\u2019 once, it\u2019s very hard to stop. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d Bayern have had much of the ball and looked sharp going forward \u2026 but it\u2019s Villa who had the ball in the net after a bit of chaos from a set-piece. Pau Torres was the goalscorer until the offside ruling got in the way. There\u2019ll be chances for Villa on the counter, with Bayern piling their men forward and leaving Upamecano to sweep up at the back. A ball slides through trying to find Watkins, but Upamecano intercepts for Bayern Munich before the half-time whistle. Their battle looks as if it\u2019ll be the decisive one in the second half. 45+1 min: We have two minutes added on. 45 min: Olise slides the ball to Gnabry inside the box, who flicks to Laimer, who nearly bustles his way into an effort in front of goal. Mart\u00ednez sweeps away any potential danger. 43 min: Kane launches into a lengthy dribble before launching a wayward pass; he proceeds to take Rogers down from behind. 42 min: Villa get a hold of the ball, just calming things down after a lively few minutes for Bayern. 39 min: Wow, this time Olise does shoot and it\u2019s a terrific hit. It\u2019s a curling effort cutting in from the right, aiming for the top left corner from 25 yards or so \u2026 but Mart\u00ednez leaps to somehow tip it over. 38 min: Coman pulls back for Olise on the edge of the box, who tries to sidefoot in a pass when a shot might have been the better option. 37 min: Bayern have a free-kick from distance on the right, with Kimmich to whip it in \u2026 he ambitiously has a crack at goal. It\u2019s easily swept up by Mart\u00ednez. 35 min: Kane, dropping deep, dinks a nice ball to Laimer to skip on to on the right, but the right-back\u2019s cross is deflected and finds the hands of Mart\u00ednez. 33 min: Villa will have to look for success on the counterattack, which seems possible if they have Watkins isolated with Upamecano, already on a yellow. 32 min: Kimmich continues to dictate, finding Coman on the left as Bayern turn the game into attack v defence. Villa\u2019s defensive shape holds for now. 29 min: Bayern build out brilliantly from the back, with Laimer\u2019s ball over the top finding Gnabry free to rampage down the right wing. He enters the area, should square to Kane \u2026 and instead blasts high and wide! A shocking effort and Kane is rightly furious. 27 min: An early change for Villa, with Ramsey suffering an injury. On comes Leon Bailey. 22 min: Lift off! It\u2019s really poor defending from Bayern Munich after a Digne ball in from the left is brought down by Philogene, with Pau Torres seizing upon the loose ball to expertly poke in the finish from close range. The stadium erupts until they check for offside \u2026 Ramsey was off from the free-kick that began the move. 21 min: Oooooh. Upamecano and Watkins are left one-on-one again after a long punt from Mart\u00ednez, and this time the defender\u2019s challenge is considered a foul. It\u2019s a yellow card, and this looks an enticing duel. 19 min: Prince William is here, if you care for that sort of thing. 18 min: \u2026 Olise whips in from the right, the ball is headed out before Coman fires way over the bar. 17 min: Some lovely buildup play from Bayern on the right leads to a corner \u2026 16 min: Villa Park erupts as Watkins goes down under a challenge from Upamecano, with only Neuer behind the defender. Play goes on but that could have easily been disastrous for Bayern. 15 min: Digne finally gets to cross from the left, and he finds Watkins at the far post \u2026 but he heads over, put off by his marker, Kim. 14 min: Olise brings down Digne on Villa\u2019s left before the hosts finally get their passing game going, working it across the pitch. 12 min: Kimmich is playing the quarter-back role for Bayern, springing the long diagonal passes; he finds Coman on the left. 10 min: Nothing comes of the Bayern corner before the visitors press high, suffocating Villa\u2019s attempt to play out from the back. It\u2019s been a nervy opening for the hosts. 9 min: Villa are cut open with a ball over the top from Kimmich to Gnabry inside the area, who tries to square it to Kane. The end result is a corner for Bayern. 6 min: Kane enters the game, getting his head on an excellent Kimmich cross from the right. Mart\u00ednez makes a terrific save with his left foot \u2026 but the forward was offside anyway. 5 min: Rogers meets the ball but is also greeted by a stream of Bayern shirts, the German side already looking to stop him from carrying the ball forward for Villa. 3 min: Bayern knock it around at the back, dominating the early possession. 2 min: Olise whips in a corner for Bayern, with no damage done to Villa. 1 min: Neuer spends plenty of time on the ball outside his area, waiting and assessing. There\u2019s no rushed press from Villa on to the keeper, who goes short. Villa are in their usual claret and blue, while Bayern don their all-black outfits. The visitors kick off, moving from left to right on my screen. Rio Ferdinand\u2019s getting all worked up and excited over on TNT. The players are on their way out, led by two World Cup winners: Emi Mart\u00ednez and Manuel Neuer. Villa Park is rocking. Just a few minutes now \u2026 get your cup of chamomile/whatever suits ready. Richard Hirst would like to see a certain someone back at the Cottage: \u201cNever mind about how\u2019s Kane doing, what about poor Joao, on Bayern\u2019s bench rather than gracing Fulham\u2019s midfield as we march up the table. Don\u2019t worry Joao, we\u2019ll have you back.\u201d Ben Fisher reports on one of the key subplots of the evening. The question related to Harry Kane and the easy answer was the equivalent of a tap-in but instead Ollie Watkins paused before offering a candid assessment of the nuanced dynamic at play. For Watkins, Kane is his England captain, a teammate but also, to put it bluntly, the guy he is trying to displace. How\u2019s Harry Kane doing in Germany this season, you ask? Five goals in five league games, four in one Champions League match, and a goal in the cup, too. He was an injury concern heading into this match but starts. Bayern make two changes from the XI that drew 1-1 against Leverkusen, with Konrad Laimer and Kingsley Coman in; Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro and Jamal Musiala go to the bench. Villa have one change from their 2-2 draw with Ipswich: Jaden Philogene, 19 years young, replaces Leon Bailey. Here we go: Aston Villa: Mart\u00ednez, Diego Carlos, Konsa, Torres, Digne, Onana, Ramsey, Philogene, Tielemans, Rogers, Watkins Subs: Gauci, Zych, Cash, Barkley, Dur\u00e1n, Buend\u00eda, Nedeljkovic, Maatsen, Bogarde, Bailey, Swinkels, Young Bayern Munich: Neuer, Kimmich, Kim, Upamecano, Davies, Laimer, Pavlovic, Coman, Olise, Gnabry, Kane Subs: Peretz, Ulreich, Goretzka, San\u00e9, Dier, Palhinha, Guerreiro, M\u00fcller, Tel, Musiala Hello, hello, hello and welcome to a very special evening at Villa Park. The German giants are in town for a rematch of the 1982 European Cup final, when Aston Villa triumphed 1-0 in Rotterdam. Withe, Shaw and Spink were just some of the heroes back then; tonight offers Watkins, Mart\u00ednez and others the chance to become the same. Bayern Munich, looking rejuvenated under new management, will hope to be party-poopers. They remain unbeaten this season, scored nine (!) against Dinamo Zagreb in their Champions League opener and kept up with Leverkusen over the weekend. This should be good fun. Kick-off\u2019s at 8pm BST.",

Biden\u2019s comments came after the top Israeli diplomat at the UN warned his country\u2019s retaliation for an Iranian salvo of nearly 200 ballistic missiles would be heavier than Tehran \u201ccould ever have imagined\u201d. On the same day, the Israeli chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, warned: \u201cWe have the capabilities to reach and strike any point in the Middle East\u201d, a reality that Israel\u2019s enemies would \u201csoon understand\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of his top security officials at the Israeli defence headquarters, the Kirya in Tel Aviv, on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the country\u2019s options after a round of conversations with Washington. As Israel contemplated opening a fourth front with its regional enemies, eight Israeli soldiers were confirmed killed and a significant number wounded in three clashes with Hezbollah, following Israel\u2019s first significant ground incursions across the Lebanese border since 2006. Late on Wednesday, powerful explosions were again heard in southern and central Beirut, as Lebanese authorities said that 46 people had been killed and 85 injured in Israeli attacks on the city in the previous 24 hours. A separate strike on the Syria capital Damascus reportedly killed the son-in-law of Hassan Nasrallah \u2013 the Hezbollah leader who died last week in a massive Israeli strike in Beirut. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Hassan Jaafar Qasir was among three people killed by the attack, which flattened a building in the Mazzeh district, an area favoured by Hezbollah militants and officers of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. There is general acceptance in Washington that Israel will carry out a military response to Iran\u2019s missile salvo that is almost certain to go further than the only previous Israeli airstrikes against the country, when missiles were fired at an air defence installation near Isfahan, after a previous Iranian aerial attack in April this year. But the Biden administration fears that a major Israeli response, particularly one targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, could trigger further escalation that could ultimately draw in US forces, and potentially lead to an Iranian decision to try to build nuclear weapons. Almost all the incoming Iranian missiles on Tuesday were intercepted by Israel\u2019s layered air defences, and the sole fatality was a Palestinian killed by falling debris on the West Bank.

Washington first raised the alarm a few hours before Iran\u2019s missile launch on Tuesday night and since then US officials have been locked in urgent talks with their Israeli counterparts on their country\u2019s response. Second only to nuclear sites in terms of their devastating impact, Israel is reported to be considering a broad attack on Iran\u2019s oil installations, as well as airstrikes on military bases, or targeted assassinations, which Israel has used widely in the region.

The UN security council convened on Wednesday to discuss the worsening conflict, with the secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warning that \u201ctime is running is out\u201d and that the \u201cdeadly cycle of tit-for-tat violence must stop\u201d. Iran justified its attack as self-defence in a letter to the security council saying that \u201cin full compliance with the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law, has only targeted the regime\u2019s military and security installations with its defensive missile strikes\u201d. Israel\u2019s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, rejected that claim, describing Iran\u2019s missile attack as \u201ca calculated attack on a civilian population\u201d. \u201cIsrael will respond,\u201d Danon told reporters. \u201cOur response will be decisive, and yes, it will be painful, but unlike Iran we will act in full accordance with international law.\u201d He added later that it would worse than the Iranians \u201ccould ever have imagined\u201d. The US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, called for the security council to impose \u201cserious consequences\u201d on Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, for Tuesday\u2019s attack. \u201cThe Iranian regime will be held responsible for its actions,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cAnd we strongly warn against Iran \u2013 or its proxies \u2013 taking actions against the United States, or further actions against Israel.\u201d The spreading crisis comes at a fraught moment for Joe Biden less than five weeks before an election in which he hopes to pass occupancy of the White House to his vice-president, Kamala Harris. While showing staunch support for Israel, he is seeking to stop the US being drawn directly into a conflict with Iran, well aware that Israel sees Iran\u2019s nuclear programme as a potentially existential threat but cannot inflict significant damage on it militarily on its own. \u201cIt is a widely held assumption that Netanyahu\u2019s preference, across years in government, has been to bring the US into a direct military confrontation with Iran, and that now appears to be closer to fruition than ever,\u201d Daniel Levy, the president of the US/Middle East Project policy institute, said. Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said: \u201cI think Israel\u2019s impressive successes, both in the military field and in the intelligence arena in the past few weeks have enticed some in the Biden administration, who were advising cautiousness before, to consider options of going for the jugular now and continuing to further weaken Iran and its allies in the region, or even potentially targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\u201d Vaez warned that: \u201cWhether the US is involved or not, such an attack would certainly be the last straw in Iranian political decision to develop the ultimate deterrent.\u201d",

Arne Slot: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy one, Bologna made it difficult, they man-marked all over the pitch. you have to wait for the right moment. The last pass could have been better. \u201cThe players and the staff I inherited have been great from the start. It helps that we have not changed a lot but they have really bought into it. \u201cOverall a good result but I wouldn\u2019t say I am delighted. \u201cI see when we lose the ball that heads go down. That happened a bit too much in the first half, second half we pressed better and had more control.\u201d Who cares about Prince William celebrating Villa goals? An incredible result for the club and supposedly his presence is interesting \u2026 It really has been a bad day for Atletico Madrid. What a comeback victory for the 10 men of Juve. RB Leipzig 2-3 Juventus: It is all Leipzig in the closing stages but they cannot find an equaliser. Backs against the wall time for Juve. Monaco fight back to earn point. Andy Hunter\u2019s report from Anfield is already in! The most comprehensive victory for Benfica. What a night for Lille. David\u2019s penalty is the difference. Sam Trenery says: \u201cGreat result for Liverpool, but we have to talk about the ref (unfortunately)- a series of frankly bizarre decisions culminating in a yellow for Tsimikas for what was a really good tackle. Thankfully Liverpool weren\u2019t punished for it but I have to feel for the Montenegrin teams that have to deal with him every week...\u201d A dramatic end at Villa Park but the hosts hold on. TNT needlessly scan to Prince William at full-time. Monaco look like they\u2019ve salvaged a point late on. A fine goal wins it for the Belgians. Job done for Arne Slot\u2019s men. Lille 1-0 Real Madrid: Gurler gets the wrong side of the defence but his header is straight at the goalkeeper. Lille 1-0 Real Madrid: OFF THE LINE! Tiago Santos makes up for giving the ball away by blocking a Rudiger header on the line. Juve turn defence into attack, concluding with Concei\u00e7\u00e3o showing some quick feet in the box before producing a calm finish to put the 10 men ahead. A glorious capitulation from Atletico Madrid as the penalty is slammed home by Kokcu. K\u00e1ri Tulinius emails: \u201cIt\u2019s premature to come to a conclusion about the new format when the second matchday isn\u2019t done yet, but so far it feels like the superclubs play with the intensity of a pre-season friendly, while the teams in the rungs below treat these matches like cup finals. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were a bunch of surprises.\u201d Salisu heads a corner home to give Monaco hope after a mistake from the goalkeeper. A direct pass up the pitch finds Duran around 30 yards from goal. The Colombian spots Neuer off his line and sends the ball over his head at the first time of asking. Liverpool 2-0 Bologna: The visitors claim they should have a penalty after Mac Allister makes a clearance from inside his own box, while simultaneously kicking a Bologna player. No penalty given. Done and dusted after Bah heads home a corner. Ten men? No problem. Vlahovic curls one into the top corner to level things up. \u201cOoh did you say Cambiasso?\u201d asks Charles Antaki. \u201cThat made me sit up and wonder whether, like today\u2019s Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, he\u2019d recanted his retirement and come back into The Fray. I looked harder, though and it seems that there\u2019s an errant S in there somewhere, and it\u2019s not the old warhorse at all. Shame.\u201d Sorry to build up you hopes. Liverpool 2-0 Bologna: GOAL! Alexander-Arnold slips a pass to Salah on the right wing. The Egyptian cuts in and takes aim for the top corner to make the crowd erupt. A stunning goal to settle the nerves. A cracking strike from 18 yards to double the lead. Perin is still to touch the ball as Sesko scores. RB Leipzig 1-1 Juventus: PENALTY! The resulting free-kick pings newly arrived sub Douglas Luiz in the arm in front of his face. A VAR check result in a pen. I would argue it is harsh. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: More changes for Liverpool as Tsimikas and Gakpo ready themselves for action. RB Leipzig 1-1 Juventus: RED CARD! Di Gregorio gets his marching orders after handling outside the box. A VAR check is required to make sure. Perin comes off the bench to go in goal for 10-man Juve. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: Nunez off, Jota on. In other news, Salah flashes a shot wide from the edge of the box. Lille 1-0 Real Madrid: Ancelotti send on Modric and Mbappe to try and turn things around. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: A Bologna head flicks a Robertson corner just wide. A very close to being an own goal. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: Robertson joins Van Dijk and Konate in the book. Cambiasso swings in a wonderful cross and it is a fine first-time finish from the Vlahovic. Sends Oblak the wrong way. Benfica 1-0 Atletico Madrid: PENALTY! Pavlidis goes down under pressure in the box but the referee gives nothing. After being sent to the screen he points to the spot but it is very soft. Benfica 1-0 Atletico Madrid: Simeone has sent Gallagher on at the break. Atletico were not at their best in the first half, that\u2019s for sure. Here we go again! A fine pitch. Got a lemon and ginger tea, so I am primed for the second half. Joe Pearson emails: \u201cWhile I agree with Mary Waltz that sometimes Paramount\u2019s studio show is a bit much, Meeks and Carra in particular, we as Americans bear some of the blame. The show is intentionally modeled after TNT\u2019s Inside the NBA, with resident clowns Charles Barkley and Shaq. And anyway, Mary and I are not their target audience. It\u2019s for the kids, you know?\u201d Catch up with what happened in the earlier games during the break. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna Lille 1-0 Real Madrid Dinamo Zagreb 1-0 Monaco Sturm Graz 0-1 Club Brugge Benfica 1-0 Atletico Madrid RB Leipzig 1-0 Juventus An impressive break considering the conditions concludes with a lovely dink from Sucic. Dinamo Zagreb 0-0 Monaco: The main update is that the pitch looks tricky to play on. The ball is holding up a bit. David sends Lunin the wrong way. Lille 0-0 Real Madrid: PENALTY! A Lille free-kick pings into Camavinga on the edge of the wall. His arm is out a little and VAR has a bit of interest. The referee is having a look and gives it! Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: Van Dijk goes down in the box amid a corner but the referee is not interested in the complaints. RB Leipzig 1-0 Juventus: Archie Rhind-Tutt says the difference between the two teams is that the hosts are using the ball better. Benfica 1-0 Atletico Madrid: OFF THE BAR! Lino looks to be aiming a cross for the back post but instead see the ball bounced off the bar. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: Alisson produces a decent save after Liverpool lose the ball inside their own box. Urbanski is the man who shoots and probably should do better against the Brazilian. There is now some tension inside Anfield. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: Ndoye pings the base of the post from close range. A let-off for Liverpool. The Germans go from one end to the other. Gulacsi makes a save and they break up the pitch. Openda gets it and chips to Sesko who takes an incredible touch and thrashes the ball in off the bar. A very satisfying watch. Mary Waltz emails: \u201cWill, Greetings from California. Paramount has given us the Benfica match so I appreciate the wraparound coverage of the other fixtures. I don\u2019t know if anyone else shares my opinion but the Pre and post game coverage by Scott, Henry, Carragher, and Micah is fine when they stick to soccer but the forced comedy routine where every joke elicits over the top laughter from the crew is cringe to say the least.\u201d I am pleased to not be watching. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: At some point Liverpool will wonder how they have not added a second. Nunez has a decent chance from the edge of the box but whacks it well over. Lille 0-0 Real Madrid: Two chances for David as he heads a cross straight at Lunin and can\u2019t do better with the follow up. Two decent reaction saves from the goalkeeper. What a finish! The winger controls on the ball on the left wing, takes a touch and curls the ball into the top corner. Aston Villa 0-0 Bayern Munich: NO GOAL! Pau Torres pokes home but play is brought back for an earlier offside. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: A direct ball over the top reaches Nunez, who controls it with his head before sending a weak volley straight at the goalkeeper. Lille 0-0 Real Madrid: Endrick drives forward, beating a few defenders before shooting from 15 yards but the goalkeeper blocks his effort. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: It is all Liverpool at Anfield. Szoboszlai comes close to adding a second but his shot flashes just wide. Dinamo Zagreb 0-0 Monaco: A good chance for Minamino but the goalkeeper comes out quickly. The pitch in Croatia looks awful after heavy rain. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: NO GOAL! Nunez goes too early to reach an Alexander-Arnold pass and is ruled offside after finding the back of the net. Atletico play themselves into trouble and Aursnes finds Akt\u00fcrko\u011flu in space on the edge of the box, from where he does the necessary. RB Leipzig 0-0 Juventus: Nico Gonzalez has been taken off with an injury, too. Not a good start for the Italians. Liverpool 1-0 Bologna: GOAL! Salah dinks a cross from the edge of the box over the Bologna defence to find Mac Allister and Diaz in space, with the former tapping home from close range. Form one end to the other, the Argentinian gets things going at Anfield. Liverpool 0-0 Bologna: NO GOAL! Dallinga gets the wrong side of the Liverpool defence before producing a fine finish. He runs off to celebrate but the flag is rightly erected. David Lopez scored Girona\u2019s first ever Champions League goal but the Spanish side lost 3-2 at home to Feyenoord on Wednesday in a pulsating contest in which both teams missed a penalty and there were two own goals. Lopez put Girona ahead midway through the first half, but a Yangel Herrera own goal and a strike from teenager Antoni Milambo swung the contest in the favour of the Dutch visitors. Ayase Ueda missed a penalty for Feyenoord and Bojan Miovski likewise for Girona, before former Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek drew the home side level at 2-2. That joy was short-lived though as Ladislav Krejci turned the ball into his own net to give Feyenoord the lead again and this time they held on to ensure a second consecutive defeat for Girona in their maiden Champions League campaign. Reuters RB Leipzig 0-0 Juventus: A blow for the Italians as Bremer is forced off with an injury. Gatti is on for him. Lille 0-0 Real Madrid: It is a lively night in France with a low-lying level of smoke above the pitch. Pyro galore. Liverpool 0-0 Bologna: The hosts are completing dominating proceedings. I am not sure Bologna have made it out of their own half yet. Liverpool 0-0 Bologna: Almost a very early goal for Liverpool as Gravenberch sends a low cross into the six-yard box but no one in red can convert. Posch does his best to put it into his own net but recovers to clear. Peter Oh brings his own brand to my inbox: \u201cAlisson has looked razor-sharp of late. He\u2019s clearly capable of a world-class shave I mean save. \u201cIf you ask me, the new Even Bigger Cup format is a bunch of baloney I mean Bologna.\u201d Looks like the goalkeeper has a midnight shadow to me. Peep! Peep! Peep! We are under way around Europe. I\u2019ve been at four of Liverpool\u2019s six league games this season, it\u2019s almost strange to not be at Anfield tonight. Naturally, Ryan Gravenberch has made headlines for his impressive run in a new role but I\u2019ve enjoyed watching the front three, regardless of combination. Mohamed Salah looks close to his very best. Arne Slot: \u201cIt is an opportunity, we hope we are going to take the opportunity but we face a tough opportunity. They had a very good season last season but it is not an easy one. \u201cJota didn\u2019t train for two days but I am happy he is still available. \u201cIt is difficult if you play every three or four days, it is never easy to play in Champions League or Premier League. \u201cWe need to be more aggressive without the ball and press more.\u201d Here are the results from the 5.45pm BST kick-offs: Girona 2-3 Feyenoord Shakhtar Donetsk 0-3 Atalanta Oh \u2026 GOAL! Girona 2-3 Feyenoord (Krej\u010d\u00ed og 79): As soon as they were back in it, Girona score a second own goal of the match. Jurgen Klopp is never far away. GOAL! Girona 2-2 Feyenoord (Van de Beek 73): The former United has drawn the Catalans level. We also have some pure Aston Villa v Bayern for you. Get in the mood for tonight with some preview material. GOAL! Shakhtar 0-3 Atalanta (Bellanova 48): Very much game over. Nunez starts as the central striker after missing the weekend trip to Wolves. Jota is deemed fit enough for the bench after picking up a knock at Molineux. Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Szoboszlai, Diaz; Nunez. Subs: Jaros, Kelleher, Gomez, Endo, Jones, Gakpo, Jota, Tsimikas, Quansah Morton, Bradley, Nyoni Bologna: Skorupski; Posch, Beukema, Lucum\u00ed, Miranda; Moro, Freuler, Urbanski; Orsolini, Dallinga, Ndoye Subs: Bagnolini, Ravaglia, Holm, Erlic, Castro, Iling-Junior, Casale, Corazza, Aebischer, Odgaard, Lykogiannis, Fabbian Half time scores from the early kick-offs: Girona 1-2 Feyenoord Shakhtar Donetsk 0-2 Atalanta This is what the sport needs! After a fine opening night win in Italy against Milan, this contrived new format means Liverpool are playing Italians again. This time, however, they are at home. Bologna are in town, having secured one victory in six Serie A games this season, offering little cause for optimism. Both teams had new coaches arrive over the summer but while Arne Slot has looked promising, Vincenzo Italiano is yet to make his mark. Lille are hosting Real Madrid and I think Benfica v Atletico Madrid will be fun, while RB Leipzig v Juventus will be worth keeping half an eye on. Dinamo Zagreb face Monaco and Sturm Graz welcome Club Brugge. We will also carry out a quick roundup of the early matches. Here is to a fun night!",

      "body": "<p>There are tougher tests to come and there is more work to be done, as Arne Slot frequently likes to remind Liverpool, but there is no disputing the belief, quality and momentum that is surging through this team under the guidance of their new head coach. Slot became the first Liverpool manager or head coach in history to record eight wins from his first nine matches as Bologna were dispatched in a hard-fought contest at Anfield.</p> \n<p>Alexis Mac Allister marked his and Slot\u2019s Champions League home debut for Liverpool with his first goal of the season. Mohamed Salah, having provided the pinpoint assist for the World Cup winner\u2019s opener, quashed the Italians\u2019 hopes of a point with a stunning second-half strike on Liverpool\u2019s 250th appearance in the European Cup. New leader, new era this may be, but Liverpool\u2019s promise on the European stage remains intact.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t draw any conclusions [from his record-breaking start] but it is nice,\u201d said Slot. \u201cSo many incredible managers have worked here and achieved so many special things. The only thing is, I hope when people remember me in one, two or three years\u2019 time, or however long I\u2019m here, it\u2019s not because they only say: \u2018He\u2019s the manager who won eight of his first nine games\u2019. I\u2019m hoping to achieve more special things than that. But it does say a lot about how J\u00fcrgen [Klopp] left this club, the squad I inherited, the work rate the players put in and how much my staff is helping me to get these results.

      "bodyText": "There are tougher tests to come and there is more work to be done, as Arne Slot frequently likes to remind Liverpool, but there is no disputing the belief, quality and momentum that is surging through this team under the guidance of their new head coach. Slot became the first Liverpool manager or head coach in history to record eight wins from his first nine matches as Bologna were dispatched in a hard-fought contest at Anfield. Alexis Mac Allister marked his and Slot\u2019s Champions League home debut for Liverpool with his first goal of the season. Mohamed Salah, having provided the pinpoint assist for the World Cup winner\u2019s opener, quashed the Italians\u2019 hopes of a point with a stunning second-half strike on Liverpool\u2019s 250th appearance in the European Cup. New leader, new era this may be, but Liverpool\u2019s promise on the European stage remains intact. \u201cI don\u2019t draw any conclusions [from his record-breaking start] but it is nice,\u201d said Slot. \u201cSo many incredible managers have worked here and achieved so many special things. The only thing is, I hope when people remember me in one, two or three years\u2019 time, or however long I\u2019m here, it\u2019s not because they only say: \u2018He\u2019s the manager who won eight of his first nine games\u2019. I\u2019m hoping to achieve more special things than that. But it does say a lot about how J\u00fcrgen [Klopp] left this club, the squad I inherited, the work rate the players put in and how much my staff is helping me to get these results. But I hope to be remembered for more special things than winning eight out of the first nine.\u201d Bologna deserved Liverpool\u2019s respect, Slot had insisted, having qualified for the Champions League for the first time in their history last season with a club record 68 points. Their boisterous, sold-out away support was certainly up for their inaugural away trip in the competition.

The punishment does not apply in Champions League games. Atl\u00e9tico have the right to appeal, temporarily suspending the closure.</p> \n<p>The disciplinary code contemplates fines of up to \u20ac6,000 and a one-game partial stadium closure when it is the first offence in a season, but the committee judged that Atl\u00e9tico had not taken the necessary measures to prevent the incidents considering the nature of the rivalry and the significance of the fixture. The committee said it welcomed Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s efforts to identify the perpetrators, one of whom has so far been located and banned for life, but considered retrospective action insufficient.</p> \n<p>This is the fourth time that Atl\u00e9tico have been handed punishment for the behaviour of supporters in the south stand, where members of the far-right ultra group the Frente Atl\u00e9tico gather. Last April, the stand was closed following racist abuse aimed at Nico Williams, although that punishment was not served following an appeal. Uefa punished the club when supporters performed fascist salutes during a Champions League game at Manchester City in 2022, and for the throwing of flares in the Europa League in 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"66fff6be-2fc1-4479-8014-67ac9a22b4d4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wi8OrPwLA1k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The punishment could have been greater had the objects hit Courtois but that did not prevent the committee defining the incidents as serious. \u201cAlthough the objects were small, there is no doubt that they could cause injury taking into account the distance from which some objects were thrown, with the possibility that they impact upon the head or face of the opposition goalkeeper at whom they were aimed,\u201d the judgment read.</p> \n<p>The state commission against violence, racism, xenophobia and intolerance in sport has opened a separate investigation into allegations of racist chants aimed at Vin\u00edcius.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has handed Atl\u00e9tico Madrid a \u20ac45,000 (\u00a337,000) fine and ordered a three-game partial closure of their C\u00edvitas Metropolitano stadium after Sunday night\u2019s city derby was suspended when supporters threw objects at the Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. The club could also still face further punishment as the government\u2019s anti-violence commission investigates allegations of racist abuse aimed at Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. The referee, Mateo Busquets Ferrer, took the teams off the pitch in the 68th minute, per the formal protocol, after two appeals over the loud speakers did not stop the missiles, including lighters, bottles and plastic bags. The teams returned to the pitch 15 minutes later and the game was concluded with a late Atl\u00e9tico equaliser. \u201cWe do not need these people in our stands,\u201d Diego Simeone said after the game, but he also accused Courtois of provoking supporters. The RFEF\u2019s competition committee met on Wednesday, deciding upon a \u20ac45,000 fine and the closure of the lower south stand, from where the objects came, for league games against Legan\u00e9s, Las Palmas and Alav\u00e9s. The punishment does not apply in Champions League games. Atl\u00e9tico have the right to appeal, temporarily suspending the closure. The disciplinary code contemplates fines of up to \u20ac6,000 and a one-game partial stadium closure when it is the first offence in a season, but the committee judged that Atl\u00e9tico had not taken the necessary measures to prevent the incidents considering the nature of the rivalry and the significance of the fixture. The committee said it welcomed Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s efforts to identify the perpetrators, one of whom has so far been located and banned for life, but considered retrospective action insufficient. This is the fourth time that Atl\u00e9tico have been handed punishment for the behaviour of supporters in the south stand, where members of the far-right ultra group the Frente Atl\u00e9tico gather. Last April, the stand was closed following racist abuse aimed at Nico Williams, although that punishment was not served following an appeal. Uefa punished the club when supporters performed fascist salutes during a Champions League game at Manchester City in 2022, and for the throwing of flares in the Europa League in 2018. The punishment could have been greater had the objects hit Courtois but that did not prevent the committee defining the incidents as serious. \u201cAlthough the objects were small, there is no doubt that they could cause injury taking into account the distance from which some objects were thrown, with the possibility that they impact upon the head or face of the opposition goalkeeper at whom they were aimed,\u201d the judgment read. The state commission against violence, racism, xenophobia and intolerance in sport has opened a separate investigation into allegations of racist chants aimed at Vin\u00edcius.",

      "bodyText": "Israel is enjoying a moment of military and intelligence triumph. Over two weeks, it has killed an \u201carchenemy\u201d in his secret bunker, decimated Hezbollah\u2019s leadership, blown up the militant group\u2019s communications networks and parts of its arsenal and humbled its sponsor, Iran. As its ground troops marched into Lebanon, Israel fended off a large-scale Iranian ballistic missile attack with backing from the US and other allies. Some in the Israeli government clearly want to go even further, seeing a moment that could be exploited to reshape the Middle East. Hawks argue that Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Israel gives the country greater legitimacy to attack directly and not only target Iranian proxies. Less clear is where they expect a broader Israeli campaign to lead. Israel\u2019s political and military leadership tacitly acknowledged that they could not destroy Hezbollah when they laid out their limited goals for Operation \u201cNorthern Arrows\u201d. It aims to allow residents of northern Israel to return to areas that came under Hezbollah attack after 7 October. In Gaza, by contrast, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says the war must continue until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas. The assassination of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was a tactical achievement that will hobble the group for now, and may cripple it longer term, but not a strategic one that will eliminate the threat to Israel from inside Lebanon. Israel has targeted generations of militant leaders, whose organisations survived or evolved after the assassinations. Both Nasrallah and the Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, killed earlier this year in Tehran, replaced leaders who had also been killed by Israel. Attacks of the last few weeks have been particularly wide-ranging, taking out whole echelons of Hezbollah commanders. But even if the damage proved fatal to the group in its current form, its collapse would not offer any guarantee of greater security. After the Palestine Liberation Organisation was forced out of Lebanon in the early 1980s, Hezbollah expanded there. Other conflicts offer grim examples. Islamic State grew out of al-Qaida in Iraq. The US killed the Taliban leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, in 2016 with a drone, hoping to pave the way for a peace deal; five years later, Taliban fighters swept into Kabul and took control of the country. Nor do Israel\u2019s destructive opening salvoes against Hezbollah offer any guarantee it will win a longer war. In 2003, the US-led invasion of Iraq swiftly toppled Saddam Hussein but paved the way for a bloody civil war and the rise of factions linked to Washington\u2019s regional foe, Iran. George W Bush\u2019s declaration of victory under a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner on an aircraft carrier was intended as an enduring image of American power, and became instead a icon of US hubris. Israel has an almost insurmountable advantage over Hezbollah and Iran in long-distance aerial attacks, advanced technology and espionage. Now that Israeli troops are going into Lebanon, however, their military advantages may diminish. On the ground the militant group can deploy fighters hardened by years of combat in Syria, who have dug tunnel networks into rolling hills where they know every inch of the terrain. By Wednesday evening the ground operation was less than two days old, but eight Israeli soldiers had been killed and several others injured. It was a bloody start to the Jewish new year. \u201cWhere is Israel heading, when the only horizon its leaders offer is war?\u201d Haaretz newspaper asked in an editorial to mark the holiday. \u201cWe can only hope that in the coming year we will be blessed with a profound change in leadership and a new vision for the country.\u201d A focus on short-term tactical goals has marked Netanyahu\u2019s command of the war in Gaza too, despite pressure from his closest ally, the US, and from inside Israel. The unity government formed after the 7 October attacks collapsed when Benny Gantz, a member and Netanyahu\u2019s leading rival, demanded a plan for the territory\u2019s postwar future. When the prime minister refused, he left the war cabinet. The humanitarian catastrophe unleashed by that campaign has isolated Israel internationally as it faces Iran, even if there are many rulers in the region who may privately cheer anything that weakens Tehran. Jordan shares a border with Israel, has normalised diplomatic ties and in April joined the military coalition defending it from Iranian missile attacks. As Israel prepared to enter Lebanon, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, questioned if his neighbour was seeking security or military supremacy. \u201cThe Israeli prime minister came here today and said that Israel is surrounded by those who want to destroy it,\u201d Safadi told journalists at the UN, speaking for the 57 member countries of the Muslim-Arab committee. \u201cI can tell you very unequivocally, all of us are willing to right now guarantee the security of Israel in the context of Israel ending the occupation and allowing for the emergence of an independent Palestinian state. \u201cIf he does not want the two-state solution, can you ask the Israeli officials what is their endgame, other than just wars and wars and wars?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As a grueling heatwave baked the US south-west this week, there were reports of at least three students being taken to the hospital with heat-related injuries. The injuries highlight the effects of extreme heat on health as the country struggles to grapple with increasingly severe weather amid the climate crisis. Cal Fire and the fire department in Riverside, east of Los Angeles, reported responding on Tuesday afternoon to a junior high school and high school cross-country meet in the city where they evaluated five juvenile patients for \u201cgeneral weakness\u201d. Three were transported to a hospital for further evaluation, the agency said. The area saw temperatures as high as 102F (38.8C) on Tuesday. California, and the US south-west, is in the midst of a scorching heatwave that is expected to bring record fall temperatures that officials have said poses \u201ca significant threat to property or life\u201d. On Tuesday, San Francisco recorded its hottest day this year while Phoenix marked its hottest 1 October on record. Schools across the state are feeling the impacts of extreme weather. As much as 20% of California\u2019s public schools, serving students from kindergarten to 12th grade, have no air conditioning or heating systems, CalMatters reported this week. That figure includes Long Beach, where most or all buildings at area public schools don\u2019t have air conditioning, the outlet said. The city experienced a high of 109F last month. \u201cWe have protections for farm workers and other industries in the case of extreme weather, now climate change is forcing us to also extend similar protections to students at school,\u201d said Dr Akilah Weber, a state assemblymember, in a statement this year announcing a bill to protect students from extreme weather. Extreme heat in particular takes a toll on learning \u2013 researchers have found that students learn less in school years with more hot days. In Riverside, 1,200 students from 43 schools participated in a cross-country event organized by Woodcrest Christian school that saw students run as much as three miles, the Southern California News Group reported. Eric Reynolds, the school\u2019s head cross-country coach, told the outlet that some students did not hydrate enough before the meet. Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, recently signed into law a bill requiring the state education department to create guidelines to protect students from extreme weather. The bill is named for Yahushua Robinson, who died at age 12 last year after he collapsed while running in his physical education class on a day when temperatures reached 107F. Last month, however, Newsom vetoed the Climate Resilient Schools Act, which would have created a \u201croadmap\u201d for schools to access federal funding to upgrade facilities.",

      "bodyText": "With a pandemic that upended global trade through lockdowns and travel restrictions still fresh in managers\u2019 minds, international supply chains are again under pressure. Shippers are facing myriad issues, from the conflict in the Middle East and drought in Central America to strike action in the US, and companies are finding it more difficult \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 to transport supplies. So, how bad is the supply chain squeeze? Why are supply chains under pressure? Global shippers have been faced with a growing number of headaches in moving goods over the last year. At the top of this list is the disruption in the Middle East and the impact on the movement of trade through the Red Sea. Traffic has plummeted by two-thirds through the key shipping route since attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels began last year. The route accounted for 12% of all global trade before the attacks began. Many companies, including major shipping firms such as Maersk, have all but abandoned the route, instead opting to travel around the Cape of Good Hope, which can add 10 days to journeys, and significant costs. A fresh flare-up of tensions in the Middle East in recent days has raised fears that even more ships may shun the route. Peter Sand, chief analyst at shipping analytics platform Xeneta, believes the latest escalation will have a smaller impact, as most container ships are already avoiding the Red Sea. However, he warns that a \u201cfurther deterioration in the political situation means a large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea region seems to be a more distant prospect\u201d. Separately, traffic through the Panama Canal has also dropped after a drought forced its operator to reduce the cap on the number of ships that could travel through it earlier this year, from 36 a day to 20. Fears of trade disruption have been further exacerbated by the port workers\u2019 strikes on the east coast of the US. On Tuesday, nearly 50,000 members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on strike indefinitely, affecting 14 ports across the east coast of the US. Marco Forgione, director general at the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade, said all of these issues have meant \u201chighly fragile\u201d supply chains are facing \u201cexceptional pressures\u201d. He said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the US-China trade standoff, as well as events such as the Baltimore bridge collapse, have added to supply chain pressures. What has been the impact so far? The biggest impact from the disruptions has been on the cost for business to transport goods. Freight companies opting for the Cape of Good Hope route face an added 40% in fuel costs, while container prices have also risen. According to Xeneta, spot rates for 40ft shipping containers moving between the east Asia and northern Europe stood at $8,587 a container when the market peaked in July \u2013 468% higher than in December 2023, before the Houthi attacks ramped up. The US port strikes have already affected container prices from northern Europe to the east coast of America, with an average 40ft container costing $2,861 on Tuesday, compared with $1,836 at the end of August. The disruption, particularly in the Red Sea, has also led to longer lead times for companies. Earlier this year, manufacturers and retailers said the diversion around Africa to avoid the Red Sea had added four weeks to delivery times. Carmakers such as Volvo and Tesla have had to suspend production lines because of a lack of parts as a result of the disruption. Meanwhile, retailers in the UK, including DFS and JD Sports, have said the Red Sea crisis has hit some sales. Forgione said continued disruption would ultimately hit the consumer. He said: \u201cWhere there is instability and uncertainty, the impacts are either price increases, \u2018shrinkflation\u2019, or you\u2019re going to see availability issues.\u201d What is the outlook for oil prices? The oil price climbed for a second consecutive day to almost $76 a barrel on Wednesday, from $71 at the start of the week. Some analysts believe it could break $80 within days. The market is braced for a potential threat to Iran\u2019s crude output by an Israeli retaliation against its oil infrastructure. Goldman Sachs estimates Iran can produce 1m barrels of oil a day. But there could be further disruption to supplies if problems with key shipping routes through the Red Sea affect crude exports from the wider Middle East region. In an \u201cunlikely tail scenario\u201d, Goldman Sachs warned that an interruption of oil trade through the strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, would result in a \u201clarge oil price spike\u201d. However, Saudi Arabia has said prices could actually fall, to about $50 a barrel, due to a supply glut as it tries to regain market share. Could inflation start rising again? The cost of oil and gas began to soar in 2021, sending inflation above 10% and pushing up the price of everything from food to household energy bills. Inflation has tumbled back to near the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target over the last year, but left prices more than 20% higher than before the pandemic, giving households a financial shock. Brexit has pushed up the price of imported goods from the EU, while the US\u2019s trade war with China threatens to widen into a broader battle over tariffs. The UK is one of the most open trading nations in the world and the scars from the pandemic and two major conflicts are being deeply felt by importers and exporters. If they choose to pass on those costs to consumers, then Britons may face a squeeze on their budgets again.",

Since July, Jenrick has received just over \u00a3250,000 in donations, ahead of Tom Tugendhat on just under \u00a3225,000, Kemi Badenoch on \u00a3200,000 and James Cleverly on \u00a3180,000. David Lammy The foreign secretary is, like Starmer, a keen football fan \u2013 but of Tottenham rather than Arsenal. His update shows he accepted five tickets in a hospitality box at the Tottenham stadium worth \u00a32,300 to see the north London derby against Arsenal last month. Starmer was one of Lammy\u2019s guests and would have enjoyed the game more \u2013 Arsenal won 1-0. Liam Conlon The Labour MP and the son of Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray, accepted two tickets worth \u00a31,600 to see Taylor Swift at Wembley stadium.",

      "bodyText": "Eight Israeli soldiers have been killed and a number of others wounded in three exchanges with Hezbollah in heavy fighting inside Lebanon. The largest group of soldiers, from the commando brigade and including an officer, was involved in a clash with Hezbollah in a village north of the Israeli border community of Misgav Am, while two other soldiers from the Golani brigade were killed in a separate incident. Claims of significant losses had been circulating since early on Wednesday when Hezbollah had said it had inflicted casualties on a group of Israeli soldiers attempting to assault the Lebanese village of Odaisseh, not far from the border. The casualties in the second incident appear to have taken place in the neighbourhood of Maroun-el-Ras. Hezbollah said its fighters wounded and killed a group of Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon after detonating an explosive device. Hezbollah also claimed it had destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks with guided rockets in the Lebanese border town of Maroun el-Ras. The Guardian was unable to verify the circumstances of any of the incidents. Later, Beilinson hospital in central Israel said it was treating five of the wounded soldiers. The deaths appeared to signify the first substantial clashes between Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers and Hezbollah since Israel said it had initiated a limited ground incursion into Lebanon to target Hezbollah\u2019s infrastructure along the border, and came as Israel announced it was deploying additional forces to the fight in southern Lebanon. About an hour before the announcement of the combat deaths, the IDF said soldiers from the 36th armoured division had also entered operations in Lebanon joining forces from the 98th division already operating in the border area. Confirmation of the losses followed reports that Israeli military medical evacuation helicopters had been seen removing the wounded from areas close to the border. The relatively high number of casualties in a short space of time on Wednesday has underscored how difficult fighting in Lebanon\u2019s southern border villages is likely to be, and brings back memories of the challenges faced by Israel fighting in the same area in 2006 during the second Lebanon war. Despite Israel\u2019s much trumpeted successes in targeting Hezbollah\u2019s senior personnel, including the general secretary, Hassan Nasrallah, and its command and communication networks, Israeli troops are now confronting Hezbollah in its home villages in the south, where it has experience of operating for decades in well-prepared positions and where small groups of fighters are able to operate independently. Israeli media reported infantry and tank units operating in southern Lebanon after the military sent thousands of additional troops and artillery to the border. The Lebanese army said Israeli forces had advanced 400 metres across the border and withdrew \u201cafter a short period\u201d, its first confirmation of the incursion. The Israeli military has warned people in about 50 villages and towns to evacuate north of the Awali River, about 37 miles (60km) from the border and much further than the northern edge of a UN-declared zone intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war. Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled their homes as the conflict has intensified.",

UK ministers are concerned this would be perceived as a return to freedom of movement with the EU, with Starmer telling reporters that his position hadn\u2019t changed and that \u201cfree movement is a red line\u201d.</p> <p>Diplomats and politicians told the Guardian this week that opening discussions on a youth mobility scheme was a precondition for agreement in other areas, such as defence and security.</p> <p>David McAllister, a German centre-right MEP and ally of von der Leyen\u2019s, said he hoped Starmer would be open to an EU-UK youth mobility agreement, adding: \u201cIn the end, the UK government will also have to be judged on its willingness to compromise on this issue with regard to other areas of negotiation.\u201d</p> <p>One of the early goals that is being sought by both the UK and EU is a new security and foreign policy pact, but EU officials cautioned they are waiting for detailed plans on what London wants on all aspects of the relationship.</p> <p>\u201cIt is really in Starmer\u2019s hands,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cWe would like to normalise further, but we are not going to beg you.\u201d The diplomat argued that the Labour government was \u201cstill very uneasy to embrace the new relationship with the EU because they are afraid\u201d of being criticised by the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, and the Conservatives.</p> <p>Others were more optimistic. \u201cThere has been a lot of animosity and this [meeting] kind of feels like back to normal,\u201d said a second diplomat.</p> <p>Starmer told reporters after the meeting: \u201cTone does matter. Resetting does matter. That has been a very important part of the message that I have carried into the meeting today.

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has vowed to turn the page on the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, despite differences with Brussels over proposals for a European youth mobility scheme. The prime minister said: \u201cOf course, there will be challenges\u201d in resetting relations but insisted he was \u201cturning the page on the old way of doing these negotiations\u201d in favour of a more \u201cconstructive\u201d approach. He was speaking during a trip to Brussels where he had his first bilateral meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, on Wednesday. There has been frustration in Brussels over the perceived delay in the meeting taking place and the Labour government\u2019s apparent intransigence over a youth mobility deal with the EU. EU countries want to broker an arrangement where young people from the bloc can live and work in the UK for a fixed period of time and vice versa. UK ministers are concerned this would be perceived as a return to freedom of movement with the EU, with Starmer telling reporters that his position hadn\u2019t changed and that \u201cfree movement is a red line\u201d. Diplomats and politicians told the Guardian this week that opening discussions on a youth mobility scheme was a precondition for agreement in other areas, such as defence and security. David McAllister, a German centre-right MEP and ally of von der Leyen\u2019s, said he hoped Starmer would be open to an EU-UK youth mobility agreement, adding: \u201cIn the end, the UK government will also have to be judged on its willingness to compromise on this issue with regard to other areas of negotiation.\u201d One of the early goals that is being sought by both the UK and EU is a new security and foreign policy pact, but EU officials cautioned they are waiting for detailed plans on what London wants on all aspects of the relationship. \u201cIt is really in Starmer\u2019s hands,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cWe would like to normalise further, but we are not going to beg you.\u201d The diplomat argued that the Labour government was \u201cstill very uneasy to embrace the new relationship with the EU because they are afraid\u201d of being criticised by the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, and the Conservatives. Others were more optimistic. \u201cThere has been a lot of animosity and this [meeting] kind of feels like back to normal,\u201d said a second diplomat. Starmer told reporters after the meeting: \u201cTone does matter. Resetting does matter. That has been a very important part of the message that I have carried into the meeting today. A return to pragmatism, to doing business in a respectful way and in a way which, I think, will focus on deliverables, rather than charging to the nearest camera to use a megaphone.\u201d Nick Harvey, chief executive of European Movement UK, said: \u201cDismissing the idea of reciprocal youth mobility simply means letting down British young people, who face all sorts of economic difficulties and have seen their horizons curtailed by Brexit.\u201d Starmer and von der Leyen agreed to step up cooperation by meeting again this autumn and holding regular EU-UK leaders\u2019 summits starting early next year. In a joint statement, the two leaders said they would pursue an \u201cagenda of strengthened cooperation at pace over the coming months\u201d. They resolved to work closely on \u201cwider global challenges including economic headwinds, geopolitical competition, irregular migration, climate change and energy prices\u201d. Val\u00e9rie Hayer, the leader of the centrist Renew group in the European parliament and ally of French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Starmer\u2019s visit to Brussels was a positive thing. \u201cA new EU-UK security pact would send a powerful message of unity to those working against the interests and values of Europeans,\u201d she said. Starmer and von der Leyen discussed the events in the Middle East and condemned the \u201cegregious attack\u201d by Iran on Israel on Tuesday night. Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had launched ballistic missiles in retaliation for Israeli attacks that killed the leaders of the Hezbollah and Hamas militant groups, as well as a senior Iranian commander. Most of the missiles were intercepted by Israeli defences, with support from its allies, including the US and UK. Starmer and von der Leyen said de-escalation in the region was \u201cof the utmost importance\u201d and called for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza.",

It was only in January 2023 that Starling identified that the automated financial sanctions framework it had been using since 2017 had been screening just \u201ca fraction\u201d of the names it should have been checking.</p> <p>What was senior management doing after the FCA, in September 2021, issued its order \u2013 referred to as a voluntary requirement, or VREQ \u2013 to raise standards?</p> <p>Here are a few lowlights from a \u201clessons learned\u201d review conducted by an external consultant (and accepted in full by the bank). Senior management \u201clacked the experience and capability to effectively implement the VREQ\u201d. Those same managers lacked awareness of \u201cthe seriousness of not complying\u201d. Several members \u201chad different understandings of whom at Starling had responsibility for the VREQ\u201d. Engineering teams, given responsibility for upgrading the systems and controls to implement the VREQ were not told of the existence of the regulatory order.</p> <p>Starling has better procedures in place now, the FCA agrees, and the bank\u2019s chair, David Sproul \u2013 on the board since 2021 (and, incidentally, also the new chair of South West Water\u2019s owner, Pennon) \u2013 is full of apologies. A \u00a329m fine will hurt, but Starling should count itself lucky: under the fining system for this type of offence, the FCA could have imposed a much larger sum but deemed it \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to do so.</p> <p>The other damage, surely, will be to any short-term hopes Starling held of listing on the stock market. The possibility of a flotation has been bubbling away since founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/08/its-crazy-but-i-set-up-my-own-bank-the-story-behind-starling-anne-boden-ceo-interview\">Anne Boden</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/25/starling-bank-founder-steps-down-as-ceo-to-avoid-potential-conflict-of-interest\">stepped down as chief executive last year</a>, with the baffling explanation that there was a potential conflict between that day-to-day job and her status as a near-5% shareholder. If she were still in the top job today, her position would be uncomfortable. She left the board entirely in June this year.</p> <p>The other running story has concerned Starling\u2019s handling of state-backed Covid loans to small- and medium-sized (SME) companies. Theodore Agnew, anti-fraud minister in the last government before his resignation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/27/former-minister-accuses-starling-bank-over-covid-loans\">alleged in 2022</a> that Starling did not run adequate checks on borrowers and so acted \u201cagainst the government and taxpayers\u2019 interests\u201d. Starling furiously denied the allegation, but it could hardly be more central to its business: almost 90% of its \u00a3832m SME loan book at the end of its last financial year carried a government guarantee.</p> <p>In short, Starling needs a long period of controversy-free stability before it contemplates the public markets. That means years. The big league will have to wait.</p>",

What was senior management doing after the FCA, in September 2021, issued its order \u2013 referred to as a voluntary requirement, or VREQ \u2013 to raise standards? Here are a few lowlights from a \u201clessons learned\u201d review conducted by an external consultant (and accepted in full by the bank). Senior management \u201clacked the experience and capability to effectively implement the VREQ\u201d. Those same managers lacked awareness of \u201cthe seriousness of not complying\u201d. Several members \u201chad different understandings of whom at Starling had responsibility for the VREQ\u201d. Engineering teams, given responsibility for upgrading the systems and controls to implement the VREQ were not told of the existence of the regulatory order. Starling has better procedures in place now, the FCA agrees, and the bank\u2019s chair, David Sproul \u2013 on the board since 2021 (and, incidentally, also the new chair of South West Water\u2019s owner, Pennon) \u2013 is full of apologies. A \u00a329m fine will hurt, but Starling should count itself lucky: under the fining system for this type of offence, the FCA could have imposed a much larger sum but deemed it \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to do so. The other damage, surely, will be to any short-term hopes Starling held of listing on the stock market. The possibility of a flotation has been bubbling away since founder Anne Boden stepped down as chief executive last year, with the baffling explanation that there was a potential conflict between that day-to-day job and her status as a near-5% shareholder. If she were still in the top job today, her position would be uncomfortable. She left the board entirely in June this year. The other running story has concerned Starling\u2019s handling of state-backed Covid loans to small- and medium-sized (SME) companies. Theodore Agnew, anti-fraud minister in the last government before his resignation, alleged in 2022 that Starling did not run adequate checks on borrowers and so acted \u201cagainst the government and taxpayers\u2019 interests\u201d. Starling furiously denied the allegation, but it could hardly be more central to its business: almost 90% of its \u00a3832m SME loan book at the end of its last financial year carried a government guarantee. In short, Starling needs a long period of controversy-free stability before it contemplates the public markets. That means years. The big league will have to wait.",

      "body": "<p>The army checkpoints at the entrance of Dahiyeh, the southern suburb of Beirut where airstrikes have frequently hit what Israel claimed to be Hezbollah targets, were left unmanned. The soldiers that usually stood guard were nowhere to be seen, though there were no cars passing through for them to check anyway.</p> <p>On its largely empty streets it seemed as if residents had left in a hurry. An orange juice seller\u2019s cart stood abandoned on the side of the road, a pile of soot-covered oranges left to rot. Aluminium shutters had been pulled down over shopfronts lining the neighbourhood\u2019s main thoroughfare.</p> <p>A district that usually teems with life was silent, as the acrid smoke hung over it.</p> <p>Almost all of the nearly half a million residents of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs have fled since last week, escaping Israeli bombing. Lebanese authorities say that nearly 1 million people have been displaced by the bombing over the last two weeks.</p>    <p>\u201cIsrael is hitting the civilian population because they think it will break their will. But people don\u2019t want Israel to win, so they are saying that their will won\u2019t break,\u201d said Dr Ali Ahmad, a professor at the Lebanese University and a Dahiyeh resident who had accompanied international journalists on the Hezbollah-organised tour of the Beirut suburb. </p> <p>Though there was no guarantee of safety as Israeli drones buzzed overhead, many took advantage of the presence of international reporters to check on their homes. One resident, a dental assistant who was displaced to east Beirut by Israeli strikes, said she was hoping to catch a glimpse of her apartment building to see if it was still standing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/beirut-bombingsmap/giv-4559D4b59U4coM1M/\" data-alt=\"Map of Beirut and Dahiyeh\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/10/beirut-bombingsmap/giv-4559D4b59U4coM1M/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Ahmad spoke as he stood at the foot of a building that had housed a Lebanese TV station, al-Sirat TV, levelled in an Israeli airstrike on Monday. Staffers at the channel said they were ordered to evacuate by Israel, which said it was being used to store Hezbollah weapons. Hezbollah\u2019s head of media relations, Mohammad Afif, speaking to the journalists, denied the claims.</p> <p>Israeli bombing of Dahiyeh has been an almost nightly occurrence since Friday, when dozens of 2,000lb bunker-busters used in airstrikes that killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and flattened a city block signalled the intensified campaign.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s military has in the last few days periodically published maps of Dahiyeh that pinpoint what it said were Hezbollah facilities and ordered people who lived within a 500-metre radius to evacuate. The first time it did so, on Friday night, droves of people fled in panic. On Tuesday night, it published another set of coordinates to be evacuated, but there was almost no one left in the area anyway.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t give you more than 10 or 15 minutes before they start bombing the area. They don\u2019t give the people who live here any time to leave,\u201d Hussein Zein, a 52-year-old resident of Dahiyeh who was displaced a week earlier, said while standing at the foot of an apartment building that had been bombed the previous night.

      "bodyText": "The army checkpoints at the entrance of Dahiyeh, the southern suburb of Beirut where airstrikes have frequently hit what Israel claimed to be Hezbollah targets, were left unmanned. The soldiers that usually stood guard were nowhere to be seen, though there were no cars passing through for them to check anyway. On its largely empty streets it seemed as if residents had left in a hurry. An orange juice seller\u2019s cart stood abandoned on the side of the road, a pile of soot-covered oranges left to rot. Aluminium shutters had been pulled down over shopfronts lining the neighbourhood\u2019s main thoroughfare. A district that usually teems with life was silent, as the acrid smoke hung over it. Almost all of the nearly half a million residents of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs have fled since last week, escaping Israeli bombing. Lebanese authorities say that nearly 1 million people have been displaced by the bombing over the last two weeks. \u201cIsrael is hitting the civilian population because they think it will break their will. But people don\u2019t want Israel to win, so they are saying that their will won\u2019t break,\u201d said Dr Ali Ahmad, a professor at the Lebanese University and a Dahiyeh resident who had accompanied international journalists on the Hezbollah-organised tour of the Beirut suburb. Though there was no guarantee of safety as Israeli drones buzzed overhead, many took advantage of the presence of international reporters to check on their homes. One resident, a dental assistant who was displaced to east Beirut by Israeli strikes, said she was hoping to catch a glimpse of her apartment building to see if it was still standing. Ahmad spoke as he stood at the foot of a building that had housed a Lebanese TV station, al-Sirat TV, levelled in an Israeli airstrike on Monday. Staffers at the channel said they were ordered to evacuate by Israel, which said it was being used to store Hezbollah weapons. Hezbollah\u2019s head of media relations, Mohammad Afif, speaking to the journalists, denied the claims. Israeli bombing of Dahiyeh has been an almost nightly occurrence since Friday, when dozens of 2,000lb bunker-busters used in airstrikes that killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and flattened a city block signalled the intensified campaign. Israel\u2019s military has in the last few days periodically published maps of Dahiyeh that pinpoint what it said were Hezbollah facilities and ordered people who lived within a 500-metre radius to evacuate. The first time it did so, on Friday night, droves of people fled in panic. On Tuesday night, it published another set of coordinates to be evacuated, but there was almost no one left in the area anyway. \u201cThey don\u2019t give you more than 10 or 15 minutes before they start bombing the area. They don\u2019t give the people who live here any time to leave,\u201d Hussein Zein, a 52-year-old resident of Dahiyeh who was displaced a week earlier, said while standing at the foot of an apartment building that had been bombed the previous night. As Zein spoke, he was buffeted by plumes of smoke emanating from the collapsed building, the fires beneath the rubble re-ignited by the afternoon breeze. \u201cThe bombing, it\u2019s random. If there is really a [Hezbollah] weapons depot here, show us. Bring experts to look, there\u2019s nothing here,\u201d Zein said. Israel has also begun issuing evacuation orders in southern Lebanon, announcing on Tuesday and Wednesday that residents in more than 30 villages needed to leave and head past the Awali River, north of the city of Sidon. The orders came after Israel announced on Monday it would be carrying out \u201climited\u201d ground incursions into Lebanon that it said had the aim of dismantling Hezbollah\u2019s ability to conduct cross-border raids into Israel. The approach of Israeli troops was preceded by a heavy bombing campaign, with Israeli warplanes hitting more than a dozen villages. In the first significant Israeli casualties since its announcement of the ground incursion, eight soldiers were confirmed killed in a gun battle along the border. Hezbollah also claimed in a statement to have destroyed three Israeli Merkava tanks. The fighting in the south and Israeli evacuation orders prompted even further displacement. In Martyr\u2019s Square in central Beirut, the numbers of families sleeping rough are growing. People crowded on the steps of the Blue Mosque near the square on Tuesday evening, seeking shelter from the spits of rain as night fell. Israeli strikes within the capital city have slowly expanded past Dahiyeh over the past week, with two strikes on Jnah, an upper-class neighbourhood on Tuesday night, and a strike on Cola intersection in central Beirut early on Monday morning. Old rules of which areas of Beirut were safe seemed to be slowly eroding. Despite the loss of a sense of safety and the shocking sight of bombed-out buildings amid the cityscape, residents of Dahiyeh said they would return. \u201cEven if they occupy Lebanon, we will resist. We defeated them in 2000 and we will defeat them again,\u201d Ahmad said.",

The statements, from groups in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, underline the regional extent of the current crisis, though analysts says that many key members of the Iranian-backed coalition have been so weakened over the course of the last year that their ability to convert rhetorical threats to real danger to Israel is limited. Tuesday\u2019s attack on Israel followed a series of devastating Israeli strikes on Iran\u2019s ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the Shia Islamist militia\u2019s leader and a towering figure in Iran\u2019s network of fighters across the region. Hamas, the Iran-backed militant group in Gaza whose surprise attack into Israel last October triggered the crisis, praised the Iranian missile strikes, saying they avenged Israeli assassinations of a series of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian commanders over the recent months. \u201cWe congratulate the heroic rocket launch carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, on large areas of our occupied territories, in response to the occupation\u2019s continuing crimes against the peoples of the region, and in retaliation for the blood of our nation\u2019s heroic martyrs,\u201d the group said. Yahya Saree, a spokesperson for the Houthis, an Iran-backed group which controls much of Yemen, \u201ccommended\u201d Iran and threatened to \u201cwiden its operations against the Israeli enemy or those backing them\u201d unless there was a ceasefire in Gaza. The group has been responsible for dozens of rockets aimed at Israel and strikes on international shipping in the Red Sea. Edmund Fitton-Brown, a senior adviser to the Counter-Extremism Project, a transatlantic thinktank and advocacy group, said it was predictable that the Houthis and other groups would make such threats. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t read too much into the rhetoric \u2026 the Palestinian groups do not have the capability to escalate outside the [occupied] West Bank, while the Israelis have been so successful in last couple of weeks that I don\u2019t think Lebanese Hezbollah can come to Iran\u2019s defence.\u201d Hezbollah, the most powerful of Iran\u2019s proxies and the keystone of the coalition, is reeling from the Israeli assassination campaign. The group has lost nearly 500 fighters since it started firing into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, last October and was then drawn into a prolonged war of attrition. More than a thousand members were injured by exploding pagers and walkie-talkies, an attack presumed to be the work of the Mossad, the Israeli foreign intelligence service, and hundreds more are thought to have died in Israel\u2019s bombardment of Lebanon over the past week. Casualties include much of Hezbollah\u2019s senior military leadership, including Nasrallah, who is considered irreplaceable. Iran had long hoped Hezbollah\u2019s massive rocket armoury and tens of thousands of experienced fighters would deter Israel from a major strike against Iran, possibly targeting Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. Alia Brahimi, a Middle East expert at the Atlantic Council, said that Iran\u2019s decades-long strategy of building a coalition of ideologically aligned proxies had been vindicated. \u201cIran feels under attack now and these are expendable components of its arsenal. They have done what they were designed to do and have acted as a protective shield,\u201d Brahimi said. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said it fired toward the headquarters of Israel\u2019s intelligence agency, the Mossad, and toward an airbase in a Tel Aviv suburb. The group has used surface-to-air missiles and shot down or chased off Israeli drones on several occasions \u2013 including in the past week. On Saturday, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Israel\u2019s main airport as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was arriving back from New York, where he had addressed the United Nations. The next day, Israel launched its biggest raid yet against the group, striking the port city of Hodeidah. Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the Crisis Group, said that before the war in Gaza, the Houthis were seen as a marginal faction in the axis. That changed when the Houthis began hitting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden making their way to the Suez Canal. \u201cOver the past year, the Houthis have taken centre stage,\u201d Nagi said. According to Faozi al-Goidi, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, the Houthis are not likely to be deterred anytime soon and could also target vessels further out in the Indian Ocean. They may also seek to \u201cpartner with other militias to build an alliance that would threaten security in the region,\u201d al-Goidi said. After the suspected Israel operation targeting Hezbollah pagers, observers noted that pagers exploded in Syria and in Yemen, where 40 people were injured according to reports, underlining the regional networks built up by the group and Iran. There are also powerful Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq, which remain largely unscathed, and in Syria, where they have suffered some losses.",

      "body": "<p>People who migrate in adolescence have an increased risk of psychosis, researchers have found, noting the link is particularly strong among black and north African people.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/29/risk-of-psychotic-disorders-up-to-five-times-greater-for-people-from-ethnic-minorities-uk-study\">research has previously suggested</a> migration could play a role in the increased risk of psychosis among people from ethnic minorities, the study suggests age could be an important factor.</p> <p>James Kirkbride, a professor of psychiatric and social epidemiology at University College London (UCL) and co-author of the study, said adolescence was a time when individuals were forming a sense of identity and experiencing social, cognitive and neurological development.</p> <p>He said: \u201cSo migrating during adolescence, which interrupts social network formation, and may require teenage migrants to learn a new language, navigate new social and cultural norms and customs, and manage new social environments \u2013 including potential exposure to racism and discrimination known to be associated with psychosis risk \u2013 could all play a part in making adolescent migration a particularly vulnerable period for increasing future psychosis risk.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the journal PLOS Mental Health, Kirkbride and colleagues report how they analysed data from 2,132 people aged 18-64 in England, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands who were part of a larger research study. Of this group, 937 people had experienced a first episode of a psychotic disorder, with this occurring after migration in those that had migrated.</p> <p>Most of those who migrated, Kirkbride said, had done so for economic reasons, rather than seeking asylum, for example.</p> <p>After taking into account factors including ethnicity, markers of social disadvantage, and parental history of psychosis, the team found those who migrated between the ages of 11 and 17 had almost twice the risk of developing psychosis compared with white people who had not migrated.

      "bodyText": "People who migrate in adolescence have an increased risk of psychosis, researchers have found, noting the link is particularly strong among black and north African people. While research has previously suggested migration could play a role in the increased risk of psychosis among people from ethnic minorities, the study suggests age could be an important factor. James Kirkbride, a professor of psychiatric and social epidemiology at University College London (UCL) and co-author of the study, said adolescence was a time when individuals were forming a sense of identity and experiencing social, cognitive and neurological development. He said: \u201cSo migrating during adolescence, which interrupts social network formation, and may require teenage migrants to learn a new language, navigate new social and cultural norms and customs, and manage new social environments \u2013 including potential exposure to racism and discrimination known to be associated with psychosis risk \u2013 could all play a part in making adolescent migration a particularly vulnerable period for increasing future psychosis risk.\u201d Writing in the journal PLOS Mental Health, Kirkbride and colleagues report how they analysed data from 2,132 people aged 18-64 in England, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands who were part of a larger research study. Of this group, 937 people had experienced a first episode of a psychotic disorder, with this occurring after migration in those that had migrated. Most of those who migrated, Kirkbride said, had done so for economic reasons, rather than seeking asylum, for example. After taking into account factors including ethnicity, markers of social disadvantage, and parental history of psychosis, the team found those who migrated between the ages of 11 and 17 had almost twice the risk of developing psychosis compared with white people who had not migrated. However, there was no increased risk for people who migrated in infancy, earlier childhood or adulthood. In a further analysis, the team found the increased risk of psychosis in adolescents was significant only among black and north African migrants. While Kirkbride noted the exact association was hard to pin down because of the small size of the latter group in the study, the risk of psychosis was at least two to three times higher for these groups than for white people who had not migrated. The analysis also revealed that north African adults, black people of all ages and non-migrants who were black or from mixed ethnic backgrounds were at greater risk of psychosis compared with white non-migrants. There was no such increase for white or Asian migrants. Humma Andleeb, the first author of the study, also from UCL, said white people were not visible minorities in Europe, meaning they did not face the same disadvantages or may be able to adapt more easily. \u201cThey may also be more likely to migrate within Europe and not experience the same disadvantages pre-migration or post-migration,\u201d she said. The study has limitations, including that it cannot show cause and effect, does not track people over time, and the sample sizes for some groups are small. Further work is also needed to unpick why adolescents who migrate have an increased risk of psychosis. Kirkbride said: \u201cWhat we should be focusing on for that group is ways to help them manage their mental health and help them integrate into society so that they\u2019re armed with the social skills they need to navigate new environments and avoid developing serious mental health problems.\u201d Dr Adam Coutts, of the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, said the health impacts on asylum seekers would be worse given the insecurity and lack of access to services and jobs they faced. \u201cThe key issue is that the plight of economic migrants, refugees and asylum seekers has exposed the fragile nature which government frontline services are in such as mental health services.

Starmer\u2019s decision to return the cost of the hospitality comes after weeks of criticism of the prime minister for accepting more than \u00a3100,000 in hospitality and free gifts.

The prime minister would not be drawn on Wednesday on the investigation into Alli, which is understood to relate to a clerical registration of an interest and not donations to politicians.

Walz, meanwhile, had to struggle to back up his charm with something steelier and more purposeful than relatability.

When Walz mentioned his son had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/walz-debate-son-shooting.html\">witnessed a shooting</a> at a community centre, Vance absolutely nailed a tone he customarily struggles with \u2013 being recognisably human \u2013 and immediately offered his sympathy. Walz, meanwhile, was conciliatory on the subject of how to prevent another school shooting and allowed that his opponent was, at least in principle, broadly against the murder of small children.

(Walz\u2019s resting face ranged from gimme-a-break incredulity to full blown oh-god-we\u2019re-all-going-to-die fright eyes, and by the end of the debate, the corners of his mouth drooped so heavily he looked like Marlon Brando in The Godfather.)</p> <p>Given the biases we bring to the party at this stage, I tried, for the sake of argument, to allow for the possibility that Vance\u2019s reasonable air connotes a reasonable outlook and to see Walz\u2019s under-energised performance through the eyes of those sympathetic to Trump.

      "bodyText": "Events in the Middle East were moving so rapidly this week that the stunning assassination of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last Friday, killed by an Israeli heavy bombing raid, already feels quite distant. By Tuesday morning Israeli forces had launched what was called a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Hours later, Iran responded with a barrage of ballistic missiles aimed at targets across Israel. To put things in some kind of perspective, the coming week also marks the first anniversary of Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel, setting in motion the brutal chain of events leading to the deaths of more than 41,000 Gazans by Israeli bombing, last week\u2019s dramatic events in Lebanon and Iran\u2019s military response which many now fear leaves the region close to full-blown war. There\u2019ll be much more to come in the weeks ahead \u2013 but as Jason Burke\u2019s Observer piece for our Big Story this week makes devastatingly clear, the effort to mark time means little those in Gaza whose lives have been shattered and have spoken of how they had lost track of days, weeks or months and simply wanted the war to end. As Jason concludes, ominously: \u201cIt is impossible to say where all this leads, though \u2026 the fact there is no \u2018all-out war\u2019 makes little difference to those under the bombs.\u201d Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address *** Five essential reads in this week\u2019s edition 1 Spotlight | The \u2018marriage competition\u2019 that divided South Sudan Underage marriage is illegal in South Sudan yet so commonplace it rarely attracts attention.

There is the instant response from people who have heard it in the hall, then people read it again, watch how it is refracted through the social media, find out how the focus groups and the polls respond, and after a few days a settled consensus emerges. At this point it does not feel as if there was a standout winner, but James Cleverly was probably the candidate who did most to outperform expectations.</p> <p>Here is my take on the four speeches.</p> <p><strong>Tom Tugendhat:</strong> Tugendhat arrived at the conference as the underdog, he has avoided any gaffes, but that was probably not a speech that will do enough to lift him in the rankings. Having a military record tends to help in politics, but it will only get you so far, and in the speech he was relatively light on how he would change policy, or the party.</p> <p><strong>James Cleverly:</strong> Cleverly has probably had the best conference, in that nothing has really gone wrong for him, and of the four speakers he easily came across as the warmest, most engaging and nicest. Starting with an apology was a good move. Despite his references to change, he is arguably the most status quo candidate, but that might make him a safe choice for MPs, and members. His speech was the most optimistic, and the best written.</p> <p><strong>Robert Jenrick:</strong> Jenrick has been favourite in the contest for a while, and that is unlikely to change, but that was not a speech that will consolidate his lead. He is offering the clearest policy on immigration, and the ECHR. But he does not convey 100% authenticity (speeches are a good test of this \u2013 with the Thatcher, and Labour-bashing passages, it felt he was trying a little too hard) and his policy platform felt a just a little too \u2018ChatGPT, Write a speech that will please the Telegraph\u2019.</p> <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch:</strong> There is no doubt about Badenoch\u2019s authenticity, but that could be a problem too. What she is offering is extreme \u2013 the entire recasting of the state, Tory Leninism, perhaps a better speech for a Reform UK leadership contest than a Tory one. As a speaker, she was compelling, and she had more change to offer than any of her rivals, but to a lot of people she will come over as harsh and aggressive, and there must be Tory members who will worry where her plan to dismantle parts of the state will end up.

There are plenty of more important things in politics than who becomes the next Conservative leader \u2013 two thirds of voters don\u2019t even care, according to Ipsos polling, including almost a third of people who backed the party at the election \u2013 but if you are interested in the outcome, today is the most important day in the contest so far. Over the past century most people elected Conservative leader have also been prime minister at some point, so it is normally a consequential choice.</p> <p>Although the four-day conference has, in effect, been a long husting, this morning we\u2019re getting the key face-off. All four candidates are delivering a 20-minute speech in the conference hall. A platform speech to a big audience is always a challenge, but the candidates face two particular difficulties this morning.</p> <p>First, they are going to have to say something new (no one is impressed by a speech they have heard before) even though they have spent the last three days constanly using their best soundbites, arguments, jokes and talking points. That won\u2019t be easy.</p> <p>And, second, they have to make a pitch to two separate audiences. Conservative party members will have the final say. But next week the 121 Conservative MPs will vote in two more ballots will eliminate two candidates, before ballot papers with just two names go out to members. And the views and priorities of members and MPs are not wholly aligned; MPs tend to have a more acute sense of what will help them stay elected.</p> <p>The four candidates have briefed out lines from what they plan to say, and here is snapshot.</p> <p><strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, who is now the favourite, is going to talk about building a new Conservative party. According to<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/10/01/jenrick-to-channel-blair-as-he-declares-its-time-new-tories/\"> the Telegraph</a>, he will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is this. If we\u2019re to tackle the immense challenges we face, if we\u2019re to restore the public\u2019s trust, we must build something new.</p> <p>A new Conservative party. That is what I call for today. Nothing less than a new Conservative party built on the rock of our oldest values and best traditions. If I become our leader, this is what \u2013 together \u2013 we will build.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jenrick\u2019s platform is very rightwing in some respects (he is the only candidate fully committed to withdrawal from the European convention on human rights), but this is the language of Tony Blair, when he created New Labour.</p> <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> will say the Tories must be the party of \u201cwealth creation\u201d. She will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Conservatives have to be the party of wealth creation. Wealth is not a dirty word. It supports jobs and families. It pays for our schools, for our health service. We should encourage it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>James Cleverly</strong> will strike the most optimistic note, the<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/10/01/james-cleverly-speech-tories-stop-being-grumpy-party/\"> advance briefing suggests</a>. He will say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let\u2019s be enthusiastic; relatable; positive; optimistic.</p> <p>Let\u2019s sell the benefits of a Conservative government with a smile. We will not win back voters by pretending to be something we\u2019re not. We win back voters by being honest, by being professional, by being Conservative.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Tom Tugendhat</strong> will also adopt Blairite language, calling for a \u201cNew Conservative Revolution\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/the-middle-east-ignites/\">Politico\u2019s London Playbook</a> (which says the New is capped up in the briefing it had).</p> <p>There is more on what they will say in our overnight conference story, by Jessica Elgot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/01/some-civil-servants-should-be-in-prison-says-kemi-badenoch\">Some civil servants so bad they should be in prison, says Kemi Badenoch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is the timetable for the day.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Richard Fuller, the Conservative chair, opens the morning session, and there is also a short speech from Stuart Andrew, the chief whip.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today. Here are all the key developments: Sir Keir Starmer paid back more than \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he received since entering Number 10 after a row over ministerial donations. The Labour peer Waheed Alli is under investigation by a parliamentary watchdog over a potential breach of the code of conduct. Alli is being investigated after a complaint that he has not registered his interests correctly. He has been thrust into the spotlight recently over tens of thousands of pounds worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner. Starmer pledged that the UK and European Union would work to strengthen co-operation on the economy and security, as well as to \u201cmake Brexit work\u201d after meeting with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. The four Conservative leadership candidates set out their visions for the party \u2013 consensus from the commentariat was that James Cleverly came out strongest. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with all the latest happenings in Westminster. Starmer has acknowledged there would be \u201cissues which are difficult to resolve\u201d in his talks with the European Union. Following his meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, he told reporters: We\u2019re putting our relationship with Europe on a more solid, stable footing. That\u2019s what the British people want, a return to pragmatic, sensible leadership when it comes to dealing with our closest neighbours, because they know that this matters for growth, for jobs and for security. The detailed work to take this forward starts now. We\u2019ve agreed to hold regular UK-EU summits at leader level to review progress, starting with a summit in the first half of next year. Of course, there will be issues which are difficult to resolve and areas on which we will stand firm. There will be no return to freedom of movement, no return to the customs union, no return to the single market. ut we will find constructive ways to work together and deliver for the British people. Starmer said his premiership would mark \u201ca return to doing business in a respectful way\u201d with the European Union. The Prime Minister told reporters in Brussels: Tone does matter. Resetting does matter. That has been a very important part of the message that I have carried into the meeting today. A return to pragmatism, to doing business in a respectful way and in a way which, I think, will focus on deliverables, rather than charging to the nearest camera to use a megaphone. He acknowledged there \u201cof course will be challenges along the way\u201d during the process. Starmer said it was \u201cright\u201d for him to repay the donations while new principles for accepting gifts were drawn up. He told reporters in Brussels: We came in as a government of change. We are now going to bring forward principles for donations, because, until now, politicians have used their best individual judgment on a case-by-case basis. I think we need some principles of general application. So, I took the position that until the principles are in place it was right for me to make those repayments. David Lammy accepted \u00a32,300 worth of hospitality from Tottenham Hotspur FC to watch the north London derby in September. According to the latest register of interests, the Foreign Secretary declared the amount for five tickets with the use of a box to watch the game on September 15. Angela Rayner declared \u00a3836 in hospitality as a \u201cvisit to (a) DJ booth\u201d after the Deputy Prime Minister was seen partying in Ibiza. The registration relates to a trip to nightclub Hi Ibiza on the Spanish island, where Rayner was filmed dancing and being cheered on by the crowd over summer. The name of the donor listed on the latest register of interests is Ayita LLC. Asked by journalists about EU youth mobility schemes, Starmer said that today was \u201cnot a discussion that went into the details at this stage\u201d, but rather about \u201csetting the parameters, setting the tone\u201d and \u201cmilestones along the way\u201d. He said \u201cthe emphasis was on what we can do, not what we can\u2019t do\u201d. In a press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said he had a \u201cvery productive meeting\u201d with Ursula von der Leyen. He said the pair took part in call with fellow G7 members \u201cwhere we all condemned Iran\u2019s abhorrent attack on Israel last night\u201d. They agreed on Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. \u201cWe call on all sides to show restraint,\u201d he said. They stressed the urgency of ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza to allow space for political solutions. On the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, he said: We can do more together. Promoting growth and prosperity, working together on shared challenges like climate change, energy security and illegal migration and strengthening our shared security and stability. So we\u2019re putting our relationship with Europe on a more solid stable footing. That\u2019s what British people want a return to pragmatic sensible leadership when it come sot dealing with our closest neighbours. This matters for growth, jobs and security. He said there would be regular UK-EU summits, strating with a summit in the first half of next year. But he added: \u201cThere will be no return to freedom of movement, the customs union, the single market.\u201d Liam Conlon, the Labour MP and son of of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff Sue Gray, accepted two tickets to a Taylor Swift concert from the Premier League, according to the latest register of interests. The MP for Beckenham and Penge declared \u00a31,600 worth in hospitality for the gig at Wembley Stadium, received on August 20. Asked about the news that Labour peer Waheed Alli is under investigation by a parliamentary watchdog over a potential breach of the code of conduct, a Labour spokesperson has said: Lord Alli will co-operate fully with the Lords Commissioner and he is confident all interests have been registered. We cannot comment further while this is ongoing. Here is a list of the donations and gifts from Lord Waheed Alli declared by MPs that appear in the latest version of the register of members\u2019 financial interests, which was published on September 2 2024. The latest register includes all donations and gifts declared in the previous 12 months. 1. Donations 19 October 2023: \u00a310,000 to Sir Keir Starmer (Labour) Description in register: \u201cFor the private office of the Leader of the Opposition.\u201d 7 November 7 2023: \u00a312,500 to David Lammy (Labour) \u201cTowards paying for additional staff for my office.\u201d 16 November 2023: \u00a38,500 to Angela Rayner (Labour) \u201cDonation to support me in my capacity as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.\u201d 8 December 8 2023: \u00a310,000 to Bridget Phillipson (Labour) \u201cTo host a number of events, including on behalf of the Shadow Education Team.\u201d 11 December 2023: \u00a34,000 to Bridget Phillipson \u201cTo host a number of events, including on behalf of the Shadow Education Team.\u201d 26 February 2024: \u00a36,000 to Sir Keir Starmer \u201cFor the private office of the Leader of the Opposition.\u201d 15 April 2024: \u00a38,250 to Angela Rayner \u201cTo support me in my capacity as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.\u201d 26 April 2024: \u00a3900 to Angela Rayner \u201cTo support me in my capacity as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.\u201d 29 July 2024: \u00a33,550 to Angela Rayner \u201cDonation in kind for undertaking parliamentary duties.\u201d 2 August 2024: \u00a310,000 to Liam Conlon (Labour) 2. Gifts 22 March 2023 (published in register on December 3 2023): \u00a31,200,000 to Dame Siobhain McDonagh (Labour) \u201cInterest free loan to be repaid on the sale of the home I share with a family member. The move was necessary to provide the family member with complete ground floor access.\u201d 24 April 2024: \u00a316,200 to Sir Keir Starmer Work clothing 22 May 2024: \u00a32,485 to Sir Keir Starmer Multiple pairs of glasses 2 August 2024: \u00a320,437.28 to Sir Keir Starmer Accommodation Sir Keir Starmer has paid back more than \u00a36,000 worth of gifts and hospitality he received since entering Number 10 after a row over ministerial donations. The Prime Minister is covering the cost of six Taylor Swift tickets, four to the races and a clothing rental agreement with a high-end designer favoured by his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer. It comes after Sir Keir and other Cabinet members \u2013 who vowed to \u201cclean up\u201d British politics \u2013 faced weeks of criticism for accepting tens of thousands of pounds worth of freebies from wealthy donors. The Prime Minister has committed to overhauling hospitality rules for ministers to ensure better transparency about what is provided following the backlash. On Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said: The Prime Minister has commissioned a new set of principles on gifts and hospitality to be published as part of the updated ministerial code. Ahead of the publication of the new code, the Prime Minister has paid for several entries on his own register. This will appear in the next register of members\u2019 interests. Gifts paid for by Sir Keir include four Taylor Swift tickets from Universal Music Group totalling \u00a32,800, two from the Football Association at a cost of \u00a3598, and four to Doncaster Races from Arena Racing Corporation at \u00a31,939. An \u00a3839 clothing rental agreement with Edeline Lee, the designer recently worn by his wife to London Fashion Week, along with one hour of hair and makeup, was also covered by the Prime Minister. Read more here: The UK and European Union will work to strengthen co-operation on the economy and security as Sir Keir Starmer promised to \u201cmake Brexit work\u201d. The Prime Minister met European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for talks in Brussels, with Starmer promising to offer \u201cpragmatic, sensible leadership\u201d as he pushed for a reset in the UK-EU relationship after the turbulent Tory years. A joint statement after the talks said the two had agreed to meet again this autumn, with a plan for regular EU-UK summits at leader level beginning in early 2025. The statement said: They agreed a stable, positive and forward-looking relationship was in their mutual interests and provided the basis for long-term co-operation. They agreed to take forward this agenda of strengthened co-operation at pace over the coming months, starting with defining together the areas in which strengthened co-operation would be mutually beneficial, such as the economy, energy, security and resilience, in full respect of their internal procedures and institutional prerogatives. Speaking in Brussels, Starmer said: I firmly believe that the British public want to return to pragmatic, sensible leadership when it comes to dealing with our closest neighbours, to make Brexit work and to deliver in their interests, to find ways to boost economic growth, strengthen our security and tackle shared challenges like irregular migration and climate change. He added that \u201cin dangerous times we have a duty to work together to preserve stability and security\u201d, referring to the crisis in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine. Starmer said: We are determined to put this relationship back on a stable, positive footing that I think we all want to see. Von der Leyen said the various arrangements put in place since the Brexit vote, including the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) needed to be fully implemented. She said: We have a set of solid agreements in place. We should explore the scope for more co-operation, while we focus on the full and faithful implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, the Windsor Framework and the TCA. The Prime Minister is under pressure to agree to Brussels\u2019 calls for a deal on youth mobility, to allow young EU citizens greater freedom to come to the UK to study and work and vice versa, something he has so far resisted. The Prime Minister\u2019s red lines for the reset rule out a return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement. But pro-EU campaigners have pushed for him to give ground on a youth mobility scheme. Sir Nick Harvey, chief executive of European Movement UK, said: Dismissing the idea of reciprocal youth mobility simply means letting down British young people, who face all sorts of economic difficulties and have seen their horizons curtailed by Brexit. From bad jokes to war stories: here are the key takeaways from the Tory leadership speeches, according to the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Aletha Adu. Sir Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen have agreed to work \u201cat pace\u201d to take forward \u201can agenda of strengthened co-operation\u201d. The Prime Minister and European Commission president will meet again this autumn and there will be regular leader-level EU-UK summits, with the first expected in early 2025. In a joint statement, the leaders said they \u201cunderlined their mutual commitment to the full and faithful implementation\u201d of the existing post-Brexit agreements, and they \u201creaffirmed their mutual commitment to uphold international law and to the European Convention on Human Rights\u201d. It added: They agreed a stable, positive and forward-looking relationship was in their mutual interests and provided the basis for long-term co-operation. They agreed to take forward this agenda of strengthened co-operation at pace over the coming months, starting with defining together the areas in which strengthened co-operation would be mutually beneficial, such as the economy, energy, security and resilience, in full respect of their internal procedures and institutional prerogatives. The SNP has called for a \u201cfull investigation\u201d by the standards commissioner and the independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests into donations made by Lord Alli to Labour MPs. The party\u2019s Cabinet Office spokesman Brendan O\u2019Hara MP said: I welcome the announcement of this investigation, following calls from the SNP. The Labour Party freebies scandal has wrecked public confidence in Keir Starmer, his government and the Westminster system, and there must be full transparency and accountability. It\u2019s now essential that in addition to this narrow inquiry, there is a full investigation by standards commissioners and the independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests into all the donations made by Lord Alli to Labour MPs and the subsequent granting of a Downing Street security pass. Voters are appalled that Labour ministers have been lining their pockets with more than \u00a3800,000 of luxury designer clothes, holidays, hospitality and donations, while imposing painful austerity cuts on the rest of us, and they want to know what donors were getting in exchange. We need answers \u2013 including why these gifts were taken, whether there have been breaches of the MPs and ministerial code, and why Lord Alli was handed a security pass to the halls of power. The Labour peer Waheed Alli is under investigation by a parliamentary watchdog over a potential breach of the code of conduct, writes the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Eleni Courea. Alli is being investigated after a complaint that he has not registered his interests correctly. He was listed on the Lords standards commissioners\u2019 website on Wednesday as being subject to an inquiry. \u201cThe fact that an investigation is taking place does not mean that the rules have been broken,\u201d the notice stated. Lord Alli, a media businessman and a major Labour party donor who is worth an estimated \u00a3200m, has been thrust into the spotlight over tens of thousands of pounds worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner. The SNP\u2019s Cabinet Office spokesperson Brendan O\u2019Hara MP, has now welcomed the Lords commissioner\u2019s investigation into Lord Alli, after calling for an inquiry last week. In a statement, O\u2019Hara wrote: The Labour Party freebies scandal has wrecked public confidence in Keir Starmer, his government and the Westminster system, and there must be full transparency and accountability. It\u2019s now essential that in addition to this narrow inquiry, there is a full investigation by Standards Commissioners and the Independent Adviser on Ministers\u2019 Interests into all the donations made by Lord Alli to Labour MPs and the subsequent granting of a Downing Street security pass. Voters are appalled that Labour ministers have been lining their pockets with more than \u00a3800,000 of luxury designer clothes, holidays, hospitality and donations, while imposing painful austerity cuts on the rest of us, and they want to know what donors were getting in exchange. We need answers - including why these gifts were taken, whether there have been breaches of the MPs and ministerial code, and why Lord Alli was handed a security pass to the halls of power. The reference to the security pass comes after it emerged he used it to help organise a reception for fellow donors in the garden of No 10. Labour says he held the pass to help with \u201ctransition work\u201d once the party came into government. In his letter asking for an investigation into Lord Alli, the SNP MP Brendan O\u2019Hara wrote that the revelations about donations had \u201cbecome Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s version of the expenses scandal\u201d. He said that unless the matter were \u201ccomprehensively investigated\u201d, then it was \u201cinevitable that the damaging drip, drip of revelations will continue to erode public trust\u201d. The row over Waheed Alli\u2019s donations had risked defining Labour\u2019s first months in office, and partly overshadowed their conference in Liverpool last week. The risks are particularly high for Keir Starmer, given his repeated election pledges to be a contrast to the sleaze and self-interest of the Conservatives. The SNP had asked for an investigation into Alli\u2019s donations last Friday in a letter to the standards commissioners in the House of Commons and House of Lords, the independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests, Sir Laurie Magnus, and the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. You can read more from my colleagues Rowena Mason and Peter Walker here on their report last Friday: As the row over Alli\u2019s donations to Labour emerged last month, my colleague Kiran Stacey profiled the millionaire businessman, who made his name as a co-founder of Planet 24, the television production company that created convention-defying hits such as the Big Breakfast and The Word. He later became chair of the fashion website Asos. You can read his profile here: We now have more details into the investigation into Waheed Alli, the Labour peer at the centre of a row over donations to Keir Starmer. He is facing a probe by the Lords\u2019 standards watchdog over an alleged failure to register interests. It comes after a backlash over tens of thousands of pounds worth of gifts accepted by the prime minister from the peer, a major party donor. According to an update published on Parliament\u2019s website on Wednesday, Lord Alli is being investigated by the Lords\u2019 commissioner for \u201calleged non-registration of interests leading to potential breaches of paragraphs 14(a) and 17 of the thirteenth edition of the code of conduct\u201d. These rules relate to making clear what the interests are that might be reasonably thought to influence a member\u2019s parliamentary actions and ensuring entries are up to date. Last week, Keir Starmer said the row over him borrowing Labour donor Waheed Alli\u2019s luxury flat for filming was \u201cfarcical\u201d and that the public would come to their own judgments about his reasons for taking support from the peer. It has just been announced the Lords commissioner is investigating the peer over \u201calleged non-registration of interests\u201d. The prime minister had sought to downplay the row over the flat when he was asked about his gifts from the Labour peer after weeks of questions about receiving clothing, spectacles and temporary use of a \u00a318m penthouse from Alli. He said there was nothing wrong with having used Alli\u2019s flat for filming during the Covid pandemic, after questions about why he used the peer\u2019s house rather than his own or his office. \u201cThat was just part of a video we were putting out in relation to \u2013 I think it was during Covid. Anybody who thinks that I was pretending it was my own home \u2013 the idea that I\u2019ve got union jacks by my fireplace at home and or that I would invite a bunch of you lot into my living room to have a look around. I mean, I think the idea that I was trying to pretend that it was my home is pretty farcical. And, no, I\u2019m not going to be inviting you in to film me in front of my fireplace. I\u2019m very sorry, that\u2019s about the last thing I\u2019d do,\u201d he told reporters. Labour peer Lord Alli is under investigation by the Lords\u2019 commissioner over \u201calleged non-registration of interests\u201d leading to a possible breach of the members\u2019 code of conduct, PA Media has just reported. More details soon \u2026 Starmer has tweeted a picture of himself meeting Ursula von der Leyen today, and, as expected, praises working with \u201cour closest international partners\u201d. Away from the Tory conference, which is drawing to a close, we can turn to Keir Starmer\u2019s movements. The prime minister is in Brussels today where he is meeting the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, as part of his push for a reset with the EU. It\u2019s his first visit as prime minister and he is under pressure from Brussels to open discussions on a youth mobility scheme that would allow young people from the EU to live and work in the UK for a fixed period, and vice versa. Starmer has said his government will not seek wholesale negotiation of the Brexit deal but he is looking to tweak the relationship in a range of areas. As Reuters reports, the EU shares his desire for a joint security pact, but talks on barriers to the movement of goods and people could prove thornier. \u201cI firmly believe that the British public wants a return to pragmatic, sensible leadership when it comes to dealing with our closest neighbours,\u201d Starmer said after arriving in Brussels. As mentioned earlier, the consensus amongst the commentariat is that James Cleverly is today\u2019s winner. This is what journalists are saying. From George Parker from the Financial Times A look back at four days in Birmingham and the surreal mood in the ICC: Tory mood far more buoyant than Labour last week. \u201cDelusional\u201d is the verdict of one shadow cabinet member. But one big winner this week: James \u201clet\u2019s be more normal\u201d Cleverly From Tim Shipman from the Sunday Times Grassroots liked Badenoch, but MPs v.worried about her gaffes. Tugendhat showed he is a serious public servant. Jenrick\u2019s no notes routine was impressive but members less excited than I expected. Cleverly had good jokes, a simple message and they warmed to him in the hall From Christopher Hope from GB News James Cleverly has been the big winner at the Conservative Party conference. Will MPs put him through to the final two next week? Very probably, is the answer. From Lewis Goodall from the News Agents podcast Who\u2019s had the best conference (in order) 1) Cleverly 2) Jenrick 3) Tugendhat 4) Badenoch And there\u2019s a big gap between 1 and 2. Increasingly feels like it\u2019s a Cleverly v Jenrick face off. JC definitely has the momentum. Be prepared for a lot of attacks on him before next vote From Dan Hodges from the Mail on Sunday Watched the hustings. Only one candidate looked like a serious leader and potential Prime Minister. James Cleverly. And it wasn\u2019t really that close. From Harry Cole from the Sun The Tories leave their party conference with the most open leadership contest in decades. And it is James Cleverly with the big mo as the race heads back to Westminster. After a disappointing joint fourth finish in the MPs voting earlier this month, the ex-Foreign and Home Secretary was the breakout star of the gathering here in Birmingham. Without the gaffes that have blighted frontrunners Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, Cleverly -who the members like after a stint as party chairman ahead of the 2019 election - is coming up the outside line fast. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the bookies where he is now second favourite. After the beauty parade speeches, it is clear that the members still do have a soft spot for Badenoch, and lapped up her red meat heavy address. But it is still the MPs she has to worry about and is now at a very real risk of being squeezed into their place. From my colleague Jessica Elgot This conference was designed to artificially generate an environment where the underdog would prevail. It could have been Jenrick, but he took the mantle of the favourite almost too quickly. So now it\u2019s another guy - James \u201cbe more normal\u201d Cleverly. From Jonathan Walker from the Sunday Express Cleverly probably established himself as the leading candidate of the left at #cpc24 - if we buy the idea that he and Tom are the \u201cleft\u201d candidates while Kemi and Jenrick are the right From Adam Boulton, the former Sky News political editor As I was saying, all four Conservative Candidates offer warm words and no challenge to direction of the party at the GE defeat. All pitches went down well. Last two likely to be Jenrick &amp; Clerverly From Christian Calgie from the Express Snap analysis: - Jenrick\u2019s frontrunner status has become a burden, creating very high expectations. He didn\u2019t not meet them, but he was certainly overshadowed. - Kemi was confident, I\u2019m still not sure if I or the public quite understand what she\u2019s selling - But dealt a huge blow by a knockout performance from James Cleverly - Leaves the race for the final two, and the winner, more open than ever From Steve Richards, the writer and broadcaster Quite significant that R Jenrick gets the year wrong of M Thatcher\u2019s election as leader given he framed his speech around it..he begun and ended by saying it was 1974..there were 2 general elections in 74..no space for a leadership contest that Thatcher won in 75..he\u2019s shallow\u2026 From Tom Harwood from GB News Cleverly and Jenrick delivered standout speeches. Badenoch and Tugendhat assured but lacking in magic. From Henry Zeffman from the BBC Totally unscientific but in the hall that felt like a triumph for James Cleverly. Followed by a much bigger standing ovation than Tom Tugendhat got From Kate Ferguson from the Sun on Sunday James Cleverly the breakout star of conference. But Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch both served plenty of red meat to the base From James Heale from the Spectator That\u2019s all from me for today. Colleagues are taking over the blog now. Ladbrokes, the betting firm, says it has cut its odds on James Cleverly to win the Tory leadership contest, and that he is now second favourite. Alex Apati, a spokesperson for the firm, said: As expected, a flurry of bets on Cleverly over the last few days have seen our traders slash his odds of replacing Rishi Sunak ... he\u2019s now comfortably Jenrick\u2019s closest challenger for the job. Ladbrokes has Robert Jenrick on 4/7, Cleverly on 11/4, Kemi Badenoch on 6/1 and Tom Tugendhat on 16/1. Sometimes campaigners manipulate betting odds by putting lots of bets on their candidate, so that the odds shorten and it looks as if they have momentum. But it is not likely that is happening today. There is a consensus that Cleverly has done well at the conference, and with his speech this morning. People who bet on politics tend to be people who follow it closely, and trust their judgment, so this market move looks genuine. The Tory MP Jesse Norman, who is backing Kemi Badenoch, has posted this on social media. I am very sorry to have to say it, but that speech of Robert Jenrick\u2019s was lazy, mendacious, simplistic tripe. These are from my colleague Kiran Stacey, who has been monitoring the post-hustings spin from rival camps. The Tory leadership campaign is getting bitter. - Rival campaigns describe Cleverly\u2019s speech as \u201cThat of a party chair not a leader\u2026 A bit Comical Ali.\u201d - On Tugendhat: \u201cThe speech of a Cambridge professor lecturing on Keats.\u201d Jesse Norman, prominent Badenoch backer on Jenrick: \u201cA dreadful speech\u2026 fundamentally untrue.\u201d Here is our story on the leadership hustings. Jessica Elgot and Kiran Stacey report: James Cleverly has seized the momentum in the Conservative leadership contest, calling on his party to be \u201cmore normal\u201d after a tumultuous few days for his two main rivals, Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick. In a speech on the final day of the Tory conference in which he apologised to the membership and the country for the failings of the parliamentary party, he said victory would come again when the Conservatives were \u201centhusiastic, relatable, positive, optimistic, let\u2019s be more normal\u201d. But despite days of difficult headlines, Badenoch, the shadow housing secretary, received a rapturous reception in the hall for her attacks on net zero and identity politics. She closed the conference on Wednesday with a speech taking on her critics and promising to \u201ctell the truth\u201d. The former business secretary said: \u201cI grew up in a place where fear was everywhere. Listening as you hear your neighbours scream, as they are being burgled and beaten \u2026 When you\u2019ve experienced that kind of fear, you\u2019re not worried about being attacked on Twitter.\u201d This is from Christopher Hope, GB News\u2019 political editor. Overwhelming support for James Cleverly in 10 random interviews I\u2019ve just done for @GBNEWS with members leaving the hall just now. Many have switched from other candidates. It seems Cleverly won the debate in the hall. Will MPs put him through to the final two next week?\u2026 The Kemi Badenoch campaign has released a statement from David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, saying he is now endorsing her. Davis said: Kemi understands, as Margaret Thatcher did, that Conservatives must be address the everyday problems that people face. We should not say only what is fashionable or make endless promises which we cannot deliver, but carefully build radical policies which will revitalise Britain\u2019s confidence, freedom and prosperity. As an engineer, with clear conservative principles and a willingness to speak the truth, Kemi is the leader who can deliver that. Kemi\u2019s speech today was the conference speech of a leader. It always takes a while to work out the full impact of a political speech. There is the instant response from people who have heard it in the hall, then people read it again, watch how it is refracted through the social media, find out how the focus groups and the polls respond, and after a few days a settled consensus emerges. At this point it does not feel as if there was a standout winner, but James Cleverly was probably the candidate who did most to outperform expectations. Here is my take on the four speeches. Tom Tugendhat: Tugendhat arrived at the conference as the underdog, he has avoided any gaffes, but that was probably not a speech that will do enough to lift him in the rankings. Having a military record tends to help in politics, but it will only get you so far, and in the speech he was relatively light on how he would change policy, or the party. James Cleverly: Cleverly has probably had the best conference, in that nothing has really gone wrong for him, and of the four speakers he easily came across as the warmest, most engaging and nicest. Starting with an apology was a good move. Despite his references to change, he is arguably the most status quo candidate, but that might make him a safe choice for MPs, and members. His speech was the most optimistic, and the best written. Robert Jenrick: Jenrick has been favourite in the contest for a while, and that is unlikely to change, but that was not a speech that will consolidate his lead. He is offering the clearest policy on immigration, and the ECHR. But he does not convey 100% authenticity (speeches are a good test of this \u2013 with the Thatcher, and Labour-bashing passages, it felt he was trying a little too hard) and his policy platform felt a just a little too \u2018ChatGPT, Write a speech that will please the Telegraph\u2019. Kemi Badenoch: There is no doubt about Badenoch\u2019s authenticity, but that could be a problem too. What she is offering is extreme \u2013 the entire recasting of the state, Tory Leninism, perhaps a better speech for a Reform UK leadership contest than a Tory one. As a speaker, she was compelling, and she had more change to offer than any of her rivals, but to a lot of people she will come over as harsh and aggressive, and there must be Tory members who will worry where her plan to dismantle parts of the state will end up. (Badenoch is confident talking about principles, but whenever anyone gets on to what this might mean in practice \u2013 cutting maternity pay, cutting the minimum wage etc \u2013 she shies away.) Badenoch referenced Keith Joseph, a hero for some Tories, but others will remember that his own bid for the leadership in 1975 was cut short after he floated ideas that colleagues viewed as crackers. All four candidate are now on stage together taking applause. (This morning officials were saying they did not expect a group photgraph to happen.) The conference is now ending with a rendition of the national anthem. Badenoch ended by saying she wanted: A Britain that is friends with its neighbors but will always proudly protect its national interests, a Britain at ease with itself, a Britain that believes in itself and that sort of Britain can only come about because of renewed conservative principles, The time to start that renewal is right now. Badenoch says she wants to \u201crewrite the rules of the game\u201d. He explains: If I become leader, we will immediately begin a,once in a generation undertaking, the sort of project not attempted since the days of Keith Joseph in the 1970s, a comprehensive plan to reprogram the British state, to reboot the British economy \u2026 one that goes far beyond the relationship with the EU or the ECHR, a plan that considers every aspect of what the state does and why it does it \u2026 A plan built on the principles and priorities of our nation, a plan that looks at our international agreements, at the Human Rights Act, the Equality Act, at judicial review and judicial activism, at the Treasury and the Bank of England, at devolutions and quango, at the civil service and the health service. At how we use power to give power to the British people. We will rewire, reboot and reprogram. Nothing is more exciting to me. I am an engineer, and engineers do not hide from the truth. Badenoch says Blairism is still embedded in politics. The stealthy poisoning of our society needs to stop. And let\u2019s face it, Liberal Democrats are not going to defend our country. Unlike the left, we know right from wrong, but we allowed ourselves to be bound by aggressive identity politics, by a Treasury whose rules were written by Gordon Brown and a legal system re-engineered by Tony Blair. You may think Blair and Brown were defeated in 2010 but the truth is, the left never left. It\u2019s time to make a change. Badenoch defends her record on trans issues. For too long, government stayed silent as women were sacked for saying that a man cannot be a woman. I fought for them while Labour called them bigots, and it wasn\u2019t until the SNP put a sex offender in a women\u2019s prison that they understood the fight I was leading. We won that battle. Nicola Sturgeon has gone and labor now accepts our arguments. Badenoch says she has been fighting identity politics all her life. And she goes on: Like the 1970s we face a battle of ideas against the left and its desire for ever greater social and economic control. It is socialism returned socialism in a suit. The British public knows that socialism doesn\u2019t work. They know. But you can give it a new label. You can sneak it in. You can promote class warfare under the banner of equality. You can take freedom and choice away from families by telling them that Ofsted inspection reports are unfair. If you call communism, environmentalism, you can close down businesses, block the roads and stop people going to work. This new politics has made us afraid, afraid to defend the people who need us, like young Conservatives. They tell me they are afraid to share their politics with other students, because they will be attacked that they are marked down by lecturers because of their beliefs. We have let young Conservatives down. Badenoch says the last government did not defend capitalism. Capitalism does not mean corporatism. It does not mean monopolies. It means free markets and competition. We didn\u2019t always protect those principles. Like Labour, we raised taxes on business, corporation tax, capital gains tax, we tax dividends, and we regulated like labour. Badenoch says the Tories stopped acting like Conservatives. Net zero is a good example, she says. We set a target with no plan on how to meet it, just so politicians could say we were the first country to do so. Now we have a net zero strategy addicted to state subsidy, making energy more expensive and hurting our economy. I am not a climate change sceptic, but I am a net zero sceptic. Badenoch recalls growing up in Nigeria. I was born here, but I grew up in a place where fear was everywhere. You cannot understand it unless you\u2019ve lived it, triple checking that all the doors and windows are locked, waking up in the night at every sound, listening as you hear your neighbors scream as they are being burgled and beaten, and wondering if your home will be next. When you\u2019ve experienced that kind of fear, you\u2019re not worried about being attacked on Twitter. You appreciate how rare and precious it is to live in a country with security, democracy, equality under the law and above all else, freedom \u2013 free speech, free enterprise, free markets, conservative freedoms, conservative principles. I am not a Conservative because I study politics at university. I\u2019m an engineer. I am not a Conservative because my family always voted Conservative. I am a Conservative because I have seen what happens when a country loses sight of those principles, and that must not happen here. Badenoch says the party has to get the diagnosis right. It is not enough just to be in government, because you can be in government and not have power without a plan to fix the system, you end up just announcing policies, doing media and waiting for something to happen, and then you run into trouble, as this Labour government are quickly finding out \u2026 Our country needs us. We must not let it down for this to work, we need to go back to first principles. She recalls her father, who was a GP. He also taught me responsibility. He would say 80% of what happens to you is down to you. He was right. And as a GP, he taught me how to solve problems. He would say, if you get the diagnosis wrong, the treatment won\u2019t work. I miss my dad. He taught me the most important lesson of all, never be afraid to do the right thing. No matter what people say about you, just do the right thing. My father taught me not to be afraid. The Kemi Badenoch video stresses how disillusioned people are with politics generally. She is on stage now, and she starts: It is time to tell the truth, the truth about our party, the truth about our politics, the truth about our future. For too long, politicians have been scared of the truth. For too long, politicians have hidden behind spin. For too long, politicians have been scared of the truth for too long. Politicians have hidden behind spin for too long. Politicians have told the public what they wanted to hear and then done their own thing. Well, I say enough. Badenoch says she addressed the Tory conference seven years ago (when she introdued Theresa May before her conference speech). She goes on: But I am no longer a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed back bencher. I am a veteran of four government departments and a former cabinet minister. I have seen the system from the inside. Ladies and gentlemen, the system is broken. Jenrick ends by saying he wants to lead change. Come with me, join me, work with me in this new Conservative party and together, let\u2019s take a stand for the country that we love. Jenrick says he will stand up for British culture. Well, how have we come to the point where a teacher from Batley remains in hiding because in a class on free speech of all things, they showed a cartoon of Muhammad. How have we come to the point on our watch in which the NHS has facilitated thousands of children to have life changing, life altering surgery. How have we come to the point where the RAF the Royal Air Force has chosen pilots on the basis of race and gender? Well, I say our new Conservative party. We will be tolerant, but we will stand for never tolerating any of this, ever again. Jenrick says he would cut foreign aid, to fund raising defence spending to 3% of GDP. Jenrick calls for public sector reform, and a smaller state. We will also take a stand for a small state that actually works, not a big state that fails \u2026 We need to do for all our public services, what we did for schools in the 2010s empower the good leaders, kick out the bad ones, be relentless in driving up standards and having zero tolerance for failure, that must be at the core of our mission as a party. Jenrick says the Tories must champion more housebuilding. Our country needs more homes. We need more industry and infrastructure. So I have a hard message for all of us today, if we want to be the party of low tax, of growth of business \u2013 as I do, and I know you do too \u2013 we also need to be the party of fixing the broken system that stops us building the homes, the factories, the data centers, the roads, the trams, the trains the investment that Britain desperately needs. Jenrick says the Tories must \u201ctake a stand on net zero\u201d. He says he does not oppose the principle of net zero, but he does oppose \u201cthe crazy interim binding targets put into law by Gordon Brown\u201d. Jenrick restates his call for the UK to leave the European convention on human rights so it can end illegal migration. We must take a stand to secure our borders. We must secure our borders. 120,000 people have entered our country on small boats on our watch. 99% of them are still here, costing us billions. Frankly, there is no future for this party unless we take a stand to answer this problem, and the way to do that we all know is to detain and swiftly deport everyone who comes into our country illegally. But we will never do that .. unless we leave the European convention on human rights. Jenrick says he wants \u201ca new great Reform Act, one that leaves the ECHR, repeals Tony Blair\u2019s Human Rights Act and writes a British Bill of Rights\u201d. He goes on: And the age of mass migration that must end too. It\u2019s not making us any richer, it\u2019s putting immense pressure on our housing, our hospitals, our roads, and if we\u2019re honest with ourselves, the sheer scale and the lack of integration is sapping at our culture and our national cohesion. If I am your leader, I will fight for the effective freeze in net migration our country needs. And this time, we will cast it in iron. We will do it with a vote in Parliament so that each and every one of us can look the British public in the eye and say, we mean it. We\u2019re going to do it this time and and if we do that, we give our country the effective breathing space that we need. Will we be open to the best and the brightest? Yes, absolutely. Will we be open to the world and its wife and all their extended family? No, not anymore, and under my conservative party, never, ever again. Jenrick says the Tories must be honest about their failings. I will be painfully honest about our failings. We failed to deliver the strong NHS, the strong economy and, yes, the strong border that we promised friends, we must never fail our people again. And the party must change, he says. And the truth is this, if we are going to change this party to restore the trust and the confidence of the people, if we are going to tackle together the immense challenges our country faces, we are going to have to build something new \u2013 a new conservative party That is what I call for today \u2013 a new Conservative party, nothing less than that, built on the rock of our proudest traditions and noblest values, but a new Conservative party. Jenrick carries on the attack on Labour. Where\u2019s the vision, where\u2019s the boldness? The country just voted for change, and all we\u2019ve got is more managed decline. Sir Keir Starmer will take the knee, but he will never take a stand. He doesn\u2019t even take a stand. He doesn\u2019t even take a stand at the football anymore \u2026 And what about the cabinet? Well, Rachel Reeves, as wooden as Pinocchio, and only barely more honest. And then we\u2019ve got Ed Miliband, Whoever tells you the grown ups are back in charge. Look at Ed Miliband, a Wallace missing his Gromit. And Jenrick says Labour represent a different group. Who is Sir Keir Starmer in politics for? Well, the last three months have shown us who: convicted criminals walking free, illegal migrants given an amnesty, well-paid train drivers given yet more money, all the while the hard-working silent majority waiting for huge tax rises, the nation\u2019s wealth creators fleeing en masse and millions of pensioners betrayed. Imagine, imagine friends, imagine how cowardly you have to be to rob poor pensioners just to placate your union paymasters. Jenrick descibes who he is in politics for. I am in politics for the millions of people in our country just like [his parents], devoted citizens, good neighbors, the people who get up early in the morning to put food on the table for their families, yes, the people who start small businesses around their kitchen tables, the people for whom there is no pressure group pressing their case, no lobby demanding their so called rights. So let me tell you, if I am your leader, the pressure group for Britain\u2019s hard working majority will be us, the Conservative party. Robert Jenrick starts by saying it is \u201cgood to be back\u201d. He is a Midlands man, and he grew up in Wolverhampton. He says 50 years ago his parents came to Birmingham. His dad got a job at an iron foundary. It has made the cannon for Wellington\u2019s army, he says. (Referencing Napoleon as the enemy is very Brexit.) He says the Tories decided to change in 1974. They chose to change their leadership. (Er \u2013 the leadership election that Margaret Thatcher won was actually in 1975.) He says the Tories reversed Britain\u2019s decline under Thatcher. He says she is one of his heroines. They are now showing a video about Robert Jenrick. It starts with footage featuring Boris Johnson and Liz Truss quite prominently (quite a bold move). It is a reminder of Brexit. And it ends showing Jenrick talking to a voter who says he will return to the party if Jenrick is leader. Cleverly is now on his peroration. So it\u2019s in our hands, yours and mine, to turn this around, and we can because the facts of life, the simple desire to aspire and achieve, to provide safety and security for your family, to own a home, to build a life and give your children a better tomorrow than today \u2013 these are conservative facts. We may have lost our way, but it\u2019s time to get back on track, because history shows that while we have no right to govern, we govern where we get it right. So let\u2019s unite. Let\u2019s rebuild this party of ours. Cleverly says he is running, not because he wants to be someone, but because he wants to do something. So if you want a winner, choose one, choose someone who can deliver results, who can communicate effectively and who campaigns relentlessly. Choose someone who you know and who is tested and who doesn\u2019t hide from the media. Choose someone who is not afraid of the public, but is popular with the public, and choose the candidate who Starmer, Farage and Davey fear the most, because I will not accept the status quo. I will not accept defeatism, and I will not accept defeat. Cleverly also talks about his time as home secretary, saying again he introduced controls that brought down immigration. Because leadership is about things like making the tough decisions when you get that ugly phone call in the middle of the night about keeping this country safe, because I\u2019ve been there, because I know in detail what the government should be doing right now. I know in detail how they\u2019re failing. Now is not the time for an apprentice. There is an echo of Gordon Brown \u201cnow is not the time for a novice\u201d speech to the Labour conference in 2008 (a jibe at both David Cameron and David Miliband). Cleverly is now talking about his record as foreign secretary. We need to choose someone to lead us who has already done their apprenticeship to get this party winning again. As foreign secretary, I strengthened our posture on Iran. I dealt with Putin\u2019s nuclear threats. I worked with Ben Wallace to get tanks delivered to Ukraine. And in Beijing, I told the Chinese foreign minister to his face, do not invade Taiwan and lift the sanctions. And I told him directly to lift the sanctions on my parliamentary friends, even those who have decided to run against me. Cleverly says his support for Israel is \u201cunwavering\u201d. And he says he wants to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP. Cleverly says he will revive the party\u2019s campaigning machine. And he says there will be \u201cno more stitch-ups\u201d in candidate selections. Cleverly is now talking about what the Conservatives should do. Conference, how are we going to face the great challenges of our time? The way we always have done when we succeed \u2013 by being for stuff. British science and engineering shaped the modern world. We are the country that gave the world the vaccine, twice, the steam engine, the light bulb, the World Wide Web, the bicycle, the tank, the people who split the atom. We need more \u2026 We need to build more homes so that we can build a new generation of optimism in the tradition of Macmillan and Thatcher, we need to cut the cost of childcare so people can build a family. We need to cut red tape so we can build the energy and the transport infrastructure we need, but do so more cheaply and more quickly. We need to build, build, build and remake the argument for Conservatism for capitalism by our actions, not just our words. Cleverly rules out a pact with Reform UK. Reform didn\u2019t deliver Brexit, we did. Reform didn\u2019t cut immigration, I did. Mark my words, we will beat Reform by being the best version of our sales, not a pale version of anyone else. So no mergers, no deals. Cleverly recalls Conservative achievements, running from the abolition of the slave trade to equal marriage and Brexit. Don\u2019t let anyone trash our record. Be proud of our record. And compare that with what we saw at the Labour Party conference just last week, a party drunk on power who lied to the British people, glasses for passes, favors for friends, swamped in scandal, and even worse, inflation busting pay rises to their union paymasters taken straight out of the pockets of British pensioners. And what did Keir Starmer say just last week? He wants the state to have more control over your lives, a nanny state, closing pubs early, banning smoking outdoors and even trying to control the price of Oasis tickets. He also has a good joke about the Lib Dems. And we know the Lib Dems won\u2019t do it. They\u2019re too wet \u2013 and in the case of Ed Davey soaking wet. Cleverly says his political hero is Ronald Reagan, because of his optimism. Let\u2019s be more like Reagan. Let\u2019s be enthusiastic, relatable, positive, optimistic. Let\u2019s be more normal \u2026 Let\u2019s sell the benefits of conservatism with a smile. Cleverly seems to be referencing the decision of UK Democrats to describe Trump as \u201cweird\u201d. There is a slight suggestion that some of opponents are a bit too harsh or extreme too. Cleverly says, like his parents, he is optimistic. His life hasn\u2019t been straightforward, he says I grew up a mixed race kid in Lewisham now at 19. I joined the regular army, but I got injured and I had to drop out, so I joined the Reserves and served for over 30 years in the Royal Artillery, finishing as a lieutenant colonel. Now, I don\u2019t pretend to be a war hero, but I did command a battery in Bristol of 100 soldiers, and one day I got the call. I got mobilized. I thought I was going to Basra or Baghdad - and I was sent to Luton. He says he worked in publishing for a decade, but lost his job. He set up a small business, but after the crash the made no money. So I know what it is like to take risks, to run a small business, to work crazy hours, to put food on the table. I know what it\u2019s like to stumble and to fall and to get up again and again and again. Cleverly says he did not plan to run for leader. He could have spent more time with his family, and his warhammer figures (his hobby). But I went into politics to get things done, not watch from the sidelines, and all the more so after the defeat that we\u2019ve just had, I need to do this for the party that I love. Cleverly recalls his mother, who came to the UK from Sierra Leone. She did not live to become an MP, he says. Some people love to talk our country down. But this country has given so much to so many people, including my family. Now, both my parents were in the business of optimism. And he mentions his wife, Suzy, saying she has had treatment for cancer. Her life was saved, he says. He thanks the NHS. James Cleverly starts by asking what the purpose of the party is. They are in opposition. But their purpose is to be in power. We\u2019re in politics to serve the British people and to make their lives better. It\u2019s not our right, but it is our mission, our duty and intent. They need to get back on track, he says. But before we can do that, there\u2019s something we need to say. Sorry. Sorry on behalf of the Conservative parliamentary party who let you down. And we have to be better, much better. And under my leadership, we will be. They are now showing a video about James Cleverly. It features many members and supporters speaking, including Grant Shapps and Ruth Davidson. They stress Cleverly\u2019s credentials as someone who can unite the party. Tugendhat is off the stage, and the podium is coming back on. Tugendhat turns to his opponents. My opponents claim that they\u2019ve got more management experience around the cabinet table. Sure, that\u2019s true, but I\u2019m not here to manage. I\u2019m here to lead. The party needs change, he says. He claims he is the only person who can deliver that. He ends: That\u2019s the change only I will bring. Our mission is the prosperity and happiness of the British people and we start today. There is enthusiastic applause. Tugendhat says they have to give young people a chance. We need to give young people the chance to own a home, connect that home to work and that work to growth. That\u2019s our route back. That\u2019s how we win again, by remembering that Conservative principles start with a family and build to the nation, by remembering that Conservative economics help you control your own life and your own wealth, by remembering that Conservative delivery starts with a patient, and the pupil, not the faceless bureaucrat. He says, when the Tories deliver on these three things, they win converts. The party must win, not in 10 years or 15, but in five. Tugendhat says he is proud of the role the armed forces played last night helping to defend Israel. Tugendhat turns to energy security. He says Britain needs more nuclear power stations, \u201cso we are never dependent on tyrants\u201d. The lesson from Germany is stark. They bet on cheap Russian energy, on fast Chinese growth, and they left their borders open. Now none of those bets have paid off. Dictators are dictating the terms of trade once more, and that\u2019s why we need to stand with our allies. Tugendhat is getting more stuck into policy. The UK has had too little growth, he says. We can only fix the problem if we diagnose the cause, and it starts, as every Conservative knows, with our economy, real growth, not the illusion of growth that has boosted been boosted by migration and has barely shifted in the past 30 years. Now that\u2019s left us poorer and more vulnerable. We need a new Conservative revolution. That\u2019s what Margaret Thatcher did. Tugendhat says he would set a 100,000 cap on net migration. But a cap on its own wont\u2019 work, he says. He goes on: This is about visas, not about foreign courts. Let me tell you something that my opponents probably won\u2019t this isn\u2019t simple. We issued the visas because businesses need the staff for our care homes and our hospitals to look after our families. So how do we square this circle where we need to fix migration by fixing the gaps in education and skills in transport and in housing so that we can recruit at home and not abroad? Well, we need to fix migration by fixing the gaps in education and skills in transport and in housing so that we can recruit at home and not abroad. Now I will end the cap on apprenticeships and use the immigration skills charge to invest in further education and train our own people. Tugendhat says higher wages are needed too. We need higher wages, and for that, businesses need to be able to grow faster with a fantastic, skilled and healthy workforce and less regulation holding them back. Tugendhat says he will rebuild CCHQ. I will turn us back into being the campaign winning machine that you know we can be. My plan is to rebuild the Conservative party and to make you proud again. My mission is to win the next general election, and I have never failed a mission yet. Tugendhat jokes about the Labour donations controversy. You can\u2019t afford Labour. I can\u2019t afford Labour. Lord Alli can\u2019t afford Labour. And he attacks Labour on policy. They are the most venal and vindictive administration in decades. Starmer isn\u2019t just making pensioners pay for his union paymasters. He\u2019s undermining freedom of speech in our universities. He\u2019s trashing our border security instead of keeping us safe. He wants to police smoking in beer gardens. He\u2019s freeing criminals, not standing up for the police. Now, I know what it\u2019s like when a Labour government doesn\u2019t have your back. The last Labour government left our troops without body armor in Iraq and without helicopters in Afghanistan. As your prime minister, I will never abandon those on the front line, Tugendhat says he won\u2019t offer empty promises. Leadership is not about empty promises. It\u2019s not about cheap rhetoric or government by management consultancy. It\u2019s not about managing decline, and it\u2019s not about talking our country down. Leadership is about making choices that serve our country and our people best. He accuses Labour of talking the country down, and stresses his pride in Britain. And he signals that he would seek to win back voters from all sides. If you went to Reform, I want to show you the conservative values that we share. If you went to the Lib Dems, I want you to see the opportunities that only we can deliver. If you went to Labour I want to show you why freedom, not state control, is how we build. If you stayed at home, I want to make you proud to vote Conservative again. Tugendhat says he has had enough of the \u201cpetty point-scoring and self service\u201d at Westminster. He is offering leadership, he says. He says he knows what leadership is from his time in the military. I was a soldier, I served our country and I faced our enemies. I know what leadership demands. When everything else has been cut away and there\u2019s nothing left, character is what remains. In Afghanistan and in Iraq. I served in combat alongside the best, and I\u2019ve seen friends push themselves beyond their limits, and some made the ultimate sacrifice. When it was hard, when it was tough, we kept going, even after we were knocked down and thought it was over. I know what drove them, and I know what drove me. It\u2019s leadership, and our country is crying out for leadership. Tugendhat arrives. He starts \u201cGood morning conference\u201d. When there is no response, he asks them to try again (which is a bit panto). The election was bruising. But the conference has made him optimistic, he says. Four days here with all of you has helped turn my anger and my disappointment into optimism. I can feel the energy, I can feel the determination. I can feel the hope you, the beating heart of our party \u2026 I know we can, and we will rebuild this party. I know we can and we will reconnect with the British people. I know we can, and we will restore trust. And if we do that, we can and we will win again. They are now showing a video about Tom Tugendhat. It stresses his military record. Andrew has finished, and the podium is being removed. There is just a small stand on stage, with a glass of water. Most of the candidates are planning to speak without a text or autocue. They have been learning their speeches \u2013 keen to emulate David Cameron, whose no-notes speech in 2005 gave him a breakthrough in the leadership contest. Andrew says he needs help. They have to put the years of division behind them, he says. We have all got to get behind whoever wins. We are the most successful political party in the world for a reason, because our forebears, as custodians of our party, have come together when their backs were against the wall to build back when they have fallen short. Andrew recalls growing up in a council home in Wales. It was this party that showed that same teenager that families on his estate could become homeowners for the first time. It was this party that gave that teenager\u2019s dad the chance to set up his own small business, ending long periods of unemployment. It was this party that said to that teenager, it didn\u2019t matter that he didn\u2019t go to university, as he could still fulfill his dreams and aspirations. rations. So what did the Conservative party offer to that working class kid from Wales? It gave him the privilege and the honour to serve as your chief whip. Back in the hall, Andrew is talking about Labour. Keir Starmer \u201cdefinitely doesn\u2019t go to Specsavers,\u201d he says. You would think that the son of a toolmaker would do a better job of putting his own wardrobe together. Andrew talks about House of Cards, and how in that drama the chief whip ended up as party leader, by eliminating all the candidates. Is it coincidence he is here now? \u201cYou may well think that, but I couldn\u2019t possible comment,\u201d he jokes. He says he is appealling to members for help. The party lost \u201cbrilliant\u201d MPs at the election, he says. But the party is not done, he says. Stuart Andrew, the chief whip, is speaking now. He says he will talk about what the party is doing in parliament. Referring to the \u201chorrific scenes in Israel\u201d, he says the party will work with the government to support Israel, because that is in the national interest. Richard Fuller, the Tory chair, is on the conference platform now introducing the morning session. He starts with thanks to various people who have helped with the conference. Yesterday Robert Jenrick\u2019s team said Jenrick was worried about losing his voice, and they concerns about how well he would be able to project today. This helps to explain a nice joke at the start of this conference upsum by Giles Dilnot, the ConservativeHome editor. After a frenetic Conference for Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Tom Tugendhat and Robert Jenrick the tiredness will be kicking in, but also for the teams of advisers who want, and maybe need, their principal to take another go at delivering the twenty-minute speech of their career. It\u2019s a four hoarse race. As for who has done best out of the conference so far, Dilnot says there has not (so far?) been a breakthrough moment for anyone. The problem for the party, and for me, is that none of this gossipy chatter has taken the conference attendees much further forward \u2013 nor has any of the four taken conference by storm. In an article for the Sunday Telegraph published at the weekend, Kemi Badenoch said that people should be committed to the UK, they should \u201clove this country\u201d, if they want to settle here as immigrants. She also implied people who \u201chate Israel\u201d should be excluded. On the Today programme this morning Mishal Husain, interviewing Badenoch, tried to get her to explain how a Badenoch government could actually enforce an immigration policy based on these principles. She did not much much luck. Asked if policy might depend on country of origin (banning or restricting people from certain countries?) or a test on arrival (only admitting people who pass?), Badenoch said it could be \u201call of those things\u201d. But she repeatedly said she was not proposing policy now, because at this point what mattered were the principles behind her stance. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t have the strategy,\u201d she said. Badenoch also argued that setting out policy now was counterproductive. In comments that were implicitly critical of her rivals, who have been much happier announcing policy, she said: The leadership contest is now, and what we are testing is principles and character, not the detail of policy solutions. That will come later. And the more we start talking about policy before deciding on what we agree on, the more likely we are to start having arguments after the fact. That is what I want to change. People ask me how we unite the party. It\u2019s by starting with principles, with the mission and direction. According to Dan Bloom in his London Playbook briefing for Politico, Tories at conference think Kemi Badenoch\u2019s outspoken interventions at the conference have backfired for her. He says: The conference is awash with talk from some senior Tories that Kemi Badenoch\u2019s blunt comments on maternity pay, minimum wage and the like damaged her standing with MPs, who hold knockout rounds next week. One former minister who backs a rival tells Playbook: \u201cShe fucked up on day one.\u201d A senior Tory accuses her of \u201cgaslighting\u201d MPs by blaming the media for over-interpreting her. A backer of another rival adds: \u201cEvery time she opens her mouth it gets worse for her \u2026 The longer the contest the better it is for everyone else.\u201d In a conference write-through for Bloomberg, Alex Wickham, Ailbhe Rea and Lucy White says much the same. Badenoch\u2019s pugnacious style and willingness to get drawn into controversies may have put off some MPs worried about how she\u2019d behave under the glare of leadership, one lawmaker said. Another described her campaign as blowing up over the remarks. A third said Badenoch needed a good week to cement her position among MPs, concluding that hadn\u2019t happened. The four leadership candidates will not be appearing on the stage together at the conference this morning, it has emerged. Relations between them have been strained; despite the \u201cyellow card\u201d rule supposed to stop personal attacks, most of them have found ways of slyly disparaging their opponents, and there are suggestions they were not all willing to stand alongside each other for a jolly team photograph. But we are expected to see them in the hall together at the end, when members wrap up the conference by singing the national anthem. Tom Tugendhat said it is \u201cupsetting\u201d that his Conservative leadership rival Robert Jenrick used footage of a soldier Tugenhdat served with in Afghanistan to claim UK special forces were \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists. Jenrick has been widely-criticised for the campaign video in which he claimed special forces were acting like this through fear of detainees being released under European human rights law. Tugendhat said one of the soldiers featured in Jenrick\u2019s video died shortly after the video was taken, and is therefore unable to defend himself from such accusations. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Tugendhat said: What\u2019s particularly upsetting is that video is using a piece of footage of some of the people I served with, one of whom there died shortly after that film was taken in an accident, and is not able to defend himself from the accusation that is effectively being levelled against him. I do not think we should be using footage of our special forces in operations. I would not put that video out. In fact I\u2019d pull it down. James Cleverly has defended his call for the Tories to commit to abolishing stamp duty on homes In an interview with the Today programme, when it was put to him that this would cost around \u00a310bn, he replied: At the last general election, my party \u2013 the Conservative party \u2013 was being criticised by the Labour party for taxing too much. If we don\u2019t start cutting taxes, we stifle the economy and we will ultimately not be able to thrive as a country. When Mishal Husain, the presenter, suggested that this was reminiscent of what Liz Truss was doing in her mini-budget, Cleverly replied: Your argument is because one of my predecessors proposed it, we can never propose it? This is why we have now got the highest tax burden since the war. Higher than many of our international competitors and high enough that the Labour party felt liberated to criticise us. Some Tories at the conference have been calling for closer links with Reform UK. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, insisted he was not interested. He said: There would be no deal with them, I wouldn\u2019t trust them anyway, they have a pattern of behaviour pretending to be one thing and then when they\u2019re in government being quite the opposite. And, frankly, what I\u2019m trying to do with Reform is replace them. Farage also said he thought the Tories had no chance of winning the next election. They all think with a new leader \u2018it\u2019ll all be fine, all the voters will come back to us\u2019, and what they don\u2019t understand is the Conservative brand is completely damaged, they have no chance of winning the next election. Asked if he was proud of having helped to deliver Brexit, Farage said: Do I think getting back our independence was the right thing to do? You bet your life. Do I think we\u2019ve handled it well? Good Lord, no. Good morning. There are plenty of more important things in politics than who becomes the next Conservative leader \u2013 two thirds of voters don\u2019t even care, according to Ipsos polling, including almost a third of people who backed the party at the election \u2013 but if you are interested in the outcome, today is the most important day in the contest so far. Over the past century most people elected Conservative leader have also been prime minister at some point, so it is normally a consequential choice. Although the four-day conference has, in effect, been a long husting, this morning we\u2019re getting the key face-off. All four candidates are delivering a 20-minute speech in the conference hall. A platform speech to a big audience is always a challenge, but the candidates face two particular difficulties this morning. First, they are going to have to say something new (no one is impressed by a speech they have heard before) even though they have spent the last three days constanly using their best soundbites, arguments, jokes and talking points. That won\u2019t be easy. And, second, they have to make a pitch to two separate audiences. Conservative party members will have the final say. But next week the 121 Conservative MPs will vote in two more ballots will eliminate two candidates, before ballot papers with just two names go out to members. And the views and priorities of members and MPs are not wholly aligned; MPs tend to have a more acute sense of what will help them stay elected. The four candidates have briefed out lines from what they plan to say, and here is snapshot. Robert Jenrick, who is now the favourite, is going to talk about building a new Conservative party. According to the Telegraph, he will say: The truth is this. If we\u2019re to tackle the immense challenges we face, if we\u2019re to restore the public\u2019s trust, we must build something new. A new Conservative party. That is what I call for today. Nothing less than a new Conservative party built on the rock of our oldest values and best traditions. If I become our leader, this is what \u2013 together \u2013 we will build. Jenrick\u2019s platform is very rightwing in some respects (he is the only candidate fully committed to withdrawal from the European convention on human rights), but this is the language of Tony Blair, when he created New Labour. Kemi Badenoch will say the Tories must be the party of \u201cwealth creation\u201d. She will say: The Conservatives have to be the party of wealth creation. Wealth is not a dirty word. It supports jobs and families. It pays for our schools, for our health service. We should encourage it. James Cleverly will strike the most optimistic note, the advance briefing suggests. He will say: Let\u2019s be enthusiastic; relatable; positive; optimistic. Let\u2019s sell the benefits of a Conservative government with a smile. We will not win back voters by pretending to be something we\u2019re not. We win back voters by being honest, by being professional, by being Conservative. And Tom Tugendhat will also adopt Blairite language, calling for a \u201cNew Conservative Revolution\u201d, according to Politico\u2019s London Playbook (which says the New is capped up in the briefing it had). There is more on what they will say in our overnight conference story, by Jessica Elgot. Here is the timetable for the day. 10.30am: Richard Fuller, the Conservative chair, opens the morning session, and there is also a short speech from Stuart Andrew, the chief whip. Then we get into the main event of the conference: the leadership contenders\u2019 beauty parade, where they all deliver 20-minute speeches in the conference hall. 10.45am: Tom Tugendhat speaks. 11.10am: James Cleverly speaks. 11.35am: Robert Jenrick speaks. Noon: Kemi Badenoch speaks. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can\u2019t read all the messages BTL, but if you put \u201cAndrew\u201d in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I\u2019m still using X and I\u2019ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I\u2019m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian). I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct). And I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.",

      "body": "<p>The four Conservative leadership candidates each sought to charm members with 20-minute speeches setting out their vision for the party. </p>  <h2>Tom Tugendhat</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Tugendhat\u2019s speech was filled with references to his military experience to illustrate how he can \u201clead\u201d and not \u201cmanage\u201d, as his rivals would, in the Conservative fightback against Keir Starmer\u2019s \u201cbleak outlook\u201d, which he says is already hurting the UK.</p></li> <li><p>He remains hopeful for the party\u2019s future and thanked the membership for converting his disappointment at the election results into optimism, leaving him determined. But he said the future would only bright if he can end \u201cWestminster\u2019s political games \u2026 petty point-scoring and self-service\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>In a dig at his rivals, the former serviceman said illegal migration has soared \u201cnot because of foreign courts\u201d but because of visas. Taking a less critical tone, he said immigration can only be fixed by filling \u201cthe gaps in education and skills, in transport and in housing, so that we can recruit at home and not abroad\u201d.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Most memorable quote</strong></p> <p>\u201cI know what leadership really is. Before I stood for parliament, I was a soldier, I served our country and I faced our enemies. I know what leadership demands when everything else has been cut away and there\u2019s nothing left. Character is what remains in Afghanistan and in Iraq \u2026 Leadership is not about empty promises \u2026 Leadership is about making choices that serve our country and our people best.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Worst joke</strong></p> <p>\u201cI will defeat Labour and lead us back to power in five years\u2019 time. We all know that this country cannot afford Labour. You can\u2019t afford Labour. I can\u2019t afford Labour. Lord Alli can\u2019t afford Labour.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Delivery</strong></p> <p>Tugendhat had an awkward start as he tried to get the audience going, saying, \u201cGood morning, conference, let\u2019s try that again\u201d, before leading into a low-energy speech that may have been too dreary to inspire members.</p> <h2>James Cleverly</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Cleverly urged the membership to choose the candidate who already has the experience to do the job \u201cfrom day one\u201d and is not focused on being the leader but rather making tough decisions, repeatedly insisting \u201cnow is not the time for an apprentice\u201d.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>He used the difficulties he\u2019s faced in life \u2013 growing up as a \u201cmixed-race kid in Lewisham\u201d before failing to be sent to Baghdad or Basra in the reserves \u2013 to showcase his ability to help the Tories succeed by being \u201cfor stuff\u201d.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>He made good use of his speech to highlight his professional achievements, taking credit for speedy candidate selections in the run-up to the 2019 general election and apparently being solely responsible for slashing immigration under Rishi Sunak\u2019s regime.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Most memorable quote</strong></p> <p>\u201cIf you want a winner, choose one \u2026 and choose the candidate who Starmer, Farage and Davey fear the most because I will not accept the status quo. I will not accept defeatism and I will not accept defeat.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Worst joke</strong></p> <p>\u201cThey [Labour] are completely out of their depth, and we need to be ready and we need to hold them to account, not next year or in 2030 or after that but now.

      "bodyText": "The four Conservative leadership candidates each sought to charm members with 20-minute speeches setting out their vision for the party. Tom Tugendhat Tugendhat\u2019s speech was filled with references to his military experience to illustrate how he can \u201clead\u201d and not \u201cmanage\u201d, as his rivals would, in the Conservative fightback against Keir Starmer\u2019s \u201cbleak outlook\u201d, which he says is already hurting the UK. He remains hopeful for the party\u2019s future and thanked the membership for converting his disappointment at the election results into optimism, leaving him determined. But he said the future would only bright if he can end \u201cWestminster\u2019s political games \u2026 petty point-scoring and self-service\u201d. In a dig at his rivals, the former serviceman said illegal migration has soared \u201cnot because of foreign courts\u201d but because of visas. Taking a less critical tone, he said immigration can only be fixed by filling \u201cthe gaps in education and skills, in transport and in housing, so that we can recruit at home and not abroad\u201d. Most memorable quote \u201cI know what leadership really is. Before I stood for parliament, I was a soldier, I served our country and I faced our enemies. I know what leadership demands when everything else has been cut away and there\u2019s nothing left. Character is what remains in Afghanistan and in Iraq \u2026 Leadership is not about empty promises \u2026 Leadership is about making choices that serve our country and our people best.\u201d Worst joke \u201cI will defeat Labour and lead us back to power in five years\u2019 time. We all know that this country cannot afford Labour. You can\u2019t afford Labour. I can\u2019t afford Labour. Lord Alli can\u2019t afford Labour.\u201d Delivery Tugendhat had an awkward start as he tried to get the audience going, saying, \u201cGood morning, conference, let\u2019s try that again\u201d, before leading into a low-energy speech that may have been too dreary to inspire members. James Cleverly Cleverly urged the membership to choose the candidate who already has the experience to do the job \u201cfrom day one\u201d and is not focused on being the leader but rather making tough decisions, repeatedly insisting \u201cnow is not the time for an apprentice\u201d. He used the difficulties he\u2019s faced in life \u2013 growing up as a \u201cmixed-race kid in Lewisham\u201d before failing to be sent to Baghdad or Basra in the reserves \u2013 to showcase his ability to help the Tories succeed by being \u201cfor stuff\u201d. He made good use of his speech to highlight his professional achievements, taking credit for speedy candidate selections in the run-up to the 2019 general election and apparently being solely responsible for slashing immigration under Rishi Sunak\u2019s regime. Most memorable quote \u201cIf you want a winner, choose one \u2026 and choose the candidate who Starmer, Farage and Davey fear the most because I will not accept the status quo. I will not accept defeatism and I will not accept defeat.\u201d Worst joke \u201cThey [Labour] are completely out of their depth, and we need to be ready and we need to hold them to account, not next year or in 2030 or after that but now. And we know the Lib Dems won\u2019t do it. They\u2019re too wet. In the case of Ed Davey, he\u2019s soaking wet.\u201d Delivery Cleverly stood out from the start, opting against the awkward greetings favoured by his rivals, instead posing the big question of the Tory party\u2019s purpose. He then issued a contrite apology to members on behalf of his parliamentary colleagues, for letting them down, exuding confidence throughout, while relating a story about his life and vision for the party. Robert Jenrick Jenrick said there were things to be proud of after 14 years of the Tories in government, but said they failed to deliver a strong NHS, a strong economy and a strong border. He vowed to end illegal migration and repeated his call for Britain to leave the ECHR under a new great reform act that will repeal Tony Blair\u2019s Human Rights Act. He also promised to stand up for British culture, with references to the RAF choosing pilots based on race and gender and a classroom showing a cartoon of Muhammad. Most memorable quote \u201cIf we are going to change this party to restore the trust and the confidence of the people, if we are going to tackle together the immense challenges our country faces, we are going to have to build something new \u2013 a new Conservative party.\u201d Worst joke? On Keir Starmer: \u201cImagine how cowardly you\u2019d have to be to rob poor pensioners to placate your union paymasters. He will take the knee, but he will never take the stand. He doesn\u2019t even take the stand at the football any more.\u201d Delivery Jenrick has been described as an orator and had clearly learned his speech by heart, but he struggled to come across as authentic, delivering an address that was repetitive of the rhetoric he has rehashed since quitting his short stint as an immigration minister. Kemi Badenoch Badenoch said the system was broken and told Tories it\u2019s \u201ctime to tell the truth\u201d. She criticised the last government for not defending capitalism and its record on net zero, noting the last Tory regime \u201cstopped acting like Conservatives\u201d, setting a target with no plan to meet it. She criticised those who claim she \u201clikes to fight\u201d, insisting \u201cshe\u2019s not afraid to\u201d, given her difficult background. But she did call for a fight against identity politics and likened society now to the \u201c1970s [where] we face a battle of ideas against the left and its desire for ever greater social and economic control\u201d. Most memorable quote \u201cI\u2019m sad to be in opposition, but there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s excited, because opposition is an opportunity \u2013 an opportunity to make Angie uncomfortable, to make Rachel wriggle and make Starmer sweat. We are going to have fun. They thought that all they had to do was get us out. But they don\u2019t have a plan. They are not up to the job.

Some residents have resorted to bathing in creeks, and relying on water from streams to flush toilets, according to the Washington Post. Sydney Evans, senior science analyst at Environmental Working Group, said that \u201cafter catastrophic storms like Hurricane Helene, many water systems and private wells are compromised by dangerous contamination like bacteria and other pathogens, industrial pollutants and animal waste that pose an immediate threat to people\u2019s health\u201d. Many in the affected areas, particularly in the Appalachian region, rely on wells that require electricity to access drinking water. But in the aftermath of Helene, which made landfall last Thursday, more than 1 million people remain without power. \u201cNow there are so many additional potential contaminants that may be present in water sources, especially water systems that use surface water,\u201d Elin Betanzo, drinking water expert and president of Safe Water Engineering, said. \u201cBoiling water is effective for addressing acute microbial contaminants, but this might be very difficult with the lack of power in many locations.\u201d Betanzo added that camping drinking water filters and treatments may be another option in the short term.",

The vessel first took to the seas before midnight on Monday but it only travelled for one hour, anchoring north of Bangor a few miles away in the mouth of Belfast Lough. Harsanyi said the latest delays had been to do with \u201csome back and forth about whether they had to go back to Belfast docks for more water and fuel\u201d but \u201ceveryone was pretty positive\u201d, whatever the decision. The liner, which is 31 years old, had been idle for four years before being taken over by the cruise company. Passengers who opted to stay in Northern Ireland while repairs were undertaken grew to love the city and its people. Harsanyi also fell in love. She and her fiance, fellow passenger Gian Perroni, got engaged and hope to have a big wedding when the vessel docks in the Caribbean next spring. One man, who carried a model of the Titanic onboard on Monday, said he enjoyed Belfast but was ready for the rest of the cruise. A woman from Georgia said she had always wanted to see the world, but thanked Belfast for hosting them, calling it \u201ca wonderful place\u201d. One pair of would-be voyagers became engaged while waiting for the cruise to begin. On Tuesday, John Frim, a passenger, said he was a bit \u201cconfused\u201d by the situation but was \u201chappy to be home\u201d and to have slept in his \u201cown bed\u201d onboard the vessel for the first time.

      "bodyText": "Sellafield will have to pay almost \u00a3400,000 after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings at Britain\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site. The vast nuclear waste dump in Cumbria left information that could threaten national security exposed for four years, according to the industry regulator, which brought the charges. It was also found that 75% of its computer servers were vulnerable to cyber-attack. Sellafield had failed to protect vital nuclear information, Westminster magistrates court in London heard on Wednesday. Chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, said that after taking into account Sellafield\u2019s guilty plea and its public funding model, he would fine it \u00a3332,500 for cybersecurity breaches and \u00a353,200 for prosecution costs. The state-owned company has already apologised for the cybersecurity failings. It pleaded guilty to the charges \u2013 which relate to IT security offences spanning a four-year period from 2019 to 2023 \u2013 when they were brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) in June. Goldspring said the case fell into a category \u201cbordering on negligence\u201d and a \u201cdereliction of responsibilities\u201d. Sellafield might also \u201cforeseeably have caused harm\u201d and a loss of data could \u201chave had huge risk adverse consequences for workers, the public and the environment\u201d, he said. Sellafield, which has a workforce of about 11,000 people, is a sprawling rubbish dump on the Cumbrian coast that stores and treats decades of nuclear waste from atomic power generation and weapons programmes. It is the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium and is part of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, a taxpayer-owned and -funded quango. Late last year, the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation revealed a string of IT failings at the state-owned company, dating back several years, as well as radioactive contamination and a toxic workplace culture. The Guardian reported that the site\u2019s systems had been hacked by groups linked to Russia and China, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. The Guardian investigation revealed that Sellafield\u2019s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed \u201cVoldemort\u201d, after the Harry Potter villain, because it was sensitive and dangerous. It also revealed concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its system while unsupervised. In sentencing, Goldspring added that the prosecution did not offer any evidence of a successful cyber-attack, even if it asserted that it was impossible for Sellafield to prove that the nuclear site had not been \u201ceffectively attacked\u201d. As a result, the court could only sentence Sellafield on the basis that there was no evidence of \u201cactual\u201d harm arising from any attacks. The fine was reduced by one-third as the nuclear site pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The judge also noted that Sellafield has sought to improve its cybersecurity in recent months. The fine was further reduced as it is ultimately dependent on public funding to operate as a not-for-profit business. At an earlier hearing in August, Goldspring had said that, while all parties said the failings were very serious, he would need to balance the cost to the taxpayer with the need to deter others in the sector from committing similar offences in deciding the size of the fine. At that hearing, the court heard that a test had found that it was possible to download and execute malicious files on to Sellafield\u2019s IT networks via a phishing attack \u201cwithout raising any alarms\u201d, according to Nigel Lawrence KC, representing the ONR. An external IT company, Commissum, found that any \u201creasonably skilled hacker or malicious insider\u201d could access sensitive data and insert malware that could then be used to steal information at Sellafield. Euan Hutton, chief executive of Sellafield, has apologised for the failing and said he \u201cgenuinely\u201d believes that \u201cthe issues which led to this prosecution are in the past\u201d. Paul Fyfe, senior director of regulation at the ONR, said: \u201cWe welcome Sellafield Ltd\u2019s guilty pleas. \u201cIt has been accepted the company\u2019s ability to comply with certain obligations under the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 during a period of four years was poor. \u201cFailings were known about for a considerable length of time but despite our interventions and guidance, Sellafield failed to respond effectively, which left it vulnerable to security breaches and its systems being compromised.\u201d There have, however, been \u201cpositive improvements\u201d at Sellafield during the last year under new leadership, the ONR added. A Sellafield spokesperson said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield, as reflected in our guilty pleas. \u201cThe charges relate to historical offences and there is no suggestion that public safety was compromised. \u201cSellafield has not been subjected to a successful cyber-attack. \u201cWe\u2019ve already made significant improvements to our systems, network and structures to ensure we are better protected and more resilient. \u201cThe cyber threat is continually evolving, and we will continue to work with the regulator to ensure we meet the high standards rightly required of us.\u201d The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \u201cWe take the safety of our nationally significant infrastructure very seriously and I welcome the fact we have a robust regulator holding our nuclear industry to account. \u201cI have written to the chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority seeking assurance that cybersecurity failings at Sellafield are being addressed and cannot happen again.\u201d",

Penguin Random House, the UK\u2019s largest book publisher, released a report last year that found black and Asian authors, illustrators and contributors at the publisher were underrepresented by 1.4% and 0.8% respectively. Although there was a slight increase in the proportion of colleagues who identified as black, Asian and minority ethnic, the publisher was still behind the UK benchmark. Tickets for the festival have sold out but Brown said there were free workshops and activities available for people to participate in. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be something for everyone, and we\u2019ve curated that deliberately because we want everyone to feel that this festival is for them,\u201d she said. A Penguin spokesperson said the publisher was looking forward to attending the festival this weekend, which it has supported for several years, to provide information to budding writers at their \u201cGetting Published\u201d stall. \u201cPenguin Random House continues to invest in ongoing interventions and partnerships that support our long-term ambition to reflect the rich diversity of UK society \u2013 both in who we publish and who we employ,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cIn terms of our publishing and authors, our WriteNow programme has continued to find and nurture unpublished writers from communities under-represented on the nation\u2019s bookshelves. To date, 42.5% of writers who have taken part in the programme are writers of colour.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2024 to add a comment from Penguin Random House that was received after publication.",

      "body": "<p>Thousands gathered for New York City\u2019s annual <a href=\"https://www.climateweeknyc.org/\">Climate Week</a> last week to promote climate solutions, from the phaseout of fossil-fuel subsidies to nuclear energy to corporate-led schemes like carbon credits. Others touted a more offbeat potential salve to the crisis: psychedelics.</p> <p>Under the banner of Psychedelic Climate Week, a group of academics, marketers and advocates gathered for a film on pairing magic mushrooms with music, a discussion on <a href=\"https://cardea.net/furthur-fund/\">funding</a> ketamine-assisted therapy and a panel on \u201cBalancing Investing &amp; Impact with Climate &amp; Psychedelic Capital\u201d.</p> <p>Many attendees shared the belief that psychedelic experiences may spark \u201cconsciousness shifts\u201d, which can inspire climate-friendly behaviors, said Marissa Feinberg, the founder of Psychedelics for Climate Action, which convened the event series.</p> <p>The promotion of psychedelics was one of several features of Climate Week that diverged from the usual lineup of platitude-heavy panel talks. Other events included a <a href=\"https://swissnex.org/boston/event/climate-ring-glam-slam-with-susanne-bartsch-choke-hole/\">series</a> of climate-themed discussions and a performance by a \u201cdrag wrestling collective\u201d in a pop-up boxing ring, as well as <a href=\"https://www.viewcy.com/e/naturetemple\">events</a> filled with dancing, meditation and imbibing cacao.</p> <p>Such themes of wellness and personal improvement come amid growing public anxiety about the climate crisis, to the extent that many younger people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/09/more-people-not-having-children-due-to-climate-breakdown-fears-finds-research\">do not see themselves having children</a>, and frustration over the faltering progress to move away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>There is a sense of anger among many people that \u201cfossil-fuel companies are using the power of their wallet and their political reach to intimidate anyone who wants to move forward\u201d, said Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who was previously the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about drugs, but many people in the climate and biodiversity community are certainly beyond despondent,\u201d said Figueres. \u201cWhen you feel angry and despondent, there\u2019s a lot of energy there and you have to take that and turn it into agency for good.\u201d</p> <p>There is surging interest in the potential for hallucinogens \u2013 including psychedelics like LSD, empathogens like MDMA, and dissociatives like ketamine \u2013 to serve as healing aids for depression, addiction and other mental health problems.</p> <p>Psychedelic drug use, under the right circumstances, can \u201crelieve your personal stress\u201d and promote \u201cmindfulness\u201d, said Feinberg in an interview from a midtown Manhattan coffee shop. Someone who is tense and seeking convenience might buy a plastic water bottle, but those who take psychedelics \u2013 and internalize the feeling of connectedness they inspire \u2013 may behave with more intention, she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou take that moment of peace and calm, and you plan your day, and you bring that water bottle with you, and you have that more intentional start to your day,\u201d she said. Gesturing toward her own cup of water, she said: \u201cI opted for the paper cup.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not only consumers who can benefit from psychedelic experiences, said Feinberg. They may also help C-suite executives \u201cthink outside the box\u201d when it comes to social issues and climate, she said. Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/25/injured-amazon-warehouse-workers-gofundme\">anti-worker</a> policies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/22/amazon-workers-climate-crisis-board-jeff-bezos\">sky-high carbon emissions</a> may be related to Jeff Bezos\u2019s feelings of unworthiness, Feinberg suggested.</p> <p>If Bezos experienced \u201chealing\u201d, he might shift from solely focusing on amassing wealth to incorporating compassion and sustainability, she argued. The same may be true of some politicians, she said, adding that one <a href=\"https://beondibogaine.com/blog/free-treatment-for-politicians/\">sponsor of Psychedelic Climate Week</a> offered free treatments of ibogaine \u2013 a psychedelic and dissociative drug \u2013 to politicians out of a Canc\u00fan clinic.</p> <p>Another one of Feinberg\u2019s collaborators, the University of Maryland business school professor Bennet Zelner, is researching psychedelic experiences for organizational leaders, examining whether they spur more compassionate decision-making.</p> <p>\u201cHis work is very compelling to our group,\u201d said Feinberg, who is also the founder of a communications firm and does public relations for Nushama, a Manhattan clinic offering ketamine treatment for mental health.</p> <p>Some research does <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00221678221111024\">suggest</a> psychedelic experiences are <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20503245221129803\">associated</a> with \u201cpro-environmental\u201d behavior or feeling \u201cnature-connectedness\u201d. But the evidence is limited, subjective and full of potentially confounding factors, said Nicolas Langlitz, a historian of science at the New School who studies psychedelics. A 2017 <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28631526/\">study</a> found those who reported hallucinogen use were also more likely to report that they recycled and saved water, but its participants, who were recruited from Amazon\u2019s crowdsourcing platform, were younger, more educated and more experienced with psychedelics than the average US citizen.</p> <p>\u201cGenerally, the milieu around psychedelics \u2013 and especially the parts of that milieu that these studies tap into \u2013 just tends to be a lot more liberal, a lot more environmentally conscious,\u201d said Langlitz.</p> <p>Though <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20503245241235100\">research</a> shows those who have partaken in Indigenous-led ayahuasca ceremonies in the Amazon rainforest feel more \u201cnature-relatedness\u201d, it does not interrogate the willingness of foreigners to take carbon-intensive flights to the rainforest from far-flung western countries.</p> <p>Such studies also generally focus on individual changes in feelings and behavior amid a longstanding <a href=\"https://time.com/5669071/lifestyle-changes-climate-change/\">heated debate</a> about whether such shifts translate into carbon reductions, and whether they should command environmentalists\u2019 attention.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m generally skeptical about any individualized solution,\u201d said Langlitz. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, it\u2019s policy decisions that make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>Feinberg, for her part, said individual and system-wide solutions were both needed. \u201cSystems are created \u2026 for individuals to participate in,\u201d she said, adding that systems and individuals \u201cinform each other\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe all have power. We all influence each other. Someone can only make a product that someone\u2019s going to buy, and I\u2019m only going to buy something that\u2019s on the shelf,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it all plays hand in hand.\u201d</p> <p>Other studies indicate a correlation between using the substances and <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00881/full\">pro-social</a> behavior or <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28443703/\">anti-authoritarian sentiment</a>. Yet counter-examples <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.733185/full\">abound</a>, said Langlitz. Neo-Nazi figures have said psychedelics have <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/andrew-thomasberg-court-arrest-drugs-white-supremacist-neo-nazi-lsd-ak47-a9114461.html\">inspired them</a>. Albert Hofmann, who invented LSD in 1938, was close friends with Ernst J\u00fcnger, who railed against democracy, and Armin Mohler, the far-right political philosopher, Langlitz said.</p> <p>\u201cJ\u00fcnger and Hofmann tripped together,\u201d said Langlitz. \u201cThere are pockets of psychedelic countercultures that are rightwing and authoritarian.\u201d</p> <p>Psychedelics have also gained prominence among business leaders. Elon Musk, SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO, has reportedly used ketamine both <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/tech/elon-musk-ketamine-use-don-lemon-interview/index.html\">therapeutically</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/06/27/elon-musk-touts-ketamine-for-depression-following-report-on-his-use-of-drug/\">recreationally</a> and has still been widely criticized for <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/former-employees-sue-elon-musks-spacex-alleged-illegal/14940762/#:~:text=The%20lawsuit%2C%20brought%20by%20eight,sexual%20banter%2C%20and%20offering%20the\">mistreating workers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/tesla-sued-by-california-counties-over-hazardous-waste-2024-01-31/\">mishandling hazardous products</a>. (Feinberg declined to comment on Musk specifically, but said that \u201cpsychedelic healing does not happen overnight and it\u2019s not at all a silver bullet\u201d, and that \u201cpsychedelics do not work for everyone in a positive way\u201d.) </p> <p>In the absence of robust climate policy, however, interest in inward-focused climate action is likely to abound.

      "bodyText": "Thousands gathered for New York City\u2019s annual Climate Week last week to promote climate solutions, from the phaseout of fossil-fuel subsidies to nuclear energy to corporate-led schemes like carbon credits. Others touted a more offbeat potential salve to the crisis: psychedelics. Under the banner of Psychedelic Climate Week, a group of academics, marketers and advocates gathered for a film on pairing magic mushrooms with music, a discussion on funding ketamine-assisted therapy and a panel on \u201cBalancing Investing &amp; Impact with Climate &amp; Psychedelic Capital\u201d. Many attendees shared the belief that psychedelic experiences may spark \u201cconsciousness shifts\u201d, which can inspire climate-friendly behaviors, said Marissa Feinberg, the founder of Psychedelics for Climate Action, which convened the event series. The promotion of psychedelics was one of several features of Climate Week that diverged from the usual lineup of platitude-heavy panel talks. Other events included a series of climate-themed discussions and a performance by a \u201cdrag wrestling collective\u201d in a pop-up boxing ring, as well as events filled with dancing, meditation and imbibing cacao. Such themes of wellness and personal improvement come amid growing public anxiety about the climate crisis, to the extent that many younger people do not see themselves having children, and frustration over the faltering progress to move away from fossil fuels. There is a sense of anger among many people that \u201cfossil-fuel companies are using the power of their wallet and their political reach to intimidate anyone who wants to move forward\u201d, said Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who was previously the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change. \u201cI don\u2019t know about drugs, but many people in the climate and biodiversity community are certainly beyond despondent,\u201d said Figueres. \u201cWhen you feel angry and despondent, there\u2019s a lot of energy there and you have to take that and turn it into agency for good.\u201d There is surging interest in the potential for hallucinogens \u2013 including psychedelics like LSD, empathogens like MDMA, and dissociatives like ketamine \u2013 to serve as healing aids for depression, addiction and other mental health problems. Psychedelic drug use, under the right circumstances, can \u201crelieve your personal stress\u201d and promote \u201cmindfulness\u201d, said Feinberg in an interview from a midtown Manhattan coffee shop. Someone who is tense and seeking convenience might buy a plastic water bottle, but those who take psychedelics \u2013 and internalize the feeling of connectedness they inspire \u2013 may behave with more intention, she said. \u201cYou take that moment of peace and calm, and you plan your day, and you bring that water bottle with you, and you have that more intentional start to your day,\u201d she said. Gesturing toward her own cup of water, she said: \u201cI opted for the paper cup.\u201d It\u2019s not only consumers who can benefit from psychedelic experiences, said Feinberg. They may also help C-suite executives \u201cthink outside the box\u201d when it comes to social issues and climate, she said. Amazon\u2019s anti-worker policies and sky-high carbon emissions may be related to Jeff Bezos\u2019s feelings of unworthiness, Feinberg suggested. If Bezos experienced \u201chealing\u201d, he might shift from solely focusing on amassing wealth to incorporating compassion and sustainability, she argued. The same may be true of some politicians, she said, adding that one sponsor of Psychedelic Climate Week offered free treatments of ibogaine \u2013 a psychedelic and dissociative drug \u2013 to politicians out of a Canc\u00fan clinic. Another one of Feinberg\u2019s collaborators, the University of Maryland business school professor Bennet Zelner, is researching psychedelic experiences for organizational leaders, examining whether they spur more compassionate decision-making. \u201cHis work is very compelling to our group,\u201d said Feinberg, who is also the founder of a communications firm and does public relations for Nushama, a Manhattan clinic offering ketamine treatment for mental health. Some research does suggest psychedelic experiences are associated with \u201cpro-environmental\u201d behavior or feeling \u201cnature-connectedness\u201d. But the evidence is limited, subjective and full of potentially confounding factors, said Nicolas Langlitz, a historian of science at the New School who studies psychedelics. A 2017 study found those who reported hallucinogen use were also more likely to report that they recycled and saved water, but its participants, who were recruited from Amazon\u2019s crowdsourcing platform, were younger, more educated and more experienced with psychedelics than the average US citizen. \u201cGenerally, the milieu around psychedelics \u2013 and especially the parts of that milieu that these studies tap into \u2013 just tends to be a lot more liberal, a lot more environmentally conscious,\u201d said Langlitz. Though research shows those who have partaken in Indigenous-led ayahuasca ceremonies in the Amazon rainforest feel more \u201cnature-relatedness\u201d, it does not interrogate the willingness of foreigners to take carbon-intensive flights to the rainforest from far-flung western countries. Such studies also generally focus on individual changes in feelings and behavior amid a longstanding heated debate about whether such shifts translate into carbon reductions, and whether they should command environmentalists\u2019 attention. \u201cI\u2019m generally skeptical about any individualized solution,\u201d said Langlitz. \u201cI think, at the end of the day, it\u2019s policy decisions that make a difference.\u201d Feinberg, for her part, said individual and system-wide solutions were both needed. \u201cSystems are created \u2026 for individuals to participate in,\u201d she said, adding that systems and individuals \u201cinform each other\u201d. \u201cWe all have power. We all influence each other. Someone can only make a product that someone\u2019s going to buy, and I\u2019m only going to buy something that\u2019s on the shelf,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it all plays hand in hand.\u201d Other studies indicate a correlation between using the substances and pro-social behavior or anti-authoritarian sentiment. Yet counter-examples abound, said Langlitz. Neo-Nazi figures have said psychedelics have inspired them. Albert Hofmann, who invented LSD in 1938, was close friends with Ernst J\u00fcnger, who railed against democracy, and Armin Mohler, the far-right political philosopher, Langlitz said. \u201cJ\u00fcnger and Hofmann tripped together,\u201d said Langlitz. \u201cThere are pockets of psychedelic countercultures that are rightwing and authoritarian.\u201d Psychedelics have also gained prominence among business leaders. Elon Musk, SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO, has reportedly used ketamine both therapeutically and recreationally and has still been widely criticized for mistreating workers and mishandling hazardous products. (Feinberg declined to comment on Musk specifically, but said that \u201cpsychedelic healing does not happen overnight and it\u2019s not at all a silver bullet\u201d, and that \u201cpsychedelics do not work for everyone in a positive way\u201d.) In the absence of robust climate policy, however, interest in inward-focused climate action is likely to abound. Figueres said she had started to lead spiritual retreats in locations around the world to help people \u201cturn inside and understand what is going on and how they can compost those feelings and emotions in order to strengthen their agency\u201d. \u201cThis is an issue very close to my heart,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Pennsylvania has come into laser focus in the 2024 election as the must-win state of the presidential election. But further down the ballot is another race in the battleground state \u2013 one that could decide whether Democrats are able to hold on to a one-seat majority in the Senate.</p> <p>With the party bracing to lose a seat in West Virginia and incumbent Jon Tester\u2019s prospects looking grim in Montana, a lot of attention and money is flowing into the Senate race between Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Casey, who is seeking a fourth term in the Senate, hopes to turn one of Democrats\u2019 largest vulnerabilities \u2013 the cost of living \u2013 into a campaign asset. He has focused much of his messaging on rising prices, a primary concern for voters, and the so-called \u201cgreedflation\u201d of large corporations. He accuses those companies of gouging consumers during the high inflationary period of Joe Biden\u2019s early presidency and warns that McCormick will not take action to hold them accountable.</p> <p>But McCormick holds Democrats like Casey and Kamala Harris responsible for those same high prices because of their \u201cwasteful government spending\u201d, and he is betting that voters will, too.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans alike appear keenly aware of the importance of the contest, as outside spending groups have dropped tens of millions of dollars into Pennsylvania and prominent members of both parties have traveled to the state for campaign events. Appearing at a recent event alongside Casey in the Philadelphia suburb of Ambler, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts reminded supporters of the high stakes of the race.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what control of the Senate is all about right now,\u201d Warren told supporters. \u201cIf [Republicans] win on November 5, they are going to help the rich get richer and let everyone else eat dirt \u2026 We are all, as Democrats, in this fight because we will not let them take back the Senate.\u201d</p> <h2>A tipping-point race and state</h2> <p>Senate Democrats\u2019 difficult calculus this year has only underscored the significance of Casey\u2019s re-election bid, as his loss could fortify a new Republican majority in the Senate. Republicans appear comfortable with their nominee in McCormick, a former hedge-fund CEO and senior government official who narrowly missed out on a Senate nomination in 2022.</p> <p>That year, the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz won the Republican primary by 0.1 points after securing the endorsement of Donald Trump, who repeatedly attacked McCormick on the campaign trail. This time Trump has thrown his support behind McCormick, and the two appear to have made amends, appearing together at events across Pennsylvania. But McCormick has continued to distance himself from some of Trump\u2019s most controversial stances, like denying the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I had said before was that President Biden was our president. He had won the election. I don\u2019t believe the election was stolen,\u201d McCormick recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/08/politics/pennsylvania-senate-race-bob-casey/index.html\">told CNN</a>. \u201cSo President Trump and I don\u2019t agree on everything, but we agree on a lot of things.\u201d</p> <p>As of now, Trump\u2019s pitch seems to be resonating more with Pennsylvania voters compared with McCormick\u2019s. According to <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/pennsylvania/harris-trump-pennsylvania/\">an average</a> <a href=\"https://elections2024.thehill.com/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-senate-mccormick-casey/\">of Pennsylvania polls</a> from the Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris leads Trump by just 0.9 points in the state while Casey has an advantage of 4.0 points over McCormick, as of Tuesday.</p> <p>The neck-and-neck race between Harris and Trump for Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral votes could determine the winner of the presidential race, a fact that both nominees seem all too aware of. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in Pennsylvania by just a point.</p> <p>\u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/23/trump-rally-pennsylvania-election\">said</a> at a rally in the state last week. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple.\u201d</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian why he appears to be in a slightly stronger polling position in Pennsylvania compared with Harris, Casey sidestepped.</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing I want to try to do is be a pundit on the polls,\u201d Casey said in Ambler. \u201cHere\u2019s, I think, the reality. I think both races are going to be very close, but I think the people of our state know it\u2019s a very, very clear choice. It\u2019s never been clearer.\u201d</p> <h2>Greedflation versus Bobflation</h2> <p>At his event with Warren in Ambler, a town about 30 miles from Philadelphia, Casey focused his attention on the rising prices that have plagued families in Pennsylvania and across the country. Addressing hundreds of supporters in a college campus auditorium , Casey blamed large corporations for the high inflation seen since 2020.</p> <p>Accusing those corporations of taking advantage of customers, Casey called for investigations of companies and a federal bill targeting price-gouging before turning his attention to McCormick.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I brought this issue up, he criticized me for bringing it up,\u201d Casey said. \u201cHe wants to excuse price-gouging. I want to hold these companies accountable and make sure that we have a fighting chance against these corporations.\u201d</p> <p>Casey painted a very deliberate picture of why US prices had increased by roughly 20% since 2019, a statistic that McCormick frequently cites in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3rFtlF0b_g\">attack ads</a>. The senator referenced <a href=\"https://www.casey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/greedflation1.pdf\">a report</a> compiled by his office showing that corporate profits went up 75% in a two-year period when inflation went up by 14%.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the biggest conglomerates in the world that are jacking up prices with impunity, and we\u2019re not going to take it any more,\u201d Casey told supporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight back and hold them accountable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreedflation\u201d has become one of Casey\u2019s most repeated talking points, surfacing in the senator\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7owbZQs-J1g\">campaign ads</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/bob-casey-dnc-speech-greedflation\">his speech</a> at the Democratic national convention in August, and the message has shown some signs of success. <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/bob-casey-dave-mccormick-senate-race-poll-20240919.html\">A poll</a> conducted by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the New York Times, and Siena College showed Casey leading McCormick by 6 points when Pennsylvania voters were asked who they trusted to handle the economy, even as Trump led Harris by 4 points on the same issue.</p> <p>Lori Morrissey, a 64-year-old voter from Harleysville who attended Casey\u2019s event with Warren, said she has even started posting to social media about the issue.</p> <p>\u201cI see the profits of a lot of these corporations, especially consumer products, and it\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t seem to be ticking down. I actually think people need to start protesting outside of these chain supermarkets and letting them know.\u201d</p> <p>Beth Staab, a Democrat who serves on the Montgomery county board of supervisors and attended Casey\u2019s event, hopes that the senator\u2019s messaging is sinking in even as many voters remain frustrated with price increases.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to break through, because there\u2019s so many people that think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just inflation, inflation,\u2019 and it\u2019s not,\u201d Staab said. </p> <p>As Casey and Warren rallied supporters, McCormick was on the other side of the state, meeting with workers affected by the planned closure of a glass factory in Charleroi. The closure of the factory, located about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh, is expected to cost Charleroi more than 300 jobs.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the challenges we\u2019re having right here in Charleroi and right here across our commonwealth are due to poor leadership,\u201d McCormick <a href=\"https://penncapital-star.com/economy/charleroi-workers-rally-to-try-to-save-glass-manufacturing-plant/\">told</a> the workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had too much onerous regulation, and Bob Casey\u2019s not done anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>McCormick has come up with his own term to explain rising prices: \u201cBobflation.\u201d A pro-McCormick <a href=\"https://www.bobflation.com/\">website</a>, Bobflation.com, features a \u201cCasey cost calculator\u201d that allows visitors to \u201csee how much more your Pennsylvania favorites will cost you this year\u201d compared with 2019. McCormick\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3rFtlF0b_g\">campaign ads</a> accuse Harris and Casey of having \u201crecklessly spent trillions\u201d while downplaying concerns about inflation.</p> <p>\u201cCasey is a weak rubber stamp who voted for trillions of wasteful government spending, which sent the cost of living skyrocketing,\u201d said Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick.</p> <p>Inflation has subsided in the US, as the consumer price index <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/11/august-inflation\">rose</a> at an annual rate of 2.5% in September. That reading, which marked the lowest annual CPI level since February 2021, paved the way for the Federal Reserve to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/18/inflation-fed-rate-cut\">cut interest rates</a> for the first time in four years.</p> <p>Despite that progress, the cost of living remains top of mind for voters. According to a <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_pa_092524/\">survey</a> conducted by Monmouth University last month, 62% of Pennsylvania voters name inflation as one of their top two priorities this year, making it the most common response.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19, the pandemic \u2013 all of that is still with us, the impact of it,\u201d said Roxanne Anderson, a 55-year-old voter from Norristown who attended Casey\u2019s event. \u201cSo we still need that support.\u201d</p> <p>Anderson said she did not trust Republicans to lead on the economy, as she considered them \u201cout of touch\u201d. But unfortunately for Casey, McCormick has hefty financial backing to spread his economic message to Pennsylvania voters in the last month before election day.</p> <h2>An expensive sprint to the finish</h2> <p>Even as Democratic congressional candidates across the country have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/03/republican-campaign-money-problems-congress-00176947\">benefited</a> from an infusion of cash since Harris launched her presidential campaign in July, Casey finds himself at a notable financial disadvantage heading into the home stretch of his race against McCormick.</p> <p>Casey had raised almost twice as much as his opponent by the end of June, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2024&amp;id=PAS2\">according to OpenSecrets</a>, but McCormick has benefited from significant outside spending. AdImpact <a href=\"https://x.com/AdImpact_Pol/status/1839760924690776315\">reported</a> last week that McCormick\u2019s allies have reserved $22.7m more in future ad spends compared to Casey\u2019s team. That gap puts Casey at the largest spending disadvantage of any Democrat running in one of the seven <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\">most closely watched</a> Senate races.</p> <p>One Super Pac in particular, the Keystone Renewal Pac, has provided a substantial boon for McCormick. The group, which has <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/keystone-renewal-pac/C00849489/donors/2024\">received</a> contributions from Republican mega-donors such as Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, has already <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs//C00849489/independent-expenditures/2024\">spent</a> $37.3m to promote McCormick\u2019s campaign. The investment makes Keystone Renewal Pac the highest-spending single-candidate Pac involved in a Senate race of this election cycle so far, according to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/single_candidate_super_pacs/2024?chrt=2022&amp;disp=O&amp;type=C\">OpenSecrets\u2019 data</a>.</p> <p>Casey has tried to turn McCormick\u2019s financial backers into a campaign issue, attacking the former hedge fund CEO as a \u201cbag man for billionaires\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe made a lot of money with his Wall Street friends,\u201d Casey told reporters in Ambler. \u201cNow he wants to go to Washington and support those billionaire tax cuts and corporate tax cuts that wrecked our economy and jacked up the debt. We shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>In part because of the deluge of pro-McCormick money flowing into Pennsylvania in the final weeks before election day, Casey is clearly not getting too comfortable in the race. But when the last ballot is counted, Casey still expects Pennsylvania to send him back to Washington for another term.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very clear choice, just on rights and on these basic debates we\u2019ve had for years \u2013 on tax policy, on healthcare and so much else,\u201d Casey said in Ambler. \u201cAnd I think people know they have a stake in this election. I think it\u2019ll be close \u2013 but I think we\u2019re going to win.\u201d</p>",

I don\u2019t believe the election was stolen,\u201d McCormick recently told CNN. \u201cSo President Trump and I don\u2019t agree on everything, but we agree on a lot of things.\u201d As of now, Trump\u2019s pitch seems to be resonating more with Pennsylvania voters compared with McCormick\u2019s. According to an average of Pennsylvania polls from the Hill/Decision Desk HQ, Harris leads Trump by just 0.9 points in the state while Casey has an advantage of 4.0 points over McCormick, as of Tuesday. The neck-and-neck race between Harris and Trump for Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral votes could determine the winner of the presidential race, a fact that both nominees seem all too aware of. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in Pennsylvania by just a point. \u201cIf we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,\u201d Trump said at a rally in the state last week. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple.\u201d Asked by the Guardian why he appears to be in a slightly stronger polling position in Pennsylvania compared with Harris, Casey sidestepped. \u201cThe last thing I want to try to do is be a pundit on the polls,\u201d Casey said in Ambler. \u201cHere\u2019s, I think, the reality. I think both races are going to be very close, but I think the people of our state know it\u2019s a very, very clear choice. It\u2019s never been clearer.\u201d Greedflation versus Bobflation At his event with Warren in Ambler, a town about 30 miles from Philadelphia, Casey focused his attention on the rising prices that have plagued families in Pennsylvania and across the country. Addressing hundreds of supporters in a college campus auditorium , Casey blamed large corporations for the high inflation seen since 2020. Accusing those corporations of taking advantage of customers, Casey called for investigations of companies and a federal bill targeting price-gouging before turning his attention to McCormick. \u201cWhen I brought this issue up, he criticized me for bringing it up,\u201d Casey said. \u201cHe wants to excuse price-gouging. I want to hold these companies accountable and make sure that we have a fighting chance against these corporations.\u201d Casey painted a very deliberate picture of why US prices had increased by roughly 20% since 2019, a statistic that McCormick frequently cites in attack ads. The senator referenced a report compiled by his office showing that corporate profits went up 75% in a two-year period when inflation went up by 14%. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the biggest conglomerates in the world that are jacking up prices with impunity, and we\u2019re not going to take it any more,\u201d Casey told supporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight back and hold them accountable.\u201d \u201cGreedflation\u201d has become one of Casey\u2019s most repeated talking points, surfacing in the senator\u2019s campaign ads as well as his speech at the Democratic national convention in August, and the message has shown some signs of success. A poll conducted by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the New York Times, and Siena College showed Casey leading McCormick by 6 points when Pennsylvania voters were asked who they trusted to handle the economy, even as Trump led Harris by 4 points on the same issue. Lori Morrissey, a 64-year-old voter from Harleysville who attended Casey\u2019s event with Warren, said she has even started posting to social media about the issue. \u201cI see the profits of a lot of these corporations, especially consumer products, and it\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t seem to be ticking down. I actually think people need to start protesting outside of these chain supermarkets and letting them know.\u201d Beth Staab, a Democrat who serves on the Montgomery county board of supervisors and attended Casey\u2019s event, hopes that the senator\u2019s messaging is sinking in even as many voters remain frustrated with price increases. \u201cWe need to break through, because there\u2019s so many people that think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just inflation, inflation,\u2019 and it\u2019s not,\u201d Staab said. As Casey and Warren rallied supporters, McCormick was on the other side of the state, meeting with workers affected by the planned closure of a glass factory in Charleroi. The closure of the factory, located about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh, is expected to cost Charleroi more than 300 jobs. \u201cA lot of the challenges we\u2019re having right here in Charleroi and right here across our commonwealth are due to poor leadership,\u201d McCormick told the workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had too much onerous regulation, and Bob Casey\u2019s not done anything about it.\u201d McCormick has come up with his own term to explain rising prices: \u201cBobflation.\u201d A pro-McCormick website, Bobflation.com, features a \u201cCasey cost calculator\u201d that allows visitors to \u201csee how much more your Pennsylvania favorites will cost you this year\u201d compared with 2019. McCormick\u2019s campaign ads accuse Harris and Casey of having \u201crecklessly spent trillions\u201d while downplaying concerns about inflation. \u201cCasey is a weak rubber stamp who voted for trillions of wasteful government spending, which sent the cost of living skyrocketing,\u201d said Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick. Inflation has subsided in the US, as the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in September. That reading, which marked the lowest annual CPI level since February 2021, paved the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time in four years. Despite that progress, the cost of living remains top of mind for voters. According to a survey conducted by Monmouth University last month, 62% of Pennsylvania voters name inflation as one of their top two priorities this year, making it the most common response. \u201cCovid-19, the pandemic \u2013 all of that is still with us, the impact of it,\u201d said Roxanne Anderson, a 55-year-old voter from Norristown who attended Casey\u2019s event. \u201cSo we still need that support.\u201d Anderson said she did not trust Republicans to lead on the economy, as she considered them \u201cout of touch\u201d. But unfortunately for Casey, McCormick has hefty financial backing to spread his economic message to Pennsylvania voters in the last month before election day. An expensive sprint to the finish Even as Democratic congressional candidates across the country have benefited from an infusion of cash since Harris launched her presidential campaign in July, Casey finds himself at a notable financial disadvantage heading into the home stretch of his race against McCormick. Casey had raised almost twice as much as his opponent by the end of June, according to OpenSecrets, but McCormick has benefited from significant outside spending. AdImpact reported last week that McCormick\u2019s allies have reserved $22.7m more in future ad spends compared to Casey\u2019s team. That gap puts Casey at the largest spending disadvantage of any Democrat running in one of the seven most closely watched Senate races. One Super Pac in particular, the Keystone Renewal Pac, has provided a substantial boon for McCormick. The group, which has received contributions from Republican mega-donors such as Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, has already spent $37.3m to promote McCormick\u2019s campaign. The investment makes Keystone Renewal Pac the highest-spending single-candidate Pac involved in a Senate race of this election cycle so far, according to OpenSecrets\u2019 data. Casey has tried to turn McCormick\u2019s financial backers into a campaign issue, attacking the former hedge fund CEO as a \u201cbag man for billionaires\u201d. \u201cHe made a lot of money with his Wall Street friends,\u201d Casey told reporters in Ambler. \u201cNow he wants to go to Washington and support those billionaire tax cuts and corporate tax cuts that wrecked our economy and jacked up the debt. We shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d In part because of the deluge of pro-McCormick money flowing into Pennsylvania in the final weeks before election day, Casey is clearly not getting too comfortable in the race. But when the last ballot is counted, Casey still expects Pennsylvania to send him back to Washington for another term. \u201cIt\u2019s a very clear choice, just on rights and on these basic debates we\u2019ve had for years \u2013 on tax policy, on healthcare and so much else,\u201d Casey said in Ambler. \u201cAnd I think people know they have a stake in this election. I think it\u2019ll be close \u2013 but I think we\u2019re going to win.\u201d",

Mickey Down, the show\u2019s co-creator and co-writer, says this wasn\u2019t always intentional. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are necessarily unsexy, but they are sometimes quite clinical,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are scenes where it feels like someone\u2019s just left the camera there and allowed two people to get off \u2026 There\u2019s lots of squelchy noises and the visual exchanging of fluids.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/01/industry-season-three-review-tv-wildest-drama-is-more-thrilling-than-ever-bbc\">Industry season three review \u2013 TV\u2019s wildest drama is more thrilling than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Down explains that most of the sex scenes are about \u201ctransfers of power\u201d \u2013 a phrase that gets right to the heart of what Industry is about. The show ostensibly revolves around money, but it\u2019s really about <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/industry-class-wars-status-uk-1235089897/\">class</a> and familial trauma. These themes are difficult to untangle, partly because power imbalances are so central to both, whether it\u2019s the inherited dominance of the ruling class over the \u201clittle people,\u201d or the power disparity between parent and child that never fully goes away, even after death.</p> <p>Money is our culture\u2019s most mainstream fetish, which is reflected in how most of Industry\u2019s characters behave: they consume and own each other, treating people and relationships like assets to be traded. It reminds me of a quote that\u2019s commonly attributed to Oscar Wilde: \u201cEverything in the world is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power.\u201d If money and sex are both means to achieving the ultimate goal \u2013 power \u2013 then Industry was destined to be one of the kinkiest shows on TV.</p> <p>\u2022 Season three of Industry is on BBC iPlayer now.</p>",

Money is the strongest incentive that society has ever created to make people do things,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a fraternity between the two, that\u2019s why they\u2019re so linked in people\u2019s heads.\u201d Some of Industry\u2019s sex scenes make for uncomfortable viewing. Mickey Down, the show\u2019s co-creator and co-writer, says this wasn\u2019t always intentional. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are necessarily unsexy, but they are sometimes quite clinical,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are scenes where it feels like someone\u2019s just left the camera there and allowed two people to get off \u2026 There\u2019s lots of squelchy noises and the visual exchanging of fluids.\u201d Down explains that most of the sex scenes are about \u201ctransfers of power\u201d \u2013 a phrase that gets right to the heart of what Industry is about. The show ostensibly revolves around money, but it\u2019s really about class and familial trauma. These themes are difficult to untangle, partly because power imbalances are so central to both, whether it\u2019s the inherited dominance of the ruling class over the \u201clittle people,\u201d or the power disparity between parent and child that never fully goes away, even after death. Money is our culture\u2019s most mainstream fetish, which is reflected in how most of Industry\u2019s characters behave: they consume and own each other, treating people and relationships like assets to be traded. It reminds me of a quote that\u2019s commonly attributed to Oscar Wilde: \u201cEverything in the world is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power.\u201d If money and sex are both means to achieving the ultimate goal \u2013 power \u2013 then Industry was destined to be one of the kinkiest shows on TV. \u2022 Season three of Industry is on BBC iPlayer now.",

We cannot comment further while this is ongoing.\u201d It is understood that the investigation relates to a clerical element of some of Alli\u2019s already declared interests, and not to donations. Alli, a media businessman and a major Labour party donor who is worth an estimated \u00a3200m, has been thrust into the spotlight over tens of thousands of pounds-worth of gifts he gave to Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner. He gave \u00a332,000-worth of clothes to Starmer while he was leader of the opposition, as well as \u00a32,400 for glasses and the temporary use of a \u00a318m penthouse during the election campaign.

Starmer has come under fire over the extent of donations that he and his frontbench accepted while in opposition. It also emerged that Alli was temporarily given a pass to Downing Street after Labour won the election. The row overshadowed Labour\u2019s party conference in Liverpool last month. Alli has been involved in Labour party circles for decades and Tony Blair made him a peer in 1998. The Guardian contacted Alli for comment. The Lords commissioners\u2019 office declined to comment further. Alli\u2019s business interests have been under scrutiny since Open Democracy reported last week that the peer added his directorship at Mac (BVI) Limited, a firm based in the British Virgin Islands, to his register of interests only after the news outlet contacted him last month to ask why it was missing. It found he had not declared that he had been a director of Mac (BVI) Limited since April 2023. When questioned about it, Alli told Open Democracy the omission was an \u201cunintentional error\u201d, adding: \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised until you asked that it wasn\u2019t listed on my register of interests.\u201d He then added the directorship to his register as a \u201cnon-financial interest\u201d. Financial accounts show Alli holds \u201cincentive shares\u201d in the firm, so if an acquisition is completed while he is a director, he will receive \u201ca one-off transaction fee of an amount equal to \u00a325,000 per calendar month elapsed between the date of his appointment and a platform acquisition being completed\u201d.",

But when Tim Collis wanted to move back to his native Derbyshire with his husband, Ryan Phelps, and bought the station house, the couple had no idea they were also buying a piece of Britpop lore \u2013 the building featured on the cover of Oasis\u2019s first UK No 1 hit. After seeing the station online, they both fell in love it with it. \u201cIt\u2019s a very architecturally beautiful house,\u201d Collis said. They bought their dream home, which is Grade II-listed, in 2007 for \u00a3390,000, and renovated the lineside station building that came with it, which at the time was derelict. While they had thought it was out of their budget, their property in Wood Green, north London, sold for more than they expected and they were able to make the purchase. They have named the lineside cottage the Waiting Room and now rent it out as a holiday let.

The policy had been in the pipeline for some time but was reportedly applied only after one spouse of the last remaining married couple among the bank\u2019s staff retired. The rule, which also bars staff from marrying someone employed by another Vatican institution, was made public only after disgruntled employees shared details with the Italian press. The Vatican bank has more than \u20ac5bn-worth of assets but employs only 100 people in one location. The newlyweds appealed last month to Pope Francis, who approved the rule, decrying the \u201cunjust\u201d situation in a long letter, according to Il Messaggero. The newspaper reported that the couple could take the case to the Vatican\u2019s court. ADLV, the association of Vatican lay workers, had intervened on the couple\u2019s behalf, arguing that \u201cthe birth of a new family should not be endangered by bureaucratic regulations\u201d. It is not the first workers\u2019 dispute to embroil the Holy See. In May, dozens of employees at Vatican Museums launched an unprecedented legal dispute over job conditions and workplace safety. They sent a petition to the Vatican\u2019s governorate alleging that the city state\u2019s labour rules \u201cundermine each worker\u2019s dignity and health\u201d, including overtime hours paid at lower rates and insufficient health and safety provisions.",

      "body": "<p>Ukraine has said that its forces have withdrawn from the eastern city of Vuhledar, a defensive bastion that had resisted repeated Russian attacks since Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion.</p> <p>The military command in Kyiv said its troops left late on Tuesday. They had retreated in order to preserve personnel and combat equipment, it said, adding that Russian combat units had attacked from three directions and were close to \u201cencircling\u201d the city.</p> <p>The fall of Vuhledar is a boost for the Kremlin and comes as Russian troops advance across the eastern Donetsk oblast. In February they captured the city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/ukrainian-defenders-of-avdiivka-hold-on-for-now\">Avdiivka</a>, outside the regional capital of Donetsk, occupied in 2014.</p> <p>Since then the Russian advance has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/28/russian-troops-seize-two-villages-near-avdiivka-ukraine\">swallowed up towns and villages</a> and come to within six miles of the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/russians-pokrovsk-ukrainian-city-families-agonise-residents-leave\"> city of Pokrovsk</a>, a logistics hub 80km (50 miles) north of Vuhledar. Defence experts think Ukraine may next have to retreat from other under-pressure urban settlements, including Toretsk and Selydove.</p>    <p>Russian Telegram channels published video of triumphant troops waving the Russian tricolour flag over shattered buildings in Vuhledar. In one clip, four soldiers stood inside a gutted highrise flat and placed a flag outside. \u201cEverything will be Russia. Victory will be ours,\u201d an officer declared.</p> <p>The communist hammer and sickle was also raised. Vuhledar was originally built around a mine in the mid-1960s when it was within the Soviet Union. Before the war it had a population of about 14,000. It is now a sprawling ruin, with apartment buildings smashed apart and scarred.</p> <p>Ukraine\u2019s 72nd mechanised brigade had defended Vuhledar for more than two years. On Tuesday it said the Russians had suffered \u201cnumerous losses as a result of prolonged fighting\u201d as it tried to storm the city, which sits on an elevated plain.</p> <p>\u201cIn an effort to take control of the city at any cost, the enemy managed to direct reserves to carry out flanking attacks, which exhausted the defence of our units,\u201d the brigade explained.</p> <p>Russia claimed it had wiped out large numbers of fleeing Ukrainian soldiers. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), however, said <a href=\"https://x.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1841289522614882614?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">the scale of casualties was unknown</a> and added that more would have been killed or captured if Russia had managed to encircle them.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1841289522614882614?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">According to the ISW</a>, the loss of Vuhledar will not fundamentally alter offensive operations because it is \u201cnot a particularly crucial logistics node\u201d. Russian forces already controlled surrounding access roads, the institute said.

      "bodyText": "Ukraine has said that its forces have withdrawn from the eastern city of Vuhledar, a defensive bastion that had resisted repeated Russian attacks since Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion. The military command in Kyiv said its troops left late on Tuesday. They had retreated in order to preserve personnel and combat equipment, it said, adding that Russian combat units had attacked from three directions and were close to \u201cencircling\u201d the city. The fall of Vuhledar is a boost for the Kremlin and comes as Russian troops advance across the eastern Donetsk oblast. In February they captured the city of Avdiivka, outside the regional capital of Donetsk, occupied in 2014. Since then the Russian advance has swallowed up towns and villages and come to within six miles of the city of Pokrovsk, a logistics hub 80km (50 miles) north of Vuhledar. Defence experts think Ukraine may next have to retreat from other under-pressure urban settlements, including Toretsk and Selydove. Russian Telegram channels published video of triumphant troops waving the Russian tricolour flag over shattered buildings in Vuhledar. In one clip, four soldiers stood inside a gutted highrise flat and placed a flag outside. \u201cEverything will be Russia. Victory will be ours,\u201d an officer declared. The communist hammer and sickle was also raised. Vuhledar was originally built around a mine in the mid-1960s when it was within the Soviet Union. Before the war it had a population of about 14,000. It is now a sprawling ruin, with apartment buildings smashed apart and scarred. Ukraine\u2019s 72nd mechanised brigade had defended Vuhledar for more than two years. On Tuesday it said the Russians had suffered \u201cnumerous losses as a result of prolonged fighting\u201d as it tried to storm the city, which sits on an elevated plain. \u201cIn an effort to take control of the city at any cost, the enemy managed to direct reserves to carry out flanking attacks, which exhausted the defence of our units,\u201d the brigade explained. Russia claimed it had wiped out large numbers of fleeing Ukrainian soldiers. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), however, said the scale of casualties was unknown and added that more would have been killed or captured if Russia had managed to encircle them. According to the ISW, the loss of Vuhledar will not fundamentally alter offensive operations because it is \u201cnot a particularly crucial logistics node\u201d. Russian forces already controlled surrounding access roads, the institute said. They would now have to \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d across open terrain in order to link up with units farther north. The overall picture for Kyiv is grim. Russian forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine at their quickest rate for two years. A Ukrainian incursion in August into Russia\u2019s Kursk region was launched to relieve pressure on its exhausted frontline troops. It prompted Moscow to divert some of its units \u2013 but these came from other parts of the battlefield, in the south and north-east. Putin has said Russia\u2019s chief political goal was to seize the whole of the Donbas region in south-eastern Ukraine. In September 2022, he claimed to have \u201cannexed\u201d four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk.

The war has largely been a story of grinding artillery and drone strikes along a heavily fortified front stretching for nearly 1,000km (620 miles) and involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

      "body": "<p>The first story expansion for Bethesda\u2019s big, bold, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/06/starfield-review-an-exquisite-electric-faintly-rickety-universe-of-possibilities\">rickety</a> space RPG arrives after a year\u2019s worth of incremental updates that have already ironed out the game\u2019s most egregious flaws. Those quest-breaking bugs have been squished, there are now vehicles to make planet-side travel less of a chore, city maps are at least partly useful these days, and there\u2019s now a 60fps mode for those playing on Xbox Series X. But Starfield\u2019s fundamental problems remain \u2013 turgid, rubbery NPCs; the baffling profusion of loading screens \u2013 but just as the Phantom Liberty expansion finessed Cyberpunk 2077 in its entirety, Shattered Space arrives poised to improve upon what came before.</p> <p>It appears that Bethesda has acknowledged that travelling across space by selecting planets from menus and watching a cutscene was a bit rubbish, because Shattered Space mostly takes place on a single map, much like Skyrim or Fallout. This new, self-contained narrative concerns House Va\u2019ruun, Starfield\u2019s slightly tiresome cult of space-serpent-worshipping zealots. The player is whooshed towards the secretive society\u2019s homeworld after it has suffered a cataclysm, heralded as the civilisation\u2019s potential saviour \u2013 which, naturally, means everyone has plenty of chores for you to do, busy as they are standing around staring at walls or genuflecting in courtyards.</p> <p>These tasks range from traversing the void between universes, to blasting homicidal electric-blue phantoms, to literally tidying up an old man\u2019s manky little flat. It\u2019s the usual initially overwhelming RPG to-do list, and it all, at least to begin with, feels very old-school Bethesda.</p> <p>The problem is, very little of what you\u2019re asked to do turns out to be any fun. Fetch-quests that offer next to no payoff are compounded by annoying travel: you have to make an unappealing choice between the vein-popping frustration of trying to drive across the craggy, impassable, boulder-strewn landscape, or giving up and shlepping there on foot. And this landscape isn\u2019t Skyrim, or The Capital Wasteland, with discoveries to be made around every corner. It\u2019s a Starfield planet map like any other, with only the odd cave or cookie-cutter facility to explore, and it rarely rewards inquisitiveness with anything other than wasted time and the urge to swear.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNM1HFzQC8c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iNM1HFzQC8c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Any previous suggestion that Starfield was leaning into cosmic horror in some new and interesting way also turns out to have been wide of the mark.

      "bodyText": "The first story expansion for Bethesda\u2019s big, bold, rickety space RPG arrives after a year\u2019s worth of incremental updates that have already ironed out the game\u2019s most egregious flaws. Those quest-breaking bugs have been squished, there are now vehicles to make planet-side travel less of a chore, city maps are at least partly useful these days, and there\u2019s now a 60fps mode for those playing on Xbox Series X. But Starfield\u2019s fundamental problems remain \u2013 turgid, rubbery NPCs; the baffling profusion of loading screens \u2013 but just as the Phantom Liberty expansion finessed Cyberpunk 2077 in its entirety, Shattered Space arrives poised to improve upon what came before. It appears that Bethesda has acknowledged that travelling across space by selecting planets from menus and watching a cutscene was a bit rubbish, because Shattered Space mostly takes place on a single map, much like Skyrim or Fallout. This new, self-contained narrative concerns House Va\u2019ruun, Starfield\u2019s slightly tiresome cult of space-serpent-worshipping zealots. The player is whooshed towards the secretive society\u2019s homeworld after it has suffered a cataclysm, heralded as the civilisation\u2019s potential saviour \u2013 which, naturally, means everyone has plenty of chores for you to do, busy as they are standing around staring at walls or genuflecting in courtyards. These tasks range from traversing the void between universes, to blasting homicidal electric-blue phantoms, to literally tidying up an old man\u2019s manky little flat. It\u2019s the usual initially overwhelming RPG to-do list, and it all, at least to begin with, feels very old-school Bethesda. The problem is, very little of what you\u2019re asked to do turns out to be any fun. Fetch-quests that offer next to no payoff are compounded by annoying travel: you have to make an unappealing choice between the vein-popping frustration of trying to drive across the craggy, impassable, boulder-strewn landscape, or giving up and shlepping there on foot. And this landscape isn\u2019t Skyrim, or The Capital Wasteland, with discoveries to be made around every corner. It\u2019s a Starfield planet map like any other, with only the odd cave or cookie-cutter facility to explore, and it rarely rewards inquisitiveness with anything other than wasted time and the urge to swear. Any previous suggestion that Starfield was leaning into cosmic horror in some new and interesting way also turns out to have been wide of the mark. Occasional, very brief sequences do threaten to conjure an atmosphere of foreboding, but this soon gives way to the same bullet-sponge gunfights through the same uninspired buildings in return for the same loot. The unreliable quest markers feel inexcusable, and Shattered Space becomes a slog long before the 12- to 15-hour campaign comes to an end. It isn\u2019t all bad. The main story is engaging enough, and throws a few interesting choices your way, as the three ruling houses of the planet of Va\u2019ruun\u2019kai vie for power. And when the frame rate is stable, Shattered Space is quite pretty, if overwhelmingly, monotonously purple.

They have spent two weeks at an acclimatising warmup camp in Abu Dhabi, a stroke of luck given that the camp was organised well before the tournament move. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hot, very humid, so it\u2019s been useful having those extra weeks to prepare from that perspective,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIn Sharjah, it\u2019s about watching those first couple of games [of the tournament], and trying to pick up anything we can, because it\u2019s very unknown.\u201d</p>    <p>England\u2019s first match is on Saturday against Bangladesh. In the meantime, the team\u2019s focus has been on geeing themselves up for what is expected to be a relatively low-key affair. Local enthusiasm for women\u2019s cricket is difficult to whip up at a few weeks\u2019 notice and games are likely to be played out in empty stadiums.</p> <p>\u201cThe crowd can really lift your energy, and make it a lot easier to put on a show,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about as a team \u2013 how can we bring the high-energy game that we want, regardless of what the atmosphere\u2019s like?

      "bodyText": "Ever had one of those nightmares where you study your socks off for an exam but when you show up to sit it, the paper in front of you isn\u2019t the one you revised for? If so, you\u2019ll have some sympathy with England\u2019s predicament before the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup which starts on Thursday: not in Bangladesh, as originally intended, but in the UAE. Twelve months ago, the England and Wales Cricket Board hired a head of cricket intelligence, Liam Sanders, and tasked him with helping to achieve something England have not managed since 2009: winning a Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. Sanders and his team gamed every possible scenario, including having the captain, Heather Knight, miss a match against New Zealand in July with just an hour\u2019s notice, mimicking what might happen if illness struck. But in August, with civil unrest in Bangladesh, the ICC announced the tournament was upping sticks. For Sanders and his team, 12 months of work went down the drain. It was back to the drawing board, with a mere six weeks to rejig the plan. England have put a brave face on the move \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think our plans change too much,\u201d Knight said this week \u2013 but it has wiped out any data advantage the ECB hoped to use. The paucity of information available on women\u2019s cricket in the UAE makes planning very difficult: none of the Big Three \u2013 England, Australia and India \u2013 have played an international there. The men contested the T20 World Cup there in 2021. But given the differences between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s games, there is debate as to whether any meaningful conclusions can be drawn from that. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of unknowns, especially in Sharjah,\u201d said the England wicketkeeper Amy Jones. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the wickets will be like there yet.\u201d England have one trump card. They have spent two weeks at an acclimatising warmup camp in Abu Dhabi, a stroke of luck given that the camp was organised well before the tournament move. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hot, very humid, so it\u2019s been useful having those extra weeks to prepare from that perspective,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIn Sharjah, it\u2019s about watching those first couple of games [of the tournament], and trying to pick up anything we can, because it\u2019s very unknown.\u201d England\u2019s first match is on Saturday against Bangladesh. In the meantime, the team\u2019s focus has been on geeing themselves up for what is expected to be a relatively low-key affair. Local enthusiasm for women\u2019s cricket is difficult to whip up at a few weeks\u2019 notice and games are likely to be played out in empty stadiums. \u201cThe crowd can really lift your energy, and make it a lot easier to put on a show,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about as a team \u2013 how can we bring the high-energy game that we want, regardless of what the atmosphere\u2019s like? It\u2019s been on our radar.\u201d England are fortunate to have been drawn in Group B, with Bangladesh, South Africa, West Indies and Scotland, who are making their maiden World Cup appearance after beating Ireland in the global qualifier in May. Group A looks a tougher bet, featuring India, New Zealand, Pakistan, the new Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka, as well as the title holders, Australia. England and Australia \u2013 who, if the rankings are to be believed, should meet in the final in Dubai on 20 October \u2013 have adopted opposing strategies. Australia will be unleashing their pace duo, Darcie Brown and Tayla Vlaeminck, who (should they remain injury-free) are a formidable new-ball pairing. By contrast, England have one frontline seamer, Lauren Bell, and are resting their hopes on a four-pronged spin attack that includes the left-armer Linsey Smith, playing in her first World Cup since 2018. Conditions could prove tricky for the quartet. Three of England\u2019s four group-stage matches are evening games, and descending dew will make gripping the ball difficult. England won the T20 leg of the multi-format Women\u2019s Ashes in 2023, but their warmup match against Australia last Sunday was a reminder that the aggressive approach favoured by the head coach, Jon Lewis, can also be a volatile one. England lost by 33 runs, thanks to an all-too-familiar middle-order collapse. Jones, though, said the mood in the camp was confident. \u201cThe last year has been brilliant \u2013 we\u2019ve played some really good cricket.\u201d There is a substantial pot of gold for the team who do triumph.

      "body": "<h2><strong>BIGGER THRASHINGS</strong></h2> <p>Travelling to Germany with his team having won nine games on the bounce in all competitions, Brendan Rodgers was understandably bullish ahead of Celtic\u2019s Bigger Cup match against Borussia Dortmund. His team had conceded only four goals all season while scoring 33, with just under half that tally coming in their past three outings, against St Johnstone, Falkirk and Slovan Bratislava. Having seen off such exalted opposition with a minimum of fuss, it was small wonder that Rodgers talked up the new \u201cmindset, belief and experience\u201d that he felt would help his side as Celtic attempted to secure their first competitive victory on German soil in 15 attempts.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have also added some players that give us something in key areas of the pitch that you need,\u201d beamed Brendan, whose subsequent approach to the Dortmund match might have sufficed for a home cup tie against Bonnyrigg Rose or East Fife, but could scarcely have proved more naive when taking on last season\u2019s Bigger Cup runners up at the Westfalenstadion. What exactly Brendan hoped his players might give in key areas of the pitch remains unclear, but it almost certainly wasn\u2019t repeated possession of the ball to their hosts. The upshot? Dortmund duly spanked seven goals past them on yet another chastening European night on the road for Celtic. While Big Paper\u2019s fitba correspondent described the match as being \u201cakin to a grand master playing an orangutan at chess\u201d, Football Daily would politely suggest such a comparison does a grave disservice to our famously intelligent hominid chums, one of whose number had an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokolsky_Opening\">opening gambit named after her</a> on the back of advice she somehow imparted to the Polish grand master Savielly Tartakower before a match he played in New York in 1924.</p> <p>Celtic had surfed into Dortmund on a wave of misplaced confidence they\u2019d taken from the beatdown to which they\u2019d subjected Slovan Bratislava in the previous round of fixtures. Unsurprisingly, the Slovak champions were the victims of another drubbing at the hands of Manchester City. Between qualifiers and group games, Bratislava have already played 10 matches in this season\u2019s Bigger Cup, with their opening win over North Macedonian champions, Struga, in July now a distant memory. Given Bigger Cup\u2019s new format and 36-team table, regular shellackings were always going to be on the cards, not least when you consider that Bratislava\u2019s tormentor-in-chief, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku, retails at more than twice the cost of the entire home squad.</p> <p>While Barcelona and Inter also piled the hurt on comparative minnows last night, arguably the most intriguing of the Bigger Cup thrashings was the one visited upon RB Salzburg by Brest. As hammerings go, this was easily the most fascinating game of an otherwise fairly unremarkable evening of action, in so far as the team that was battered for long periods somehow managed to score four goals against the run of play and without reply. The team with the lowest Uefa ranking in this season\u2019s Bigger Cup, Brest, currently sit joint-top of the 36-team group table like a diminutive Napoleonic colossus. Speaking of whom, we\u2019ve got a good story about the famous French emperor and his old barge, which currently resides in the Brest Naval Museum.

In History of Australia, a student workbook and teacher\u2019s manual published by Light Educational Ministries, Cain wrote that when the British arrived, \u201csome were afraid of the Aboriginals; some treated them badly\u201d. \u201cBut the governors tried to protect the Aborigines and encouraged Christians to tell them about the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Christians also tried to help the Aboriginals by caring for them and teaching them English so they could be part of the growing settlement,\u201d he wrote. One exercise talks about the \u201cunfortunate things that happened\u201d with colonisation then asks students to discuss how Aboriginal people have been \u201cblessed\u201d by the British coming. In another section Cain talks about the conversion of First Nations people. \u201cDarwinian evolution actually taught that some Aboriginal people on the Earth represented a lower stage of humanity in the evolutionary tree,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Origin of the Species [sic] influenced some during the nineteenth century to see Aboriginal peoples as inferior and not worth the full rights of other human beings. \u201cIn a Christian perspective all human beings are made in God\u2019s image and one of the responsibilities for the Christian Church is to make disciples of the nations \u2026 generally speaking, the settlement of Australia was accompanied by a desire to help Aboriginal peoples. \u201cThe gospel of Jesus Christ is no doubt greatly appreciated by the many Aboriginal Christians in this land today. Even those Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals who do not consider themselves Christian receive the benefits of a society that still operates in many spheres upon Christian presuppositions and order.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Cain also described God as the \u201ccreator of Australia\u201d and said he made plans for the various tribes and nations \u201cin the hope that they might find the truth about God\u201d. \u201cGod knew the Aboriginal peoples and made a plan for their salvation,\u201d he wrote. Asked about the books, Cain told Guardian Australia he had \u201csincere respect for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community\u201d. \u201cAnd I wholeheartedly apologise for any offence given,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own understanding of First Nations history and culture has developed considerably in the over two decades since the student workbook was authored and published.\u201d Prof Bronwyn Carlson, from Macquarie University\u2019s Critical Indigenous Studies department, said she was glad Cain had apologised and had learned more about Indigenous cultures. \u201cHard to imagine that such nonsense was written only two decades ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI am glad Mr Cain has apologised for such ridiculous statements \u2013 it is a demonstration of how power works that this nonsense was even in circulation. \u201cI am sure he is very embarrassed \u2013 I would be.\u201d The workbook and manual were published by Light Educational Ministries, which sells books for home schoolers and Christian schools. Its bookstore still sells a similar workbook and manual but does not appear to stock Cain\u2019s. Cain\u2019s personal website states he had a 20-year career as a high school mathematics teacher and worked as principal in the non-government school sector before his election to the ACT Legislative Assembly in October 2020. Cain is the Canberra Liberal\u2019s member for Ginninderra. Canberrans head to the polls for the ACT election on 19 October. Another Ginninderra Canberra Liberal Elizabeth Kikkert was dumped by the party two weeks ago and is now running for Family First. Darren Roberts will also run as a Liberal candidate for Ginninderra, despite a recent controversy over social media posts. Labor\u2019s Andrew Barr is the longest-serving chief minister of the ACT.",

Host Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) is desperate for better ratings, so he has no problem bringing on to his program a creepy girl named Lilly (Ingrid Torelli), who is apparently possessed by a demon. Why not get that demon to say hello, live on air?</p> <p>Employing the found footage style, the Cairnes brothers turn an initially campy mood into something that becomes increasingly unsettling, then intoxicatingly scary. Fun fact: on the Sunday during its opening weekend in the US, the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/25/horror-film-late-night-with-the-devil-takes-666666-on-sunday-in-the-us\">earned exactly $666,666</a>.</p> <h2>Territory</h2> <p><strong>TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 24 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVjNE5O89PE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jVjNE5O89PE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s Succession, but in the outback. Expect every critic who reviews this show to make that point. The central setting is the fictional Marianne Station, the world\u2019s largest cattle station, which is thrown into turmoil after the unexpected death of the man next in line to inherit it. Grumpy, Logan Roy-like patriarch Colin (Robert Taylor) isn\u2019t happy with any of the other options, which include his alcoholic son Graham (Michael Dorman), Graham\u2019s wife Emily (Anna Torv), and their two children Marshall (Sam Corlett) and Susie (Philippa Northeast).

In the first episode she finds a box that, legend has it, makes anybody who touches it wealthy, though locals say the box \u201cwill only bring death and destruction\u201d. The lesson we\u2019ve learned from a zillion other stories: listen to the locals! Indiana Jones-esque plotlines deploy lots of magical items and narrow escapes. It\u2019s a bit boilerplate, but not badly made; my teenage self probably would\u2019ve dug it.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Heartstopper season three (TV, 3 October), The Platform (film, 4 October), The Fabelmans (film, 5 October), The Menendez Brothers (film, 7 October), Lonely Planet (film, 11 October), Chucky season one (TV, 15 October), Time Cut (film, 30 October).</p> <h2><em><strong>Stan</strong></em></h2> <h2>Of an Age</h2> <p><strong>Film, Australia, 2022 \u2013 out 24 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c496BvQ0qBs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c496BvQ0qBs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Macedonian Australian film-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/20/australian-film-maker-goren-stolevski-on-his-unlikely-rise-it-felt-like-a-hallucinatory-moment\">Goran Stolevski</a> has delivered an awesome one-two directorial debut, following up his spellbinding horror movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/22/you-wont-be-alone-review-a-spellbinding-horror-movie-from-a-great-new-talent\">You Won\u2019t Be Alone</a> with this queer romance that\u2019s sweet in a tough-hearted way, embracing romantic <em>possibility</em><strong> </strong>rather than uniting two lovers forevermore. Adam (Thom Green) and Nikola (Elias Anton) meet and bond while racing across Melbourne to pick up Nikola\u2019s dance partner Ebony (Hattie Hook). The camerawork can be sharp and jittery but the film ultimately feels tender and gentle, the passage of time pushing the story into a melancholic \u201cwhat might have been\u201d space.</p> <h2>Carrie</h2> <p><strong>Film, US, 1976 \u2013 out 23 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Mg-GRS46Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j9Mg-GRS46Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Very few films about puberty and schoolyard bullying pack a punch like Brian De Palma\u2019s horrific assault on the senses \u2013 a horror classic intensely focused on the tormented psyche of its titular character (unforgettably played by Sissy Spacek) who develops supernatural powers. She\u2019s the victim of the cruelest treatment, mocked and belittled and terrorised by her peers, including and especially at her high school prom. This is the setting for a long, bloody, fire-filled stretch of carnage: once seen, never forgotten.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Joan (TV, 1 October), This is Going to Hurt (TV, 2 October), Lucky Country (film, 3 October), Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (film, 6 October), The Wedding Singer (film, 8 October), Seven (film, 10 October), Gayby Baby (film, 13 October), Thou Shalt Not Steal (TV, 17 October), Bad Boys 1-3 (film, 18 October), Child\u2019s Play (film, 25 October).</p> <h2><em><strong>SBS on Demand</strong></em></h2> <h2>So Long, Marianne</h2> <p><strong>TV, Canada/Norway, 2024 \u2013 out 19 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5DWuNY7dnE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k5DWuNY7dnE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>If, like me, you\u2019re a Leonard Cohen fan, you\u2019ll be intrigued by this eight-part series inspired by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/so-long-marianne-leonard-cohen-writes-to-muse-just-before-her-death\">song of the same name</a>. It follows a young Cohen (Alex Wolff) as he arrives on the Greek island of Hydra, hanging out with cash-strapped artists and beatniks and meeting Marianne Ihlen (Thea Sofie Loch N\u00e6ss), who\u2019s in a volcanic relationship with the novelist Axel Jensen (Jonas Strand Gravli). I\u2019ve only watched the first episode so far and I\u2019m in two minds about it: the show jumps around a lot and I\u2019m not entirely sold by Wolff\u2019s impersonation of the great poet. But it grew on me as the runtime progressed, and I\u2019m curious enough to keep watching.</p> <h2>Batman and Me</h2> <p><strong>Film, Australia, 2020 \u2013 out 3 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJI3uF4nInI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yJI3uF4nInI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Society is full of potential addictions.

I hate them today.\u201d The film is low-fi but endearingly made, expanding into an exploration of pop culture collectibles.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Beyond Utopia (film, 1 October), The Old Man (TV, 1 October), Four Years Later (TV, 2 October), The Gone (TV, 31 October).</p> <h2><em><strong>ABC iView</strong></em></h2> <h2>Plum</h2> <p><strong>TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 20 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6CX8o1tZFY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6CX8o1tZFY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Brendan Cowell\u2019s 2021 novel Plum provides a multidimensional, warts-and-all depiction of the retired rugby league footballer Peter Lum, who suffers from various health conditions \u2013 mostly related to concussions he experienced on the field. In terms of its form and structure, the book\u2019s most impressive element is its long and naturalistic conversations, good dialogue being very difficult to nail in any artistic medium. This bodes well for its TV adaptation, which is created, written and produced by Cowell, who also stars as Plum, alongside cast members including Asher Keddie (who was terrific in the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/04/fake-tv-show-review-paramount-cast-asher-keddie\">Fake</a>), Mar\u00eda Dupl\u00e1a and Jemaine Clement.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Nolly (TV, 18 October), Fisk season three (TV, 20 October), A Bite To Eat With Alice (TV, 28 October).</p> <h2><em><strong>Prime Video</strong></em></h2> <h2>The Office</h2> <p><strong>TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 18 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIEVoulYZM0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MIEVoulYZM0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I don\u2019t think anybody in the world is saying, \u201cNow\u2019s the right time for another remake of The Office.\u201d The makers of the new Australian version <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/01/the-office-australian-remake-amazon-prime-video-felicity-ward\">have their work cut out for them</a>, the original show\u2019s heavily templated mockumentary format having already spawned versions in more than a dozen countries. Felicity Ward leads the cast as Hannah Howard, the inevitably inept David Brent- or Michael Scott-esque manager of a Sydney-based packaging company.</p> <p>Ward will be the first woman to lead any version of The Office, adding a little novelty. Although you <em>could </em>argue the show has already been (unofficially) remade, with a broadly similar leading character played by a woman \u2013 that show being the very similarly toned Parks and Recreation, led by a very funny Amy Poehler.</p> <h2>Challengers</h2> <p><strong>Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 1 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VobTTbg-te0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VobTTbg-te0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The centrepiece scene in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s love triangle drama is a tennis match between two personal and professional adversaries \u2013 Art (Mike Faist) and Patrick (Josh O\u2019Connor) \u2013 which the director keeps cutting away from. Or perhaps you could say serving, smashing or volleying away from, given the film\u2019s bouncy editing that audaciously attempts to reflect the sport\u2019s rhythms.</p> <p>This scattered approach comes together with surprising fluidity, as we gradually learn more details about the characters\u2019 lives, Art and Patrick for instance previously being buddies who competed for the eye of another tennis player, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi, who ultimately married Art.

Ella Purnell\u2019s protagonist Rhiannon Lewis, who works as an editorial assistant for a small newspaper, opens the show with a monologue about \u201cpeople I\u2019d love to kill\u201d, kvetching about a range of people including manspreaders and \u201cDonna at the mini market\u201d. The first episode does a great job really putting her down, painting her as a person constantly ignored, even if it\u2019s a bit cheeky to cast the magnetic Purnell as a dorky wallflower.</p> <p>Created by Kirstie Swain and adapted from CJ Skuse\u2019s book of the same name, the show is a wild take on standing up for yourself, flipping into sensational luridness when Rhiannon brutally stabs a bully to death, horrifically breaking bad. The pace is absolutely cracking and the humour as black as it comes. It\u2019s very sharp and well made; I smashed through all six episodes in two evenings.</p> <h2>The Franchise</h2> <p><strong>TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 7 October</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Och6SQc6Nbs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Och6SQc6Nbs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I\u2019m a big fan of Armando Iannucci, one of the executive producers of this zippily enjoyable behind-the-scenes comedy about blockbuster moviemaking.

Dialogue flows thick and fast, with loads of bon mots and ripostes delivered in that wonderful dry British style.</p> <p>Himesh Patel\u2019s protagonist Daniel plays the first assistant director of a Marvel-like production, tasked with putting out countless spot fires and navigating all sorts of dramas and mishaps.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions</strong>: Salem\u2019s Lot (film, 3 October), Mountain (film, 3 October), Brazen Hussies (film, 3 October), Teacup (TV, 10 October), Caddo Lake (film, 10 October), Man on Wire (film, 18 October), Hysteria!

      "bodyText": "Netflix Late Night with the Devil Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 18 October This much-talked-about exorcism movie from Australian directors Colin and Cameron Cairnes is wickedly garish, with a great central location: the set of a late-night talkshow from the 1970s. Host Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) is desperate for better ratings, so he has no problem bringing on to his program a creepy girl named Lilly (Ingrid Torelli), who is apparently possessed by a demon. Why not get that demon to say hello, live on air? Employing the found footage style, the Cairnes brothers turn an initially campy mood into something that becomes increasingly unsettling, then intoxicatingly scary. Fun fact: on the Sunday during its opening weekend in the US, the film earned exactly $666,666. Territory TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 24 October It\u2019s Succession, but in the outback. Expect every critic who reviews this show to make that point. The central setting is the fictional Marianne Station, the world\u2019s largest cattle station, which is thrown into turmoil after the unexpected death of the man next in line to inherit it. Grumpy, Logan Roy-like patriarch Colin (Robert Taylor) isn\u2019t happy with any of the other options, which include his alcoholic son Graham (Michael Dorman), Graham\u2019s wife Emily (Anna Torv), and their two children Marshall (Sam Corlett) and Susie (Philippa Northeast). Expect lots of power jostling and stunning shots of Top End terrain. Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft TV, US, 2024 \u2013 out 10 October This animated show version of the iconic video game franchise doesn\u2019t waste any time indulging in, well, tomb raiding, with Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) catapulting into various exotic jungle locations. In the first episode she finds a box that, legend has it, makes anybody who touches it wealthy, though locals say the box \u201cwill only bring death and destruction\u201d. The lesson we\u2019ve learned from a zillion other stories: listen to the locals! Indiana Jones-esque plotlines deploy lots of magical items and narrow escapes. It\u2019s a bit boilerplate, but not badly made; my teenage self probably would\u2019ve dug it. Honourable mentions: Heartstopper season three (TV, 3 October), The Platform (film, 4 October), The Fabelmans (film, 5 October), The Menendez Brothers (film, 7 October), Lonely Planet (film, 11 October), Chucky season one (TV, 15 October), Time Cut (film, 30 October). Stan Of an Age Film, Australia, 2022 \u2013 out 24 October The Macedonian Australian film-maker Goran Stolevski has delivered an awesome one-two directorial debut, following up his spellbinding horror movie You Won\u2019t Be Alone with this queer romance that\u2019s sweet in a tough-hearted way, embracing romantic possibility rather than uniting two lovers forevermore. Adam (Thom Green) and Nikola (Elias Anton) meet and bond while racing across Melbourne to pick up Nikola\u2019s dance partner Ebony (Hattie Hook). The camerawork can be sharp and jittery but the film ultimately feels tender and gentle, the passage of time pushing the story into a melancholic \u201cwhat might have been\u201d space. Carrie Film, US, 1976 \u2013 out 23 October Very few films about puberty and schoolyard bullying pack a punch like Brian De Palma\u2019s horrific assault on the senses \u2013 a horror classic intensely focused on the tormented psyche of its titular character (unforgettably played by Sissy Spacek) who develops supernatural powers. She\u2019s the victim of the cruelest treatment, mocked and belittled and terrorised by her peers, including and especially at her high school prom. This is the setting for a long, bloody, fire-filled stretch of carnage: once seen, never forgotten. Honourable mentions: Joan (TV, 1 October), This is Going to Hurt (TV, 2 October), Lucky Country (film, 3 October), Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (film, 6 October), The Wedding Singer (film, 8 October), Seven (film, 10 October), Gayby Baby (film, 13 October), Thou Shalt Not Steal (TV, 17 October), Bad Boys 1-3 (film, 18 October), Child\u2019s Play (film, 25 October). SBS on Demand So Long, Marianne TV, Canada/Norway, 2024 \u2013 out 19 October If, like me, you\u2019re a Leonard Cohen fan, you\u2019ll be intrigued by this eight-part series inspired by his song of the same name. It follows a young Cohen (Alex Wolff) as he arrives on the Greek island of Hydra, hanging out with cash-strapped artists and beatniks and meeting Marianne Ihlen (Thea Sofie Loch N\u00e6ss), who\u2019s in a volcanic relationship with the novelist Axel Jensen (Jonas Strand Gravli). I\u2019ve only watched the first episode so far and I\u2019m in two minds about it: the show jumps around a lot and I\u2019m not entirely sold by Wolff\u2019s impersonation of the great poet. But it grew on me as the runtime progressed, and I\u2019m curious enough to keep watching. Batman and Me Film, Australia, 2020 \u2013 out 3 October Society is full of potential addictions. Some of us get hooked on obviously addictive things, like crack and Iced VoVos, while others take to protein shakes, nutmeg, licking toads \u2026 even collecting Batman paraphernalia. When I spoke a few years ago to Darren \u201cDags\u201d Maxwell, the subject of Michael Wayne\u2019s documentary, he told me he didn\u2019t even like the Batman merchandise he was addicted to buying: \u201cI bought these items and I couldn\u2019t stand them,\u201d he said. \u201cI hated them. I hate them today.\u201d The film is low-fi but endearingly made, expanding into an exploration of pop culture collectibles. Honourable mentions: Beyond Utopia (film, 1 October), The Old Man (TV, 1 October), Four Years Later (TV, 2 October), The Gone (TV, 31 October). ABC iView Plum TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 20 October Brendan Cowell\u2019s 2021 novel Plum provides a multidimensional, warts-and-all depiction of the retired rugby league footballer Peter Lum, who suffers from various health conditions \u2013 mostly related to concussions he experienced on the field. In terms of its form and structure, the book\u2019s most impressive element is its long and naturalistic conversations, good dialogue being very difficult to nail in any artistic medium. This bodes well for its TV adaptation, which is created, written and produced by Cowell, who also stars as Plum, alongside cast members including Asher Keddie (who was terrific in the recent Fake), Mar\u00eda Dupl\u00e1a and Jemaine Clement. Honourable mentions: Nolly (TV, 18 October), Fisk season three (TV, 20 October), A Bite To Eat With Alice (TV, 28 October). Prime Video The Office TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 18 October I don\u2019t think anybody in the world is saying, \u201cNow\u2019s the right time for another remake of The Office.\u201d The makers of the new Australian version have their work cut out for them, the original show\u2019s heavily templated mockumentary format having already spawned versions in more than a dozen countries. Felicity Ward leads the cast as Hannah Howard, the inevitably inept David Brent- or Michael Scott-esque manager of a Sydney-based packaging company. Ward will be the first woman to lead any version of The Office, adding a little novelty. Although you could argue the show has already been (unofficially) remade, with a broadly similar leading character played by a woman \u2013 that show being the very similarly toned Parks and Recreation, led by a very funny Amy Poehler. Challengers Film, US, 2024 \u2013 out 1 October The centrepiece scene in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s love triangle drama is a tennis match between two personal and professional adversaries \u2013 Art (Mike Faist) and Patrick (Josh O\u2019Connor) \u2013 which the director keeps cutting away from. Or perhaps you could say serving, smashing or volleying away from, given the film\u2019s bouncy editing that audaciously attempts to reflect the sport\u2019s rhythms. This scattered approach comes together with surprising fluidity, as we gradually learn more details about the characters\u2019 lives, Art and Patrick for instance previously being buddies who competed for the eye of another tennis player, Zendaya\u2019s Tashi, who ultimately married Art. Tashi\u2019s unpredictable behaviour is partly what keeps the drama spiky and spicy. Honourable mentions: The Fighter (film, 1 October), House of Spoils (film, 3 October), A Simple Favour (film, 6 October) Citadel: Diana (TV, 10 October), Canary Black (film, 24 October). Binge Sweetpea TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 10 October This wickedly entertaining series about a woman fed up with being overlooked and underestimated has a volcanically dark and sassy energy. Ella Purnell\u2019s protagonist Rhiannon Lewis, who works as an editorial assistant for a small newspaper, opens the show with a monologue about \u201cpeople I\u2019d love to kill\u201d, kvetching about a range of people including manspreaders and \u201cDonna at the mini market\u201d. The first episode does a great job really putting her down, painting her as a person constantly ignored, even if it\u2019s a bit cheeky to cast the magnetic Purnell as a dorky wallflower. Created by Kirstie Swain and adapted from CJ Skuse\u2019s book of the same name, the show is a wild take on standing up for yourself, flipping into sensational luridness when Rhiannon brutally stabs a bully to death, horrifically breaking bad. The pace is absolutely cracking and the humour as black as it comes. It\u2019s very sharp and well made; I smashed through all six episodes in two evenings. The Franchise TV, UK, 2024 \u2013 out 7 October I\u2019m a big fan of Armando Iannucci, one of the executive producers of this zippily enjoyable behind-the-scenes comedy about blockbuster moviemaking. While the great satirist and film-maker didn\u2019t create or write it, the show certainly feels Iannucci-esque. Dialogue flows thick and fast, with loads of bon mots and ripostes delivered in that wonderful dry British style. Himesh Patel\u2019s protagonist Daniel plays the first assistant director of a Marvel-like production, tasked with putting out countless spot fires and navigating all sorts of dramas and mishaps. Honourable mentions: Salem\u2019s Lot (film, 3 October), Mountain (film, 3 October), Brazen Hussies (film, 3 October), Teacup (TV, 10 October), Caddo Lake (film, 10 October), Man on Wire (film, 18 October), Hysteria! (TV, 18 October), Immaculate (film, 20 October), When We Were Kings (film, 21 October), Page One: Inside The New York Times (film, 23 October), The Color Purple (TV, 24 October), Stop Making Sense (film, 29 October), Spaceship Earth (film, 30 October), Frackman (film, 31 October). Disney+ Last Days of the Space Age TV, Australia, 2024 \u2013 out 2 October Set in Perth in 1979, this original Australian period drama from the Big Mouse attempts to evoke an end-of-an-era mentality. But I didn\u2019t buy it, emerging from the series feeling as though I\u2019d watched a very middle-of-the-road vision of the past, history\u2019s rough edges smoothed. The narrative spreads itself too thin, introducing about a dozen key characters, the most vivid and interesting being Radha Mitchell\u2019s Judy, whose promotion to a managerial position at the local power plant places her in opposite to its striking employees, including her husband Tony (Jesse Spencer). Honourable mentions: Hold Your Breath (film, 3 October), Rivals (TV, 18 October), Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band (film, 25 October), Wizards Beyond Waverly Place (TV, 30 October). Apple TV+ Disclaimer TV, US/Australia/Mexico, 2024 \u2013 out 11 October The combination of director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and star Cate Blanchett should alone put this seven-part adaptation of Ren\u00e9e Knight\u2019s 2015 novel on your watch list. Blanchett plays Catherine Ravenscroft, a revered documentarian who receives a novel that incorporates dark aspects of her own past. Deadline calls the show \u201cgut-wrenching, beautiful and solidly conventional\u201d while IndieWire describes it as an \u201castute, all-consuming thriller\u201d. Honourable mentions: The Last of the Sea Women (film, 11 October), Shrinking season two (TV, 16 October), Before (TV, 25 October).",

      "bodyText": "When the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved three new coalmine expansions last week, she not only failed abjectly to act on climate change, but by diverting scarce workers from constructing homes to expanding fossil-fuel projects, she also made it harder for the government to improve housing affordability through its aim of building 1.2m new homes in five years. Last week Plibersek posted photos of her releasing a cute little bilby into a wild training zone. Oddly there was no such cute photo, nor mention on her list of \u201csome of the things I\u2019m most proud of\u201d, of her approving those three coalmine expansions, which will generate about 1.3bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime. On ABC\u2019s Weekend Breakfast, when asked how the approval squared with both the government\u2019s commitment to net zero by 2050 and the pleas from those living in the Pacific Islands to reduce our emissions, she batted away the questions. Apparently, approving 1.3bn tonnes of emissions does not undermine the government\u2019s commitments to reaching net zero, the minister argued, because \u201call of these projects fit within our safeguard mechanism\u201d. At this point it is worth noting the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d was first developed by Tony Abbott and if red flags aren\u2019t waving at this point then you might want to Google \u201cTony Abbott climate change is crap\u201d. The safeguard mechanism allows companies to pay their way out of reducing emissions by buying carbon offsets. These offsets are often utterly worthless, and cost relatively so little that these mining companies had no qualms about paying the cost to emit 1.3bn tonnes of CO2. Maybe I am too simple, but if your emissions reduction policy does not actually deter coal companies from increasing their emissions, I think there may be an issue with how it works. Ending thermal coalmining is the lowest-hanging fruit in reducing emissions, and yet the government is unwilling to pick it. But at least the safeguard mechanism allows government ministers such as Chris Bowen to say that \u201cAustralia is already on track to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what track the minister is looking at, but the government\u2019s own figures suggest otherwise. If the graph does not display, click here Minister Plibersek might think Pacific Islanders should stop worrying about the government approving new coalmines but, unfortunately, they are not so gullible. Dr Maina Talia, the Tuvalu climate minister, called the decision \u201ca direct threat to our collective future\u201d. Maybe Tuvalu should just try to offset their future. Clearly, approving more coalmines is not good for the climate, but what is less understood is how it is also bad for the economy \u2013 especially if you want to build (as the government does) 1.2m homes in five years. The problem is one of crowding out. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Usually when economists talk of \u201ccrowding out\u201d, they mean the government using up the resources in the economy and making it hard for the private sector to get workers or investment. But it also works the other way. Construction workers \u2013 especially those in the \u201ctechnician and trades\u201d occupation group \u2013 are in very short supply. The unemployment rate for workers in the construction industry has been below 3% for most of the past three years, and there are now fewer than two unemployed construction workers per job vacancy. If the graph does not display, click here It is easier to get work in construction now than during the mining boom. That means there is a big fight for workers. Crucially, mining construction competes for the same workers as those building houses, apartments and public infrastructure such as roads and rail. Approving a coalmine means that work will \u201ccrowd out\u201d other types of construction work. You want to build 1.2m homes? Great, but who will build them? It won\u2019t be those who are constructing a coalmine expansion, or some new gasfield. In a period of full employment in the construction industry, approving new coalmines is essentially saying you want workers to go do that rather than build homes. Until 2005, about 35% of all construction work done was building new residences \u2013 whether houses or apartments. Since 2004 the share of that construction work has never been that high. If the graph does not display, click here The drop is almost completely due to mining. The relative amount of work done on public infrastructure and non-residential building works has barely changed. The big shift has been from building homes to private sector engineering work. If the graph does not display, click here The biggest part of such engineering work is construction in oil, gas, coal and other mines. If the graph does not display, click here The cost of approving the three coalmine extensions (and any of the others that are on Minister Plibersek\u2019s plate) is thus twofold. There is the obvious cost of the emissions causing greater climate change \u2013 one that has been pretty much swept under the rug via the misnamed safeguard mechanism. But there is also the opportunity cost that comes from diverting the scarce resources of the economy to fossil fuel projects rather than to building homes for people. Doing so not only reduces the ability for homes to be built but raises the cost of labour to build those homes. It takes skill to make two things worse with one decision, but Minister Plibersek did just that when she approved the three coalmines.",

Not like those digital-native freaks who don\u2019t remember 9/11 and had the internet as just a consistent part of their life; as I grew up, the internet grew up with me.</p> <p>Early doors, I used to download comedy off the internet illegally (sight-unseen) and just hope it was funny/not a virus. Then came the first batch of made-for-internet comedy that you had to hunt for yourself on random websites like CollegeHumor or Newgrounds. And finally YouTube, where random people made niche videos for no reason (monetisation came later) and they were all in one convenient location. It matured as I matured.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/22/clare-cavanagh-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet\">Clare Cavanagh: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s still heaps of stuff I laugh at online because, as a standup comedian, the internet has become the repository for every set, TV show clips, comedy special, sketch series and blooper compilation ever \u2013 it\u2019s like Sportscenter for humour. All the highlights (and lowlights) are there.

I have tried to keep it vaguely reverse-chronological order. Enjoy!</p> <h2>1. Norm Macdonald is married to a real battle axe \u2013 Conan</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7K-kaelQEs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L7K-kaelQEs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>If you\u2019re talking about what I find funniest now, I could easily do 10 Norm Macdonald late-night clips. He\u2019s so hilarious and the hosts\u2019 reactions make him even better. If you can watch David Letterman\u2019s face while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiooeRAdcjU\" title=\"https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/MVqoCYWK03u3ZjGFGhwuXA-76?domain=youtube.com\">Norm does his Bob Uecker impression</a> without laughing then abandon these lists forever, I reckon? Anyway this is my favourite, it\u2019s a book promo which is so dry but Norm makes it great in like three different ways and does so while Conan is telling the audience exactly what the joke is \u2026 and it doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <h2>2. Gary Gulman \u2013 state abbreviations</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLECCmKnrys\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dLECCmKnrys?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is the perfect late-night standup set. My dog is called Dottie because of this clip and that\u2019s all you need to know really. And yes, she\u2019s a pistol.</p> <h2>3. Bill Burr on Night of Too Many Stars</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X70xe90dcKk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X70xe90dcKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Probably my favourite comedian ever and my favourite set of his. As a comic, you think about the context of a set a bit more than most \u2013 so to do these jokes in front of a charity gala, tuxedo-wearing crowd, super late into the event and KILL with that material is just absurd. Plus it\u2019s the only recording I\u2019ve ever found of his Steve Jobs bit which is an all-timer and will change the way you view pears forever. So stop reading this and watch the clip. GET ON IT!</p> <h2>4. Patrice O\u2019Neal \u2013 Ain\u2019t that better?</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-6GuttRWGE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9-6GuttRWGE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Probably my second-favourite comedian ever and a perfect joke. \u201cMen want to be alone but we don\u2019t want to be by ourself\u201d is just a perfect observation; it\u2019s irrefutable and gets everybody on board immediately. I\u2019ve shown my mum this joke, I\u2019ve shown my wife this joke, I\u2019ve shown my dentist this joke; they all loved it because it\u2019s impossible to dislike this joke. And Patrice\u2019s suit for this taping deserves a wider audience as well.</p> <h2>5. Preston walks off Never Mind the Buzzcocks</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UewCI6dtHss\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UewCI6dtHss?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I remember being introduced to Simon Amstell hosting Never Mind the Buzzcocks first year of uni and being blown away. He was so fast, the jokes were so good and how mean he was to his guests was incredible (especially compared to the absolute friendliness of Spicks &amp; Specks). That said, I think Bill Bailey is the MVP of this clip: a celebrity walks off a panel, he jumps in with a perfect one-liner and then replaces him with a lookalike member of the studio audience like nothing happened \u2026 who immediately gets a bigger laugh than Preston did the whole show. So good.</p> <h2>7. PurePwnage \u2013 FPS Doug</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61ss1KSdDxE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/61ss1KSdDxE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Look, I\u2019ll be the first to admit I don\u2019t find this particularly funny any more. But as a teenager playing computer games at a Burwood internet cafe, this was hilarious and it gave gaming a context that didn\u2019t really exist when I was in high school. It definitely has some very homophobic language, but remember \u2013 this is a satire of hardcore gamers from 2004 so while it might be offensive, it\u2019s not inaccurate. This is my favourite episode just because the character FPS Doug is so stupid, but we yelled out \u201cBOOM HEADSHOT\u201d for years anyway.</p> <h2>8. \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/W7JyjZI3LUM?si=v-FdSri35tARtGbP\" title=\"https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/vfouC5QD3Nt0KwqhlFMuyXthi?domain=youtu.be\">My spoon is too big</a>\u201d</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7JyjZI3LUM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W7JyjZI3LUM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another absolute classic, I had no idea it was an Academy Award nominee until I made this list. Just watch and enjoy knowing there\u2019s an entire generation of people who can only hear the words \u201cMy spoon is too big\u201d in that voice. In hindsight it\u2019s weird how accurately this guy nailed internet humour\u2019s vibe before it became a thing people were actively trying to do.</p> <h2>9. John Cena prank call</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CjRZYWmwAc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0CjRZYWmwAc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Pranks online have become horrific, but the prank phone call was always an internet staple and this for me in the GOAT. This was before John Cena was a meme \u2013 hell, it might\u2019ve even been before meme was a word. But just hounding this poor lady, BLASTING his theme music, bringing up supporting the troops just to trick her again \u2026 and then the switch up of a lady calling instead of the original guy to get her one last time is genius. It just makes me happy.</p> <h2>10. \u201cI\u2019m in your face\u201d</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-9Uv1YBJdM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_-9Uv1YBJdM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is when the internet made sense to me. A scene from the not-yet billion-dollar Fast &amp; Furious franchise and someone took it upon themselves to do some dodgy editing for a dumb joke. No call to action, no \u201clike and subscribe\u201d. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it. I\u2019ve watched this at least 1,000 times and I\u2019ve never regretted it once.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Daniel Muggleton\u2019s standup special <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxyQUgCUAq4\">White &amp; Wrong</a> is streaming on YouTube and he co-hosts the podcast <a href=\"https://pod.link/1706144216\">Flog Cabin</a>.

      "bodyText": "I grew up with the internet. Not like those digital-native freaks who don\u2019t remember 9/11 and had the internet as just a consistent part of their life; as I grew up, the internet grew up with me. Early doors, I used to download comedy off the internet illegally (sight-unseen) and just hope it was funny/not a virus. Then came the first batch of made-for-internet comedy that you had to hunt for yourself on random websites like CollegeHumor or Newgrounds. And finally YouTube, where random people made niche videos for no reason (monetisation came later) and they were all in one convenient location. It matured as I matured. There\u2019s still heaps of stuff I laugh at online because, as a standup comedian, the internet has become the repository for every set, TV show clips, comedy special, sketch series and blooper compilation ever \u2013 it\u2019s like Sportscenter for humour. All the highlights (and lowlights) are there. But I thought for my list I\u2019d focus on the good old days because current internet \u201ccontent\u201d is so homogenous and so blatantly trying to sell something that I thought we were due for a palate cleanser. So while I might not necessarily still find them the funniest as I\u2019m not 13 anymore, here\u2019s the 10 things that I found funniest on the internet. I have tried to keep it vaguely reverse-chronological order. Enjoy! 1. Norm Macdonald is married to a real battle axe \u2013 Conan If you\u2019re talking about what I find funniest now, I could easily do 10 Norm Macdonald late-night clips. He\u2019s so hilarious and the hosts\u2019 reactions make him even better. If you can watch David Letterman\u2019s face while Norm does his Bob Uecker impression without laughing then abandon these lists forever, I reckon? Anyway this is my favourite, it\u2019s a book promo which is so dry but Norm makes it great in like three different ways and does so while Conan is telling the audience exactly what the joke is \u2026 and it doesn\u2019t matter. 2. Gary Gulman \u2013 state abbreviations This is the perfect late-night standup set. My dog is called Dottie because of this clip and that\u2019s all you need to know really. And yes, she\u2019s a pistol. 3. Bill Burr on Night of Too Many Stars Probably my favourite comedian ever and my favourite set of his. As a comic, you think about the context of a set a bit more than most \u2013 so to do these jokes in front of a charity gala, tuxedo-wearing crowd, super late into the event and KILL with that material is just absurd. Plus it\u2019s the only recording I\u2019ve ever found of his Steve Jobs bit which is an all-timer and will change the way you view pears forever. So stop reading this and watch the clip. GET ON IT! 4. Patrice O\u2019Neal \u2013 Ain\u2019t that better? Probably my second-favourite comedian ever and a perfect joke. \u201cMen want to be alone but we don\u2019t want to be by ourself\u201d is just a perfect observation; it\u2019s irrefutable and gets everybody on board immediately. I\u2019ve shown my mum this joke, I\u2019ve shown my wife this joke, I\u2019ve shown my dentist this joke; they all loved it because it\u2019s impossible to dislike this joke. And Patrice\u2019s suit for this taping deserves a wider audience as well. 5. Preston walks off Never Mind the Buzzcocks I remember being introduced to Simon Amstell hosting Never Mind the Buzzcocks first year of uni and being blown away. He was so fast, the jokes were so good and how mean he was to his guests was incredible (especially compared to the absolute friendliness of Spicks &amp; Specks). That said, I think Bill Bailey is the MVP of this clip: a celebrity walks off a panel, he jumps in with a perfect one-liner and then replaces him with a lookalike member of the studio audience like nothing happened \u2026 who immediately gets a bigger laugh than Preston did the whole show. So good. 7. PurePwnage \u2013 FPS Doug Look, I\u2019ll be the first to admit I don\u2019t find this particularly funny any more. But as a teenager playing computer games at a Burwood internet cafe, this was hilarious and it gave gaming a context that didn\u2019t really exist when I was in high school. It definitely has some very homophobic language, but remember \u2013 this is a satire of hardcore gamers from 2004 so while it might be offensive, it\u2019s not inaccurate. This is my favourite episode just because the character FPS Doug is so stupid, but we yelled out \u201cBOOM HEADSHOT\u201d for years anyway. 8. \u201cMy spoon is too big\u201d Another absolute classic, I had no idea it was an Academy Award nominee until I made this list. Just watch and enjoy knowing there\u2019s an entire generation of people who can only hear the words \u201cMy spoon is too big\u201d in that voice. In hindsight it\u2019s weird how accurately this guy nailed internet humour\u2019s vibe before it became a thing people were actively trying to do. 9. John Cena prank call Pranks online have become horrific, but the prank phone call was always an internet staple and this for me in the GOAT. This was before John Cena was a meme \u2013 hell, it might\u2019ve even been before meme was a word. But just hounding this poor lady, BLASTING his theme music, bringing up supporting the troops just to trick her again \u2026 and then the switch up of a lady calling instead of the original guy to get her one last time is genius. It just makes me happy. 10. \u201cI\u2019m in your face\u201d This is when the internet made sense to me. A scene from the not-yet billion-dollar Fast &amp; Furious franchise and someone took it upon themselves to do some dodgy editing for a dumb joke. No call to action, no \u201clike and subscribe\u201d. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it. I\u2019ve watched this at least 1,000 times and I\u2019ve never regretted it once.

      "bodyText": "Annual rent increases for houses have hit multi-year lows in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, suggesting a relentless stretch of rising rents may have peaked, a new report has found. Renters are still feeling the pinch from record high prices but the data in Domain\u2019s Rent Report revealed the lowest September quarter growth rate since 2019 for houses and 2020 for units. \u201cAustralia\u2019s era of explosive rental growth appears to be nearing its end,\u201d Domain\u2019s head of research, Nicola Powell, said. \u201cAfter enduring the steepest and longest rental surge in history our latest [report] shows that all capital cities have passed their peak in growth rates and are now decelerating rapidly, with some cities already in decline.\u201d For rental houses, Sydney recorded its weakest growth rate for a September quarter in four years with annual gains at their lowest in almost three years. However, the average weekly rent was up marginally to sit at a record high $775. Melbourne house rents marked the weakest outcome for a September quarter since 2021. But the report noted weekly rent remained at a record high of $580. Rents in Brisbane declined for the first time in just over four years, marking the end of the city\u2019s long growth period. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Rental demand is easing, the report said, with the number of prospective tenants per rental listing on Domain\u2019s website falling to its lowest level since 2019, indicating a better balance between supply and demand. The shift had been driven by a decrease in demand as more people move into share housing and intergenerational living to alleviate financial strain, the report said. It also noted net overseas migration had decreased 19% since its March 2023 peak. The peak in migration coincided with record rent growth. Not all capital cities have a potential light at the end of the tunnel. Darwin and Hobart experienced their strongest September quarter since 2020 and 2017, respectively. Despite the evident slowdown in rental growth, tenants were still grappling with record-high asking rents across all capitals except Brisbane and Canberra, and for units in Hobart. All capital cities remain firmly a landlords\u2019 market and vacancy rates sit uniformly below 2%, the report said. Powell said the tide seemed to be turning. \u201cThis is long-awaited good news for renters,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the first time in nine months, quarterly rental growth for both houses and units has stalled across the combined capitals. \u201cThis has slowed annual gains to an almost three-year low across the combined capitals, with most cities at multi-year lows.\u201d One of the biggest shifts has been a rise in investment activity, the report said, accounting for 38% of new home loans, well above the decade average. Investors are likely reacting to capital growth potential and seeking to buy before the Reserve Bank of Australia lowers the cash rate, the report said.",

They said Stadiums Tasmania would negotiate event planning with the new stadium\u2019s neighbours.</p> <p>\u201cWe also expect works on site will continue as they have to date, with noise and vibration monitoring and liaison with the TSO to minimise impact on key events,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>In a statement, the AFL did not address the concerns raised by the TSO, saying only that the new Tasmania Devils club had signed up more than 200,000 members and the stadium development was continuing to make \u201cgreat progress\u201d.</p> <p>As a state-significant project, the stadium\u2019s plans must be approved by both houses of parliament. The Labor opposition has indicated it will support the development.</p> <p>According to the development application, the Federation Concert Hall is expected to experience levels of sound spill from crowd noise, game sirens, PA systems and live music of between 49 and 75 decibels.</p>    <p>Sharpen said the latest report prepared has warned that low frequency (bass) music sounds emanating from the stadium\u2019s loudspeakers from advertising and entertainment will be the hardest to mitigate.</p> <p>\u201cThese sounds tend to travel through the earth, and the vibration comes through into the concert hall,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sharpen stressed that the TSO was supportive of the Tasmania Devils getting a home and she is an AFL fan (her brother Jeremy Sharpen played for Collingwood in the late 1990s) but the orchestra is now joining a growing number of Tasmanians objecting not to having an AFL stadium but to the government\u2019s choice of site.</p> <p>On Thursday the orchestra will hold a joint announcement with the Tasmanian RSL, which has already voiced its opposition to the location.</p>    <p>The two organisations will announce a 10 November vigil and free concert at Hobart\u2019s cenotaph to protest against the development.</p> <p>The RSL\u2019s objection centres on the 54-metre high stadium dome which will intrude on the sightlines of the cenotaph, Australia\u2019s oldest war memorial.</p> <p>The RSL\u2019s chief executive, John Hardy, said the layout of the Hobart memorial had been designed after the first world war to incorporate two significant landmarks \u2013 the Derwent River and St George\u2019s Church, where many of those servicemen had been baptised or married.</p> <p>The render designs provided in the development application by Cox Architecture show the stadium\u2019s dome will become a defining feature of Anzac Day\u2019s dawn ceremonies in Hobart.</p> <p>The RSL appears to have higher access to government than the TSO, with Hardy saying he had met the premier and the veteran\u2019s affairs minister to lobby for a location change.</p>    <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had [politicians] say, \u2018We\u2019d never disrespect the RSL or disrespect the cenotaph\u2019 \u2013 but they are because they\u2019re building something right by it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The extent of the government\u2019s \u201cclear lack of understanding\u201d of the cenotaph\u2019s significance was evident in the development application, Hardy said. When addressing the sightline issue from the cenotaph, the report states that the view is blocked by vegetation.</p> <p>The vegetation in question is a towering poplar tree bearing a soldier\u2019s name at its base.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the essence of the cenotaph,\u201d the RSL chief executive said. \u201cThe Tasmanian government will be the first Australian parliament to ever reduce, degrade and disrespect its own cenotaph by building around it. No other government has ever done that.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal minority government said the premier and veteran affairs minister would continue to consult with the RSL.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand the RSL has concerns and that there are also differing views in the veteran community,\u201d a spokesperson said on Thursday.</p> <p>The government said there would be viewing areas within the stadium where people could see the cenotaph. But Hardy said a \u201cpay for view\u201d approach to a war memorial was unacceptable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The $775m bid to bring an AFL team to Tasmania will place the state\u2019s symphony orchestra in an unenviable world-first position, which could threaten its future existence. The plan to build a home for the newly formed Tasmania Devils AFL team will see a 23,000-seat sports and music stadium constructed on a historic Hobart foreshore site just 40 metres from the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra\u2019s purpose-built performing and recording headquarters, the Federation Concert Hall. The TSO has commissioned two independent acoustic reports in the past 12 months. Both reports, seen by Guardian Australia, warn greater measures will be needed to address the potential for sound spill and reverberation into the concert hall during construction \u2013 set to begin next year \u2013 and once operating from 2029. The orchestra\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Sharpen, said there were major inadequately addressed issues in the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium development application now before the Tasmanian Planning Commission for assessment. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cThere\u2019s no precedent in the world that we know of for a concert hall having a 23,000-people stadium 170 metres from its stage,\u201d Sharpen said. \u201cThere are still too many unanswered questions, particularly around noise and vibration and the ability of the existing concert hall to be able to buffer those without impairing any of our performance, recording or filming activities.\u201d Sharpen said the stadium proposal relied heavily on \u201cmanagement mitigation\u201d \u2013 such as coming to an agreement with the AFL over scheduling to avoid a conflict of events \u2013 rather than prevention at the source. \u201cThis is problematic because management mitigation needs to be by mutual agreement \u2013 and we can\u2019t predict ongoing relations between the AFL and the TSO,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can predict that the AFL won\u2019t negotiate.\u201d The 75-year-old orchestra performs hundreds of concerts across Tasmania each year, including in its purpose-built home on Hobart\u2019s waterfront. When not performing, Sharpen said the concert hall was in use seven days and six nights a week for the TSO\u2019s extensive recording, rehearsal, filming and livestream activities, which reach more than 6 million online and radio listeners annually, making it the most recorded, broadcast and streamed orchestra in the country. According to the stadium\u2019s developer, the Tasmanian government, the stadium is expected to host between 36 and 51 major events each year once operational. In the past two years the concert hall has undergone a $1.3m acoustic and digital recording upgrade. Generating $14m a year in revenue, it is considered Tasmania\u2019s No 1 cultural export. But Sharpen said she had not been able to secure meetings with senior ministers to discuss the orchestra\u2019s fate in the face of the AFL juggernaut, and the state arts minister, Madeleine Ogilvie, had only given vague assurances the noise and vibration problems would be \u201cengineered away\u201d. A state government spokesperson said the planning commission\u2019s assessment would include public consultation with key stakeholders including the TSO. They said Stadiums Tasmania would negotiate event planning with the new stadium\u2019s neighbours. \u201cWe also expect works on site will continue as they have to date, with noise and vibration monitoring and liaison with the TSO to minimise impact on key events,\u201d the spokesperson said. In a statement, the AFL did not address the concerns raised by the TSO, saying only that the new Tasmania Devils club had signed up more than 200,000 members and the stadium development was continuing to make \u201cgreat progress\u201d. As a state-significant project, the stadium\u2019s plans must be approved by both houses of parliament. The Labor opposition has indicated it will support the development. According to the development application, the Federation Concert Hall is expected to experience levels of sound spill from crowd noise, game sirens, PA systems and live music of between 49 and 75 decibels. Sharpen said the latest report prepared has warned that low frequency (bass) music sounds emanating from the stadium\u2019s loudspeakers from advertising and entertainment will be the hardest to mitigate. \u201cThese sounds tend to travel through the earth, and the vibration comes through into the concert hall,\u201d she said. Sharpen stressed that the TSO was supportive of the Tasmania Devils getting a home and she is an AFL fan (her brother Jeremy Sharpen played for Collingwood in the late 1990s) but the orchestra is now joining a growing number of Tasmanians objecting not to having an AFL stadium but to the government\u2019s choice of site. On Thursday the orchestra will hold a joint announcement with the Tasmanian RSL, which has already voiced its opposition to the location. The two organisations will announce a 10 November vigil and free concert at Hobart\u2019s cenotaph to protest against the development. The RSL\u2019s objection centres on the 54-metre high stadium dome which will intrude on the sightlines of the cenotaph, Australia\u2019s oldest war memorial. The RSL\u2019s chief executive, John Hardy, said the layout of the Hobart memorial had been designed after the first world war to incorporate two significant landmarks \u2013 the Derwent River and St George\u2019s Church, where many of those servicemen had been baptised or married. The render designs provided in the development application by Cox Architecture show the stadium\u2019s dome will become a defining feature of Anzac Day\u2019s dawn ceremonies in Hobart. The RSL appears to have higher access to government than the TSO, with Hardy saying he had met the premier and the veteran\u2019s affairs minister to lobby for a location change. \u201cI\u2019ve had [politicians] say, \u2018We\u2019d never disrespect the RSL or disrespect the cenotaph\u2019 \u2013 but they are because they\u2019re building something right by it,\u201d he said. The extent of the government\u2019s \u201cclear lack of understanding\u201d of the cenotaph\u2019s significance was evident in the development application, Hardy said. When addressing the sightline issue from the cenotaph, the report states that the view is blocked by vegetation. The vegetation in question is a towering poplar tree bearing a soldier\u2019s name at its base. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the essence of the cenotaph,\u201d the RSL chief executive said. \u201cThe Tasmanian government will be the first Australian parliament to ever reduce, degrade and disrespect its own cenotaph by building around it. No other government has ever done that.\u201d The Liberal minority government said the premier and veteran affairs minister would continue to consult with the RSL. \u201cWe understand the RSL has concerns and that there are also differing views in the veteran community,\u201d a spokesperson said on Thursday. The government said there would be viewing areas within the stadium where people could see the cenotaph. But Hardy said a \u201cpay for view\u201d approach to a war memorial was unacceptable.",

Will new housing ease these farmworkers\u2019 trauma?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pablo, who is using a pseudonym due to fear of retaliation, is one of more than 35,000 migrant workers in North Carolina this year as part of the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker Program, a guest visa program overseen by the US Department of Labor (DoL). The program enables American employers to hire foreign workers to perform seasonal agricultural work. Employers in the program frequently exploit their migrant employees, and the structure of the program makes easy work of it. Visas are tied to a single employer who must also provide housing, transportation and access to food, creating a crushing power imbalance between American employers and migrant H-2A workers.</p> <p>H-2A regulations require that all conditions of an agricultural job are disclosed in the application for temporary labor certification. On their face, regulations related to food and kitchen access are <em>very</em> precise. For example, labor camp stoves must have a certain number of burners depending on the number of workers, and each individual is only allotted three-fourths of a cubic foot of refrigerator space, about the size of a gallon of milk. The contract entered into between the employer and worker must also detail whether the employer will provide workers access to kitchen facilities, or if the employer will provide three meals a day for no more than $15.88 a day.</p> <p>But sometimes H-2A workers sign contracts with guaranteed kitchen access, only to arrive and learn their employer has what advocates call a \u201cforced meal plan\u201d, unlawfully siphoning money from farm workers\u2019 paychecks.</p> <p>The H-2A program is so rife with <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2023/04/14/h2a-visa-wage-theft-exploitation/\">serious legal violations</a> that attorney Caitlin Ryland with the farmworker unit of Legal Aid of North Carolina (Lanc) says forced meal plans are often overlooked \u2013 even as they become more common.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more cases where individuals or companies see meals as another opportunity to make an extra buck off of a vulnerable workforce that really doesn\u2019t have much of a choice,\u201d she said. Forced meal plans are happening so frequently that a few years ago, Lanc developed materials to inform H-2A workers of their meal plan rights.</p> <p>Pablo has encountered forced meal plans several times during the 14 years he\u2019s come to North Carolina as part of the H-2A program. He is contracted through the North Carolina Growers Association (NCGA), which serves as his joint employer along with the farm or business where he harvests sweet potatoes, tobacco and a variety of other crops. The NCGA serves as an agricultural intermediary, applying en masse for H-2A visas needed by member businesses and then busing workers like Pablo across the border and moving them from farm to farm as needed. While American employers can obtain workers from <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/h2a-h2b-visa-eligibility-2023-dhs-list.aspx\">86 countries</a>, <a href=\"https://cdmigrante.org/new-report-ripe-for-reform-abuse-of-agricultural-workers-in-the-h-2a-visa-program/\">90% come from Mexico</a> and a majority work in Florida, California, Georgia, Washington and North Carolina, where the NCGA obtains the largest proportion of H-2A workers in the state.</p> <p>Workers who come to the US through a contract with the NCGA are rolling the dice with their food, according to advocates. The growers association\u2019s contracts cover many employers and the language regarding food is often vague, leaving workers unsure of the shape their meals will take until they\u2019re in the US. And because they have no control over the farms they\u2019re sent to, they can gain and lose kitchen access multiple times during a single season. The NCGA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>    <p>According to Carol Brooke, a senior attorney with the North Carolina Justice Center\u2019s Workers\u2019 Rights Project, forced meal plans are common in North Carolina. In fact, the organization is currently handling a meal plan-related legal case. The pending <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/lopez-v-rhodes-farming-llc-1\">lawsuit</a> alleges that eastern North Carolina agricultural operations Boykin Farms, Rhodes Farming, and Lee and Sons Farms were contractually obligated to provide kitchen access to workers. However, over the course of four years beginning in 2019, employers allegedly blocked H-2A workers from accessing cooking spaces and instead charged them as much as $160 a week under a forced meal plan.</p> <p>According to the complaint, meals were reportedly only provided twice a day Monday through Saturday. The meager breakfast consisted of coffee and slices of bread. In another example, workers arrived at a labor camp after a long day of work only to \u201cfind their dinners left out for them, cold and covered in flies\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Nothing voluntary about it</strong></h2> <p>Some forced meal plans are also unlawful because they charge workers prices that far exceed the daily cost allowed by DoL. The most expensive forced meal plan that attorney Aaron Jacobson has ever encountered was around $150 to $200 a week, almost half of workers\u2019 paychecks.</p> <p>Jacobson is a supervising attorney with Lanc\u2019s farmworker unit, where he has litigated cases related to forced meal plans going back to 2018. He noted that nothing about these forced meal plans is \u201coptional\u201d or \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Workers have to pay for the meal plan even if they don\u2019t eat the food \u2013 and it\u2019s often a hard violation to prove because most employers know better than to leave a paper trail. Jacobson says that typically, when H-2A workers are taken to cash their checks, their employers then immediately demand a kickback: cash for the plan.</p> <p>Ryland has represented workers in more extreme cases. In one, an employer told workers that they would have to pay a fee if they wanted to leave their labor camp, and the employer also locked them out of the labor camp kitchen and threatened to shoot workers who fled without first paying their debts. The workers who remained were forced to pay exorbitant amounts for meager, poor-quality food. Unable to go to the grocery store or use the labor camp kitchen, hungry farmworkers built a makeshift grill with cinder blocks and an oven rack to grill fish they caught in a nearby swamp.</p> <p>These conditions <a href=\"https://prismreports.org/2023/08/29/slavery-fields-north-carolina-h-2a/\">aren\u2019t as uncommon</a> as you\u2019d think, said Leticia Zavala, a former farm worker who now organizes North Carolina H-2A workers with the worker-led organization El Futuro Es Nuestro. Workers often report barred kitchens and chained refrigerators, she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/black-farmers-us-census\">How many Black farmers are there in the US?

Get your stuff ready because the [NCGA] is going to pick you up.\u2019\u201d With Zavala\u2019s help, Felipe and other workers were transferred to another farm.</p> <p>The incident occurred in 2020, when DoL\u2019s current maximum daily charge for a meal plan was $12.67. In their complaint, Felipe and his co-workers noted they were paying up to $20.85 a day, which included out-of-pocket costs for food on Sundays when their employer didn\u2019t provide meals. Felipe says all he wants is \u201cdignified food\u201d, something that\u2019s been hard to come by in the US.</p> <p>With Zavala\u2019s help, Pablo has also recently filed complaints demanding kitchen access. This led to his termination and transfer to two different farms. At his current farm, he\u2019s on yet another forced meal plan. Breakfast is typically some bread or a bowl of cereal. By 9am, he\u2019s usually hungry again, but he must wait until noon for lunch. Most days it\u2019s a plate of beans and rice, a few tortillas and very little protein. Pablo sent the Guardian cellphone images of recent meals, including a \u201csoup\u201d made of beans and hot dogs and various iterations of potatoes cooked in a watery salsa with bits of bacon or diced hot dogs.</p> <p>The 2022 H-2A Modernization Rule clarified that employers that elect to provide meals to H-2A workers must ensure the meals are calorically and nutritionally adequate. To meet the requirement, US DoL encourages employers to consult caloric intake guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health.</p> <p>But fresh fruit and vegetables are almost never offered as part of a meal plan of any kind \u2013 an irony, given how much time workers spend each day harvesting these very items. The cheap, starchy, carb-loaded and heavily processed foods served in forced meal plans can have health consequences.</p>    <p>Sara Quandt is a biological anthropologist with expertise in human nutrition. The professor emerita of epidemiology and prevention at North Carolina\u2019s Wake Forest University School of Medicine has conducted research with farmworker communities for more than 30 years.</p> <p>According to Quandt, if workers aren\u2019t consuming enough calories to sustain the difficult physical labor they perform, their bodies first eat through their fat reserves and then their muscles are used by their bodies as fuel. The cyclical nature of farm worker diets is akin to the impact of yo-yo diets, in which dieters are often losing and regaining the same few pounds but never recovering muscle lost during the process.</p> <p>The consequences can be even more severe for those with chronic conditions. Pablo currently shares housing with a few men who have diabetes. He says that the workers try to look out for each other\u2019s health by sharing food or otherwise encouraging men with chronic illnesses to avoid foods that will make them feel unwell.</p> <p>Pablo said: \u201cSome people need certain food or food at certain times, or they lose the energy to work. But the field manager will keep demanding them to keep working.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a recipe for disaster, according to Quandt. \u201cIf somebody passes out from low blood sugar, it\u2019s not going to look any different to their co-workers or supervisor than if they passed out because of the heat. So taking them to a cooler area and having them drink water isn\u2019t going to make a difference; they need a sugary drink and treatment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for NCDoL said that while the agency is \u201csympathetic\u201d to these situations, NCDoL \u201chas no enforcement authority over the type of food provided to migrant workers\u201d. North Carolina\u2019s Migrant Housing Act does require certified housing for H-2A workers to have a working stove, refrigerator and a sink with hot and cold water, which means workers like Pablo and Felipe who have been locked out of kitchen facilities can file complaints. However, \u201canything related to meal plans should be referred to US DoL\u2019s wage and hour division\u201d, the state agency said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/us-farms-made-200m-human-smuggling-labor-trafficking-operation\">\u2018A lot of abuse for little pay\u2019: how US farming profits from exploitation and brutality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A representative for the DoL said that when employers fail to comply with the H-2A program\u2019s meal requirements, the agency\u2019s Wage and Hour Division will assess back wages and penalties and where warranted, \u201cseek debarment and/or revocation\u201d of an employer\u2019s H-2A certification.</p> <p>\u201cWe take seriously the requirements for H-2A employers to provide meals or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to workers,\u201d a DoL spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThese obligations are critical worker protections, especially for H-2A workers who often live and work in remote areas.

      "bodyText": "On an August afternoon, Pablo stared down at a foam plate sloshing with flavorless pinto beans and a particularly bad version of huevos a la Mexicana. The simple, usually delicious scramble of eggs, tomatoes, onions and jalape\u00f1os is difficult to mess up. But if anyone can find a way to make it unpalatable, it\u2019s the cook at his labor camp. Soupy eggs are the last thing the 42-year-old from western Mexico wants to eat. But after a 12-hour day harvesting tobacco in the brutal and sometimes deadly summer heat, he must eat \u2013 and this was far from the worst meal he\u2019s been given. A few weeks ago, fellow farm workers got sick due to raw and moldy food they were forced to purchase. On days like this, Pablo can\u2019t decide which is worse: that he\u2019s forced to pay $80 a week for this slop, or that everything about what he eats, when he eats and how much he eats is tightly controlled by his employer. Pablo, who is using a pseudonym due to fear of retaliation, is one of more than 35,000 migrant workers in North Carolina this year as part of the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker Program, a guest visa program overseen by the US Department of Labor (DoL). The program enables American employers to hire foreign workers to perform seasonal agricultural work. Employers in the program frequently exploit their migrant employees, and the structure of the program makes easy work of it. Visas are tied to a single employer who must also provide housing, transportation and access to food, creating a crushing power imbalance between American employers and migrant H-2A workers. H-2A regulations require that all conditions of an agricultural job are disclosed in the application for temporary labor certification. On their face, regulations related to food and kitchen access are very precise. For example, labor camp stoves must have a certain number of burners depending on the number of workers, and each individual is only allotted three-fourths of a cubic foot of refrigerator space, about the size of a gallon of milk. The contract entered into between the employer and worker must also detail whether the employer will provide workers access to kitchen facilities, or if the employer will provide three meals a day for no more than $15.88 a day. But sometimes H-2A workers sign contracts with guaranteed kitchen access, only to arrive and learn their employer has what advocates call a \u201cforced meal plan\u201d, unlawfully siphoning money from farm workers\u2019 paychecks. The H-2A program is so rife with serious legal violations that attorney Caitlin Ryland with the farmworker unit of Legal Aid of North Carolina (Lanc) says forced meal plans are often overlooked \u2013 even as they become more common. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more cases where individuals or companies see meals as another opportunity to make an extra buck off of a vulnerable workforce that really doesn\u2019t have much of a choice,\u201d she said. Forced meal plans are happening so frequently that a few years ago, Lanc developed materials to inform H-2A workers of their meal plan rights. Pablo has encountered forced meal plans several times during the 14 years he\u2019s come to North Carolina as part of the H-2A program. He is contracted through the North Carolina Growers Association (NCGA), which serves as his joint employer along with the farm or business where he harvests sweet potatoes, tobacco and a variety of other crops. The NCGA serves as an agricultural intermediary, applying en masse for H-2A visas needed by member businesses and then busing workers like Pablo across the border and moving them from farm to farm as needed. While American employers can obtain workers from 86 countries, 90% come from Mexico and a majority work in Florida, California, Georgia, Washington and North Carolina, where the NCGA obtains the largest proportion of H-2A workers in the state. Workers who come to the US through a contract with the NCGA are rolling the dice with their food, according to advocates. The growers association\u2019s contracts cover many employers and the language regarding food is often vague, leaving workers unsure of the shape their meals will take until they\u2019re in the US. And because they have no control over the farms they\u2019re sent to, they can gain and lose kitchen access multiple times during a single season. The NCGA did not respond to multiple requests for comment. According to Carol Brooke, a senior attorney with the North Carolina Justice Center\u2019s Workers\u2019 Rights Project, forced meal plans are common in North Carolina. In fact, the organization is currently handling a meal plan-related legal case. The pending lawsuit alleges that eastern North Carolina agricultural operations Boykin Farms, Rhodes Farming, and Lee and Sons Farms were contractually obligated to provide kitchen access to workers. However, over the course of four years beginning in 2019, employers allegedly blocked H-2A workers from accessing cooking spaces and instead charged them as much as $160 a week under a forced meal plan. According to the complaint, meals were reportedly only provided twice a day Monday through Saturday. The meager breakfast consisted of coffee and slices of bread. In another example, workers arrived at a labor camp after a long day of work only to \u201cfind their dinners left out for them, cold and covered in flies\u201d. Nothing voluntary about it Some forced meal plans are also unlawful because they charge workers prices that far exceed the daily cost allowed by DoL. The most expensive forced meal plan that attorney Aaron Jacobson has ever encountered was around $150 to $200 a week, almost half of workers\u2019 paychecks. Jacobson is a supervising attorney with Lanc\u2019s farmworker unit, where he has litigated cases related to forced meal plans going back to 2018. He noted that nothing about these forced meal plans is \u201coptional\u201d or \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Workers have to pay for the meal plan even if they don\u2019t eat the food \u2013 and it\u2019s often a hard violation to prove because most employers know better than to leave a paper trail. Jacobson says that typically, when H-2A workers are taken to cash their checks, their employers then immediately demand a kickback: cash for the plan. Ryland has represented workers in more extreme cases. In one, an employer told workers that they would have to pay a fee if they wanted to leave their labor camp, and the employer also locked them out of the labor camp kitchen and threatened to shoot workers who fled without first paying their debts. The workers who remained were forced to pay exorbitant amounts for meager, poor-quality food. Unable to go to the grocery store or use the labor camp kitchen, hungry farmworkers built a makeshift grill with cinder blocks and an oven rack to grill fish they caught in a nearby swamp. These conditions aren\u2019t as uncommon as you\u2019d think, said Leticia Zavala, a former farm worker who now organizes North Carolina H-2A workers with the worker-led organization El Futuro Es Nuestro. Workers often report barred kitchens and chained refrigerators, she said. Zavala\u2019s outreach efforts put her in touch with Felipe, who\u2019s worked in the H-2A program for nine years. He\u2019s also using a pseudonym due to a well-founded fear of retaliation. In his experience, refusal to comply with a forced meal plan often comes with intimidation \u2013 or worse. \u201cA few years ago, nine of us [workers] refused to sign the forced meal plan contract,\u201d Felipe said. \u201cThe manager told us: \u2018You\u2019re no longer working here. Get your stuff ready because the [NCGA] is going to pick you up.\u2019\u201d With Zavala\u2019s help, Felipe and other workers were transferred to another farm. The incident occurred in 2020, when DoL\u2019s current maximum daily charge for a meal plan was $12.67. In their complaint, Felipe and his co-workers noted they were paying up to $20.85 a day, which included out-of-pocket costs for food on Sundays when their employer didn\u2019t provide meals. Felipe says all he wants is \u201cdignified food\u201d, something that\u2019s been hard to come by in the US.

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, Tim Winton walked on stage at the Perth festival and delivered a blistering closing address that was, as he puts it now, \u201ca bit like dropping a turd in the pool\u201d.

How about tobacco sponsoring ventilators for lung patients?\u201d As he pointed out, even banks and superfunds were divesting from fossil fuels: \u201cSo how is it that the arts community should show less creativity and moral imagination than bankers?\u201d</p>    <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what they thought they\u2019d come to hear,\u201d the 64-year-old says now. \u201cBut if that wasn\u2019t the moment for me, then there was no moment.\u201d He wasn\u2019t concerned about pissing off fossil fuel executives or festival directors; he was thinking about his newest grandson, born just weeks before, and the world he was going to inherit. \u201cI thought, if I can measure a certain level of progress in his lifetime, we\u2019ll have managed to pick some tentacles off. The arts is suffering from the same sense of occupation that we\u2019re all trying to unshackle ourselves from. We\u2019re all trying to get unfucked.\u201d</p> <p>What no one in that room knew, even some people very close to him, was that Winton was writing a novel about how future generations could react if they knew climate change was the result of choices we made now. And now, after seven years, spent research and writing and agonising, Juice is finally out.</p> <p>\u201cA novelist could spend an extra 10 years trying to come to terms with climate change, but I don\u2019t think we have that time,\u201d he says. Writing Juice \u201cwas a strange experience\u201d, he says, rubbing his big hands over his face. He looks haunted. \u201cI wonder if I\u2019ll ever recover from it.\u201d</p> <p>Juice follows an unnamed narrator in a future Australia that has been devastated by climate change: \u201cWinters were hot. The summers lethal \u2026 locals were hardy and adaptable, but it was rare to see people of a great age. And for reasons nobody seemed to understand or discuss, the number of births had begun to wane.\u201d Hardy survivors barely get by in constant dust storms, cyclones, fires and locust plagues, spending months of every year sheltering underground.</p> <p>The narrator is recruited by the Service, a secretive activist group, which lets him in on the truth: Earth\u2019s conditions were not inevitable, but the result of decisions made by his ancestors. \u201cTo be told that my trials were not random accidents but deliberate acts undertaken with the knowledge of their consequences? \u2026 It was infuriating to the point of derangement. It was impossible to imagine that humans had knowingly let this happen.\u201d</p> <p>Winton is well-known for his environmental activism: he has donated thousands in prize money to protect Ningaloo reef; written articles to raise awareness of whaling, the Great Barrier Reef and shark protection; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/06/fish-called-tim-winton-scientists-name-new-species-after-australia-novelist\">scientists even named a fish after him</a> to honour his championing of conservation in the Kimberley. Last year he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for \u201cdistinguished service to literature and to environmental advocacy\u201d.</p>    <p>But even he didn\u2019t really want to write a novel about climate change. \u201cCan anybody pick a subject that\u2019s more likely to turn people off, or make people roll their eyes? It is a big, abstract, wicked problem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a novel can solidify amorphous things in strange ways that I don\u2019t really understand, even after 40 years of being in the caper.\u201d</p> <p>He did not tell anyone about Juice for years because he was worried someone would warn him against it. \u201cI fessed up when it was done,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my American publishers won\u2019t publish it. That could be because I\u2019m a bad bet. I\u2019d hate to think it was because they were too afraid.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only thing that\u2019s likely to save us as a species is solidarity</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Winton</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Surely you can do anything when you\u2019re Tim Winton, I say, and he snorts. \u201cYou say that like its a good thing!\u201d he says. \u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve been doing it for 40 years, it doesn\u2019t mean you can do it this morning.

On the day we speak, a new report warns that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/09/almost-68-of-australias-tourism-sites-at-major-risk-if-climate-crisis-continues-report-says\">almost 68% of Australia\u2019s tourism sites will be at major risk by 2050 if the climate crisis continues</a>. \u201c2050 used to sound far away,\u201d Winton says. \u201cMy grandkids will be at uni then.\u201d</p> <p>Winton now has six grandchildren. Much of the grief he has felt while researching the science of climate change has been imagining their future.

Most of our political leaders and corporate leaders were born in the 60s. So in that sense, this is already real. The world has already changed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In some ways, it changed for the better: both of Winton\u2019s parents left school in their mid-teens, and his grandparents at 11 or 12. He was the first in his family to attend university; he got to live overseas; built a career in the arts. \u201cMy life is radically different to theirs, in a good way. But when I look into my grandchildren\u2019s faces, I can\u2019t tell myself that,\u201d Winton says. \u201cThat\u2019s deeply haunting. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I wrote this book and lived in the worst possible space for seven years. It knocks some paint off you, I can tell you.\u201d</p> <p>He has seen first-hand how his part of the world has changed (\u201cI know what it feels like in 50 degrees\u201d), but spending years looking at scientists\u2019 models changed him. \u201cWe\u2019re on a razor\u2019s edge,\u201d he says. \u201cThe consequences of our decisions now will be the biggest in our species\u2019 history. Can you imagine a generation of people who could, by the way that they act over less than a decade, have such a profound consequence for those who come after?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that gravity every day. To feel that our legacy might be one of shame is \u2013 well, it concentrates the mind,\u201d he says, and laughs that sad laugh again.</p> <p>***</p>    <p>Winton\u2019s world is contained in interesting ways. His wife Denise was a childhood friend; he first asked her to marry him when he was nine. Where he lives in WA is \u201c1,000 miles away from the nearest bookshop\u201d. He adores cinema but hasn\u2019t trekked out to the movies in five years.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, Tim Winton walked on stage at the Perth festival and delivered a blistering closing address that was, as he puts it now, \u201ca bit like dropping a turd in the pool\u201d. Perhaps some in the room had expected the Australian literary giant, Western Australia\u2019s homegrown hero, to say something pretty and benign about the arts. Instead, Winton tore into fossil fuel giants Woodside and Chevron \u2013 both at that time long-term sponsors of Perth festival \u2013 with his plain-speaking, moral directness that comes through so clearly on the page. That fossil fuel companies would \u2013 and could \u2013 sponsor cultural festivals even as they staged works about the climate crisis, was \u201creally embarrassing\u201d. He told the room: \u201cFor, who else in the corporate world, sailing so close to reputational oblivion, could feel that safe and so confident? You reckon a brewery would put itself forward for a show about foetal alcohol syndrome? How about tobacco sponsoring ventilators for lung patients?\u201d As he pointed out, even banks and superfunds were divesting from fossil fuels: \u201cSo how is it that the arts community should show less creativity and moral imagination than bankers?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what they thought they\u2019d come to hear,\u201d the 64-year-old says now. \u201cBut if that wasn\u2019t the moment for me, then there was no moment.\u201d He wasn\u2019t concerned about pissing off fossil fuel executives or festival directors; he was thinking about his newest grandson, born just weeks before, and the world he was going to inherit. \u201cI thought, if I can measure a certain level of progress in his lifetime, we\u2019ll have managed to pick some tentacles off.

      "bodyText": "Late-night hosts recap the first vice-presidential debate and Donald Trump tossing boxes of chicken tenders at an SEC college football game. Jimmy Kimmel Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate in New York was between \u201ctwo men who couldn\u2019t be much more different\u201d, said Jimmy Kimmel. \u201cOne of them called Donald Trump a reprehensible idiot who shouldn\u2019t be president, the other is Tim Walz.\u201d Both Walz and JD Vance \u201cstuck to the issues, they showed each other a lot of respect\u201d, Kimmel continued. \u201cIt was, uh, very boring. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I like these better with Trump, I really do,\u201d he said. Watching a vice-presidential debate is \u201clike taking your kids apple picking\u201d, he noted. \u201cAbout halfway through you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this sounded like it was going to be fun, but what\u2019s the point?\u2019 \u201cIt was weird to see Tim Walz being so serious,\u201d he said. \u201cI kept waiting for him to reach down behind his podium and come up with a corndog and a baby pig.\u201d Vance, meanwhile, elicited some faux-sympathy from Kimmel. \u201cYou kind of feel sympathy for JD Vance, having to defend Donald Trump, who he himself openly denounced. It\u2019s kind of like being Diddy\u2019s defense attorney.\u201d Still, \u201cboth candidates were pretty darn polite to each other\u201d, said Kimmel before a montage of the two candidates declaring they \u201cagree\u201d with one another. \u201cTrump is not going to like that at all,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, JD.\u201d Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert branded the debate \u201cHillbilly Elegy v Minnesota nice.\u201d Vance looked like \u201ca business lemur on beta blockers\u201d, while Walz \u201clooked like the old likable coach, but appeared to be way over-caffeinated\u201d, he said. \u201cI think the governor done overdid doin\u2019 the Dew.\u201d During the debate, Vance tried to claim that the Trump administration was one of the most peaceful times in America. \u201cA peaceful time! Free of any major conflict, as we all remember from the January 6 puppy pile,\u201d Colbert deadpanned. Vance also \u201ctried to pretend that January 6 was no biggie\u201d. Said the Ohio senator: \u201cIt\u2019s really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over on January the 20, as we have done for 250 years in this country.\u201d \u201cYeah, after his coup failed!\u201d Colbert interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s like a toddler saying, \u2018I went to bed peacefully at 8pm, and I think that it\u2019s time we stop focusing on the 45 minutes I spent screaming and biting the babysitter because I wanted more bubbles.\u2019\u201d Vance also tried to spin the \u201creal family separation policy\u201d and \u201cKamala Harris\u2019s wide open southern border\u201d. \u201cNice try,\u201d said Colbert, imitating the logic: \u201cThe real cheating on his wife with a porn star is Kamala Harris\u2019s immigration policy. Tragically, her southern border is the one with the mushroom penis.\u201d Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers noted that the vice-presidential debate did not feature a live audience, \u201cwhich, because of his rallies, gives Vance home court advantage\u201d. Trump attended the University of Georgia v the University of Alabama college football game over the weekend. Appealing to students, he tossed boxes of chicken tenders into the crowd while they chanted \u201cUSA!\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich is the easiest way to describe this country to someone who\u2019s never been here\u201d, Meyers laughed. Trump sat in a box with the golfer John Daly and the musician Kid Rock. \u201cApparently, you get to see a game with the president if you collect 1bn Marlboro miles,\u201d Meyers joked. The group reportedly had Domino\u2019s pizza and McDonalds delivered for the game. \u201cThank God nobody lit a match,\u201d Meyers quipped. \u201cI feel bad for the cleaning crew the next morning. Remember in middle school when it was your turn to rinse out the terrarium and you got hit with that turtle funk? Imagine that times John Daly and Kid Rock.\u201d",

But it did finally get published in 1966: a love letter to the drinking dens, illegal gambling houses and strip joints that made the London area so iconic. The book has now been republished with a foreword by writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barrymiles\">Barry Miles</a> in which he calls it \u201ca snapshot of a wonderful place at a certain time, now separated from us for ever by the vault of time\u201d.</p> <p>But is the true spirit of Soho \u2013 forged from that bustling mix of immigrants, artists and down\u2019n\u2019outs \u2013 really gone for ever?

I set out with Joe Daniel, Norman\u2019s grandson <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/findingfranknorman\">and the force behind the book\u2019s reissue</a>, to retrace his grandfather\u2019s steps \u2013 and find the \u201creal\u201d Soho.</p>    <p>It probably all started to go wrong with the breakfast negronis.

In the book, Norman dismisses pretty much every pub besides <strong>The French House </strong>(49 Dean Street), so that is our next port of call. Previously called the York Minster but known colloquially as \u201cthe French\u201d due to its original proprietor Monsieur Victor Berlemont (whose moustache was said to be a full foot long), this is a watering hole of legend. General de Gaulle enjoyed aperitifs here during the second world war, Dylan Thomas mislaid his only copy of Under Milk Wood here after one too many (thankfully the landlord saved it), and \u2013 according to Norman at least \u2013 even the local vicar used to pop in for a swift half while hymns were being sung.</p>    <p>\u201cOne of its greatest assets is that it\u2019s almost impossible to get barred,\u201d wrote Norman, and even if you did end up being turfed out for being unruly, \u201cthe following lunch time you were allowed back in again without a word being said about the activities of the night before\u201d.</p> <p>We fail to test that theory but do enjoy a midday pastis (a mix of Ricard and water known as \u201cthe milk of Marseille\u201d) surrounded by the old photographs and artworks that line the walls. After a swift Guinness at another fine (and old) pub, <strong>The Blue Posts</strong> (22 Berwick Street), we amble around. Soho is where <strong>Mozart</strong> once lived (20 Frith Street), <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/19/stage\">the Magic Circle</a></strong> first formed (17 Wardour Street) and <strong>John Logie Baird</strong> first demonstrated television (22 Frith Street).</p> <p>It is also the home of <strong>Foyles</strong> (107 Charing Cross Road), the giant bookstore that, after opening in 1929, became a hangout for the 1930s literary set. Edith Sitwell, No\u00ebl Coward and even Walt Disney browsed the miles of shelves here (or at least at its former location next door). Norman notes in his book how back in his day the store was a renowned \u201cpassing\u201d place: \u201cPound notes are occasionally found between the pages of books, and one was discovered to have a revolver-shaped hole cut in it.\u201d</p>    <p>One of the most legendary institutions of old Soho was the restaurant Wheeler\u2019s, where artists such as Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach (with of course Norman himself) would gather to cure their hangovers with oysters. Taking advantage of the fact that the shellfish were not rationed during the war, Wheeler\u2019s grew from a first-floor sorting house to a thriving multi-storey restaurant shucking 2,000 mouthwatering molluscs each day.</p>    <p>The Soho branch is sadly no more, so we visit <strong>The Seafood Bar</strong> (77 Dean Street), where a 3-5pm happy hour lets you devour them for \u00a31.50 a piece. We wash 12 down with chablis, and are then offered another platter from the next table who\u2019ve over-ordered. It\u2019s not a bad way to while away an afternoon. \u201cI guess this is how my granddad lived,\u201d says Joe. \u201cHe\u2019d do this sort of thing every day.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Le Beaujolais</strong> (25 Litchfield St) may be outside what we consider Soho boundaries, but Barry Miles \u2013 who knows more than a thing or two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/10/london-calling-history-barry-miles\">about London\u2019s counterculture</a> \u2013 has recommended it and assures Joe that old school Soho hands would consider it perfectly legit. A couple more glasses of pinot noir are ordered, at which point things start to get a little bit blurry.</p> <p>You can see how Soho might lead you astray. Norman was a fresh-faced 16-year-old when he arrived in the area. Before leaving school, his headmaster had warned him that drink, gambling and loose women could ruin a man. \u201cBut what he did not tell me,\u201d writes Norman, \u201cis that the best place in the world to find these things is Soho. That I found out for myself.\u201d</p>    <p>His prospects after leaving school were not good. Norman had grown up in various Dr Barnardo\u2019s homes after being given up for adoption at the age of three (he wrote about this in his 1969 memoir Banana Boy). Despite a brutal early life and a lack of academic success, his experiences living as a bum in Soho, and the friendships he struck up with authors and artists, provided him with a wealth of raw material for what became a series of celebrated memoirs.</p> <p>Bang to Rights, his 1958 account of life behind bars (he served three years for petty crimes), was championed by Raymond Chandler, and was swiftly followed by the hit musical Fings Ain\u2019t Wot They Used t\u2019Be. Norman\u2019s affectionate eye for the seedier side of life is present in Soho Night &amp; Day, not least when he mentions gambling.</p> <p>Betting shops weren\u2019t even legal when he was a teen but what went on in the schpielers was notorious \u2013 he includes tales of reckless Greek immigrants who would gamble away their homes. Could we be about to turn similarly reckless by stepping into <strong>Coral</strong> (1-3 Newport Place)? The regulars glance up at these strange besuited men trying to get their heads around a betting slip. I stick a tenner on Love Billy Boy at Ascot while Joe plumps for Smart Vision. Four minutes later, we are back on the streets and \u00a320 down.</p>    <p>Your money is better spent in one of Soho\u2019s many eateries, of which a couple mentioned in Norman\u2019s book \u2013 Quo Vadis and L\u2019Escargot \u2013 remain. We are reliably informed that, for the intimate vibe of old Soho, <strong>Andrew Edmunds</strong> (46 Lexington St) is the place to be, with its handwritten menus, cramped tables and simple-yet-spectacular food. Eating there feels like time-travelling to another more romantic and more artistic era. A rump of lamb, dressed crab and some Ch\u00e2teau Montus later and we are back outside, where the heavens have opened. My umbrella has been lost, so we wander the streets in search of it.</p> <p>There is no doubt Soho has cleaned up its act. We are not \u201checkled by a prostitute from a top floor window\u201d, as was common in Norman\u2019s day when multiple sex clubs lurked on every street and it was \u201cas easy to have a woman as it was to buy a loaf of fresh French bread\u201d. But we do meet the proprietor of an X-rated outlet who bemoans the fact that, after the pandemic, you can no longer attend a live show in the area. We descend the stairs to see what he offers instead: a bleak and empty room full of coin-operated booths in which you can sit and watch videos. \u201cFancy a go?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s hardcore stuff.\u201d We politely decline.</p> <p>So much of old Soho has gone, from Madame Floris\u2019s bakery to the Italian deli King Bomba; from strip clubs like Casino de Paris to restaurants like Moulin D\u2019Or and Trattoria Terrazza. With that, of course, goes some of the atmosphere. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/25/the-slow-death-of-soho-farewell-to-londons-sleazy-heartland\">mourning Soho</a> is also a very Soho thing to do. Norman, in his book, frequently complains that the Soho of his misspent youth is no more. Sometimes the changes are positive; often they make you wince. The fresh produce available at the once buzzing Berwick Street market has now been replaced by food trucks. The Highlander pub now serves Pieminster pies. Earlier this year, the deli I Camisa &amp; Son was shuttered. (Of the old school delis, only the delightful Lina Stores on Brewer Street remains.)</p> <p>Search around, however, and you can still find traces of the old world. The original 1966 book launch for Soho Night &amp; Day was at the famous members\u2019 club the Colony Room, whose success was down to the club\u2019s inimitable host Muriel Belcher. She had the visionary idea to let Francis Bacon drink there for free in return for him bringing in interesting clientele. Fond of calling people \u201ccunty\u201d as a term of endearment, Muriel presided over a room of \u201cevery social stratum one could possibly imagine: stockbrokers, layabouts, advertising men\u201d, while proudly proclaiming her motto: \u201cRush up, spend up, drink up, fuck off.\u201d</p>    <p>Belcher died in 1979 and the club \u2013 which had entertained the likes of William Burroughs, Princess Margaret, Henri Cartier-Bresson and the YBAs \u2013 closed in 2008. Yet earlier this year it reopened as <strong>The Colony Room Green</strong> (4 Heddon Street) which, in a neat case of history repeating, is where the launch for the republished Soho Night &amp; Day is happening. The room is absolutely packed with characters when we arrive. I spot artist Jeremy Deller holding court, a Klaxon loitering near the back and a woman behind me at the bar yelling: \u201cI\u2019m the granddaughter of Jeffrey Bernard! What does it take to get a drink in here? I said I\u2019m the <em>granddaughter of Jeffrey Bernard!</em>\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/sep/13/from-francis-bacon-to-tracey-emin-soho-historic-colony-room-club-in-pictures\">From Francis Bacon to Tracey Emin: Soho\u2019s historic Colony Room Club \u2013  in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSoho is a roundabout, which sometimes spins around so fast that it is impossible to jump off,\u201d writes Norman towards the end of his book. \u201cSome people can keep their balance no matter how fast it goes around, whilst others become giddy, lose their balance and hit rock bottom, together with their wives, children and self-respect.\u201d</p> <p>Neither myself nor Joe have quite gone that far \u2013 nor have we plunged our hands into piranha tanks or gambled away the family home.

A couple more glasses of pinot noir are ordered, at which point things start to get a little bit blurry. You can see how Soho might lead you astray. Norman was a fresh-faced 16-year-old when he arrived in the area. Before leaving school, his headmaster had warned him that drink, gambling and loose women could ruin a man. \u201cBut what he did not tell me,\u201d writes Norman, \u201cis that the best place in the world to find these things is Soho. That I found out for myself.\u201d His prospects after leaving school were not good. Norman had grown up in various Dr Barnardo\u2019s homes after being given up for adoption at the age of three (he wrote about this in his 1969 memoir Banana Boy). Despite a brutal early life and a lack of academic success, his experiences living as a bum in Soho, and the friendships he struck up with authors and artists, provided him with a wealth of raw material for what became a series of celebrated memoirs. Bang to Rights, his 1958 account of life behind bars (he served three years for petty crimes), was championed by Raymond Chandler, and was swiftly followed by the hit musical Fings Ain\u2019t Wot They Used t\u2019Be. Norman\u2019s affectionate eye for the seedier side of life is present in Soho Night &amp; Day, not least when he mentions gambling. Betting shops weren\u2019t even legal when he was a teen but what went on in the schpielers was notorious \u2013 he includes tales of reckless Greek immigrants who would gamble away their homes. Could we be about to turn similarly reckless by stepping into Coral (1-3 Newport Place)? The regulars glance up at these strange besuited men trying to get their heads around a betting slip. I stick a tenner on Love Billy Boy at Ascot while Joe plumps for Smart Vision. Four minutes later, we are back on the streets and \u00a320 down. Your money is better spent in one of Soho\u2019s many eateries, of which a couple mentioned in Norman\u2019s book \u2013 Quo Vadis and L\u2019Escargot \u2013 remain. We are reliably informed that, for the intimate vibe of old Soho, Andrew Edmunds (46 Lexington St) is the place to be, with its handwritten menus, cramped tables and simple-yet-spectacular food. Eating there feels like time-travelling to another more romantic and more artistic era. A rump of lamb, dressed crab and some Ch\u00e2teau Montus later and we are back outside, where the heavens have opened. My umbrella has been lost, so we wander the streets in search of it. There is no doubt Soho has cleaned up its act. We are not \u201checkled by a prostitute from a top floor window\u201d, as was common in Norman\u2019s day when multiple sex clubs lurked on every street and it was \u201cas easy to have a woman as it was to buy a loaf of fresh French bread\u201d. But we do meet the proprietor of an X-rated outlet who bemoans the fact that, after the pandemic, you can no longer attend a live show in the area. We descend the stairs to see what he offers instead: a bleak and empty room full of coin-operated booths in which you can sit and watch videos. \u201cFancy a go?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s hardcore stuff.\u201d We politely decline. So much of old Soho has gone, from Madame Floris\u2019s bakery to the Italian deli King Bomba; from strip clubs like Casino de Paris to restaurants like Moulin D\u2019Or and Trattoria Terrazza. With that, of course, goes some of the atmosphere. But mourning Soho is also a very Soho thing to do. Norman, in his book, frequently complains that the Soho of his misspent youth is no more. Sometimes the changes are positive; often they make you wince. The fresh produce available at the once buzzing Berwick Street market has now been replaced by food trucks. The Highlander pub now serves Pieminster pies. Earlier this year, the deli I Camisa &amp; Son was shuttered. (Of the old school delis, only the delightful Lina Stores on Brewer Street remains.) Search around, however, and you can still find traces of the old world. The original 1966 book launch for Soho Night &amp; Day was at the famous members\u2019 club the Colony Room, whose success was down to the club\u2019s inimitable host Muriel Belcher. She had the visionary idea to let Francis Bacon drink there for free in return for him bringing in interesting clientele. Fond of calling people \u201ccunty\u201d as a term of endearment, Muriel presided over a room of \u201cevery social stratum one could possibly imagine: stockbrokers, layabouts, advertising men\u201d, while proudly proclaiming her motto: \u201cRush up, spend up, drink up, fuck off.\u201d Belcher died in 1979 and the club \u2013 which had entertained the likes of William Burroughs, Princess Margaret, Henri Cartier-Bresson and the YBAs \u2013 closed in 2008. Yet earlier this year it reopened as The Colony Room Green (4 Heddon Street) which, in a neat case of history repeating, is where the launch for the republished Soho Night &amp; Day is happening. The room is absolutely packed with characters when we arrive. I spot artist Jeremy Deller holding court, a Klaxon loitering near the back and a woman behind me at the bar yelling: \u201cI\u2019m the granddaughter of Jeffrey Bernard! What does it take to get a drink in here? I said I\u2019m the granddaughter of Jeffrey Bernard!\u201d \u201cSoho is a roundabout, which sometimes spins around so fast that it is impossible to jump off,\u201d writes Norman towards the end of his book. \u201cSome people can keep their balance no matter how fast it goes around, whilst others become giddy, lose their balance and hit rock bottom, together with their wives, children and self-respect.\u201d Neither myself nor Joe have quite gone that far \u2013 nor have we plunged our hands into piranha tanks or gambled away the family home. But we have done something we weren\u2019t sure was possible \u2013 spent a full 12 hours in the boozy embrace of old Soho. \u2022 Soho Night &amp; Day is out via ACC Art Books with an exhibition at Colony Room Green, London until 18 October",

      "bodyText": "Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida\u2019s Gulf coast on Thursday night with winds above 140mph (225km/h) and a 15ft (4.5m) storm surge. The storm caused deadly flooding as it dumped almost unprecedented amounts of rain through Georgia and the Carolinas, to Tennessee, Virginia and Kentucky. Dozens were killed, communities wrecked or changed forever, and early estimates by insurance experts calculate losses at up to $160bn. Before unleashing its full fury on the continental US, Helene, the eighth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, spent several days building up strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Here is the timeline of one of the most deadly and costly hurricanes in recent memory: Monday 23 September The National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami warned that a broad area of pressure over the north-western Caribbean Sea, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms, had \u201ca high chance\u201d of tropical development over the following two days. It posted tropical storm warnings for western Cuba and Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, while noting the motion of the developing weather system was uncertain. Tuesday 24 September After being classified as a tropical storm, Helen\u2019s forecast track began to come into focus. An NHC advisory projected it \u201caccelerating toward the north-eastern Gulf coast through Thursday\u201d after causing heavy rain, considerable flooding and mudslides across western Cuba overnight. Anticipating a severe impact, Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s governor, expanded an existing emergency order to 61 of his state\u2019s 67 counties, while Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s governor, did the same for all 159 of his. Wednesday 25 September Helene, upgraded during the morning to a category 1 hurricane, dumped substantial quantities of rain over the Mexican province of Quintana Roo, churning up beaches and flooding hotel rooms in the popular tourist towns of Cozumel and Canc\u00fan. After sideswiping the Yucat\u00e1n coast, Helene made a turn north, with the NHC stating it was \u201cexpected to rapidly intensify and grow in size over the eastern Gulf of Mexico\u201d. Hurricane warnings were posted for Florida\u2019s Big Bend, along with the first alerts for flash and urban flooding across much of the south-eastern US as far as the southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley. Thursday 26 September Fueled by the ultra-warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Helene bulked up at a rapid pace through the day into a category 4 hurricane, with winds above 130mph, as it closed in on landfall on Florida\u2019s Gulf coast. The NHC said the storm surge and wind combination would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d, and warned the storm\u2019s sheer size meant life-threatening conditions would penetrate far inland. Helene made landfall at Keaton Beach, Florida, at 11.10pm. Friday 27 September Residents along the Gulf coast awoke, if they were able to sleep, to scenes of devastation and destruction, with entire coastal communities swept away by the storm surge and countless buildings blown apart. First responders conducted thousands of water rescues in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and large areas of metropolitan Atlanta were flooded. Although downgraded again to a tropical storm, the center of Helene continued to cause havoc as it passed from Georgia into the Carolinas. More than 50 patients and staff were airlifted from the roof of a flooded hospital in Erwin, Tennessee. Saturday 28 September The scale of the emergency in North Carolina began to emerge, with authorities declaring that all roads in the west of the state could be considered closed due to flooding, damage, debris and fallen trees and power lines. The town of Asheville was largely underwater and cut off, with a local sheriff, Quentin Miller, declaring: \u201cTo say this caught us off-guard would be an understatement.\u201d The NHC issued its final bulletin on the now dissipated storm but warned widespread and significant river flooding was still ongoing across the southern Appalachians, and lengthy power outages were expected.",

Hard to believe, after weeks of nonsense and four days of the Fearless Four saying the same thing minute after minute, that we\u2019ve still got a month of the Tory leadership election to go. I guess we just need to be thankful for small mercies: we may not be at the beginning of the end, but we are at the end of the beginning.</p> <p>God it\u2019s been one hell of a slog. People have died, long service medals have been won and my therapy bills have gone through the roof. Spare a thought for those who have had to listen to all this doggybollox.</p> <p>It is an election that is at best inconsequential and at worst an irrelevance. At a time when the Middle East is about to enter another full-scale war, the Tory party has chosen to take indefinite leave of absence to talk about itself. And it\u2019s not even as if the conversation has been honest. That is still a step too far.</p> <p>But at least the Tory conference is over for another year. Though this one ended in the most painful way possible, with each of the four contenders giving what was billed as a 20-minute leader\u2019s speech. Only they all overran hideously. As if we haven\u2019t suffered enough. What is it with so many politicians that they have no idea how to stop once they have started talking. All blessed with a total inability to read the room. TLDL. Too Long, Didn\u2019t Listen.</p> <p>A far more entertaining format would have been a cage fight. Or tag-team mud wrestling. That\u2019s something some of us could have stayed awake for.</p> <p>Though I guess there would have only ever have been one winner. Kemi Badenoch. She would have just pulled out an AK-47 and gunned down the other three. Before turning the weapon on herself. There\u2019s nothing KemiKaze likes more than sudden death.</p> <p>Proceedings began with the Tory party chair, Richard Fuller, handing over a bell \u2013 me neither \u2013 to somebody no one could identify, while Michael Gove and George Osborne looked on disinterestedly from the press seats. Even they don\u2019t give a toss about the Tories any more.</p> <p>Then came the shadow chief whip, Stuart Andrew, to make a few cracks about Keir Starmer taking Taylor Swift freebies. He forgot to mention that he took Kylie Minogue freebies not so long ago. Maybe he\u2019s just pissed off with his own lack of ambition.</p> <p>Tom Tugendhat went first, needing a real barnstormer to move the dial on his chances. He didn\u2019t really deliver. Although he did the entire routine without an Autocue, he still managed to sound as if some of what he was saying came as a surprise to him. Go figure. For the most part he just rambled somewhat, switching from platitude to platitude with no real insight into why the Tories were humiliated at the last election.</p> <p>He did mention that he had been in the army. Of course he did. Though he promised not to kill us. He also rather glossed over why he had supported Liz Truss in 2022 \u2013 the Trusster is the Tories\u2019 guilty secret \u2013 and ignored Partygate. There again, they all did. When the history of the last five years comes to be written, the Fearless Four are going to be astonished to find themselves front and centre of it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never failed in a mission yet,\u201d said Tom. Hostage to fortune. He might just find there\u2019s always a first time. Make that a second time. His 2022 leadership bid also came to nothing. \u201cI get it. You\u2019ve had enough,\u201d he declared. Then carried on. Either that\u2019s sublime comic timing or a lack of awareness. You decide.</p> <p>Next up was James Cleverly. Everyone\u2019s natural fourth-in-command. A born follower. Still, at least Jimmy Dimly knows how to turn his weaknesses into strengths. He still hasn\u2019t quite worked out how to use an Autocue and kept slowing down to give it a chance to keep up. At times he sounded like someone edging close to some gravitas. Mostly though he sounded just like David Brent. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose and I don\u2019t lose,\u201d he announced, clearly thrilled with what he had said. He didn\u2019t mind that it could have been lifted straight from The Office.</p> <p>There were other moments of weirdness. Praising ticket gougers and claiming Labour had lied to the country. Er, guys. That was you. Jimmy D rambled on and on in a death match with the Autocue, daring people to stay conscious. But the hall loved him. The clear winner. Maybe because he was the only one who sounded vaguely normal. You wouldn\u2019t believe how low the bar is in this particular contest.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick was true to himself. High on Ozempic and thoroughly dislikable. Almost as if he really doesn\u2019t want to become leader. \u201cYou know how I loathe empty rhetoric,\u201d he said. Before giving a speech grounded in 30 minutes of empty rhetoric. I will miss him if he doesn\u2019t get the job. He makes my job so much easier.</p> <p>\u201cI am in politics for the little people,\u201d Honest Bob continued. Conveniently forgetting to mention the \u00a340m favour he had done as housing minister for the Tory pornographer Dirty Des. He also promised an end to \u201cmore managed decline\u201d. Nice of him to admit that was the Tory legacy.</p> <p>After pandering to a few more easy prejudices, he wondered why there were no teachers, doctors and nurses in the hall. Er \u2026 that was because they were at the Labour conference last week. Ozempic Bob had weeks to write this speech and this was the best he could come up with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/02/bad-jokes-war-stories-and-rehashed-rhetoric-key-takeaways-from-the-tory-leadership-speeches\">Bad jokes, war stories and rehashed rhetoric: key takeaways from the Tory leadership speeches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last up was Kemi Badenoch, ready to renew her abusive relationship with the Conservatives. Here were the rules. She gets to treat them like trash and in return they give their undying loyalty. As ever her speech was a long list of grievances with no effort to understand why the country now loathes her party. She thinks the Tories lost the election because of a slavish devotion to net zero.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like a fight,\u201d she lied. She loves one. And she was ready to take on all comers. It was the weirdest leadership pitch yet. One based entirely on a culture war. She was going to make the 2030s great.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t explain why the Tories hadn\u2019t made the 2010s or the 2020s great while they had the chance. All that mattered was that people who were nice to each other, who treated one another with respect, should know that their days were numbered. And she\u2019d be starting by imprisoning 50,000 civil servants.</p> <p>Was this it? Was this really it? Had we waited four days for this? The audience was screaming to be let out.

Everyone\u2019s natural fourth-in-command. A born follower. Still, at least Jimmy Dimly knows how to turn his weaknesses into strengths. He still hasn\u2019t quite worked out how to use an Autocue and kept slowing down to give it a chance to keep up. At times he sounded like someone edging close to some gravitas. Mostly though he sounded just like David Brent. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to lose and I don\u2019t lose,\u201d he announced, clearly thrilled with what he had said. He didn\u2019t mind that it could have been lifted straight from The Office. There were other moments of weirdness. Praising ticket gougers and claiming Labour had lied to the country. Er, guys. That was you. Jimmy D rambled on and on in a death match with the Autocue, daring people to stay conscious. But the hall loved him. The clear winner. Maybe because he was the only one who sounded vaguely normal. You wouldn\u2019t believe how low the bar is in this particular contest. Robert Jenrick was true to himself. High on Ozempic and thoroughly dislikable. Almost as if he really doesn\u2019t want to become leader. \u201cYou know how I loathe empty rhetoric,\u201d he said. Before giving a speech grounded in 30 minutes of empty rhetoric. I will miss him if he doesn\u2019t get the job. He makes my job so much easier. \u201cI am in politics for the little people,\u201d Honest Bob continued. Conveniently forgetting to mention the \u00a340m favour he had done as housing minister for the Tory pornographer Dirty Des. He also promised an end to \u201cmore managed decline\u201d. Nice of him to admit that was the Tory legacy. After pandering to a few more easy prejudices, he wondered why there were no teachers, doctors and nurses in the hall. Er \u2026 that was because they were at the Labour conference last week. Ozempic Bob had weeks to write this speech and this was the best he could come up with. Last up was Kemi Badenoch, ready to renew her abusive relationship with the Conservatives. Here were the rules. She gets to treat them like trash and in return they give their undying loyalty. As ever her speech was a long list of grievances with no effort to understand why the country now loathes her party. She thinks the Tories lost the election because of a slavish devotion to net zero. \u201cI don\u2019t like a fight,\u201d she lied. She loves one. And she was ready to take on all comers. It was the weirdest leadership pitch yet. One based entirely on a culture war. She was going to make the 2030s great. She couldn\u2019t explain why the Tories hadn\u2019t made the 2010s or the 2020s great while they had the chance. All that mattered was that people who were nice to each other, who treated one another with respect, should know that their days were numbered. And she\u2019d be starting by imprisoning 50,000 civil servants. Was this it? Was this really it? Had we waited four days for this? The audience was screaming to be let out. Half had vanished before the national anthem. What\u2019s wrong with Tories these days? Don\u2019t they love their country? \u2022 A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar On Tuesday 3 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back at a political year like no other, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

      "bodyText": "Simon Case, the head of the civil service, has returned to the Garrick six months after his high-profile departure, and is understood to be among a number of members whose resignations have been withdrawn by the club\u2019s management. Case quit the Garrick in March after the Guardian published the names of about 80 senior politicians, lawyers, leaders of arts organisations and actors who were members of the then men-only club, which until this year was notorious for rejecting proposals to admit women. A club vote in May acknowledged that women could become members, but it has subsequently elected only two women \u2013 the actors Dame Si\u00e2n Phillips and Dame Judi Dench \u2013 to join the 1,500 men listed in its membership booklet. Case announced this week that he would step down from his job as cabinet secretary at the end of the year on health grounds. In his role, he is the leader of half a million civil servants and has been responsible for improving diversity. At the Garrick there appears to be an internal reluctance to speed up the admission of more women in significant numbers despite the change of policy. Only about a dozen women have been nominated as potential future members and the admissions process means it usually takes several years for new people to be approved. An article in the latest edition of the club magazine headlined \u201cNo fast track\u201d, written by the chair of the club\u2019s candidates\u2019 committee, states: \u201cAs the chairman has made clear, there will be no \u2018fast-tracking\u2019 of women members except in exceptional circumstances.\u201d Case was criticised when his membership of the-then all-male club became public knowledge.

The club\u2019s management is understood to have allowed members who resigned in March and April amid publicity over the no women members policy to withdraw their resignations and resume their memberships without needing to go through a lengthy and expensive official rejoining process. One member who resigned amid the controversy over the men-only rules said his resignation was never formally processed because of the speed with which the club moved to clarify that women were in fact allowed to join. Another member who resigned said the club allowed people who had left the club in March and April amid unease about the publicity over the club\u2019s men-only status to \u201cwithdraw their resignations because there hadn\u2019t been time for the regular committee meeting to take place to formally accept them\u201d. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said Case resigned his membership earlier this year as reported at the time, and had previously campaigned within the club for a change of membership rules; the spokesperson was not able to comment on whether Case has subsequently rejoined the club. The MI6 chief, Richard Moore, who resigned at the same time as Case, is understood not to have returned to the club and nor to be intending to rejoin.

They can be used to settle transactions, although in practice adoption has been relatively slow because of technical hurdles and waning interest in cryptocurrency from companies and investors. Their reputation has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/qa-the-collapse-of-terra-and-what-it-could-mean-beyond-crypto\">suffered after notable collapses</a> that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/12/stablecoin-tether-breaks-dollar-peg-cryptocurrencies\">sparked crypto market turmoil</a>.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, Mills said there was a risk that payments could shift \u201caway from central bank money to private settlement assets, weakening financial stability\u201d. She was speaking at Digital Assets Week, a London conference.</p> \n  <p>The Bank this week opened a \u201cdigital securities sandbox\u201d alongside the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates financial services firms, to allow companies to test out trading using blockchain technologies. Mills said the regulators had allowed non-sterling assets to be used in the trial after feedback from companies.</p> \n  <p>Mills said there were risks, but also that digital assets could make payments \u201cfaster, cheaper, and more straightforward\u201d. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While unbacked crypto grabs the headlines, to me developments in the underlying technologies, including blockchains and programmable ledgers, may be what will have the lasting positive impact on supporting financial markets and growth.</p> \n   <p>We have a low-risk appetite for a significant shift away from wholesale settlement in central bank money towards private settlement assets (such as from the use of stablecoins for wholesale transactions), because settlement in central bank money is the anchor back to the state.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-66fd2e7e8f08e3a5b9b3e213\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-02T11:38:46.748Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At lunchtime in western Europe major stock market indeices are mostly in the red, with only the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> up by 0.15%.</p> \n  <p>However, one industry that is doing well today is <strong>weaponry</strong>.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the challenger bank had grown quickly but \u201cmeasures to tackle financial crime did not keep pace with its growth\u201d. Starling, a UK-based online bank founded in 2014 by entrepreneur Anne Boden, grew rapidly, from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023. Banks are required by law to conduct rigorous checks on new customers to prevent fraud and money laundering. Starling said it \u201cregrets and apologises\u201d for its failings, and has paid the fine as full and final settlement. It added that it had rescreened transactions and reviewed its customer accounts in depth, and introduced additional safeguards.

JJ Wall Street stock market indices have dipped at the opening bell in New York, as investors try to work out what will happen next in the Middle East crisis. Here are the opening snaps via Reuters: S&amp;P 500 DOWN 13.44 POINTS, OR 0.24%, AT 5,695.31 NASDAQ DOWN 45.08 POINTS, OR 0.25%, AT 17,865.28 DOW JONES DOWN 23.96 POINTS, OR 0.06%, AT 42,133.01 Tesla has marginally missed expectations for the number of deliveries of electric cars in the third quarter of the year, as carmakers contend with slowing demand around the world. The US electric carmaker delivered 463,000 vehicles in the July-to-September quarter, compared with the 469,000 average expected by analysts polled by London Stock Exchange Group. Tesla shares fell by 4% in pre-market trading. Wall Street on average had expected the Elon Musk-led company to deliver 469,828 vehicles, according to 12 analysts polled by LSEG. The figures mean that Tesla will have to manage 516,000 deliveries in the fourth quarter to match last year\u2019s total of 1.81m, Reuters reported. The EU\u2019s proposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports are likely to pass on Friday, according to Reuters, citing sources who suggest the measure will have enough support to pass a vote on Friday. Reuters reported: France, Greece, Italy and Poland will vote on Friday in support of imposing tariffs of up to 45% on imports of electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, enough to get the European Union proposal passed, in a move likely to increase trade tensions with Beijing, sources said. The tariffs are aimed at countering the alleged state support handed to China\u2019s car manufacturing industry, which has allowed exported vehicles to be sold at cheaper prices than those of global rivals, according to the EU. Stronger-than-expected US jobs numbers would usually suggest that the world\u2019s largest economy is doing better than expected. Reuters reported that US stock market futures narrowed some of the day\u2019s losses ahead of proper trading opening in an hour\u2019s time. The US dollar index also gained ground slightly; a stronger economy could make the Federal Reserve slow the pace of interest rate cuts, which would make dollar-yielding assets marginally more attractive. Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, a trading research company, said: The US ADP data rolled in like a breath of fresh air for the Fed, printing a much stronger reading than anticipated. This news has certainly put a damper on hopes for a ballistic shift in monetary policy. As a result, gold prices have taken a hit, with the dollar index flexing its muscles. All eyes are now on Friday\u2019s developments. Friday will bring the big one: the aforementioned non-farm payrolls data. US hiring accelerated by more than expected in September, with 143,000 jobs created in the private sector according to employment agency ADP. There was a \u201cwidespread rebound after a five-month slowdown\u201d in US job creation, ADP said. The rapid job creation compared with 99,000 new jobs in August, according to ADP\u2019s data. Economists polled by Reuters had expected ADP to report 120,000 new jobs created in September. The ADP numbers are a precursor to the closely followed non-farm payrolls data, which show the pace of job creation in the US economy. The non-farms are vital to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy judgements, as the central bank considers when to cut interest rates. The Bank of England is working on technology to settle blockchain payments using central bank money in order to prevent a shift to private settlement that could undermine financial stablity, according to a senior official. Sasha Mills, executive director of financial market infrastructure for the Bank, said in a speech on Monday that the Bank was acting to link up the traditional financial sector to digital technologies so that payments continue to be made using central bank money rather than through digital assets such as stablecoins. Stablecoins are a form of cryptocurrency designed to hold value and make payments quicker and cheaper by avoiding the need for a trusted middleman. They can be used to settle transactions, although in practice adoption has been relatively slow because of technical hurdles and waning interest in cryptocurrency from companies and investors. Their reputation has also suffered after notable collapses that have sparked crypto market turmoil. Nevertheless, Mills said there was a risk that payments could shift \u201caway from central bank money to private settlement assets, weakening financial stability\u201d. She was speaking at Digital Assets Week, a London conference. The Bank this week opened a \u201cdigital securities sandbox\u201d alongside the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates financial services firms, to allow companies to test out trading using blockchain technologies. Mills said the regulators had allowed non-sterling assets to be used in the trial after feedback from companies. Mills said there were risks, but also that digital assets could make payments \u201cfaster, cheaper, and more straightforward\u201d. She said: While unbacked crypto grabs the headlines, to me developments in the underlying technologies, including blockchains and programmable ledgers, may be what will have the lasting positive impact on supporting financial markets and growth. We have a low-risk appetite for a significant shift away from wholesale settlement in central bank money towards private settlement assets (such as from the use of stablecoins for wholesale transactions), because settlement in central bank money is the anchor back to the state. At lunchtime in western Europe major stock market indeices are mostly in the red, with only the FTSE 100 up by 0.15%. However, one industry that is doing well today is weaponry. Escalating conflict in the Middle East is bad for the world, but likely good for weapons sales. Britain\u2019s BAE Systems was up 2%, Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall was up 2.5%, Italy\u2019s Leonardo gained 4.1%, France\u2019s Thales rose 2.2% and Norway\u2019s Kongsberg rose 3.8%. Howeverk, some other companies whose defence arms are outweighed by larger aerospace operations were trading flat or down on Wednesday, including Airbus, Dassault, Safran and Qinetiq. Post office operators affected by the Horizon IT scandal will not all receive payouts by the March 2025 deadline called for by the campaigner Sir Alan Bates, the postal minister has admitted. Gareth Thomas said it would be difficult to achieve the deadline but promised that there would be \u201csubstantial progress\u201d toward clearing the compensation claim backlog by next summer. Last month, Bates sent a letter to hundreds of former branch owner-operators calling for a March 2025 deadline for financial redress for those affected by the Horizon scandal, in which hundreds of post office operators were wrongly pursued through the courts over account shortfalls that were later linked to a faulty IT system. \u201cI wish I could commit to Sir Alan\u2019s timeframe,\u201d said Thomas, speaking to BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. \u201cI think we will have made substantial progress by next summer.\u201d Starling said in a statement that it accepts the FCA\u2019s findings in full, and apologised. David Sproul, chairman of Starling Bank, said: I would like to apologise for the failings outlined by the FCA and to provide reassurance that we have invested heavily to put things right, including strengthening our board governance and capabilities. We want to assure our customers and employees that these are historic issues. We have learned the lessons of this investigation and are confident that these changes and the strength of our franchise put us in a strong position to continue executing our strategy of safe, sustainable growth, supported by a robust risk management and control framework. Starling opened a bank account for a person under sanctions. A review found that \u201cat least one designated person had opened an account with them\u201d. A report detailing the failings was presented to the board in April 2023, a month before Anne Boden stepped down as chief executive. More details of the oversights from Starling: It said that it screened customers against US, EU and UK sanctions lists, but \u201conly screened its customers against the sanctions records for individuals who were known to reside or have links to the UK\u201d, and failed to check against US sanctions lists at all. A misconfigured system meant that its automatic screening was only checking the names of 39 out of 3,088 people on the UK sanctions list. When the fault was corrected, it created 48,000 alerts for account creation that had not previously been flagged. 796,000 payments were red flagged. The FCA was damning on Starling Bank\u2019s leadership under founder Anne Boden, who left the business in May 2023. \u201cStarling\u2019s senior management as a whole lacked the experience and capability\u201d to introduce controls, the FCA said. \u201cThey lacked the required AML [anti-money laundering] skills or experience.\u201d Starling\u2019s senior management failed to adequately oversee and monitor the day-to-day compliance [\u2026] There were also key failings in the communications between senior management and the staff responsible for the day- to-day implementation. The bank only managed its first month without a high-risk client joining in April 2024. Starling has promised to spend significantly more on financial crime compliance, and has also promised to carry out \u201chistoric financial sanctions screening reviews of its entire customer base and payments dating back to 2017\u201d. That will likely imply a cost of millions of pounds above the \u00a329m fine. The problem is not limited to Starling. The FCA said: The Authority found that the challenger bank sub-sector as a whole needed to do more in relation to their financial crime controls. Starling\u2019s financial crime controls \u201cfailed to keep pace with its growth\u201d, the Financial Conduct Authority said in an official notice detailing its reasons for a \u00a329m fine. The bank put in place a financial sanctions screening framework in 2017. However, its automated screening system had only been screening the names of new and existing customers against \u201ca fraction\u201d of the names on the UK\u2019s consolidated list \u2013 resulting in many oversights. The FCA did not say which individuals under sanctions that Starling dealt with, but the regulator noted that it had written to Starling and other banks in February 2022 \u2013 as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 to remind them of their duties to comply with updated sanctions rules relating to Russia. Starling failed to ensure that its screening of customers and payments was sufficient to prevent this during the relevant period. Other control failures included: Allowing 294 customers to open accounts after they had been dropped for reasons relating to financial crime. It then found that thousands of customers had opened accounts despite not meeting restrictions. The UK financial regulator has fined app-based Starling Bank \u00a329m for \u201cshockingly lax\u201d failures related to financial sanctions screening. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that Starling had reported \u201cmultiple potential breaches of financial sanctions\u201d despite its financial checks process being under scrutiny by the regulator. The fine was reduced by 30% from \u00a341m because it agreed to resolve the issues. Starling has grown rapidly as it aims to take on the big high-street lenders with an app-only offering. It is one of several app-only competitors that have started up in the last decade, including rivals such as Monzo and Revolut. However, the rush to grow has caused concerns. Starling Bank was criticised in 2022 by a former government minister who claimed it did not run adequate checks on borrowers before handing out taxpayer-backed Covid-19 loans. Starling Bank\u2019s founder, Anne Boden, at the time said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by Agnew\u2019s comments, asked the former minister to withdraw his statements, and said the bank was one of the \u201cmost active and effective banks fighting fraud\u201d. Yet as far back as 2021 the FCA had \u201cidentified serious concerns with the anti-money laundering and sanctions framework\u201d at the bank. Starling agreed to regulatory restrictions preventing it from opening new accounts for high-risk customers until it improved, but the FCA said that it failed to comply and opened over 54,000 accounts for 49,000 high-risk customers between September 2021 and November 2023. Therese Chambers, the FCA\u2019s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: Starling\u2019s financial sanction screening controls were shockingly lax. It left the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions. It compounded this by failing to properly comply with FCA requirements it had agreed to, which were put in place to lower the risk of Starling facilitating financial crime. Eurozone unemployment remained at 6.4% in August. That was a continued record low, despite a weakening economy. However, economists expect the rate to increase in the coming months, as weakness \u2013 notably in Germany, the EU\u2019s largest economy \u2013 feeds through to job losses. Bert Colijn, chief economist at ING, a Dutch investment bank, said: The unemployment rate remains at the lowest level recorded since the eurozone began in 1999. The low rate remains remarkable given the sluggish economic environment that the eurozone has been in since late 2022. But labour demand remains high despite a weak economic environment. That results in worrisome productivity developments, but also boosts household income growth and confidence in the short-term. Israel could target Iranian oil refineries in retaliation for Tuesday night\u2019s attack, in which Tehran launched an estimated 180 ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv and other targets across the country in a dramatic escalation of the conflict between the two countries, write the Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont and Andrew Roth. The US website Axios has reported that Israeli officials are considering a \u201csignificant retaliation\u201d to the Iranian attack within days that could target oil production facilities inside Iran and other strategic sites. US lawmakers have backed a strike against Iranian oil production. Sen Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said he would \u201curge the Biden administration to coordinate an overwhelming response with Israel, starting with Iran\u2019s ability to refine oil\u201d. In a statement, he said Iran\u2019s oil refineries should be \u201chit and hit hard\u201d. You can read the full story here: Axios reported: Many Israeli officials point to Iran\u2019s oil facilities as a likely target, but some say targeted assassinations and taking out Iran\u2019s air defense systems are also possibilities. Iran\u2019s oil is sanctioned by the USA, so it does not directly reach the US or its allies (indirectly is another matter). However, there are plenty of other non-allied countries who are willing to buy it, so any disruption to Iranian oil supplies would probably impact the global market and raise prices. Shipping company Maersk has said that it is continuing to send ships to Beirut, despite the incursion of Israeli troops into Lebanon and the heavy bombardment of its capital. \u201cWhile Maersk\u2019s business in the country is impacted, we currently remain in a position to serve our customers,\u201d a Maersk spokesperson said in an email reported by Reuters. Beirut\u2019s port handled 827,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) shipping containers in 2023. That does not put it in the ranks of the biggest ports in the Mediterranean, but does make it a vital trade artery for Lebanon. Lebanon has been struggling with economic crisis for several years. The port was significantly damaged in August 2020 by a huge explosion caused by a consignment of ammonium nitrate, used in fertiliser. Maersk said all staff in both Lebanon and Israel were safe and accounted for. Maersk\u2019s office in Lebanon is located in Beirut and employs 21 people. Oil prices may be up today, but Saudi Arabia is warning that prices could fall as low as $50 per barrel, the Wall Street Journal reports. The reported comments came ahead of an online meeting on Wednesday of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, an oil cartel described as Opec+ that controls a large proportion of global supplies. Before the escalation of the Middle Eastern crisis, oil prices had been on a downward path for weeks \u2013 and prices are well below the $90 per barrel level a year ago despite the conflict. The Saudi energy minister warned other Opec+ members that they should comply with production cuts to avoid further price drops. The Wall Street Journal reported: During a conference call last week, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the oil minister of OPEC kingmaker Saudi Arabia, warned fellow producers prices could drop to $50 a barrel if they don\u2019t comply with agreed production cuts, according to OPEC delegates who attended the call. Falling oil prices would help consumers after several years of inflation \u2013 and it could help Kamala Harris in her effort to defeat Donald Trump in the US presidential election. However, oil producers \u2013 with Saudi Arabia as the biggest \u2013 want to sustain prices. One share price that has surged on Wednesday is that of musicMagpie. The second-hand smartphone seller is up 48% after retailer AO World agreed a takeover. But it is hardly a happy ending for musicMagpie, which started out as a reseller of CDs and DVDs. It listed shares in 2021 with a heady \u00a3200m+ valuation (netting chief executive and co-founder Steve Oliver \u00a312m in the process). But the 9.07p-per-share takeover values the company at only \u00a310m three years later. As any buyer of second-hand electronics knows, you have to be careful what you pay for. Investors in musicMagpie bought in during the coronavirus pandemic boom in tech sales. Shortages of computer chips meant that electronic devices were hard to come by, which helped resellers. However, that boom had petered out by early 2022, and musicMagpie\u2019s share price slumped as it turned lossmaking. It has had some interest since, notably with BT Group last year considered a bid to complement its EE mobile network business, which also sells electronics. But its share price was at 5.75p on Tuesday before the takeover was announced \u2013 97% down from the heights above \u00a32 in April 2021. The directors of musicMagpie unanimously backed the takeover. John Roberts, AO\u2019s chief executive, said: To achieve our strategic ambition of becoming the destination for electricals, it is crucial for AO to enhance its consumer tech offering. A top-tier trade-in service will be essential, and musicMagpie represents a significant enabler in unlocking value through our reverse supply chain. The biggest share price drop on the FTSE 100 this morning is trainer and clothing retailer JD Sports. It is down by 3.6% on Wednesday morning. UK business has been hit by falling sales after disruption in the Red Sea stalled deliveries and the cold wet spring reduced demand for camping kit and clothing. The retail group, which owns Millets and Blacks in the UK, said sales at the outdoor kit chain were down 5.3% in the six months to 3 August as \u201ckey product lines\u201d had been delayed by Houthi attacks off Yemen delaying or rerouting shipping and the early date of Easter fell outside the camping season for the first time since 2018. It said poor weather compounded the issue, reducing demand for seasonal outdoor living product such as tents and camping equipment. The chilly wet weather also hit the group\u2019s main JD sportswear chain in the UK where sales at established stores were down 4.6% in what the group described as a \u201cchallenging and often volatile UK market\u201d. JD said discounting in the market had surged after \u201cunfavourable spring and early summer weather conditions, dampened footfall and full price demand for seasonal [clothing]\u201d. Oil prices have bumped up further as European traders switch on \u2013 both Brent and West Texas Intermediate are up by more than 2% now. That has helped oil companies. BP and Shell are among the top gainers on London\u2019s FTSE 100 index, thanks to higher oil prices. They rose by 2% and 1.9% respectively. TotalEnergies, France\u2019s oil supermajor, rose by 2.1%, while Italy\u2019s Eni gained 1.3%. European stock markets have gained ground on Wednesday morning \u2013 suggesting that the selloff in response to the Middle Eastern conflicts is so far limited to oil prices. Here are the opening stock market index snaps from Reuters: EUROPE\u2019S STOXX 600 UP 0.2% BRITAIN\u2019S FTSE 100 UP 0.3% GERMANY\u2019S DAX FLAT FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 0.3% SPAIN\u2019S IBEX DOWN 0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Oil prices rose on Wednesday morning as investors around the world weighed the risk of threats to energy supplies after Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel threatened to escalate the Middle East conflict. The price of Brent crude oil futures, the North Sea benchmark, rose by 1.6% to $74.75, while the price of futures for its North American counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, rose by 1.7% to $70.98. Prices surged on Tuesday as reports of Iran\u2019s imminent attack emerged. The attack was a response to Israel\u2019s killing last week of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon\u2019s powerful militant group, Hezbollah. Hezbollah is widely seen as an Iranian proxy, and Israeli troops have moved into Lebanon. Brent crude prices rose by 3.8%, after the largest intra-day move since April 2023, according to analysts led by Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank. They wrote: There were some indications that escalation risks might be higher this time around. The Pentagon said that this attack used around twice as many ballistic missiles as the one in April, while Iranian commentary was more ambiguous on whether the attack would be one-off. Most Asian stock markets outside China slumped on Wednesday morning, following the lead of US indices the night before. Japan\u2019s Nikkei slumped by 2.2%, South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell by 0.6%, and Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index fell by 0.1%. However, Hong Kong\u2019s stock market soared by 6% amid Beijing\u2019s stimulus, which has pushed up Chinese stocks. The mainland Chinese stock markets were closed for the Golden Week holiday. Investors are now considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, while Israeli forces continued to strike Beirut, Lebanon\u2019s capital. Israel has also been fighting in Gaza, to its west, for almost a year after the attacks by Hamas on 7 October. Mohit Kumar, chief economist for Europe at Jefferies, an investment bank, said: Risk off dominated the markets on escalation in the Middle East. Oil moved higher on geopolitical risks. Markets did stabilise after the initial risk off and investors now wait for the response from Israel.

      "body": "<p>The \u201cangry young man\u201d has not aged so well. At least, not John Osborne\u2019s pugilistic sweet-stall seller in <strong>Look Back in Anger (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606)</strong>. Having erupted on to the stage in 1956, he looks like a charmless, self-pitying tyrant here who weaponises his working-class chip against his wife. </p> <p>Director Atri Banerjee leans into the version of Jimmy Porter (Billy Howle) as coercive controller and while it is an instinctive interpretation for our day, forensically rendered, it butts up against the play\u2019s shining legacy as a cri de coeur of class consciousness.</p> <p>Jimmy is a B-rate version of Pinter\u2019s fulminating men, though louder and more impotent, or like Tennessee Williams\u2019 brutish Stanley Kowalski but without the sex appeal. Women are all \u201ccows\u201d and \u201cbitches\u201d and his marriage to middle-class Alison (Ellora Torchia) a battleground. Jimmy\u2019s brand of toxic masculinity entwines class anger with misogyny so thoroughly that it is hard to see him as anything other than odious.</p> <p>Was he really a hero, or even anti-hero, back then? Osborne\u2019s play inspired a movement of angry young men on stage and hailed the advent of a new social realism in British theatre but watching it now is a curiously cold anthropological experience.</p>    <p>Alison, for her part, has class privilege but does not realise her power. Silence is her weapon against Jimmy\u2019s barrage of bullying words, but it is incredibly anodyne. Like Jimmy, she feels very much a historical woman, calculating a future life either under the dubious protection of Jimmy, or the security of her establishment father.</p> <p>The production itself is sleek and Naomi Dawson\u2019s set design cleverly inverts the kitchen-sink realism of the genre to make it more expressionistic as the play goes on. But it does not feel quite potent enough in its balance between passion and rage. You feel twinges of tenderness in Jimmy and Alison\u2019s few moments of intimacy but not the more electric love between them which is better conveyed in the 1959 film, in which Richard Burton plays an equally unpleasant Jimmy, but you glimpse his dark charm and vulnerability, which you do not here. Perhaps that is the point but it makes it a prolonged kind of torture to sit through \u2013 as if watching this abusive relationship play out in all its period detail from under a theatrical bell jar.</p> <p>When Alison\u2019s assertive friend Helena (Morfydd Clark), begins a relationship with Jimmy, there is no sense of attraction or passion. She falls into an identical domestic setup but without the erotic charge displayed between them, their partnership is entirely unconvincing.</p> <p>The angry young woman has fared far better in Arnold Wesker\u2019s <strong>Roots (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)</strong>, written in 1958, which comes as part of the Almeida\u2019s Angry and Young season. Directed by Diyan Zora, this time the focus is on Beatie (also played by Clark), a woman returning home from London to her farming family in Norfolk. They are organising a welcome party for her beau, Ronnie, another working-class hero, in absentia, who has taught Beatie socialism.</p> <p>It could be an early prototype for Educating Rita \u2013 the drama has the same sense of a woman\u2019s eyes being opened by a man; she sees her family differently and looks on their simple yet tough lives with voluble disdain, although this turns poignantly into shame and self-judgment.</p> <p>It is a static play but there are masterful subtleties around class and interplay of characters built into its pace, alongside humour. The rhythms of working-class life are intricately caught too, from the cooking to the noting of buses passing the house by Beatie\u2019s mother (Sophie Stanton).</p> <p>Neither play is preachy but they are certainly talky \u2013 characters are often cooking, eating or sitting as they deliver tranches of monologue. But there is a slowly building momentum in Roots, with a painful mother-daughter confrontation and a deeply moving payoff that feels more eternally relevant in its coming-of-age realisations.</p> <p>The cast, doubling between both plays, is strong, especially Clark as Beatie, while Torchia exudes quiet anguish as Alison. In both dramas you can see a blueprint for the TV soaps of our times, and trace a line from the likes of Osborne, Wesker and Shelagh Delaney to James Graham, Beth Steel and Gary Owen. It makes for a valuable experience as a whole and you see, paradoxically, how much has changed around gender on stage and how much has stayed the same around class. Who, you wonder, are the inheritors of Jimmy and<strong> </strong>Beatie today?</p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/\">Almeida theatre, London</a>, until 23 November</p></li> </ul>",

The production itself is sleek and Naomi Dawson\u2019s set design cleverly inverts the kitchen-sink realism of the genre to make it more expressionistic as the play goes on. But it does not feel quite potent enough in its balance between passion and rage. You feel twinges of tenderness in Jimmy and Alison\u2019s few moments of intimacy but not the more electric love between them which is better conveyed in the 1959 film, in which Richard Burton plays an equally unpleasant Jimmy, but you glimpse his dark charm and vulnerability, which you do not here. Perhaps that is the point but it makes it a prolonged kind of torture to sit through \u2013 as if watching this abusive relationship play out in all its period detail from under a theatrical bell jar. When Alison\u2019s assertive friend Helena (Morfydd Clark), begins a relationship with Jimmy, there is no sense of attraction or passion. She falls into an identical domestic setup but without the erotic charge displayed between them, their partnership is entirely unconvincing. The angry young woman has fared far better in Arnold Wesker\u2019s Roots (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606), written in 1958, which comes as part of the Almeida\u2019s Angry and Young season. Directed by Diyan Zora, this time the focus is on Beatie (also played by Clark), a woman returning home from London to her farming family in Norfolk. They are organising a welcome party for her beau, Ronnie, another working-class hero, in absentia, who has taught Beatie socialism. It could be an early prototype for Educating Rita \u2013 the drama has the same sense of a woman\u2019s eyes being opened by a man; she sees her family differently and looks on their simple yet tough lives with voluble disdain, although this turns poignantly into shame and self-judgment. It is a static play but there are masterful subtleties around class and interplay of characters built into its pace, alongside humour. The rhythms of working-class life are intricately caught too, from the cooking to the noting of buses passing the house by Beatie\u2019s mother (Sophie Stanton). Neither play is preachy but they are certainly talky \u2013 characters are often cooking, eating or sitting as they deliver tranches of monologue. But there is a slowly building momentum in Roots, with a painful mother-daughter confrontation and a deeply moving payoff that feels more eternally relevant in its coming-of-age realisations. The cast, doubling between both plays, is strong, especially Clark as Beatie, while Torchia exudes quiet anguish as Alison. In both dramas you can see a blueprint for the TV soaps of our times, and trace a line from the likes of Osborne, Wesker and Shelagh Delaney to James Graham, Beth Steel and Gary Owen. It makes for a valuable experience as a whole and you see, paradoxically, how much has changed around gender on stage and how much has stayed the same around class. Who, you wonder, are the inheritors of Jimmy and Beatie today? At the Almeida theatre, London, until 23 November",

But one contender offered some sanity</h2> <p>The key emotion circulating at the Tories\u2019 strangely fascinating conference was what I\u2019ve seen described as \u201csurvivor\u2019s elation\u201d: a kind of giddiness in defeat, tinged with relief at no longer being in power \u2013 and a deep reluctance to candidly look at the depth of the Conservative party\u2019s crisis. Such was the mood as the unFab Four made their big speeches: the job wasn\u2019t to tell the faithful many home truths, but to stroke the party\u2019s bruised collective ego.</p> <p>For Tom Tugendhat, that meant a weak and very waffly 20 minutes, delivered by a one nation Tory who has concluded \u2013 correctly \u2013 that what he actually believes will be about as attractive to his audience as cold pies. Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch, by contrast, happily played to the gallery, with two prime examples of the paranoid style of politics that has gripped their party: hers a belligerent call to fight the culture wars to the death, his a stilted, slightly ridiculous oration \u2013 someone has told him to go very big on Tony Blair-esque hand gestures \u2013 centred on immigration and the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>There was only one credible hint of an exit from this event\u2019s comfort zone, when James Cleverly began his speech with the word \u201cSorry\u201d, paid tribute to Ronald Reagan and exhorted his party to \u201cbe more normal\u201d. In his own way, the former foreign secretary showed roughly what that means: he does a good impression of rough-and-tumble suburban everybloke, little interested in the abstractions peddled by some of his fellow contenders (Badenoch\u2019s snappy credo is apparently \u201cfamily, sovereignty and capitalism\u201d), and desperate to get on with the job.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no time to lose, and I don\u2019t lose,\u201d he said, like a true-blue David Brent. Amid all the denial and weirdness, he seemed to have by far the best hope of slowly restoring his party to some version of sanity. The fact that he is still not the frontrunner probably says it all.</p> <p><strong>Threat to Labour:</strong></p> <p>Tom Tugendhat 4/10</p> <p>James Cleverly 8/10</p> <p>Robert Jenrick 5/10</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch 6/10</p> <ul> <li><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Katy Balls: Cleverly came the closest to \u2018doing a David Cameron\u2019</h2> <p>Who is the David Cameron of this Tory party conference? That\u2019s the question being asked in Birmingham after the four candidates gave their leadership speeches. In the 2005 Conservative leadership contest, Cameron used his conference speech to change the dynamics of the race and gain momentum over the frontrunner, David Davis.</p> <p>Given Robert Jenrick\u2019s team are confident he already has sufficient MP backers to get to the final two, he had the simplest task: keep momentum. His speech was aimed squarely at the membership \u2013 in a polished performance that included several references to iron (pitching himself as an heir to Thatcher), he offered plenty of red meat, including on leaving the European convention on human rights. He won laughs by taking pops at leftwing bogeymen such as James O\u2019Brien and Ed Miliband. It didn\u2019t offer an electrifying moment per se, but his team will probably be pleased with his performance.</p> <p>It means the real battle is among the three other candidates for that second place that goes to the membership. Tom Tugendhat went first and put in a smooth performance talking about regaining trust. However, it was James Cleverly who seemed to gain momentum when he appeared next. Despite appearing in the tricky second slot, the former foreign and home secretary was the most memorable, deviating from his standard lines in the hustings. He told the story of his upbringing, said the party needed to start by saying sorry and then try being \u201cmore normal\u201d. It led to a standing ovation and played well in the hall.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch started the contest as the frontrunner but has since come into difficulty \u2013 including at conference with a row over her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/sep/29/maternity-pay-is-excessive-says-tory-leadership-hopeful-kemi-badenoch\">comments on maternity pay</a>. In her speech, she pitched herself as the candidate who could take the fight to Labour and lead a battle of ideas against the trend of identity politics. She also showed some humour by joking about her reputation as a fighter. It was a solid and clear performance that will have calmed nerves among her supporters.</p> <p>However, leaving the stage it is likely to be the Cleverly camp who have the most reason for cheer, as they look to the final MP knockout rounds next week.</p> <p><strong>Threat to Labour:</strong></p> <p>Tom Tugendhat 5/10</p> <p>James Cleverly 8/10</p> <p>Robert Jenrick 6/10</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch 6/10</p> <ul> <li><p>Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s political editor</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Sahil Dutta: All four contenders were singing from the same hymn sheet \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t convincing</h2> <p>For all that this is a factious leadership campaign in a fractured party, there was surprising unity in the speeches about a few things. One was the familiar fixation about \u201cexcess migration\u201d \u2013 a daily staple of British politics. Another was the economy.</p> <p>Tom Tugendhat and, most compellingly, James Cleverly promised to free the economy, cut regulation and celebrate entrepreneurs. The Reform-chasing radicals, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch, attacked net zero targets, planning rules and Labour\u2019s \u201csocialist\u201d programmes. All, of course, bemoaned the tax burden.</p> <p>While all these themes are conference-room standards, they drew on ideas made in a recent<a href=\"https://ukfoundations.co/\"> essay, Why Britain has Stagnated</a>, that has gripped Conservative circles. It is a free-market tract that laments how the country has never recovered from the way Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar government destroyed the entrepreneurial spirit of the 1930s. The result is that business investment in the economy\u2019s most important sectors \u2013 housing, transport, and energy \u2013 has in effect been \u201cbanned\u201d by government rules and planning laws.</p> <p>It is true that the UK is trapped in economic decay. Average wages for most people are<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/september2024\"> worse today</a> than 16 years ago, productivity growth is<a href=\"https://www.productivity.ac.uk/news/what-explains-the-uks-productivity-problem/#:~:text=It%20is%20in%20the%20bottom,of%20improvement%20in%20recent%20years.\"> anaemic</a> and investment is<a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/articles/rock-bottom\"> well below</a> competitor countries. More pressingly, the costs of housing, food transport and most of all energy have jumped in the last two years. Energy especially was a focus for all the candidates, and an area in which Labour will face intense scrutiny.</p> <p>Yet it is questionable how far slashing regulation can alone reverse long-term economic trends. It is also hard to credibly claim, as Badenoch did, that a party that had been in government for 14 years had no power to make a difference. Ultimately, the anti-state economic rhetoric of all candidates is unlikely to bridge the party\u2019s broken electoral coalition. After years of austerity, what is left to cut?</p> <p><strong>Threat to Labour:</strong></p> <p>Tom Tugendhat 3/10</p> <p>James Cleverly 6/10</p> <p>Robert Jenrick 5/10</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch 5/10</p> <ul> <li><p>Sahil Jai Dutta is a lecturer in political economy and co-author of Unprecedented: How Covid-19 Revealed the Politics of Our Economy</p></li> </ul>    <h2>Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones: Cleverly reminded me of Obama, but I\u2019m backing Badenoch\u2019s bold vision</h2> <p>As someone who has long advocated for greater Black representation in the Conservative party, I find this leadership race particularly compelling. Each candidate offers a different vision for the future of the party, and their performances provided further insight into their potential.</p> <p>James Cleverly, whom I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting, remains a natural contender for leadership. His presentation at the conference was confident \u2013 almost presidential. He had a calm, measured approach that reminded me of Barack Obama, a steady hand that looked like it could lead the opposition. However, while Cleverly\u2019s performance demonstrated reliability, I still have concerns about his ability to energise the broader public. His moderate stance is respectable, but I worry that it makes him feel like a Black Keir Starmer \u2013 stable, but not quite transformative.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick and Tom Tugendhat, on the other hand, fell flat. Their presentations were stilted, lacking the energy and vision needed for leadership. Jenrick\u2019s black tie was a bit of a distraction \u2013 was he in mourning for something? His speech felt old-fashioned, filled with attacks on Labour and cabinet members for cheap laughs, which is a tired approach in modern politics. Similarly, Tugendhat\u2019s assertion that he\u2019s \u201cnever failed a mission\u201d felt hollow. Based on today\u2019s performance, this might be his first failure. Both seem like relics of a past Conservative party, appealing only to the traditionalist base.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch running for leader of the Conservative party as a Black woman is a monumental achievement in itself. She received the warmest reception, and her bright blue suit was uplifting. She needs to work on her presentation style, but her real strength lies in her unapologetic, conviction-driven politics. Today, she came across as a fighter \u2013 someone unafraid to speak her mind and confront difficult issues. Her fearless nature makes her a strong contender for challenging Labour.</p> <p>Ultimately, the country needs a visionary. My pick for the leadership is Badenoch, who embodies the bold, unapologetic leadership the party desperately needs.</p> <p><strong>Threat to Labour:</strong></p> <p>Tom Tugendhat 5/10</p> <p>James Cleverly 7/10</p> <p>Robert Jenrick 6/10</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch 8/10</p> <ul> <li><p>Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones was a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservative party in the 2010 election</p></li> </ul>    <h2>John Redwood: Jenrick has shown more intent than his compromised rivals</h2> <p>The three candidates for leader of the opposition who stayed in the government \u2013 Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat and James Cleverly \u2013 struggle to find the right words to justify why they collectively helped the Conservative party over the cliff without a protest.</p> <p>Why had they not been decisive in making it easier for business people to set up and grow companies? Why did they not change the law sufficiently to get flights off to Rwanda or to stop the small boats? Why had they not foreseen the areas where international treaties impeded doing the right thing? Why did they go along with an economic policy that created inflation? Why did none of these three welcome and use some of the many good ideas put to them to boost the economy, get inflation down, raise the quality and productivity of public services, and to cut migration when they had ministerial power? Why did they go along with an early election that the party was bound to lose badly?</p> <p>They are auditioning for the most important role in opposition, a crucial role for the functioning of our democracy. They have had three months to make their mark by exposing the errors and bad conduct of the ministers they are shadowing. So where is the critique of Angela Rayner\u2019s housing policy? Why no forensic analysis of her inability to change planning laws and rules in a way that will make an immediate change in the number of homes built? Where is the exposure of the home secretary\u2019s copycat policies to the past government on trying to curb illegal migration, backed up by a likely policy of allowing people who arrived illegally to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2q0rvgv25xo\">apply for asylum?</a></p> <p>Robert Jenrick has shown a serious intent with his clear articulation of Conservative principles. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/06/robert-jenrick-quits-as-immigration-minister-after-rwanda-bill-published\">resigned from the last government</a> over its failings on migration, one of the big failings that led to defeat.

Why did none of these three welcome and use some of the many good ideas put to them to boost the economy, get inflation down, raise the quality and productivity of public services, and to cut migration when they had ministerial power? Why did they go along with an early election that the party was bound to lose badly? They are auditioning for the most important role in opposition, a crucial role for the functioning of our democracy. They have had three months to make their mark by exposing the errors and bad conduct of the ministers they are shadowing. So where is the critique of Angela Rayner\u2019s housing policy? Why no forensic analysis of her inability to change planning laws and rules in a way that will make an immediate change in the number of homes built? Where is the exposure of the home secretary\u2019s copycat policies to the past government on trying to curb illegal migration, backed up by a likely policy of allowing people who arrived illegally to apply for asylum? Robert Jenrick has shown a serious intent with his clear articulation of Conservative principles. He resigned from the last government over its failings on migration, one of the big failings that led to defeat. He has set out a strong critique of the Labour government. He has my vote.

Nearly a quarter of those families lost more than 50 family members.

Officials say that Israel acts in compliance with the laws of armed conflict and the army takes extensive measures to avert civilian casualties, including alerting people to military operations via phone calls and text messages. Netanyahu told the US Congress earlier this year that the war in Gaza has one of the lowest ratios of combatants to noncombatant casualties in the history of urban warfare. The claim is based on Israeli estimates \u2013 which lack detail, and have been contested \u2013 that as many as 17,000 Hamas combatants have been killed.

Is it the batty challenges devised by its creator \u201cLittle\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/17/alex-horne-looks-back-horne-section-taskmaster\">Alex Horne</a>? Or is it the pleasure of watching half a dozen top comedians struggle with them? Judging by the centrality of Taskmaster to current live comedy (UK tours are now routinely booked off the back of an appearance on the show), the latter is not insignificant. But Taskmaster: the Live Experience is banking on the former.</p> <p>In a repurposed warehouse in Canada Water, London, the show\u2019s world has been recreated so you too can be involved \u2013 undertaking a series of gimcrack tasks, in contest against friends or strangers, with not a professional joker in sight. (Well, OK, a few were in sight at the launch event, hitting the free bar. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a fixture.)</p> <p>There are two versions of the game (\u201cunique experiences\u201d) available: Absolute Casserole and Melon Buffet. Turning up for a 6.45pm timeslot with my 10-year-old son in tow, we are assigned to the green team and Melon Buffet. Before the game begins, there are a few interactive challenges in the bar area, to get us into the tasking groove. We then enter the Taskmaster house, or a facsimile thereof, where Horne halloos us from a video screen. He introduces us to our real-world MC, \u201cLittle Little Alex Horne\u201d, who, tablet in hand, will lead us through five tasks and tot up our scores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/17/alex-horne-looks-back-horne-section-taskmaster\">Alex Horne looks back: \u2018Both my careers \u2013 the Horne Section and Taskmaster \u2013 are an extension of playing with friends\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is, in other words, Taskmaster meets escape room, save that we\u2019re not working as a team, we\u2019re competing against one another. Our first task is to predict how many times a rubber ball will bounce on a table. The next is to select, in a room full of steampunk detritus, the right switch to illuminate a particular bulb. At the penultimate stage, we compete to construct towers from garden bits and bobs, and balance an egg on top.</p> <p>In that challenge, Little Little Alex\u2019s measuring stick seems to malfunction, denying victory to clearly the highest tower \u2013 unless my eyes were deceiving me. What happened next was worse, as, after task four, five winners were declared, and the rest of the group separated into also-rans. Fair enough, if the group were 12-strong \u2013 which seems to be the number this event is set up for. But our group numbered six, meaning only one player, a boy roughly the same age as my kid, was singled out as the loser. And teased as such by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/17/greg-davies-review-hammersmith-apollo-london\">Greg Davies</a>\u2019 and Horne\u2019s avatars \u2013 a sequence that certainly won\u2019t have been filmed with child persecution in mind.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the boy in question will, rubber ball-like, bounce back; the experience as a whole is an enjoyable one.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the key to the success of the TV show Taskmaster? Is it the batty challenges devised by its creator \u201cLittle\u201d Alex Horne? Or is it the pleasure of watching half a dozen top comedians struggle with them? Judging by the centrality of Taskmaster to current live comedy (UK tours are now routinely booked off the back of an appearance on the show), the latter is not insignificant. But Taskmaster: the Live Experience is banking on the former. In a repurposed warehouse in Canada Water, London, the show\u2019s world has been recreated so you too can be involved \u2013 undertaking a series of gimcrack tasks, in contest against friends or strangers, with not a professional joker in sight. (Well, OK, a few were in sight at the launch event, hitting the free bar. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a fixture.) There are two versions of the game (\u201cunique experiences\u201d) available: Absolute Casserole and Melon Buffet. Turning up for a 6.45pm timeslot with my 10-year-old son in tow, we are assigned to the green team and Melon Buffet. Before the game begins, there are a few interactive challenges in the bar area, to get us into the tasking groove. We then enter the Taskmaster house, or a facsimile thereof, where Horne halloos us from a video screen. He introduces us to our real-world MC, \u201cLittle Little Alex Horne\u201d, who, tablet in hand, will lead us through five tasks and tot up our scores. It is, in other words, Taskmaster meets escape room, save that we\u2019re not working as a team, we\u2019re competing against one another. Our first task is to predict how many times a rubber ball will bounce on a table. The next is to select, in a room full of steampunk detritus, the right switch to illuminate a particular bulb. At the penultimate stage, we compete to construct towers from garden bits and bobs, and balance an egg on top. In that challenge, Little Little Alex\u2019s measuring stick seems to malfunction, denying victory to clearly the highest tower \u2013 unless my eyes were deceiving me. What happened next was worse, as, after task four, five winners were declared, and the rest of the group separated into also-rans. Fair enough, if the group were 12-strong \u2013 which seems to be the number this event is set up for. But our group numbered six, meaning only one player, a boy roughly the same age as my kid, was singled out as the loser. And teased as such by Greg Davies\u2019 and Horne\u2019s avatars \u2013 a sequence that certainly won\u2019t have been filmed with child persecution in mind. I\u2019m sure the boy in question will, rubber ball-like, bounce back; the experience as a whole is an enjoyable one. Fans of Taskmaster will surely savour this lovingly recreated interactive version, which I\u2019m happy to recommend to anyone planning a party or a puzzle-lovers\u2019 soiree. But there are still kinks to iron out. Our game was rounded off with one final, battle-of-the-champions challenge \u2013 which went askew on my visit, as the real-world task got out of synch with its pre-recorded commentary.

The UN World Food Programme (WFP) and its partner organisations estimate that 5.4 million Haitians are now regularly finding it hard to get enough to eat, a record for the Caribbean nation and the largest proportion of acutely food insecure people anywhere in the world, WFP said. The figure suggests another 600,000 people have fallen into \u201ccrisis\u201d level hunger since the previous peaks recorded earlier this year and in 2023. A coalition of 12 leading aid agencies has called for immediate action to alleviate the escalating hunger crisis as gang control of major roads blocks food supplies and causes huge price rises. \u201cWithout immediate action the hunger crisis in Haiti will continue to deepen, with devastating consequences for millions of vulnerable people,\u201d civil society groups in Port-au-Prince, including Action Against Hunger, Save the Children and Mercy Corps warned in an open letter. Ten years ago only 2% of Haiti\u2019s population was food insecure but the country was plunged into chaos when its president Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated in 2021 and gangs have since seized control of more than 80% of the capital. An explosion of gang violence earlier this year \u2013 which forced Haiti\u2019s interim leader Ariel Henry to step down \u2013 brought shipping and airport operations to a halt, blocking food getting into the import-dependent country. The added cost of gang tolls on major roads combined with inflation and ever deepening poverty means food now accounts for up to 70% of total household expenditure, the 12 NGOs said. Supplies from southern Haiti, a key region for food distribution, have been blocked for months, said Angeline Annesteus, president of Cadre de Liaison Inter-Organisations (Clio), an association of 80 Haitian and foreign NGOs. \u201cWhile markets may still have food, violence and inflation have driven prices out of reach for millions,\u201d Annesteus said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing in Haiti isn\u2019t a food shortage \u2013 it\u2019s a full-blown hunger crisis.\u201d Two million Haitians are now at \u201cemergency\u201d hunger levels, WFP said, which is one step away from famine. Aid groups say heads of families are regularly having to choose whether to feed themselves or their children and that they are particularly concerned about the growing number of displaced people who are at the highest risk of malnutrition and the diseases coursing through refugee camps. About 6,000 Haitians are at risk of death from starvation, the report found. The number of people displaced has nearly doubled to more than 700,000 in the past six months, with some seeking shelter in schools and public buildings. Women and girls are being forced to offer sex for food. Aid groups are desperately trying to support millions in need but humanitarian food agencies and NGOs in Haiti are $230m (\u00a3173m) short of funding. \u201cWe must not turn our backs on the worst hunger emergency in the western hemisphere. WFP is urgently calling for broad-based support to massively increase life-saving assistance to families struggling every day with extreme food shortages, spiralling malnutrition and deadly diseases,\u201d said WFP\u2019s executive director Cindy McCain. Kenya deployed 400 police officers to Haiti in June as part of a UN-backed security mission intended to tackle the gangs but that mission has stalled as countries have not provided the estimated $600m (\u00a3450m) required. The UN security council voted unanimously on Monday to extend the mission for another year but a plan from the US and Ecuador to make it an official UN peacekeeping force, allowing them to tap the organisation\u2019s international funding, was shelved because of opposition from China and Russia. In the first half of 2024, 3,661 people have been killed in the violence, the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights said last week.",

It is expected to make landfall near Kaohsiung on Thursday afternoon. Authorities warned the threat of strong winds and storm surges remained for coastal and low-lying communities on the densely populated west coast, and the mountainous areas remained at high risk of landslides and torrential rain.</p> \n<p>More than 38,000 troops have been placed on standby and almost 10,000 people evacuated from some mountain areas. Rescue authorities said on Wednesday afternoon that one man in his 70s had died after falling from a tree and two were missing \u2013 one reportedly having fallen into rough seas and another swept away by a river. On Thursday a truck driver was reported killed after a falling boulder struck his vehicle. At least 70 injuries have also been reported, mostly in the east coast county of Taitung, which has been battered by high winds and rain. One person was reported missing in the central county of Yunlin.</p> \n<p>Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons but it is unusual for one to make landfall on the west coast.</p> \n<p>Different forecast models of the storm\u2019s potential path varied widely. Taiwan\u2019s Central Weather Administration (CWA) predicted it would hit the coast <a href=\"https://www.cwa.gov.tw/eng/\">between Kaohsiung and the historic city of Tainan</a> to the north, at some time in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday morning as a weak typhoon or tropical storm.</p> \n<p>Authorities in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\u2019s second biggest city and home to 2.7 million people, had earlier warned people to stay home as the storm\u2019s path looked set to repeat that of Typhoon Thelma in 1977, which killed 37 people. In the city\u2019s Siaogang district, Chou Yi-tang, a government official, told Reuters that older residents with memories of Thelma were being particularly cautious. A record number of sandbags had been distributed in the district.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were hit directly by the eyewall,\u201d Chou said of the 1977 storm. \u201cPower was out for two weeks and no water for almost a month. It was disastrous.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/29/hyper-violent-typhoon-gaemi-climate-crisis-scientists\">\u2018Hyper-violent\u2019 Typhoon Gaemi was made fiercer by climate crisis, say scientists</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Every county in Taiwan declared a typhoon day for Wednesday, closing schools and offices. However, there was some criticism of city governments in the north, with accusations that the day off was ordered unnecessarily to win favour with voters.</p> \n<p>Domestic flights, ferry services and more than 200 international flights have been cancelled, and rail services suspended or reduced.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, a cargo vessel ran aground near Taiwan\u2019s Lanyu island, off the south-east coast.

      "bodyText": "Two people have been killed, two are missing and more than 100 injured in bad weather from a typhoon approaching Taiwan, which grounded flights and closed all schools, offices and financial markets for Wednesday and Thursday. Typhoon Krathon reached super typhoon status in recent days but movement stalled overnight and its intensity has weakened as it moves slowly towards Taiwan\u2019s south-west. It is expected to make landfall near Kaohsiung on Thursday afternoon. Authorities warned the threat of strong winds and storm surges remained for coastal and low-lying communities on the densely populated west coast, and the mountainous areas remained at high risk of landslides and torrential rain. More than 38,000 troops have been placed on standby and almost 10,000 people evacuated from some mountain areas. Rescue authorities said on Wednesday afternoon that one man in his 70s had died after falling from a tree and two were missing \u2013 one reportedly having fallen into rough seas and another swept away by a river. On Thursday a truck driver was reported killed after a falling boulder struck his vehicle. At least 70 injuries have also been reported, mostly in the east coast county of Taitung, which has been battered by high winds and rain. One person was reported missing in the central county of Yunlin. Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons but it is unusual for one to make landfall on the west coast. Different forecast models of the storm\u2019s potential path varied widely. Taiwan\u2019s Central Weather Administration (CWA) predicted it would hit the coast between Kaohsiung and the historic city of Tainan to the north, at some time in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday morning as a weak typhoon or tropical storm. Authorities in Kaohsiung, Taiwan\u2019s second biggest city and home to 2.7 million people, had earlier warned people to stay home as the storm\u2019s path looked set to repeat that of Typhoon Thelma in 1977, which killed 37 people. In the city\u2019s Siaogang district, Chou Yi-tang, a government official, told Reuters that older residents with memories of Thelma were being particularly cautious. A record number of sandbags had been distributed in the district. \u201cWe were hit directly by the eyewall,\u201d Chou said of the 1977 storm. \u201cPower was out for two weeks and no water for almost a month. It was disastrous.\u201d Every county in Taiwan declared a typhoon day for Wednesday, closing schools and offices. However, there was some criticism of city governments in the north, with accusations that the day off was ordered unnecessarily to win favour with voters. Domestic flights, ferry services and more than 200 international flights have been cancelled, and rail services suspended or reduced. On Tuesday, a cargo vessel ran aground near Taiwan\u2019s Lanyu island, off the south-east coast. All 19 crew of the Barbados-registered Blue Lagoon were rescued but the ship remains stuck, and a Lanyu island official said on Tuesday that there appeared to be oil leaking from it. The ship was carrying more than 67,000 tonnes of iron ore and 227 tonnes of a fuel oil, according to Taiwan\u2019s coastguard. The outer bands of the typhoon also caused landslides near Hualien on Monday, blocking roads and rail lines and trapping eight vehicles and 14 people who were later freed. Authorities are taking extra precautions after Taiwan was hit by the very strong typhoon Gaemi, equivalent to a category 4 hurricane, in July. The storm killed 11 people in Taiwan, brought widespread flooding including to Kaohsiung\u2019s city centre, and grounded several ships. \u201cBecause of Typhoon Gaemi being quite severe earlier this year, everyone is more cautious and prepared this time around,\u201d said sales representative Yu Ren-yu, 35, picking up sandbags at a government office. Despite Krathon weakening, its slow pace meant that the impact of continuing strong wind and rain would last into the weekend, the CWA said. Reuters contributed to this report",

      "body": "<p>The Anthem is a concert hall by the waterfront in Washington DC. Upcoming performing acts include Ringo Starr and Vampire Weekend.</p> <p>But on 7 October, it will be where three large mainstream Jewish organizations, pulling from across the city\u2019s Jewish communities, will host an evening of remembrance. Attendees are invited to send in photo reflections \u2013 pictures of themselves and their community showing support for Israel \u2013 some of which will be shared at the event, an attempt to give the evening a feeling that\u2019s both deeply personal and communal.</p> <p>The Washington convening, hosted by the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, and the Washington Board of Rabbis, will be one of many that will be held next week by Jewish groups across the US to mark a year since the attack by Hamas on Israel that saw over 1,100 people <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231217222630/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231215-israel-social-security-data-reveals-true-picture-of-oct-7-deaths\">killed</a> and 251 taken hostage. There will be memorials, vigils, prayers, lectures and panels held in synagogues, on campuses and public squares, and even concert halls.</p> <p>But Hamas\u2019s attack was followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war\">Israel\u2019s war in Gaza</a>, which has, so far, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-palestinians-statistics-40000-7ebec13101f6d08fe10cedbf5e172dde\">killed</a> over 40,000 people, a figure some consider an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02508-0\">underestimate</a>. Over this period of time, hundreds of Palestinians have also been killed in the West Bank; Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-threatens-what-could-be-ground-offensive-against-hezbollah-in-lebanon\">attacks</a> in its campaign against Hezbollah in recent days also killed civilians in Lebanon.</p> <p>The anniversary, then, confronts Jewish groups with the question of what, exactly, they\u2019re commemorating; who the commemorations are for; and what they want their attendees to take from them.</p> <p>The varying answers are another reflection of the growing fractures within and between America\u2019s Jewish communities \u2013 which existed before 7 October and have been thrown into sharper focus since.</p>    <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s just digging deeper wherever they were,\u201d said Marc Dollinger, professor of Jewish studies at San Francisco State University. American Jews had their own beliefs and narratives about Israel and its role in their lives and American Jewishness before the war, he said; what has followed fit into those narratives.</p> <p>Those narratives have clashed and bumped up against each other all year. They\u2019ll collide as Jews head to synagogue, or don\u2019t, for the High Holidays, which begin with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, on Wednesday evening. And they will shape how American Jews mark a year since Hamas\u2019s attack.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In their 7 October commemorations, mainstream Jewish groups will largely focus on Jewish pain and healing, with appeals to an increasingly elusive notion of Jewish unity.</p> <p>\u201cOverall the goal is to bring together the full breadth of the Washington Jewish community to be together on October 7, one year after the attack,\u201d said Gil Preuss, chief executive of Washington\u2019s Jewish Federation.</p> <p>The event will be divided into three sections: on memory; on the resilience of the Jewish community; and on unity and renewal. There will be speeches, but not by politicians. It\u2019s not about politics, he said. It\u2019s about the Jewish community.</p> <p>\u201cEven with our broad voices, and different perspectives about the conflict, there is a critical idea \u2026 about us coming together as a Jewish community.\u201d</p> <p>Halfway across the country, in Chicago, Dan Goldwin, chief public affairs officer of the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Chicago, is planning a similar event. \u201cWe are acting as convener for a community-wide memorial,\u201d he said, that is meant to be \u201cone communal stop\u201d. More than 45 organizations are co-sponsoring. Prayers will be led by rabbis, cantors will offer songs, and speakers will include Congressman Brad Schneider, but also the aunt and grandmother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a young man taken captive and killed by Hamas, and a survivor of the Nova music festival.</p>    <p>He hopes people are able to leave remembering the feeling of unity Jews felt on that day. \u201cWe have to be united. We have to be together,\u201d Goldwin said.</p> <p>But for others, the focus on unity means sidestepping hard questions and conversations.</p> <p>\u201cFolks who are really feeling deep emotional pain at the genocide in Gaza and seeing so many of our institutions not addressing that particular framing, and often completely leaving out the necessity of saving Palestinian life after so much has already been demolished \u2013 it makes it impossible for many Jews to feel they have an institutional space to process this really incredible moment in Jewish history,\u201d said Rabbi Andrue Kahn, executive director of American Council for Judaism.</p> <p>His organization was originally <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/american-council-for-judaism\">established</a> to fight Zionism and is now dedicated to supporting Jewish spaces \u201cwith intentional resistance to the elements of nationalism, colonialism, imperialism and supremacy which have taken root in many of our Jewish communal homes\u201d.</p> <p>Most American Jews feel some emotional attachment to Israel: <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-connections-with-and-attitudes-toward-israel/\">according</a> to a 2020 Pew study, 58% of American Jews were very or somewhat emotionally attached, though 54% had never visited. A more recent Pew <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/how-us-jews-are-experiencing-the-israel-hamas-war/\">study</a>, from April, found that American Jews are far more likely than the average American to support Israel\u2019s reasons for fighting Hamas: 89% of American Jews said Israel\u2019s reasons were valid, compared to 58% of Americans overall.</p> <p>At the same time, younger American Jews were less likely than their older counterparts to say the way Israel was carrying out its response was acceptable: just 52% of American Jews ages 18-34 said so, compared to 69% of those ages 50 to 64.</p> <p>While these divisions existed before the war, they have deepened in the last year, with arguments over Israel recurring at synagogues, family dinner tables, and between Jewish groups across the country.

      "bodyText": "The Anthem is a concert hall by the waterfront in Washington DC. Upcoming performing acts include Ringo Starr and Vampire Weekend. But on 7 October, it will be where three large mainstream Jewish organizations, pulling from across the city\u2019s Jewish communities, will host an evening of remembrance. Attendees are invited to send in photo reflections \u2013 pictures of themselves and their community showing support for Israel \u2013 some of which will be shared at the event, an attempt to give the evening a feeling that\u2019s both deeply personal and communal. The Washington convening, hosted by the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington, Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, and the Washington Board of Rabbis, will be one of many that will be held next week by Jewish groups across the US to mark a year since the attack by Hamas on Israel that saw over 1,100 people killed and 251 taken hostage. There will be memorials, vigils, prayers, lectures and panels held in synagogues, on campuses and public squares, and even concert halls. But Hamas\u2019s attack was followed by Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has, so far, killed over 40,000 people, a figure some consider an underestimate. Over this period of time, hundreds of Palestinians have also been killed in the West Bank; Israel\u2019s attacks in its campaign against Hezbollah in recent days also killed civilians in Lebanon. The anniversary, then, confronts Jewish groups with the question of what, exactly, they\u2019re commemorating; who the commemorations are for; and what they want their attendees to take from them. The varying answers are another reflection of the growing fractures within and between America\u2019s Jewish communities \u2013 which existed before 7 October and have been thrown into sharper focus since. \u201cEveryone\u2019s just digging deeper wherever they were,\u201d said Marc Dollinger, professor of Jewish studies at San Francisco State University. American Jews had their own beliefs and narratives about Israel and its role in their lives and American Jewishness before the war, he said; what has followed fit into those narratives. Those narratives have clashed and bumped up against each other all year. They\u2019ll collide as Jews head to synagogue, or don\u2019t, for the High Holidays, which begin with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, on Wednesday evening. And they will shape how American Jews mark a year since Hamas\u2019s attack. *** In their 7 October commemorations, mainstream Jewish groups will largely focus on Jewish pain and healing, with appeals to an increasingly elusive notion of Jewish unity. \u201cOverall the goal is to bring together the full breadth of the Washington Jewish community to be together on October 7, one year after the attack,\u201d said Gil Preuss, chief executive of Washington\u2019s Jewish Federation. The event will be divided into three sections: on memory; on the resilience of the Jewish community; and on unity and renewal. There will be speeches, but not by politicians. It\u2019s not about politics, he said. It\u2019s about the Jewish community. \u201cEven with our broad voices, and different perspectives about the conflict, there is a critical idea \u2026 about us coming together as a Jewish community.\u201d Halfway across the country, in Chicago, Dan Goldwin, chief public affairs officer of the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Chicago, is planning a similar event. \u201cWe are acting as convener for a community-wide memorial,\u201d he said, that is meant to be \u201cone communal stop\u201d. More than 45 organizations are co-sponsoring. Prayers will be led by rabbis, cantors will offer songs, and speakers will include Congressman Brad Schneider, but also the aunt and grandmother of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a young man taken captive and killed by Hamas, and a survivor of the Nova music festival. He hopes people are able to leave remembering the feeling of unity Jews felt on that day. \u201cWe have to be united. We have to be together,\u201d Goldwin said. But for others, the focus on unity means sidestepping hard questions and conversations. \u201cFolks who are really feeling deep emotional pain at the genocide in Gaza and seeing so many of our institutions not addressing that particular framing, and often completely leaving out the necessity of saving Palestinian life after so much has already been demolished \u2013 it makes it impossible for many Jews to feel they have an institutional space to process this really incredible moment in Jewish history,\u201d said Rabbi Andrue Kahn, executive director of American Council for Judaism. His organization was originally established to fight Zionism and is now dedicated to supporting Jewish spaces \u201cwith intentional resistance to the elements of nationalism, colonialism, imperialism and supremacy which have taken root in many of our Jewish communal homes\u201d. Most American Jews feel some emotional attachment to Israel: according to a 2020 Pew study, 58% of American Jews were very or somewhat emotionally attached, though 54% had never visited. A more recent Pew study, from April, found that American Jews are far more likely than the average American to support Israel\u2019s reasons for fighting Hamas: 89% of American Jews said Israel\u2019s reasons were valid, compared to 58% of Americans overall. At the same time, younger American Jews were less likely than their older counterparts to say the way Israel was carrying out its response was acceptable: just 52% of American Jews ages 18-34 said so, compared to 69% of those ages 50 to 64. While these divisions existed before the war, they have deepened in the last year, with arguments over Israel recurring at synagogues, family dinner tables, and between Jewish groups across the country. The split is evidenced, for example, in a Rabbis for Ceasefire directory of Jewish communities \u201ceager to warmly welcome those in ceasefire movements, exactly as you are\u201d for the High Holidays. The difference isn\u2019t only generational, of course, but younger American Jews are more likely than their elders to protest against the war, and have played a visible role in the movement against it. They are also less likely to view antisemitism as a \u201cvery serious\u201d problem, perhaps in part because they are less likely to see protests against Israeli policy and even Israel itself as antisemitic. Dollinger sees the different responses to the war, and even the different approaches to commemoration, as part of a broader shifting of tectonic plates within American Jewry and how it understands itself and its relationship to Israel. American Jewish identity is largely a \u201cpluralistic, liberal enterprise\u201d, he said, while Israel represents illiberal, ethnic nationalism. \u201cI think a whole lot of American Jews have never appreciated the fundamental difference between American Jews and Israeli Jews.\u201d *** The memorial events are all, of course, pegged to 7 October, but will tell stories that span very different timelines. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to zero in on what happened that day,\u201d Goldwin said. \u201cOctober 7 was still a moment in time. That\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at this.\u201d More progressive groups see the day as a terrible milestone \u2013 but one that happened in a violent historical context that began much earlier. Eva Borgwardt, national spokesperson of IfNotNow, a group of American Jews founded a decade ago and organizing to end US support for what they call Israeli apartheid, took this view. \u201cWe need to be capable of holding three things simultaneously.\u201d 6 October, she said, was \u201ca normal day for Israelis, but a day under occupation, apartheid, and siege for Palestinians with no end in sight\u201d. 7 October was a massacre and a tragedy.

      "body": "<p>Michael Ancram, who has died aged 79, was an ambitious, popular, shrewd and effective Conservative politician who had the common misfortune throughout his career of either being the right man in the wrong place or of being there at the wrong time.</p> <p>Although he rose to become chairman of the party and its deputy leader in opposition, he never made cabinet rank in government and was humiliated when he contested the leadership of the party during its wilderness years after the 1997 election.</p> <p>His career was blighted by two considerable factors which, at other times in the history of the party would have been regarded as signal advantages: he was a wealthy aristocrat with a long lineage of landed privilege and he was a One Nation liberal-minded Tory; the problem was that his principal ministerial opportunities occurred during the premiership of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\">Margaret Thatcher</a>, who regarded both facts with the utmost suspicion. </p> <p>She did give him his first junior ministerial job at the Scottish Office in 1983, but that came beribboned with responsibility for the introduction of the hated poll tax in Scotland (where it first came into effect) and undoubtedly led to the loss of his Commons seat at Edinburgh South in 1987.</p> <p>The most significant, if understated, achievement of his political career came after his return to the Commons as MP for Devizes at the following election, in 1992, by which time John Major was prime minister. Ancram was appointed parliamentary under-secretary to the Northern Ireland office in 1993, fulfilling the requirement for a Catholic among the ministerial team, and in less than a year was promoted to minister of state. During this time he was effectively responsible for drafting what became the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and in 1995, after a series of negotiations with the Unionists, he became the first British minister to negotiate openly with Sinn F\u00e9in. </p> <p>Major wrote approvingly in his memoirs of how Ancram skilfully moved the peace process forwards and it seemed likely that he would have been promoted to Northern Ireland secretary, if there had been a reshuffle before the 1997 election.</p> <p>In the untidy aftermath of the Conservative defeat at that election by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour party, he was instead given shadow cabinet responsibility for constitutional affairs by the new Tory leader, William Hague, with a remit to oppose the incoming government\u2019s commitment to devolution to Scotland and Wales, a policy Ancram had himself endorsed.</p> <p>Having been made party chairman in 1998 and having successfully fought off the firestorm that beset the Conservatives on a number of fronts after the cataclysmic electoral defeat, he appeared to believe after the party\u2019s further defeat in the 2001 election that his was the candidacy for leadership that could best serve to \u201cheal the wounds\u201d and unite the warring party.</p> <p>In keeping with the family motto <em>Sero sed serio</em> (Late but in earnest) he put his name forward as the last of the four candidates for the leadership and was mercilessly eliminated on the first ballot. The successful Iain Duncan Smith rewarded him, however, with the deputy leadership and the significant post of shadow foreign secretary, and when Michael Howard took over in 2003, he retained Ancram in situ. His last shadow cabinet appointment for a few months in 2005 was as shadow defence secretary, from which he resigned on the election of David Cameron as party leader.</p> <p>Ancram\u2019s evident pragmatism probably had a great deal to do with his antecedents. His own political motto, which came from Disraeli, was \u201coppose, adapt, adopt\u201d, and he had examples to follow from both of his parents, who were distantly related to each other.</p> <p>His father, Peter Kerr, the 12th Marquess of Lothian, was an unwavering Conservative who worked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/oct/10/obituaries\">Alec Douglas-Home</a>, prime minister 1963-64, as a junior health minister, and was a junior Foreign Office minister after Edward Heath became prime minister in 1970. Douglas-Home was a political hero to whom young Michael (with the courtesy title of the Earl of Ancram) went for advice and whom he described as a great influence.

      "bodyText": "Michael Ancram, who has died aged 79, was an ambitious, popular, shrewd and effective Conservative politician who had the common misfortune throughout his career of either being the right man in the wrong place or of being there at the wrong time. Although he rose to become chairman of the party and its deputy leader in opposition, he never made cabinet rank in government and was humiliated when he contested the leadership of the party during its wilderness years after the 1997 election. His career was blighted by two considerable factors which, at other times in the history of the party would have been regarded as signal advantages: he was a wealthy aristocrat with a long lineage of landed privilege and he was a One Nation liberal-minded Tory; the problem was that his principal ministerial opportunities occurred during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who regarded both facts with the utmost suspicion. She did give him his first junior ministerial job at the Scottish Office in 1983, but that came beribboned with responsibility for the introduction of the hated poll tax in Scotland (where it first came into effect) and undoubtedly led to the loss of his Commons seat at Edinburgh South in 1987. The most significant, if understated, achievement of his political career came after his return to the Commons as MP for Devizes at the following election, in 1992, by which time John Major was prime minister. Ancram was appointed parliamentary under-secretary to the Northern Ireland office in 1993, fulfilling the requirement for a Catholic among the ministerial team, and in less than a year was promoted to minister of state. During this time he was effectively responsible for drafting what became the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and in 1995, after a series of negotiations with the Unionists, he became the first British minister to negotiate openly with Sinn F\u00e9in. Major wrote approvingly in his memoirs of how Ancram skilfully moved the peace process forwards and it seemed likely that he would have been promoted to Northern Ireland secretary, if there had been a reshuffle before the 1997 election. In the untidy aftermath of the Conservative defeat at that election by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour party, he was instead given shadow cabinet responsibility for constitutional affairs by the new Tory leader, William Hague, with a remit to oppose the incoming government\u2019s commitment to devolution to Scotland and Wales, a policy Ancram had himself endorsed. Having been made party chairman in 1998 and having successfully fought off the firestorm that beset the Conservatives on a number of fronts after the cataclysmic electoral defeat, he appeared to believe after the party\u2019s further defeat in the 2001 election that his was the candidacy for leadership that could best serve to \u201cheal the wounds\u201d and unite the warring party. In keeping with the family motto Sero sed serio (Late but in earnest) he put his name forward as the last of the four candidates for the leadership and was mercilessly eliminated on the first ballot. The successful Iain Duncan Smith rewarded him, however, with the deputy leadership and the significant post of shadow foreign secretary, and when Michael Howard took over in 2003, he retained Ancram in situ. His last shadow cabinet appointment for a few months in 2005 was as shadow defence secretary, from which he resigned on the election of David Cameron as party leader. Ancram\u2019s evident pragmatism probably had a great deal to do with his antecedents. His own political motto, which came from Disraeli, was \u201coppose, adapt, adopt\u201d, and he had examples to follow from both of his parents, who were distantly related to each other. His father, Peter Kerr, the 12th Marquess of Lothian, was an unwavering Conservative who worked for Alec Douglas-Home, prime minister 1963-64, as a junior health minister, and was a junior Foreign Office minister after Edward Heath became prime minister in 1970. Douglas-Home was a political hero to whom young Michael (with the courtesy title of the Earl of Ancram) went for advice and whom he described as a great influence. His mother, Tony (Antonella) Newland, was a vibrant, Labour-voting, half-Italian journalist and broadcaster who might herself in a later age have become a full-time politician. She co-founded the annual Women of the Year lunch to raise money for charity, and was a forceful campaigner for numerous causes, which included picketing the Soviet embassy to try to secure the release of Andrei Sakharov when he was detained in the 1980s. She lost an eye to cancer in 1970 and for the rest of her life wore a piratical eyepatch. \u201cShe made me accept that politics is not something on which you have a rigid view,\u201d Ancram once told me. \u201cYou listen to people, you argue, you adapt your politics to what you\u2019re hearing.\u201d Born in London, Michael was the second of six children and spent his early childhood at Melbourne Hall, Derbyshire. This was one of the two family estates \u2013 the other being Monteviot House, Jedburgh, in the Scottish Borders \u2013 and provided a formative political influence. He would later point out that many Scots politicians, born and educated only in Scotland, never really understand the English or how they think; while not exactly raised in the milieu of ordinary English society, he believed he knew what the English were about. He was educated at home by a governess until the age of 10. An asthma sufferer, he was sent to school in Switzerland for the next three years: he became fluent in French and Italian and, having overcome his asthma, became an enthusiastic and successful skier. From Ampleforth college, North Yorkshire, he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he was awarded a history degree in 1966 and then the University of Edinburgh where he qualified in law; in the nature of Scottish society, he made many lifelong friends from all parties. He busked round Italy as a folk-singing student and retained an enthusiastic and highly competent mastery of the acoustic guitar all his life. He impersonated Buddy Holly and sang the protest songs of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Tom Paxton. He also boasted about hanging out in the Troubadour club in Fulham and meeting Paul Simon. He took his mother with him when he went campaigning for his first crack at the Commons, when he stood against the redoubtable Labour MP Tam Dalyell in what was then West Lothian in 1970. Dalyell said that he was the most able candidate who had ever stood against him, albeit in a hopeless cause, and that his constituents were, besides, enormously impressed with the Marchioness.

Nigel Blow worked at Harrods for more than 14 years from 1992 to 2007 when the retailer was owned by Al Fayed, the subject of recent BBC documentary based on the accounts of more than 20 women who said he had sexually assaulted or raped them when they worked for the company. After the widely reported allegations, the BBC said that Blow, who has been the chief executive of the privately owned department store chain Morleys since 2019, declined to answer multiple requests for comment about his time at Harrods. Fenwick, a family-owned luxury department store chain with eight outlets around the UK, had announced in July that Blow would become its chief executive this month, but has now said he will no longer be taking up the role. \u201cNigel Blow has informed us that he will no longer be taking up this position,\u201d it said in a statement. No reason for the decision has been given. Blow joined Harrods as a merchandise controller in 1992, rising to chief merchant of the store. He gained a seat on the board, in 2003. He left in 2007 to run the Brown Thomas department store in Ireland and has since run Ireland\u2019s largest department store Arnotts and British menswear brand Turnbull &amp; Assser before becoming the chief executive of Morley\u2019s \u2013 which owns Elys in Wimbledon and Selbys on north London\u2019s Holloway Road.

Al Fayed died last year aged 94. The news comes after barristers representing alleged victims of Al Fayed said on Tuesday that the Justice For Harrods Survivors campaign has more than 70 clients. The group said the number of women \u201cfeeling safe to come forward\u201d was \u201cincreasing on a daily basis\u201d. Last month, the Metropolitan police confirmed officers were investigating a number of fresh allegations made against Al Fayed, as well as previous reports. The force said it would carry out \u201cfull reviews of all existing allegations\u201d of incidents reported to have taken place between 1979 and 2013 to ensure there were \u201cno new lines of inquiry based on new information which has emerged\u201d. Morleys said that Blow had resigned as chief executive in July to move to Fenwick at the end of October. \u201cNigel has worked for the group for eight years and we have been happy with his contribution to our business over this time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cMorleys Stores had no knowledge of the recent allegations regarding Harrods and like others are horrified to hear the reports of sexual abuse against their employees and our thoughts are with the victims at this time.\u201d The Guardian has approached Blow for comment.",

Yes, I have little faith in the likelihood of our coming together as a species to solve the climate crisis, make housing affordable or vote for the non-criminal presidential candidate. But that\u2019s based on evidence. Who could reflect on current events and feel optimistic about the future? That\u2019s what I might have argued before I read Jamil Zaki\u2019s new book, Hope for Cynics. Afterwards, I felt humbled: I might be part of the problem. Zaki \u2013 a professor of psychology, and director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab \u2013 paints a confronting picture of cynicism\u2019s hold on us, and its negative impacts for the future and our individual lives. Over the last 50 years, we\u2019ve lost trust not only in institutions, but also in each other. In 2018, only 32% of Americans surveyed said that \u201cmost people can be trusted\u201d, compared with nearly 50% in 1972. A global study in 2022 uncovered the same tendency towards distrust in 24 of 28 nations. As trust has waned, cynicism has taken root as a response to global instability, mounting threats and falling living standards. But, Zaki argues, it\u2019s an own goal: believing things can only get worse all but guarantees that they will, by further eroding our social fabric and discouraging us from taking action against corruption and injustice. Expecting the worst also harms our chances of finding happiness in the now. Studies show that cynics are more depressed, drink more alcohol, earn less money and even die younger than non-cynics. But the popular belief that cynicism is just smarter and more realistic isn\u2019t necessarily justifiable, Zaki points out: cynics perform worse at cognitive tests and are less effective at identifying untrustworthy people and lies than non-cynics. \u201cBy never trusting, cynics never lose,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey also never win.\u201d *** Zaki admits that for many years \u2013 even while professionally engaged in the study of kindness and empathy, and publicly preaching their importance \u2013 he, too, was a secret cynic. He set out to write the book partly to understand that incongruity: \u201cThey say research is me-search,\u201d Zaki laughs. What he found was that cynicism doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. Our tendency to focus on potential problems did evolve for a reason: \u201c200,000 years ago, the person worrying about the predator on the horizon probably did better than their friend blissed out by the sunset\u201d, he says. But now those instincts for self-protection can lead us to fixate on the negative and overestimate the chances of frightening, but rare events. Cynics might pride themselves on seeing the world as it really is, but humans are generally terrible at accounting for our biases and at amending our beliefs in line with evidence. \u201cOne of the central messages of psychology over the last century has been that we are much less objective than we think we are,\u201d Zaki says.

      "body": "<p>Maroesja Perizonius and Alice McShane\u2019s impassioned, courageous, focused and confrontational documentary alleges the sexual abuse and rape of children in the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (AKA Osho) meditation communes in Britain, the US and elsewhere, in the 70s and 80s \u2013 by people who are in the same business right now. Names are named, questions asked, and certain ageing bland-faced hippy men are challenged on camera, their seraphic expressions of placid spirituality turning to fear and rage.</p> <p>Children of the Cult grew out of widespread discontent among the now grownup Rajneesh children at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/07/cult-oregon-1980s-terror-netflix-documentary-wild-country\">much acclaimed 2018 Netflix series Wild Wild Country</a>, about the Rajneeshpuram cult in Oregon in the 80s. Although candid enough about the well-known bizarre criminality and charlatanism there that (temporarily) discredited the movement and its leader, the series failed to mention child sexual abuse. Grownup rape survivors therefore shared their stories on Facebook, leading to this fierce movie in which the film-makers travel to Europe, the UK and the US to record accounts of grotesque and unacknowledged crimes. As one interviewee puts it, the ashrams had something that attracted a certain kind of charismatic guy: \u201cFree sex, and free sex with kids too.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQmY7Y0-UE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NrQmY7Y0-UE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Many of the men involved seem to have extravagantly forgiven themselves for whatever minor lapses of which they consider themselves not especially guilty. They incautiously agreed to be interviewed, perhaps expecting lenient treatment, or something like the Netflix approach that implied it was something exotically sealed in the past.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t what happens here. And the same goes for those high up in the organisation: we get people whose faces are not pixelated, angrily stalking away from the camera. The unspeakable Rajneesh himself died in 1990 but his movement turned into the Osho International Meditation Resorts, with the Rajneesh\u2019s picture visible on the walls; these are places at which survivors have spotted online some very familiar, ageing faces. Is a class action lawsuit out of the question?</p> <p>\u2022 Children of the Cult is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Maroesja Perizonius and Alice McShane\u2019s impassioned, courageous, focused and confrontational documentary alleges the sexual abuse and rape of children in the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (AKA Osho) meditation communes in Britain, the US and elsewhere, in the 70s and 80s \u2013 by people who are in the same business right now. Names are named, questions asked, and certain ageing bland-faced hippy men are challenged on camera, their seraphic expressions of placid spirituality turning to fear and rage. Children of the Cult grew out of widespread discontent among the now grownup Rajneesh children at the much acclaimed 2018 Netflix series Wild Wild Country, about the Rajneeshpuram cult in Oregon in the 80s. Although candid enough about the well-known bizarre criminality and charlatanism there that (temporarily) discredited the movement and its leader, the series failed to mention child sexual abuse. Grownup rape survivors therefore shared their stories on Facebook, leading to this fierce movie in which the film-makers travel to Europe, the UK and the US to record accounts of grotesque and unacknowledged crimes. As one interviewee puts it, the ashrams had something that attracted a certain kind of charismatic guy: \u201cFree sex, and free sex with kids too.\u201d Many of the men involved seem to have extravagantly forgiven themselves for whatever minor lapses of which they consider themselves not especially guilty. They incautiously agreed to be interviewed, perhaps expecting lenient treatment, or something like the Netflix approach that implied it was something exotically sealed in the past. That isn\u2019t what happens here. And the same goes for those high up in the organisation: we get people whose faces are not pixelated, angrily stalking away from the camera. The unspeakable Rajneesh himself died in 1990 but his movement turned into the Osho International Meditation Resorts, with the Rajneesh\u2019s picture visible on the walls; these are places at which survivors have spotted online some very familiar, ageing faces. Is a class action lawsuit out of the question? \u2022 Children of the Cult is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 October.",

      "body": "<p>My mother, Nora Zavala Gallion, was 11 years old when she first set foot inside the farm labor camp in Caldwell, Idaho. It was 1968, and her family had traveled over 2,000 miles (3,218km) by car from Texas\u2019s Rio Grande valley to harvest sugar beets as migrant laborers.</p> <p>While my family had worked numerous crops across the country for decades, the girl who would become my mother sensed something very different about this location. The camp\u2019s small, dilapidated wooden living quarters were called \u201cbarracks\u201d and featured open, latrine-style bathrooms and showers. Somehow, my mother knew this place had a troubling past.</p>    <p>\u201cIn those years, segregation was very prevalent,\u201d she remembered. \u201cWe were not allowed to live within the white city limits of Caldwell. We had to drive 10 miles out of the city limit, then take this gravel road \u2026 And at the top of that gravel road was this encampment. It was surrounded by barbed wire. There\u2019s no way around it: I knew that at one point that this place had been a prison camp for someone, but now it was the only place that Mexicans were allowed to live.\u201d</p> <p>Other Mexican American farm workers who had been there longer soon told the family why the labor camp seemed like a prison. It had been a site of Japanese American incarceration during the second world war. It was part of a network of camps that warehoused more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, rounded up and detained on racially motivated suspicions that they supported the enemy Axis powers of Japan, Germany and Italy. In Caldwell, they would have to prove their loyalty to the United States through work, producing sugar beets to fuel the American war machine.</p> <p>My family had unknowingly become part of a long line of laborers \u2013 white Depression-era migrants; Japanese Americans brutally uprooted from their homes and lives; and later Mexican, Mexican American and Indigenous workers \u2013 to call Caldwell home. But most of them weren\u2019t free to come and go as they pleased, even with legal labor contracts. As the case of Caldwell demonstrates, the line between a farm worked by migrant labor and a prison can be a very blurry one indeed.</p>    <h2>Beets, captive labor and the war machine</h2> <p>My family\u2019s experience is typical of 20th century Mexican American migrant farm laborers. Relegated to labor camps on the nation\u2019s farms, they were forced to forfeit education and stability to follow seasonal crops and meager wages. Crossing borders \u2013 geographic, cultural and linguistic \u2013 was just a way of life.</p> <p>Though I\u2019ve never worked the fields, I\u2019ve frequently heard family stories about life on the road and the inherent violence of migrant farm work. The lesson I gleaned again and again was that to be a farm worker is essentially to be a prisoner and to live in constant fear of police and state violence. That lesson from my family\u2019s long history in the fields set me on the path to become a scholar who studies how prisons and a deeply engrained culture of punishment shape migrant farm work.</p> <p>And for me, one key to understanding that culture lies in Caldwell and its sugar beet industry.</p> <p>The demand for migrant farm workers in Idaho steadily increased during the second world war, as the US military subsidized the production of several crops deemed essential to the war effort.</p> <p>Chief among them were sugar beets. Refined sugar was an important product for the development of military weapons. It could be refined and transformed into synthetic rubber, and sugar alcohols proved to be powerful explosives that drove the US war effort in the Pacific \u2013 used in everything from grenades and bombs to large artillery. According to a fact often cited by the US military, an acre of sugarcane produced a single artillery salvo for a Pacific warship.</p> <p>Hawaii \u2013 the center of American sugar production \u2013 was a battleground after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. That status limited the availability of its sugarcane on the mainland, and companies like Idaho\u2019s Amalgamated Sugar cashed in.</p> <p>Beet season normally lasts from early spring to fall and, during the mid-20th century, involved mowing down rows of planted beets with <a href=\"https://farmcommons.org/outlawing-the-short-handled-hoe/\">small hand hoes</a> to remove excess plants. This type of work was, and still is, considered \u201cstoop labor\u201d, a term that describes the hunched-over position the work requires. Beet thinning was incredibly labor-intensive, and children in the fields weren\u2019t spared. As my mother recalls: \u201cI remember my hands getting so \u2026 sore.

And you work from sunup to sundown.\u201d</p> <p>Beet work wasn\u2019t only painful \u2013 it was also racialized. Fred Cummings, a Colorado sugar beet farmer and executive, pulled no punches about just who should do beet work when he addressed a congressional hearing on immigration in 1926: \u201cThere is not a white man of any intelligence in our country who will work an acre of beets \u2026 I do not want to see a condition arise again when white men who are reared and educated in our schools have got to bend their backs and skin their fingers to pull those little beets.\u201d As he saw it, lawmakers really had only one choice in the face of potential white racial degradation: to \u201clet us have the only class of laborers who will do the work\u201d, a class that consisted of Asian, Mexican and Indigenous farmhands.</p> <p>It was no small wonder, then, that a grueling farm labor camp would be seen as a suitable place for incarcerated Japanese Americans. Originally built in 1939 by the now defunct federal Farm Security Administration, Caldwell was created as part of a nationwide system of camps to house displaced white workers after the Great Depression.

      "bodyText": "My mother, Nora Zavala Gallion, was 11 years old when she first set foot inside the farm labor camp in Caldwell, Idaho. It was 1968, and her family had traveled over 2,000 miles (3,218km) by car from Texas\u2019s Rio Grande valley to harvest sugar beets as migrant laborers. While my family had worked numerous crops across the country for decades, the girl who would become my mother sensed something very different about this location. The camp\u2019s small, dilapidated wooden living quarters were called \u201cbarracks\u201d and featured open, latrine-style bathrooms and showers. Somehow, my mother knew this place had a troubling past. \u201cIn those years, segregation was very prevalent,\u201d she remembered. \u201cWe were not allowed to live within the white city limits of Caldwell. We had to drive 10 miles out of the city limit, then take this gravel road \u2026 And at the top of that gravel road was this encampment. It was surrounded by barbed wire. There\u2019s no way around it: I knew that at one point that this place had been a prison camp for someone, but now it was the only place that Mexicans were allowed to live.\u201d Other Mexican American farm workers who had been there longer soon told the family why the labor camp seemed like a prison. It had been a site of Japanese American incarceration during the second world war. It was part of a network of camps that warehoused more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, rounded up and detained on racially motivated suspicions that they supported the enemy Axis powers of Japan, Germany and Italy. In Caldwell, they would have to prove their loyalty to the United States through work, producing sugar beets to fuel the American war machine. My family had unknowingly become part of a long line of laborers \u2013 white Depression-era migrants; Japanese Americans brutally uprooted from their homes and lives; and later Mexican, Mexican American and Indigenous workers \u2013 to call Caldwell home. But most of them weren\u2019t free to come and go as they pleased, even with legal labor contracts. As the case of Caldwell demonstrates, the line between a farm worked by migrant labor and a prison can be a very blurry one indeed. Beets, captive labor and the war machine My family\u2019s experience is typical of 20th century Mexican American migrant farm laborers. Relegated to labor camps on the nation\u2019s farms, they were forced to forfeit education and stability to follow seasonal crops and meager wages. Crossing borders \u2013 geographic, cultural and linguistic \u2013 was just a way of life. Though I\u2019ve never worked the fields, I\u2019ve frequently heard family stories about life on the road and the inherent violence of migrant farm work. The lesson I gleaned again and again was that to be a farm worker is essentially to be a prisoner and to live in constant fear of police and state violence. That lesson from my family\u2019s long history in the fields set me on the path to become a scholar who studies how prisons and a deeply engrained culture of punishment shape migrant farm work. And for me, one key to understanding that culture lies in Caldwell and its sugar beet industry. The demand for migrant farm workers in Idaho steadily increased during the second world war, as the US military subsidized the production of several crops deemed essential to the war effort. Chief among them were sugar beets. Refined sugar was an important product for the development of military weapons. It could be refined and transformed into synthetic rubber, and sugar alcohols proved to be powerful explosives that drove the US war effort in the Pacific \u2013 used in everything from grenades and bombs to large artillery. According to a fact often cited by the US military, an acre of sugarcane produced a single artillery salvo for a Pacific warship. Hawaii \u2013 the center of American sugar production \u2013 was a battleground after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. That status limited the availability of its sugarcane on the mainland, and companies like Idaho\u2019s Amalgamated Sugar cashed in. Beet season normally lasts from early spring to fall and, during the mid-20th century, involved mowing down rows of planted beets with small hand hoes to remove excess plants. This type of work was, and still is, considered \u201cstoop labor\u201d, a term that describes the hunched-over position the work requires. Beet thinning was incredibly labor-intensive, and children in the fields weren\u2019t spared. As my mother recalls: \u201cI remember my hands getting so \u2026 sore. And I couldn\u2019t close them anymore because of holding the hoe and just going and going because the fields are miles, miles long. And you work from sunup to sundown.\u201d Beet work wasn\u2019t only painful \u2013 it was also racialized. Fred Cummings, a Colorado sugar beet farmer and executive, pulled no punches about just who should do beet work when he addressed a congressional hearing on immigration in 1926: \u201cThere is not a white man of any intelligence in our country who will work an acre of beets \u2026 I do not want to see a condition arise again when white men who are reared and educated in our schools have got to bend their backs and skin their fingers to pull those little beets.\u201d As he saw it, lawmakers really had only one choice in the face of potential white racial degradation: to \u201clet us have the only class of laborers who will do the work\u201d, a class that consisted of Asian, Mexican and Indigenous farmhands. It was no small wonder, then, that a grueling farm labor camp would be seen as a suitable place for incarcerated Japanese Americans. Originally built in 1939 by the now defunct federal Farm Security Administration, Caldwell was created as part of a nationwide system of camps to house displaced white workers after the Great Depression.

But with the outbreak of the second world war, things changed. The Caldwell labor camp was soon repurposed to house detained Japanese Americans and to satisfy the US military\u2019s thirst for sugar. In March 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9102, which ultimately removed Japanese Americans from their homes on the west coast to concentration camps.

      "body": "<p>Tokyo Game Show takes place at the Makuhari Messe, a series of cavernous halls in a suburban complex about 45 minutes east of Tokyo city centre, and given its late September slot in the calendar, it is always either horribly hot or pouring with rain. Either way, it\u2019s humid as heck, and there are many thousands of people crammed in, creating what can only be described as a suboptimal sweat situation. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for TGS. I attended my first one in 2008, and so the experience of playing games in packed halls while understanding very little about what is happening has become powerfully nostalgic.</p> <p>And I surely wasn\u2019t the only person feeling nostalgic in Tokyo last Friday, because the halls were filled with series and characters from 15 years ago. Silent Hill 2 was back on the <strong>Konami</strong> stand, along with Solid Snake\u2019s grizzled face for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater remake. <strong>Capcom</strong> had two huge areas given over to Monster Hunter, a series that was unbelievably popular in Japan throughout the 00s and finally broke through to the world with Monster Hunter World in 2018. <strong>Sony</strong> was also back at the show in a big way for the first time in five years, showing off the PlayStation 5 Pro, and its especially gorgeous-looking PlayStation 30th Anniversary special edition. The Japanese-made Astro Bot was also everywhere at the show \u2013 I hope its sales have reflected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/sep/05/astro-bot-review-team-asobi-playstation-5-team-asobi-sony\">how brilliant it is</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sega</strong>, meanwhile, had given over most of its floorspace to two upcoming games: Persona-like medieval fantasy RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio, and the beautifully, gloriously ridiculous Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, in which one of the infamous antagonists from the Yakuza series, Goro Majima, loses his memory and dosses around in Hawaii on a pirate ship. There were other newer games around, too: Palworld\u2019s developers had splashed out on a massive stand adorned with extremely Pok\u00e9mon-like creatures and costume mascots, making an ostentatious showing despite the recent news that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89lx7xdwd5o\">the company is being sued by Nintendo</a> over alleged copyright infringement.</p>    <p><strong>Namco Bandai</strong> was there with Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, out next week, a beat-em-up that is sure to sell millions. And Infinity Nikki, a dress-up online adventure game from Chinese developer <strong>Papergames</strong>, also had an elaborate presence with lots of frills and hot-air balloons. I am delighted to report that after 10 minutes of dressing Nikki up and running around a fantasy city before jumping down a well to find a crowd of unhappy frogs, I still don\u2019t know what this game is about.</p> <p>The last time I was at TGS, a good 10 years ago, most of the floorspace was dedicated to smartphone <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game\">gatcha games</a>, as the console-centric big developers and publishers faded into the background. It was dispiriting: when I was growing up, Japan <em>was </em>the games industry, and the diminished state of companies such as Sega, Atlus, Konami and even Nintendo for most of the 2010s felt quite sad. This year it looked and felt as if the whole Japanese games industry was in good health.</p> <p><strong>Xbox</strong>, which has always been weak in Japan, also had an unexpectedly large presence: in a news broadcast late last week it announced that the venerable Starcraft and Starcraft 2 were coming to its Game Pass subscription service on PC, and showed off several new games from Japanese developers. Among them was Tanuki: Pon\u2019s Summer, which was one of my personal favourites, made by <strong>DenkiWorks</strong> in Kyoto. You play a lazy <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog\">tanuki</a></em> who has to get a job as a delivery boy to fix up his shrine in time for an important festival, riding around a quaint, small Japanese town delivering packages to people with strange hobbies and pulling off sick tricks on your little BMX. It\u2019s got tremendous personality and cartoonish appeal, and even in the space of a 20-minute demo there were playful nods to about 15 different games, from Tony Hawk to Animal Crossing .</p> <p>That\u2019s another thing I noticed at Tokyo Game Show this year: hundreds of indie games in the quieter halls, from all over the world but plenty of them homegrown, something that you definitely didn\u2019t find 10 years ago. One of them was called Rolling Macho: Tumbling to Earth by <strong>Serialgames</strong>. \u201cThere is no time to worry about why macho is in space or why he does side rolls,\u201d reads <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3160060/Rolling_MachoTumbling_to_Earth/\">its description on Steam</a>. \u201cAll you need to understand is that he is in space and must return to Earth.\u201d Isn\u2019t that a video game premise we can all get behind?</p> <p>I have returned home feeling pleasingly reassured that the kinds of Japanese games I grew up with are still alive and kicking, having played a bunch that piqued my interest. The first of them, Metaphor: ReFantazio is out in just over a week from <strong>Studio Zero</strong>. There\u2019s a demo available now, if a stylish medieval-fantasy JRPG sounds like something that would enhance your life.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>    <p>I felt massively uncomfortable playing <strong>Apartment Story</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/01/apartment-story-review-slice-of-life-game-modern-adult-life-blue-rider-interactive\">a short Sims-esque life-management game</a> about a broke twenty-something games journalist, made by Glaswegian developer Sean Wenham \u2013 because it is so \u2026 intimate.</p> <p>Confined to a small flat, you can shave, rearrange your meagre belongings, snoop into your housemate\u2019s room, do the dishes, stare despondently into the fridge and, uh, take the protagonist to the toilet, all in the low-poly style of a PlayStation 2 game. The story goes off the rails pretty quick, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3069870/Apartment_Story/\">but this game is only \u00a36</a> and a couple of hours long, so it\u2019s worth a shot anyway. Before it turns into a far-fetched thriller, it\u2019s better as a grimly fascinating portrayal of the mundanity of modern life.</p> <p><strong>Available on: </strong>PC<strong><br>Estimated playtime: </strong>1-2 hours, multiple playthroughs possible</p> <h2>What to read</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Ubisoft has delayed <strong>Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows</strong> into February next year.

      "bodyText": "Tokyo Game Show takes place at the Makuhari Messe, a series of cavernous halls in a suburban complex about 45 minutes east of Tokyo city centre, and given its late September slot in the calendar, it is always either horribly hot or pouring with rain. Either way, it\u2019s humid as heck, and there are many thousands of people crammed in, creating what can only be described as a suboptimal sweat situation. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for TGS. I attended my first one in 2008, and so the experience of playing games in packed halls while understanding very little about what is happening has become powerfully nostalgic. And I surely wasn\u2019t the only person feeling nostalgic in Tokyo last Friday, because the halls were filled with series and characters from 15 years ago. Silent Hill 2 was back on the Konami stand, along with Solid Snake\u2019s grizzled face for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater remake. Capcom had two huge areas given over to Monster Hunter, a series that was unbelievably popular in Japan throughout the 00s and finally broke through to the world with Monster Hunter World in 2018. Sony was also back at the show in a big way for the first time in five years, showing off the PlayStation 5 Pro, and its especially gorgeous-looking PlayStation 30th Anniversary special edition. The Japanese-made Astro Bot was also everywhere at the show \u2013 I hope its sales have reflected how brilliant it is. Sega, meanwhile, had given over most of its floorspace to two upcoming games: Persona-like medieval fantasy RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio, and the beautifully, gloriously ridiculous Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, in which one of the infamous antagonists from the Yakuza series, Goro Majima, loses his memory and dosses around in Hawaii on a pirate ship. There were other newer games around, too: Palworld\u2019s developers had splashed out on a massive stand adorned with extremely Pok\u00e9mon-like creatures and costume mascots, making an ostentatious showing despite the recent news that the company is being sued by Nintendo over alleged copyright infringement. Namco Bandai was there with Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, out next week, a beat-em-up that is sure to sell millions. And Infinity Nikki, a dress-up online adventure game from Chinese developer Papergames, also had an elaborate presence with lots of frills and hot-air balloons. I am delighted to report that after 10 minutes of dressing Nikki up and running around a fantasy city before jumping down a well to find a crowd of unhappy frogs, I still don\u2019t know what this game is about. The last time I was at TGS, a good 10 years ago, most of the floorspace was dedicated to smartphone gatcha games, as the console-centric big developers and publishers faded into the background. It was dispiriting: when I was growing up, Japan was the games industry, and the diminished state of companies such as Sega, Atlus, Konami and even Nintendo for most of the 2010s felt quite sad. This year it looked and felt as if the whole Japanese games industry was in good health. Xbox, which has always been weak in Japan, also had an unexpectedly large presence: in a news broadcast late last week it announced that the venerable Starcraft and Starcraft 2 were coming to its Game Pass subscription service on PC, and showed off several new games from Japanese developers. Among them was Tanuki: Pon\u2019s Summer, which was one of my personal favourites, made by DenkiWorks in Kyoto. You play a lazy tanuki who has to get a job as a delivery boy to fix up his shrine in time for an important festival, riding around a quaint, small Japanese town delivering packages to people with strange hobbies and pulling off sick tricks on your little BMX. It\u2019s got tremendous personality and cartoonish appeal, and even in the space of a 20-minute demo there were playful nods to about 15 different games, from Tony Hawk to Animal Crossing . That\u2019s another thing I noticed at Tokyo Game Show this year: hundreds of indie games in the quieter halls, from all over the world but plenty of them homegrown, something that you definitely didn\u2019t find 10 years ago. One of them was called Rolling Macho: Tumbling to Earth by Serialgames. \u201cThere is no time to worry about why macho is in space or why he does side rolls,\u201d reads its description on Steam. \u201cAll you need to understand is that he is in space and must return to Earth.\u201d Isn\u2019t that a video game premise we can all get behind? I have returned home feeling pleasingly reassured that the kinds of Japanese games I grew up with are still alive and kicking, having played a bunch that piqued my interest. The first of them, Metaphor: ReFantazio is out in just over a week from Studio Zero. There\u2019s a demo available now, if a stylish medieval-fantasy JRPG sounds like something that would enhance your life. What to play I felt massively uncomfortable playing Apartment Story, a short Sims-esque life-management game about a broke twenty-something games journalist, made by Glaswegian developer Sean Wenham \u2013 because it is so \u2026 intimate. Confined to a small flat, you can shave, rearrange your meagre belongings, snoop into your housemate\u2019s room, do the dishes, stare despondently into the fridge and, uh, take the protagonist to the toilet, all in the low-poly style of a PlayStation 2 game. The story goes off the rails pretty quick, but this game is only \u00a36 and a couple of hours long, so it\u2019s worth a shot anyway. Before it turns into a far-fetched thriller, it\u2019s better as a grimly fascinating portrayal of the mundanity of modern life. Available on: PC Estimated playtime: 1-2 hours, multiple playthroughs possible What to read Ubisoft has delayed Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows into February next year. The game has been embroiled for months in a contrived culture-war controversy, prompting an (in my opinion) ill-advised apology from its developers a few months back for having \u201ccaused concern\u201d. It\u2019s hard to tell whether this delay is a show of faith on the part of Ubisoft, or damage control. The French publisher\u2019s stock price is at an all-time low after its Star Wars game, Outlaws, sold worse than expected. The Simpsons: Tapped Out has been a mobile game mega-success for 12 years, but it will finally be removed from app stores in January. If you were ever a player, you can play a final farewell quest if you return to the game this month. After playing the new Yakuza game, Pirates in Hawaii, and spending most of my demo time playing a Mario Kart-esque minigame, I came across this insightful breakdown of the series\u2019 characters\u2019 tattoos and their symbolism on Twitter. Meanwhile, the Amazon Prime Yakuza TV series is out this month, and has a new trailer.

      "bodyText": "The Western Australian Labor government has been accused of shelving plans to introduce climate change laws before a state election next March after it left the bill off a list of legislation it hopes to pass. The absence of the climate bill \u2013 from the list of 14 legislative priorities circulated with the Liberal party and crossbench MPs \u2013 reignited claims that WA Labor is in thrall to the gas industry and failing to address the climate crisis. WA is the only Australian state without a 2030 emissions reduction target. National data says climate pollution in the five eastern states fell by at least 27% between 2005 and 2022 while rising 8% in WA, largely due to the state\u2019s expanding liquified natural gas (LNG) export industry. Guardian Australia revealed that modelling presented to the state government late last year suggested its emissions would be about 20% above 2005 levels this year. The climate legislation \u2013 which would formalise a state net zero target for 2050 and eventually require the government to set a statewide emissions target for 2035, but not for 2030 \u2013 was introduced to WA parliament last year. At the time, the state\u2019s climate action minister, Reece Whitby, said the government recognised legislated targets were \u201cthe best way to mobilise the capital required for the net zero transition\u201d. Climate scientists and campaigners have criticised the bill\u2019s targets and timeframes as falling short of what is required to address the problem. The government has also faced some internal resistance over its stance on environmental issues. Greens MP Brad Pettitt said that with only five parliamentary sitting weeks before the election, the priority list showed the government was \u201cnot even going to bring on the very thing that at least could have got WA started\u201d. \u201cThe Cook government\u2019s gas fanaticism is proving to be a self-fulfilling prophecy that is driving future reliance on gas and, unsurprisingly, failing to facilitate the rapid transition to renewable energy the climate science calls for,\u201d Pettitt said. A government spokesperson said Labor was focused on \u201cpassing as many bills as possible\u201d in the remaining parliamentary sitting days this year \u201cincluding our important climate change bill\u201d. They did not explain why it was not on the priority bill list. \u201cWe are committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and codifying that pledge in legislation,\u201d they said. \u201cUnfortunately, the delaying tactics of the Liberals and Nationals present a risk to our legislative agenda.\u201d The premier, Roger Cook, has previously suggested WA may allow its emissions to continue to rise as its gas was leading to a \u201cdramatic reduction in global emissions\u201d by displacing coal-fired power overseas. He has not released evidence to support this claim when asked. According to Our World in Data, the share of electricity from coal-fired power in Japan \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest gas customer \u2013 did not decrease as gas generation increased significantly over the past decade. Gas is often described as having about half the emissions of coal when burned but studies have found this can vary markedly depending on the site and the level of methane leakage during extraction and production.",

      "bodyText": "The chair of the Metropolitan Black Police Association is facing possible dismissal from the force after allegedly sending and receiving \u201cmisogynistic, racist and violent\u201d messages. Insp Charles Ehikioya is accused over \u201cinappropriate\u201d WhatsApp messages between 2017 and 2020, the Met said in a statement. He will face a five-day public misconduct hearing on 6 January, with the Met saying the allegations are so serious that they amount to gross misconduct, which if proved will lead to his dismissal. The statement said: \u201cInspector Charles Ehikioya attached to professionalism headquarters will answer allegations that his conduct amounts to a breach of the standards of professional behaviour in respect of equality and diversity, discreditable conduct and challenging and reporting improper conduct. \u201cBetween 2017 and 2020 Inspector Ehikioya is alleged to have participated in a WhatsApp chat with a police constable in which there was exchange of messages and media items. During the WhatsApp chat it is alleged that he sent/or received messages alleged to be inappropriate. \u201cThe alleged messages and media are said to be misogynistic, racist, violent and otherwise inappropriate. The matter set out above, if proven, is said to amount to gross misconduct, in that it is so serious as to justify dismissal.\u201d In February, the National Black Police Association (NBPA) called for people from ethnic minorities to boycott joining the Met in protest at what it called the \u201cracist and vexatious\u201d misconduct investigation into Ehikioya. In the first call for a boycott in 20 years, the association claimed Ehikioya had been targeted because he voiced concerns about the poor behaviour of senior officers and the racism he alleged he and his colleagues were suffering. The NBPA claimed Ehikioya had been racially abused in a WhatsApp group and that, instead of treating him as a victim, there had been a deliberate and concerted effort to find dubious evidence against him. The MBPA has been approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. The conflict in the Middle East is escalating on multiple fronts. On Tuesday night, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel just after 7.30pm local time, with Israeli officials saying there were at least 180 ballistic missiles \u2013 but most did not reach their targets. The US and UK helped shoot the missiles down. Iran said the actions were a \u201clegal, rational and legitimate response to the terrorist attacks of the Zionist regime\u201d. Israel vowed to retaliate. \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it,\u201d the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told his security cabinet. The website Axios has reported that Israeli officials are considering a \u201csignificant retaliation\u201d to the Iranian attack that could target oil production facilities inside Iran and other strategic sites. On Wednesday morning, Israel announced additional troops were joining its ground invasion into southern Lebanon. And overnight, at least five Israeli strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the early hours, Agence France-Presse reported. Meanwhile in Gaza, Israeli military strikes killed at least 60 people overnight, including in a school sheltering displaced families, health officials in the Palestinian territory said. What are the hopes for de-escalation in the region? \u201cIn such dangerous times, the region has historically looked to Washington to contain and reverse the logic of escalation,\u201d writes the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger. \u201cBut the man currently inhabiting the Oval Office is a lame duck president who has been ignored to the point of humiliation in recent months by the US\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East.\u201d Follow our live blog here Walz and Vance clash over abortion and immigration in vice-presidential debate Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential debate that served up less drama than September\u2019s presidential head to head but offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings and immigration. Both men largely avoided attacks on each other, and instead concentrated their fire on each other\u2019s running mates. It was a more policy-driven discussion than that of their running mates\u2019, but one with a few gaffes that could overshadow some of the substance in the coming days. There was no clear winner of the debate, with a snap SSRS/CNN poll showing 49% for Walz and 51% for Vance. What are the presidential polls saying? It\u2019s neck and neck. Nationally, Kamala Harris is averaging 48.6% versus Donald Trump\u2019s 45.9%, but the races are even closer in the key swing states that will matter most in determining the outcome. Ukraine accuses Russia of executing 16 PoWs on eastern front Authorities in Ukraine have launched an investigation into what they said was the apparent killing of 16 Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered to Russian troops on the eastern frontline. \u201cThis is the largest reported case of the execution of Ukrainian PoWs on the frontline and yet another indication that the killing and torture of prisoners of war are not isolated incidents,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said on X. His office said on the Telegram messaging app that it was looking into a video shared on social media that appeared to show the alleged killing. In the video, grainy drone footage shows a group of more than 10 people leaving a trench. They are lined up and then fall down after being fired upon by other, indistinct figures. What\u2019s the situation on the frontlines? Russian troops have nearly reached the center of Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, according to the regional governor. Vuhledar has strategic significance because of its high ground and location near the junction of the two main fronts. Meanwhile, an apparent Russian artillery strike hit a market in the southern Ukraine city of Kherson on Tuesday, killing at least six people and wounding three others. In other news \u2026 The Swedish government has been accused of trying to \u201coutlaw poverty,\u201d after it presented plans for a national begging ban. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has survived a second parliamentary confidence motion, as opposition parties kept his minority government alive for now. Six people have been killed and 10 others wounded in a shooting and knife attack in the Israeli seaside city of Jaffa. It occurred minutes before Iran launched a huge missile attack on Israel. The hip-hop mogul faces sexual misconduct allegations from 120 accusers in new lawsuit, after his arrest last month following a federal grand jury indictment. The model Naomi Campbell\u2019s charity has been reported to the UK Charity Commission after claiming to be a fundraising partner of Unicef. Stat of the day: San Francisco swelters in 93C heat asheatwave scorches south-west The Californian city recorded its hottest day of the year on Tuesday, while Phoenix set a record for the hottest 1 October on record, as the National Weather Service predicted record-high fall temperatures across the south-west. Across the Bay Area, multiple cities were recording temperatures \u201cas much as 25 degrees above normal\u201d for October, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Don\u2019t miss this: Dump, post, repeat \u2013 how Instagram became a social media junkyard \u201cAn Instagram dump is a set of ostensibly unedited, low-stakes, impressionistic photos posted in a seemingly random order and finished with a dispassionate caption,\u201d writes Emma Madden. \u201cThat word implies that we are merely unloading clutter from our camera rolls on a whim, when what we\u2019re really doing is much more involved.\u201d Climate check: More than 150 dead after Hurricane Helene dumps over 40tn gallons of rain Rescue crews were still trudging through knee-deep muck and debris on Tuesday in the aftermath of the deadly category 4 storm that brought torrential rain to the southern US after it crashed ashore in Florida on Thursday. The amount of rainfall was enough to fill Lake Tahoe \u2013 with its depth of 1,645ft and surface area of 191 sq miles. Last Thing: \u2018I botched my final Harry Potter audition and felt dismay, remorse, shame \u2013 then relief\u2019 \u201cOn the drive home, I experienced two emotions more starkly than I ever had before: disappointment that my life wasn\u2019t about to be transformed, and regret at my half-hearted performance,\u201d writes Jamie Clifton.

The challenge,\u201d she says, \u201cis where you draw the line.\u201d And how far you retrace this history: Trinidadian LGBTQ+ activist Jason Jones blames British colonial-era laws (such as the Buggery Act, in force from 1533 to 1828 in Britain and still in force in former British colonies including Jamaica) and American televangelism for spreading homophobia throughout the Caribbean. \u201cPeople grow and learn at their own pace,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need more nuance and empathy when addressing homophobic music in the Caribbean. A global north approach to human rights does not always work for the global south and can sometimes cause more harm. I would rather see resources and energy put into uplifting young queer dancehall and soca artists and getting their music out to the public. Let\u2019s answer homophobic music with proudly joyous queer music.\u201d",

Upstairs, Nintendo\u2019s many video game consoles, from 1983\u2019s Famicom through 1996\u2019s Nintendo 64 to 2017\u2019s Switch, are displayed reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese company\u2019s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a <em>hanafuda</em><em> </em>playing card manufacturer in 1889.

      "bodyText": "Traditionally, visitors to Kyoto in October come for momijigari, the turning of the autumn leaves in the city\u2019s picturesque parks. This autumn, however, there is a new draw: a Nintendo museum. The new attraction, which opens on Wednesday, is best described as a chapel of video game nostalgia. Upstairs, Nintendo\u2019s many video game consoles, from 1983\u2019s Famicom through 1996\u2019s Nintendo 64 to 2017\u2019s Switch, are displayed reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese company\u2019s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a hanafuda playing card manufacturer in 1889. Downstairs, there are interactive exhibits with comically gigantic controllers and floor-projected playing cards. Situated on the site of the video game company\u2019s old manufacturing plant in Uji, a 20-minute train ride south of central Kyoto, the museum is expected to welcome up to 2,000 people a day. Tickets \u2013 which are allocated via a lottery system and cost 3,300 yen (\u00a317) for an adult \u2013 are sold out three months in advance.

You hurt our schools. Our streets are dirty. Our children are harassed by the police.\u201d</p> <p>After a few minutes, Adams was able to speak and took questions from reporters, who had just got their hands on the freshly unsealed indictment against the mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/who-is-eric-adams-nyc-mayor-indicted\">Who is Eric Adams, the New York City mayor charged with corruption?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sprawling, 57-page filing alleged that for years in the run-up to his mayoral election Adams knowingly sought out and accepted illegal campaign contributions funneled to him by people part of or close to the Turkish government \u2013 not to mention luxury hotel stays and more than $100,000 worth of free or discounted flights going everywhere from France to Sri Lanka to China.<br><br>The day after the indictment\u2019s release, Adams had to go to court.

And after months of protests over the police killing of George Floyd and a temporary rise in shootings, Adams rode a tough-on-crime backlash into office, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-eric-adams-won-the-new-york-city-mayoral-primary/\">eking</a> out a victory over a former garbage commissioner with less campaign cash and little name recognition.<br><br>\u201cLook at me and you\u2019re seeing the future of the Democratic party,\u201d Adams told supporters at the time. \u201cIf the Democratic party fails to recognise what we did here in New York, they\u2019re going to have a problem in the midterm elections and they\u2019re going to have a problem in the presidential election.\u201d</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t just Adams who was predicting big things.</p> <p>A chorus of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/opinion/eric-adams-nyc-mayor.html\">national</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/manchin-adams-2024-new-york-mayor-crime-murder-broken-window-presidential-prospect-democrat-leadership-11641418875\">political</a> columnists, consultants and analysts heralded his coming reign.

But former Adams staffers, aides, local lobbyists and elected officials \u2013 the kind of people who know how the Empire state runs \u2013 say they\u2019re not surprised.<br><br>Adams came to power through the backrooms of New York machine politics, a seedy but powerful subculture built more on favour-trading and loyalty than any strong ideological convictions. Over two decades, Adams attached himself to influential state lawmakers and party bosses from Brooklyn, cultivated some of the borough\u2019s top real estate and legal titans, and developed a close-knit coterie of advisers and staffers who rose with him for years from the fringes of Brooklyn politics.</p>    <p><br>This political network and Adams\u2019s own unceasing work ethic helped the candidate build a campaign war chest that proved large enough to get him past the finish line in 2021 \u2013 a fact he well understood.</p> <p>\u201cYou win the race by raising money. Have to raise money. Everything else is fluff,\u201d Adams texted a close supporter ahead of the election, according to messages cited in the indictment. \u201cI have a 7 million dollar race. I have a clear plan to raise it and each night we are out executing the plan.\u201d</p> <p>But it was this exacting drive, prosecutors allege, that caused him to cross ethical and legal lines in the pursuit of campaign cash and the power that comes with it.</p> <p>In the indictment, former Adams staffers, who appear to have cut deals with prosecutors as they built their case, claimed that their boss personally solicited illegal donations from foreign businessmen and approved of \u201cstraw donor\u201d schemes, which used American residents as pass-throughs to mask the money\u2019s true origin. One text message exchange cited in the indictment shows Adams personally pushing a staffer to seek \u201chelp\u201d from a Turkish businessman, now accused of funneling him straw donations.<br><br>Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for Adams, did not provide the Guardian with a comment for this story. Vito Pitta, Adams\u2019s campaign counsel, and Alex Spiro, Adams\u2019s criminal defence attorney, did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Last Friday, after Adams formally pleaded not guilty, he stood outside federal court with Spiro, his attorney, who predicted the charges would be dismissed and accused prosecutors of bringing the case because they were excited by the \u201cspectacle\u201d.<br><br>How aware, how involved the mayor was in these alleged schemes, may soon be left up to a jury to decide.

In the years after he was released from prison, the former lawmaker benefited from his association with Adams, as the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/23/eric-adams-weihong-hu-fundraiser-new-york-city-mayor\">previously reported</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018A </strong><strong>true </strong><strong>friend of Turkey</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Since he was an NYPD officer in the mid-nineties, Adams had quietly harboured ambitions to become mayor, and, in 2013, he took the next step towards his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/nyregion/eric-adams-mayor-nyc.html\">goal</a>, becoming borough president of Brooklyn. The position had few major responsibilities, but it served as an excellent launching pad for his long-planned mayoral bid.</p> <p>Once in office, Adams began using the post to boost his profile. He <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2021/04/22/how-eric-adams-official-charity-boosted-his-profile-ahead-of-mayoral-run-1377468\">hung</a> a large banner of himself on the columns at the front of borough hall.

And soon he began flying to countries around the world \u2013 cultivating relationships with foreign government officials and business leaders, which frequently preceded <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/12/07/eric-adams-donor-claims-boss-reimbursed/\">suspicious</a> <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/08/18/eric-adams-straw-donors-new-world-mall/\">clusters</a> of campaign donations from members of those nations\u2019 diasporas back in New York City.<br><br>In his second year in the new post, Adams found time to take two trips to Turkey, arranged by a Turkish government official and businessmen with ties to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, according to federal prosecutors.</p> <p>In 2016, the Turkish government official connected Adams to a manager at Turkish Airlines, which is partially state-owned. And in the years that followed, prosecutors allege, the airlines provided Adams and members of his inner circle more than $100,000 worth of free or discounted airfares to India, France, China, Hungary, Ghana and Turkey, where the borough president enjoyed free dinners, a boat tour of the Princes\u2019 Islands in the Sea of Marmara and a Turkish bath at a seaside hotel, among other perks. <br><br>In 2021, with Adams at this point officially running for mayor, the Turkish government official personally helped him harvest illegal campaign cash, according to the indictment. In one case, a New York City-based Turkish construction owner, acting at the behest of the Erdo\u011fan official, held a fundraiser for Adams, prosecutors allege. The government official sent his driver to deliver campaign checks to the event, and the construction owner had several of his employees act as straw donors each giving $1,250 to Adams, having received the exact same lump sums earlier from their boss.</p> <p>Two months later, Adams won New York City\u2019s Democratic primary, in effect making him the mayor-in-waiting.<br><br>That September, the Turkish official, having cultivated Adams for almost six years, asked his friend for help, prosecutors allege.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s was visiting New York City for a United Nations meeting, and the Turkish consulate needed to ensure the president\u2019s trip would coincide with the opening of a $300m glass skyscraper, slated to serve as the headquarters of multiple Turkish diplomatic missions, according to prosecutors. But the building still had numerous fire safety defects, which Turkish officials feared would prevent their leader from being able to preside over its inauguration.</p> <p>So the Turkish government official began reaching out to Adams\u2019s eastern Europe Muslim countries liaison, the federal indictment alleges, telling her that Turkey had supported Adams and now it was \u201chis turn\u201d to support Turkey.</p>    <p>The next day, Adams sent his liaison a message saying he would contact the fire department, prosecutors allege. And in the days that followed, Adams repeatedly contacted the fire commissioner to fast-track the process, even as one department employee warned higher-ups that the site\u2019s fire alarm system had \u201cmajor issues\u201d, according to messages cited in the filing.<br><br>\u201cIn my opinion, this document does not take any liability that we would be comfortable with,\u201d wrote the department official on 9 September, referring to a letter from a consulate contractor describing the state of the alarm system, according to an email included in the indictment. \u201cI believe it actually tells us this building is not safe to occupy.\u201d<br><br>The next morning, Adams pushed the fire commissioner for an inspection, messages cited in the indictment show. \u201cThey really need someone \u2026 by today if possible,\u201d Adams wrote. <br><br>That afternoon after additional department outreach from Adams, one of the commissioner\u2019s direct subordinates told the agency\u2019s fire prevention chief that if he did not clear the bureaucratic hurdles for the Turkish consulate, they would both lose their jobs, prosecutors allege.

      "bodyText": "Last week, on a grey September morning, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, was struggling to get ahead of federal prosecutors. News had already leaked that Adams, a former police officer who won in 2021 with a law-and-order message, was about to become the first mayor in city history to be indicted on federal corruption charges. Just minutes before the US attorney for the southern district of New York \u2013 an office known for taking on white collar criminals and the mafia \u2013 formally announced charges of bribery, wire fraud and the solicitation of campaign contributions from foreign nationals, Adams held his own press conference, in which he painted himself as the victim of a 10-month-long campaign of \u201cleaks\u201d, \u201ccommentary\u201d and \u201cdemonising\u201d. \u201cWe are not surprised,\u201d Adams said solemnly, standing at a small wooden podium. \u201cWe expected this.\u201d Behind the mayor stood a line of Black clergy members, an obvious gesture suggesting Adams was part of the long lineage of courageous Black leaders targeted by the white power structure. But as one heckler in the audience that morning made clear, Adams \u2013 who had attempted to cut school budgets, raised rents for rent-stabilised tenants and cozied up to the city\u2019s largely white corps of business leaders \u2013 might have a harder time projecting himself as a victim of the deep state. \u201cThis is not a Black thing. This is a you thing,\u201d the protester shouted, as Adams grinned awkwardly. \u201cYou are a disgrace to all Black people in this city,\u201d the heckler continued. \u201cThe things that you have done are unconscionable. You hurt our schools. Our streets are dirty. Our children are harassed by the police.\u201d After a few minutes, Adams was able to speak and took questions from reporters, who had just got their hands on the freshly unsealed indictment against the mayor. The sprawling, 57-page filing alleged that for years in the run-up to his mayoral election Adams knowingly sought out and accepted illegal campaign contributions funneled to him by people part of or close to the Turkish government \u2013 not to mention luxury hotel stays and more than $100,000 worth of free or discounted flights going everywhere from France to Sri Lanka to China. The day after the indictment\u2019s release, Adams had to go to court. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. This was not the future Adams had imagined for himself three years before when it became clear he was going to become the mayor of the US\u2019s largest city by population. Back then, the candidate\u2019s greatest support seemed to come from beyond. God had previously told Adams, he recalled, that he was \u201cgoing to be the mayor\u201d, and, indeed, in 2021, right before the pivotal Democratic primary, everything seemed to fall into place for the once obscure Brooklyn politico. New York City\u2019s progressive camp cannibalised itself. One of Adams\u2019s top centrist rivals collapsed in the polls due to decades-old harassment allegations. And after months of protests over the police killing of George Floyd and a temporary rise in shootings, Adams rode a tough-on-crime backlash into office, eking out a victory over a former garbage commissioner with less campaign cash and little name recognition. \u201cLook at me and you\u2019re seeing the future of the Democratic party,\u201d Adams told supporters at the time. \u201cIf the Democratic party fails to recognise what we did here in New York, they\u2019re going to have a problem in the midterm elections and they\u2019re going to have a problem in the presidential election.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just Adams who was predicting big things. A chorus of national political columnists, consultants and analysts heralded his coming reign. Even the political forecaster Nate Silver had high hopes for the former Republican cop turned mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s probably foolish to think a NYC mayor will successfully translate into being a national political figure, but I still think Eric Adams would be in my top 5 for \u2018who will be the next Democratic presidential nominee after Joe Biden\u2019,\u201d Silver tweeted a few days after Adams took office. Today, as he faces federal charges, historically bad polls and a growing pool of mayoral challengers smelling blood, Adams looks more like a future one-term mayor than the future of the Democratic party. This was not an outcome that national commentators predicted. But former Adams staffers, aides, local lobbyists and elected officials \u2013 the kind of people who know how the Empire state runs \u2013 say they\u2019re not surprised. Adams came to power through the backrooms of New York machine politics, a seedy but powerful subculture built more on favour-trading and loyalty than any strong ideological convictions. Over two decades, Adams attached himself to influential state lawmakers and party bosses from Brooklyn, cultivated some of the borough\u2019s top real estate and legal titans, and developed a close-knit coterie of advisers and staffers who rose with him for years from the fringes of Brooklyn politics. This political network and Adams\u2019s own unceasing work ethic helped the candidate build a campaign war chest that proved large enough to get him past the finish line in 2021 \u2013 a fact he well understood. \u201cYou win the race by raising money. Have to raise money. Everything else is fluff,\u201d Adams texted a close supporter ahead of the election, according to messages cited in the indictment. \u201cI have a 7 million dollar race. I have a clear plan to raise it and each night we are out executing the plan.\u201d But it was this exacting drive, prosecutors allege, that caused him to cross ethical and legal lines in the pursuit of campaign cash and the power that comes with it. In the indictment, former Adams staffers, who appear to have cut deals with prosecutors as they built their case, claimed that their boss personally solicited illegal donations from foreign businessmen and approved of \u201cstraw donor\u201d schemes, which used American residents as pass-throughs to mask the money\u2019s true origin. One text message exchange cited in the indictment shows Adams personally pushing a staffer to seek \u201chelp\u201d from a Turkish businessman, now accused of funneling him straw donations. Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for Adams, did not provide the Guardian with a comment for this story. Vito Pitta, Adams\u2019s campaign counsel, and Alex Spiro, Adams\u2019s criminal defence attorney, did not respond to requests for comment. Last Friday, after Adams formally pleaded not guilty, he stood outside federal court with Spiro, his attorney, who predicted the charges would be dismissed and accused prosecutors of bringing the case because they were excited by the \u201cspectacle\u201d. How aware, how involved the mayor was in these alleged schemes, may soon be left up to a jury to decide. But for years before the mayor was summoned to stand before a federal judge in lower Manhattan, political insiders say, there were signs that Adams was unafraid to skirt up to the edge of the law on his way to the top. The racetrack scandal When Adams first became a state senator from a working-class part of Brooklyn in the mid-2000s, he had a reputation as a reformer. During his early days as a cop, the Queens native publicly clashed with the department\u2019s white ethnic brass. As a young lawmaker, Adams marched with Occupy Wall Street demonstrators and spoke out against the NYPD\u2019s notorious \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d program, an initiative that pushed cops to search young Black and Latino men en masse in the off-chance that they had a knife or a gun. But while his rhetoric as a press-hungry lawmaker could at times be progressive, Adams \u2013 whose long-term ambition was always to become mayor \u2013 showed more interest in cultivating alliances than passing landmark pieces of legislation. And some of the causes he did champion were obviously in his self-interest. In 2007, Adams, then a moustachioed freshman lawmaker, stood on the Senate floor and shouted about the need for lawmaker raises. \u201cShow me the money,\u201d declared Adams, wagging his finger to the chamber. \u201cShow me the money. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Two years later, Adams found a way to raise more in campaign funds, if not personal ones. In 2008, Adams helped broker a deal that made his good friend, the state senator John Sampson, chair of the chamber\u2019s Democratic majority \u2013 one of three positions at the time that in effect dominated the New York legislature, which was then considered by some to be a finishing school for political corruption. The following year, as chair of the senate racing and wagering committee, Adams got to work with Sampson to decide which company they would recommend for a multibillion-dollar video slot machine contract at a state-owned thoroughbred racetrack in Queens. New York\u2019s inspector general later concluded that the selection process was tainted by favouritism. Investigators found that Sampson, for example, leaked \u201cone or more confidential internal senate analyses of the competing bids\u201d to a lobbyist working for AEG, the company that eventually landed the contract. And Adams and Sampson both met New York\u2019s then governor David Paterson over dinner and pushed him to approve the contract for a company called AEG, Patterson later told investigators. The same month, Adams received more than $6,000 from AEG-linked contributors. Adams would later insist to investigators that he did not meet for dinner, contrary to the claims of the governor and his good friend Sampson. Adams said he just so happened to momentarily bump into the governor, Sampson and an AEG representative at the restaurant. \u201cI just said hello to them and I moved on,\u201d he told investigators, a claim that they said strained \u201ccredulity\u201d. Four days after the contract was awarded to AEG, Adams and Sampson decided to attend a $1.5m \u201cvictory celebration\u201d at the home of the company\u2019s lobbyist. After the scandal came to light, the contract was rescinded. But federal prosecutors never brought any charges against Adams, who insisted long after that he upheld the \u201chighest\u201d of ethical standards throughout the episode. Sampson, who was also not charged for the AEG scandal, was subsequently indicted on embezzlement charges stemming from a separate incident a few years later. In the years after he was released from prison, the former lawmaker benefited from his association with Adams, as the Guardian previously reported. \u2018A true friend of Turkey\u2019 Since he was an NYPD officer in the mid-nineties, Adams had quietly harboured ambitions to become mayor, and, in 2013, he took the next step towards his goal, becoming borough president of Brooklyn. The position had few major responsibilities, but it served as an excellent launching pad for his long-planned mayoral bid. Once in office, Adams began using the post to boost his profile. He hung a large banner of himself on the columns at the front of borough hall. He plastered his image on advertisements for free concerts his office was organising. And soon he began flying to countries around the world \u2013 cultivating relationships with foreign government officials and business leaders, which frequently preceded suspicious clusters of campaign donations from members of those nations\u2019 diasporas back in New York City. In his second year in the new post, Adams found time to take two trips to Turkey, arranged by a Turkish government official and businessmen with ties to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, according to federal prosecutors. In 2016, the Turkish government official connected Adams to a manager at Turkish Airlines, which is partially state-owned. And in the years that followed, prosecutors allege, the airlines provided Adams and members of his inner circle more than $100,000 worth of free or discounted airfares to India, France, China, Hungary, Ghana and Turkey, where the borough president enjoyed free dinners, a boat tour of the Princes\u2019 Islands in the Sea of Marmara and a Turkish bath at a seaside hotel, among other perks. In 2021, with Adams at this point officially running for mayor, the Turkish government official personally helped him harvest illegal campaign cash, according to the indictment. In one case, a New York City-based Turkish construction owner, acting at the behest of the Erdo\u011fan official, held a fundraiser for Adams, prosecutors allege. The government official sent his driver to deliver campaign checks to the event, and the construction owner had several of his employees act as straw donors each giving $1,250 to Adams, having received the exact same lump sums earlier from their boss. Two months later, Adams won New York City\u2019s Democratic primary, in effect making him the mayor-in-waiting. That September, the Turkish official, having cultivated Adams for almost six years, asked his friend for help, prosecutors allege. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s was visiting New York City for a United Nations meeting, and the Turkish consulate needed to ensure the president\u2019s trip would coincide with the opening of a $300m glass skyscraper, slated to serve as the headquarters of multiple Turkish diplomatic missions, according to prosecutors. But the building still had numerous fire safety defects, which Turkish officials feared would prevent their leader from being able to preside over its inauguration. So the Turkish government official began reaching out to Adams\u2019s eastern Europe Muslim countries liaison, the federal indictment alleges, telling her that Turkey had supported Adams and now it was \u201chis turn\u201d to support Turkey. The next day, Adams sent his liaison a message saying he would contact the fire department, prosecutors allege. And in the days that followed, Adams repeatedly contacted the fire commissioner to fast-track the process, even as one department employee warned higher-ups that the site\u2019s fire alarm system had \u201cmajor issues\u201d, according to messages cited in the filing. \u201cIn my opinion, this document does not take any liability that we would be comfortable with,\u201d wrote the department official on 9 September, referring to a letter from a consulate contractor describing the state of the alarm system, according to an email included in the indictment. \u201cI believe it actually tells us this building is not safe to occupy.\u201d The next morning, Adams pushed the fire commissioner for an inspection, messages cited in the indictment show. \u201cThey really need someone \u2026 by today if possible,\u201d Adams wrote. That afternoon after additional department outreach from Adams, one of the commissioner\u2019s direct subordinates told the agency\u2019s fire prevention chief that if he did not clear the bureaucratic hurdles for the Turkish consulate, they would both lose their jobs, prosecutors allege. The fire prevention chief then bypassed standard department procedure and issued a letter clearing the way for the building to open, an action he later described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, according to prosecutors. At 2.17pm, Adams got word and messaged the Erdo\u011fan official minutes later, according to an exchange cited in the indictment: \u201cFrom the commissioner: Letter being drafted now. Everything should be good to go Monday morning.\u201d \u201cYou are Great Eric, we are so happy to hear that \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f,\u201d the Turkish government official wrote, the legal filing states. \u201cYou are a true friend of Turkey.\u201d At a press conference last Thursday, federal prosecutors said the investigation into Adams\u2019s ties to Turkey remained ongoing. (Federal authorities are also currently investigating another longtime Adams liaison linked to separate clusters of alleged straw donations, first revealed by the Guardian US in collaboration with the news sites The City and Documented.) The same morning, outside in the rain, Adams watched as protesters repeatedly interrupted his own press conference, calling him a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and an \u201cembarrassment\u201d. Between their shouts, Adams asked the public to withhold judgement. \u201cEveryone that knows me knows that I follow campaign rules and I follow the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is how I live my life. I don\u2019t see coming into the 60s at my age to all of a sudden change what I\u2019ve done all the time.\u201d",

The strikes, which Iran said were aimed at military bases, were largely thwarted by Israel\u2019s aerial defences with support from its global allies, including the US and the UK. What did Iran fire? Tehran deployed ballistic missiles, which use trajectories outside or near the limits of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, in the attack. It used similar weapons against Israel earlier this year. Why did Iran attack? While details of the timings and nature of the attack were not known in advance, it was not a surprise. World powers have for months predicted a \u201cregional escalation\u201d from Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, in which it has killed 40,000 Palestinians. That followed an attack by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023 that killed about 1,200 Israelis. Israel is now fighting allegations of genocide at the world\u2019s highest court. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have now expanded the war to Lebanon, which they are bombing heavily. Lebanon is home to Iran\u2019s key regional ally, Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into northern Israel in response to the bloodshed in Gaza.

Over the last year, Netanyahu repeatedly defied US efforts to de-escalate the war in Gaza. Earlier last month he may even have intentionally scuttled US diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. And in the past few days, he has backtracked after agreeing to a ceasefire in Lebanon, publicly embarrassing the Biden administration. Now, he is forging ahead with a ground offensive against Hezbollah that will cut another swath of destruction into Lebanon. More than 1,000 civilians died in a series of strikes last week that ultimately assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last week, according to Lebanese officials. No one in Washington will mourn Nasrallah\u2019s death or doubt Israel\u2019s right to self-defense against Iran and Iranian proxies like Hezbollah. But Netanyahu\u2019s decision to expand the war to Lebanon flies in the face of Biden\u2019s multiple calls for restraint and diplomacy.

Meanwhile, the \u201cvictory plan\u201d that Zelenskyy presented to Biden last week was yet another demand for more weapons and an end to restrictions on those the United States has given him. Why can\u2019t Biden do more to rein in his friends? For one, he is hemmed in by his staunch ideological commitment to defending democracy and allies at all costs. These are worthy causes, but centering them so squarely in US foreign policy has made it very hard to influence Israel and Ukraine in their time of need. Zelenskyy and Netanyahu meanwhile fear political disaster if they retreat from their hardline positions. And given that they have paid almost no price for ignoring Washington so far, why change course? To get these problematic friends to align their strategies with US interests, Washington can offer them sweeteners \u2013 for Ukraine, a realistic plan for its postwar security needs; for Israel, the economic benefits of normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia. Both these options are being explored, but they might require major new military commitments that Washington would be wiser to avoid \u2013 full Ukrainian membership in Nato and a US defense treaty with Saudi Arabia. Such incentives therefore need to be combined with tougher love from Washington. To begin with, the White House should not be timid about making clear in public how it sees US interests, even when these diverge from its friends. The Biden administration has grown more critical of Netanyahu recently, but it could still go further, more pointedly perhaps. With Zelenskyy, Biden has mostly pulled his punches. This may be because the White House believes that staunch backing for Kyiv would deter Russia. If so, the plan hasn\u2019t worked. The White House may now also fear that tough love for Zelenskyy could harm Kamala Harris\u2019s chances of winning swing voters in Pennsylvania. Will this work? It\u2019s unclear. Conditioning the levels of military assistance to both countries is another option. Washington regularly conditions foreign assistance, but Biden has been hesitant to do so. Some Democrats may shudder at the thought of curtailing US military support to Ukraine, especially given Donald Trump\u2019s crude proposals to this effect. But unless Ukraine is willing to adopt a strategy to end the war in a realistic timeframe without dangerously escalating it, curtailing support may be the only option to avoid another endless war. Republican proposals to increase pressure simultaneously on the Kremlin and Kyiv could work and should not be ignored by Democrats. Israel, which the United States provides with $3.8bn in annual military aid, has used US bombs extensively in strikes in Gaza and now Lebanon. If elected, Harris may need to go further than Biden has in restricting deliveries of offensive weapons and applying pressure on Netanyahu \u2013 while keeping the screws turned on Iran and its proxies. A Trump administration is unfortunately likely to be keen on the screw turning but timid in pressuring Netanyahu \u2013 just as Biden has been with Zelenskyy.

They represent thousands of utilities, though not all utilities nationwide agree with the trade groups\u2019 positions. The cost for membership is baked into customers\u2019 bills, creating a situation in which consumers are funding the attacks on their water quality.</p> <p>The AWWA is led by <a href=\"https://planetdetroit.org/2024/07/glwas-cheryl-porter-makes-history-as-water-associations-first-black-woman-president/\">Cheryl Porter</a>, an executive with the Great Lakes Water Authority, which delivers water in south-east Michigan. PFAS and lead are a major problem in Michigan, but in her role at AWWA, critics say Porter is leading an organization that is trying to thwart proposals that would clean up the state\u2019s water.</p> <p>She did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the AWWA said it doesn\u2019t oppose PFAS limits, but it is against those the EPA proposed because, it alleges, the EPA \u201cdid not use the best science and data in finalizing the rule\u201d.</p> <p>Industry frequently downplays the public health risks of toxic substances and claims the cost to remove them are too high. In late 2023, at a conference at which industry <a href=\"https://paustenbachandassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FINAL-ARA-Workshop-XIV-Highlights.pdf\">honed its legal attack</a> on PFAS limits, an AWWA manager \u201cquestioned whether regulating PFAS in drinking water represents a meaningful opportunity for public health risk reduction\u201d despite <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/index.html\">overwhelming evidence</a> that the chemicals are toxic at very low levels.</p> <p>The industry has been particularly opposed to limiting lead and removing lead lines. In 1991, when the EPA proposed a rule that would have required utilities to replace lead lines, the AWWA <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/american-water-works-assn-v-epa\">sued</a>, calling it financially \u201cburdensome\u201d. Olson, who worked on the case as an attorney for NRDC, said the EPA caved to AWWA pressure and only required utilities to replace some parts of lead lines when limits exceeded, and the remainder of the cost was put on homeowners.</p> <p>Because of that, many of the nation\u2019s water systems still have lead lines. The Biden administration last year announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/30/replace-lead-drinking-water-pipe-epa#:~:text=Proposed%20EPA%20rules%20require%20US,years%20%7C%20US%20news%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\">a plan</a> to require all lead lines to be replaced within 10 years regardless of whether there is an exceedance of limits, and made $3.5bn in federal funding available.</p> <p>The AWWA <a href=\"https://www.awwa.org/AWWA-Articles/awwa-submits-opinions-to-epa-on-proposed-lead-improvements-rule\">opposes</a> the proposal, and is <a href=\"https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/viewEO12866Meeting?viewRule=true&amp;rin=2040-AG16&amp;meetingId=571373&amp;acronym=2040-EPA/OW\">lobbying</a> the administration, claiming it supports the goal of replacing lead lines, but said the rules \u201care not feasible\u201d, especially in that time frame. Its consultants estimated the initiative would cost $90bn, a figure NRDC <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/larry-levine/report-getting-lead-out-costs-less-you-may-think\">wrote</a> is based on flawed methodology intended to inflate the estimated cost so they can justify killing the rules.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had just agreed in 1991 to a reasonable time frame then the pipes would already be gone, but instead they\u2019ve been fighting it for decades,\u201d Olson said.</p> <p>The former EPA manager and current Harvard researcher Ronnie Levin recalled an anecdote she said is emblematic of how the utility industry kills or weakens rules. The EPA in 1994 was attempting to address carcinogenic byproducts created from disinfectants, or pesticides, used to treat water for microbes. The EPA established a working group with utility industry representatives and developed the rules over the course of a year, Levin said.</p> <p>Industry helped write the rules and agreed on the language, but soon after the rules were proposed, the Chlorine Chemistry Council <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/chlorine-chemistry-council-v-epa\">sued</a> to kill them, Levin said. Meanwhile, utility trade groups lobbied to weaken the rules, Olson said.</p> <p>\u201cThat was disruptive, disingenuous, it was unfair and it did not serve the public interest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In 2011, the EPA began the process for placing drinking water limits for perchlorate, a chemical used in rocket fuel that is estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/reviewed-perchlorate.php\">contaminating water</a> for 12 million people. But the rules, <a href=\"https://www.wwdmag.com/home/news/10915842/awwa-testifies-at-congressional-hearing-on-perchlorate-and-chromium\">opposed by</a> the AWWA, have yet to be implemented. The failure to establish limits is mostly due to the group succeeding in pressuring the EPA to include numerous obstacles in its implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s 1996 revision. That made the limit setting process highly complex and presented ample opportunity to tie up proposed rules.</p> <p>When Congress revised the act, some utilities \u201csucceeded in eviscerating the standard setting provisions\u201d, Olson said. Since then, over 40 contaminants have been identified as chemicals of concern in water but the PFAS limits were the first to make it through the 10-year limit setting process.</p> <p>Utilities also successfully <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/erik-d-olson/epas-new-rules-drinking-water-right-know-reporting-are-mixed-bag\">weakened a 2024 measure </a>that would have required them to alert customers to toxic substances in their water and banned them from making false statements in reports to consumers.</p> <p>Public health advocates concede the cost of meeting new standards is a challenge. Utilities already face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/us-water-poverty-crisis-shut-offs-unpaid-bills\">enormous criticism</a> over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/millions-of-americans-cant-afford-water-bills-rise\">shut offs</a> for low income consumers. Meanwhile, many water departments are part of city governments and they face political pressure to keep rates down.</p> <p>Those factors have kept water rates \u201cartificially low\u201d, said Elin Betanzo, a Michigan-based utility consultant, and basic water infrastructure in many districts is in disrepair. There is also a shortage of technical experts to work at the utilities, Betanzo added, and the nation should invest in creating a talent pipeline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/new-york-city-tap-water-quality\">Do New Yorkers really have \u2018the champagne of tap waters\u2019?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Governments at all levels should spend more so utilities do not have to significantly increase rates to meet new regulations, advocates say.

PFAS and lead are a major problem in Michigan, but in her role at AWWA, critics say Porter is leading an organization that is trying to thwart proposals that would clean up the state\u2019s water. She did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the AWWA said it doesn\u2019t oppose PFAS limits, but it is against those the EPA proposed because, it alleges, the EPA \u201cdid not use the best science and data in finalizing the rule\u201d. Industry frequently downplays the public health risks of toxic substances and claims the cost to remove them are too high. In late 2023, at a conference at which industry honed its legal attack on PFAS limits, an AWWA manager \u201cquestioned whether regulating PFAS in drinking water represents a meaningful opportunity for public health risk reduction\u201d despite overwhelming evidence that the chemicals are toxic at very low levels. The industry has been particularly opposed to limiting lead and removing lead lines. In 1991, when the EPA proposed a rule that would have required utilities to replace lead lines, the AWWA sued, calling it financially \u201cburdensome\u201d. Olson, who worked on the case as an attorney for NRDC, said the EPA caved to AWWA pressure and only required utilities to replace some parts of lead lines when limits exceeded, and the remainder of the cost was put on homeowners. Because of that, many of the nation\u2019s water systems still have lead lines. The Biden administration last year announced a plan to require all lead lines to be replaced within 10 years regardless of whether there is an exceedance of limits, and made $3.5bn in federal funding available. The AWWA opposes the proposal, and is lobbying the administration, claiming it supports the goal of replacing lead lines, but said the rules \u201care not feasible\u201d, especially in that time frame. Its consultants estimated the initiative would cost $90bn, a figure NRDC wrote is based on flawed methodology intended to inflate the estimated cost so they can justify killing the rules. \u201cIf they had just agreed in 1991 to a reasonable time frame then the pipes would already be gone, but instead they\u2019ve been fighting it for decades,\u201d Olson said. The former EPA manager and current Harvard researcher Ronnie Levin recalled an anecdote she said is emblematic of how the utility industry kills or weakens rules. The EPA in 1994 was attempting to address carcinogenic byproducts created from disinfectants, or pesticides, used to treat water for microbes. The EPA established a working group with utility industry representatives and developed the rules over the course of a year, Levin said. Industry helped write the rules and agreed on the language, but soon after the rules were proposed, the Chlorine Chemistry Council sued to kill them, Levin said. Meanwhile, utility trade groups lobbied to weaken the rules, Olson said. \u201cThat was disruptive, disingenuous, it was unfair and it did not serve the public interest,\u201d she said. In 2011, the EPA began the process for placing drinking water limits for perchlorate, a chemical used in rocket fuel that is estimated to be contaminating water for 12 million people. But the rules, opposed by the AWWA, have yet to be implemented. The failure to establish limits is mostly due to the group succeeding in pressuring the EPA to include numerous obstacles in its implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s 1996 revision. That made the limit setting process highly complex and presented ample opportunity to tie up proposed rules. When Congress revised the act, some utilities \u201csucceeded in eviscerating the standard setting provisions\u201d, Olson said. Since then, over 40 contaminants have been identified as chemicals of concern in water but the PFAS limits were the first to make it through the 10-year limit setting process. Utilities also successfully weakened a 2024 measure that would have required them to alert customers to toxic substances in their water and banned them from making false statements in reports to consumers. Public health advocates concede the cost of meeting new standards is a challenge. Utilities already face enormous criticism over shut offs for low income consumers. Meanwhile, many water departments are part of city governments and they face political pressure to keep rates down. Those factors have kept water rates \u201cartificially low\u201d, said Elin Betanzo, a Michigan-based utility consultant, and basic water infrastructure in many districts is in disrepair. There is also a shortage of technical experts to work at the utilities, Betanzo added, and the nation should invest in creating a talent pipeline. Governments at all levels should spend more so utilities do not have to significantly increase rates to meet new regulations, advocates say. However, the utilities seem to spend their limited resources attacking clean water rules more than attempting lobbying for funding. \u201cThey say, \u2018Our customers need low water rates,\u2019 but nobody wants to save money on unsafe water,\u201d Betanzo said. \u201cSomehow they have enough money for lobbyists to fight regulations.\u201d In its statement to the Guardian, the AWWA said it does not oppose new rules, adding: \u201cWe strongly support the polluter pays principle when it comes to addressing PFAS in water, rather than passing on costs to drinking water consumers.\u201d Many utilities are managed by conservative people ideologically opposed to regulations, Levin said, and Olson added that those that are opposed to new regulations \u201care often the loudest voices. \u201cIt\u2019s the folks that don\u2019t want to do anything who rule the day,\u201d Olson said.",

      "bodyText": "Two of social media\u2019s most talked-about characters faced off during the vice-presidential debate. On one side: the folksy, avuncular, pet-loving Minnesota governor, Tim Walz. On the other: the Ohio senator JD Vance, whose campaign trail gaffes \u2013 awkwardly ordering doughnuts, railing against \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d \u2013 are top-tier meme fodder. Whatever happened on the debate stage or in the spin rooms, the most widely viewed analysis lives on social media. Right from the start, viewers and commentators noticed the difference between Walz and Vance\u2019s debating styles. During the first question about the unfolding crisis in the Middle East, Walz came off as nervous, fumbling over talking points. Vance tried to avoid the question. Because why talk about Iran when you can remind folks you wrote the New York Times bestseller Hillbilly Elegy? \u201cWeird science\u201d, a reference to the 1985 John Hughes teen sci-fi flick, became one of the night\u2019s earliest catchphrases, after Vance evoked it in reference to the climate crisis. Perhaps not the best choice of words for someone whose opponent has described as \u201cweird\u201d many times on the campaign trail \u2013 much to the delight of younger voters. Vance\u2019s appearance reignited one of the most persistent conspiracy theories of this election: does the Ohio senator wear eyeliner? His wife, Usha Vance, has shot down these rumors, telling the Puck fashion correspondent Lauren Sherman: \u201cThey\u2019re all natural.\u201d Even still, Twitter/X users delighted in comparing Vance\u2019s debate night look to emo musicians or a teenage Miley Cyrus. Still, one person was impressed with Vance\u2019s appearance: the former state representative and convicted felon George Santos, who tweeted: \u201cCan anyone confirm Vance is on Ozempic? He\u2019s looking thin and good!\u201d And what about Walz? Eagle-eyed viewers spotted a friendship bracelet on the governor\u2019s wrist. Some wondered if it was a nod to Taylor Swift, who has endorsed Kamala Harris and counts the accessory as part of her brand. The Harris campaign sells a similar style for $20. Maybe he\u2019s ordered one. The debate moderators got time in the spotlight, too. When CBS News\u2019s Margaret Brennan tried to move on from a question about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, Vance would not let her, instead trying to talk about a specific emergency visa. As he kept speaking over her, Brennan let out a strained: \u201cThank you senator for describing the legal process.\u201d On X, many women noted Brennan\u2019s tired delivery \u2013 relatable for those who have been spoken over or mansplained to at work. Vance also whined when moderators corrected a comment on immigration. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t fact-check me,\u201d he groaned, as if he were angry at journalists for doing their job. Viewers at home noted the absurdity of his statement. But the conservative commentator Megyn Kelly incredulously tweeted: \u201cF you CBS \u2013 how DARE YOU.\u201d Meanwhile over on Truth Social, Donald Trump dismissively called the anchors \u201cyoung ladies\u201d who were \u201cextremely biased\u201d during his play-by-play of the debate. One of Walz biggest flubs of the night came during a question on gun control, when the governor said: \u201cI\u2019ve been friends with school shooters.\u201d A slip of the tongue, but conservative social media accounts latched on to such a bonkers statement, and one of the strangest lines of the night. By the end of the night, Walz regained his friendly delivery for his planned closing statement, thanking Americans who had skipped out on watching Dancing with the Stars to view the debate, and bragging about Harris\u2019s coalition of supporters, \u201cfrom Bernie Sanders, to Dick Cheney, to Taylor Swift\u201d \u2013 quite the lineup.

(When he begins one sentence with \u201cAs per yourself,\u201d we can place the type exactly.) Distracted from his task, Henry\u2019s mind wanders, brooding on, among other things, mass tourism in the Instagram age (\u201cThe flattening of the world to wallpaper for the grinning head\u201d), the marketisation of education and the perniciousness of&nbsp;corporate jargon. We&nbsp;remain inside his head for most of the next 200-odd pages, intermittently checking back in&nbsp;with the voluble tech&nbsp;bro, who embodies everything Henry hates about the 21st century; his&nbsp;animus builds to almost psychotic proportions as the novel progresses.</p> <p>The sociological ruminations soon give way to a personal narrative.

We eventually circle back to Henry\u2019s childhood, via a heart-rending anecdote about a school bully who once forced a fellow pupil to eat faeces. Henry\u2019s father had been an aloof and domineering figure, but in his latter years, \u201cpockets of eccentricity and kindness were opened\u201d, and a tentative camaraderie developed between them: \u201cthe two of us, sat side by side, each opened the door of our solitude to the other\u201d.</p> <p>All My Precious Madness is an&nbsp;astutely observed portrait of intellectual melancholia. We tend to associate nostalgia with reactionary politics, but it can, of course, take other forms too: with his blend of sweary, disaffected rage and leftwing idealism, the narrator\u2019s sensibility recalls the US comic Bill Hicks.

      "body": "<p>This film is ostensibly about Maya Gabeira, a Brazilian competitive big-wave surfer (ie towed on special boards into waves of 20ft and over), and her struggle to compete again after a devastating injury in 2013. And yes, it certainly is about her, but it\u2019s almost as if everyone involved \u2013 Gabeira, people who were supposedly her closest associates, and even the director Stephanie Johnes \u2013 aren\u2019t quite conscious of the fact that they\u2019re also making a documentary about endemic sexism in sport. You can almost see awareness of that latter theme coming to mind in the last half of the film, when Maya goes to battle with the organisation that\u2019s meant to champion athletes in her field but which seemingly closes ranks against her lest her achievement makes that of her male peers seem less impressive. To explain further risks spoiling the film, which transcends its by-numbers sports doc set-up and evolves into something more thoughtful.</p> <p>In fact, it\u2019s kind of a disappointment that Johnes, whose previous credits include several other sports docs as well as work with muckraking film-maker Alex Gibney, doesn\u2019t lean harder into a feminist perspective. Maybe that\u2019s not something Gabeira actually wanted; she is a woman who comes across as easygoing, forgiving and, in the early runnings, seemingly happy to be made famous not just for her surfing prowess but also for the good looks that made her such a promotable figure in the sport. Even former sporting partner Carlos Burle, a surfer himself who operated the jet ski that towed Gabeira to the waves in the early part of her career, is seen here praising how she had \u201cnice tits\u201d and a \u201cnice ass\u201d, as a montage of surf magazine covers fly by, all featuring Gabeira in a bikini.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ElZ_dqgMA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/44ElZ_dqgMA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Needless to say, one does not wear a bikini while surfing big waves. When Gabeira had a wipeout in Nazar\u00e9, Portugal in 2013 \u2013 all of it caught on camera and shown here, albeit featuring a tiny figure seen from a great distance \u2013 Burle was the one who towed her to shore. The film just skirts suggesting that his actions may have contributed to her nearly drowning. But he certainly doesn\u2019t cover himself in glory when he says after the medics took her away to hospital, he got back in the water and continued surfing because the waves were so great that day. Indeed, like water rushing in to plug a gap, the whole industry seemed to mindlessly fill the void after her injury took her out of competing for a while. </p> <p>However, the story does have a happy ending, one partly facilitated by the actions of little girls in princess outfits accompanied by adorable pets who used the power of internet crowd-sourcing to shift sentiment, with <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/world-surf-league-a-world-record-for-women-in-big-wave-surfing?rec\">an online petition</a> to get the big wave people to <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2020/9/brazilian-surfer-maya-gabeira-breaks-largest-wave-surfed-record-630505\">submit Gabeira to Guinness World Records</a>. Those cute videos are almost worth the price of admission alone if you\u2019re not already coming for the spectacular cinematography of tubular swells and 60ft-high walls of water. But all that is why we love sports movies in the first place, surely.</p> <p>\u2022 Maya and the Wave is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 October.</p>",

And yes, it certainly is about her, but it\u2019s almost as if everyone involved \u2013 Gabeira, people who were supposedly her closest associates, and even the director Stephanie Johnes \u2013 aren\u2019t quite conscious of the fact that they\u2019re also making a documentary about endemic sexism in sport. You can almost see awareness of that latter theme coming to mind in the last half of the film, when Maya goes to battle with the organisation that\u2019s meant to champion athletes in her field but which seemingly closes ranks against her lest her achievement makes that of her male peers seem less impressive. To explain further risks spoiling the film, which transcends its by-numbers sports doc set-up and evolves into something more thoughtful. In fact, it\u2019s kind of a disappointment that Johnes, whose previous credits include several other sports docs as well as work with muckraking film-maker Alex Gibney, doesn\u2019t lean harder into a feminist perspective. Maybe that\u2019s not something Gabeira actually wanted; she is a woman who comes across as easygoing, forgiving and, in the early runnings, seemingly happy to be made famous not just for her surfing prowess but also for the good looks that made her such a promotable figure in the sport. Even former sporting partner Carlos Burle, a surfer himself who operated the jet ski that towed Gabeira to the waves in the early part of her career, is seen here praising how she had \u201cnice tits\u201d and a \u201cnice ass\u201d, as a montage of surf magazine covers fly by, all featuring Gabeira in a bikini. Needless to say, one does not wear a bikini while surfing big waves. When Gabeira had a wipeout in Nazar\u00e9, Portugal in 2013 \u2013 all of it caught on camera and shown here, albeit featuring a tiny figure seen from a great distance \u2013 Burle was the one who towed her to shore. The film just skirts suggesting that his actions may have contributed to her nearly drowning. But he certainly doesn\u2019t cover himself in glory when he says after the medics took her away to hospital, he got back in the water and continued surfing because the waves were so great that day. Indeed, like water rushing in to plug a gap, the whole industry seemed to mindlessly fill the void after her injury took her out of competing for a while. However, the story does have a happy ending, one partly facilitated by the actions of little girls in princess outfits accompanied by adorable pets who used the power of internet crowd-sourcing to shift sentiment, with an online petition to get the big wave people to submit Gabeira to Guinness World Records. Those cute videos are almost worth the price of admission alone if you\u2019re not already coming for the spectacular cinematography of tubular swells and 60ft-high walls of water. But all that is why we love sports movies in the first place, surely. \u2022 Maya and the Wave is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 October.",

      "bodyText": "Iran is bracing itself for likely Israeli attacks on its nuclear sites as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urged the west to leave the Middle East. Khamenei met students and scientists on Wednesday in his first public appearance since ordering a high-risk missile attack on Israel in response to Israel\u2019s attacks on the leadership of Hezbollah, the armed group Tehran has funded in Lebanon. Iran, he said, was still in mourning over the assassination last Friday of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, but added: \u201cBeing in mourning does not mean being depressed and sitting in a corner.\u201d Iran\u2019s attack has appeared to rally the country\u2019s previously divided political elite as the leadership justified the attack on Israel by insisting it was effective, lawful and unavoidable to restore deterrence and Iran\u2019s sovereignty. Abbas Araghchi, the foreign minister, made a round of diplomatic calls, including to European foreign ministers, insisting that Iran was not seeking escalation. Unlike Israeli attacks in Lebanon, Iran\u2019s targets had been strictly military and not civilian, he claimed. Asked on Wednesday if Iran had given any direct warnings to the US about the attacks, he said: \u201cNo, I do not confirm such a thing. But we had an exchange of messages through the Swiss embassy in Tehran, giving the necessary warnings to the US.\u201d He said that message was sent after Iran had launched the missiles into Israel. Switzerland has long acted as a diplomatic intermediary for the US in Tehran. Part of the purpose of Araghchi\u2019s calls was to convey the limits of the Iranian operation, and to urge the US and Europe to insist in turn that Israel show restraint in its response. He added: \u201cI anticipate that we may gradually witness a return to some form of stability in the region in the coming days.\u201d Iran\u2019s defence minister, Aziz Nasirzadeh, also urged Europe to contain Israel. \u201cOtherwise they will face Iran\u2019s response and the region will enter into a great war,\u201d he said. At a meeting of the UN security council in New York later on Wednesday Iran is expected to defend its actions in line with the UN Charter. Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, the head of Iran\u2019s general staff of the armed forces, said the missiles targeted Israeli airbases, including the Nevatim base, which houses F35 planes, as well as the Mossad headquarters. Images of the leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Council (IRGC) watching the attack on TV monitors showed them shouting \u201cbeautiful\u201d as the missiles struck the ground and exploded. Speaking of Israel\u2019s likely response, Mohammad Baqir Qalibaf, speaker of the parliament, said: \u201cWe have prepared ourselves for the possible madness of Israel and have designed an unexpected plan, and our next response to possible aggressions will be on a very different level.\u201d But observers said there was also a sense of foreboding. Iran knows its largely Russian-supplied aerial defences are rudimentary, and that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made it an explicit war objective to change the balance of power in Middle East, which many take as a code for weakening Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.

Democrats must again be breathing a sigh of relief that they jettisoned Biden after his miserable debate performance in June. The president steeped in foreign policy is running at one catastrophe a year: the botched Afghanistan withdrawal of 2021, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the deadly Hamas attack on Israel in 2023.</p>    <p>He has tried and failed to wield influence over the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Gaza. Last week, Biden told reporters about a plan for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon and seemed to think Netanyahu was onboard; a day later, a massive Israeli airstrike killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/hassan-nasrallah-obituary\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>, the leader of Hezbollah. It looked like a case study in presidential impotence and the limits of American power.</p> <p>Now, after the Iranian missile assault, Israel has vowed to retaliate and Republicans are ready to pounce. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/nikki-haley-trump-endorsement-2024-election\">Nikki Haley</a>, a former US ambassador to the UN, told Fox News: \u201cYou look at the time under Trump, there were no wars, there were no conflicts, and the reason is at least our allies knew where we stood. With Biden and Harris, they never know where we stand.\u201d</p> <p>This talking point \u2013 a world in disarray under Biden, in contrast to years of glorious peace under Trump \u2013 should come with plenty of caveats, not least Trump\u2019s decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal and strike a deal to end the war in Afghanistan. It is also harder to make now that Biden has made way for Harris.</p> <p>The vice-president has spent her candidacy pursuing a Goldilocks principle: not too hot on Biden, not too cold on Biden, but displaying just-right loyalty. She heaps praise on the president and delivered an address at the Democratic national convention that channelled Biden on US leadership in the world. But she is also the candidate of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/09/kamala-harris-donald-trump-change-campaign-strategies\">turn the page</a>\u201d and \u201ca new way forward\u201d who will never let the phrase \u201cBidenomics\u201d pass her lips again.</p> <p>Current events are again testing where Harris the vice-president ends and Harris the candidate begins. Activists on the left are eager for any hint that she will give Palestinians a more sympathetic ear and take a harder line on Netanyahu. The Uncommitted National Movement has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/19/harris-uncommitted-movement-declines-endorse\">declined to endorse her</a>, citing her unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/10/01/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-and-secretary-of-homeland-security-alejandro-mayorkas/\">White House press briefing</a>, one reporter was eager to know what her engagement had been like during the Iranian attack on Israel. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, was at pains to say that Harris had joined the president in the situation room.</p> <p>\u201cShe was <em>there</em>,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cShe was alongside him in getting that update, and she many times has been in the room or, as you just said, has called in when it\u2019s come to really important, critical national security issues.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Harris herself made an unplanned public appearance to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/01/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-the-iranian-ballistic-missile-attack-against-israel/\">address the Middle East escalation</a> \u2013 reaffirming her commander-in-chief credentials in a way she would not have felt obliged to do four months ago. She took care to note that she had been in the situation room and promised: \u201cMy commitment to the security of Israel is unwavering.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, both candidates are racing to put their stamp on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/hurricane-helene-rainfall\">Hurricane Helene</a>, which crashed ashore in Florida last Thursday with a wind field stretching 350 miles from its centre. It has killed at least 150 people and wiped out hundreds of homes and businesses. The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, described it as being of \u201can historic magnitude\u201d.</p> <p>Trump travelled to Georgia on Monday and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/trump-visits-georgia-after-hurricane-helene-false-biden-claims\">falsely claimed that Biden</a> had not spoken to its governor, Brian Kemp. Harris will travel to Georgia on Wednesday and to North Carolina in the coming days. The stakes are high: administrations have long been haunted by the failed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p> <p>But it is the third crisis that could have the biggest electoral impact of all. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/us-port-workers-strike-ila-union\">first dockworkers\u2019 strike</a> since 1977 could snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. That would be a political gift to Trump, whose polling lead on the economy has been eroded by Harris. Both are vying for trade union support.</p> <p>Trump, who has previously praised Elon Musk for firing workers who go on strike, <a href=\"https://djt.nucleusemail.com/amplify/v/8cPpKgJjD7?hids=Qo5ouzx&amp;_nlid=ykxvKGfeeF&amp;_nhids=Qo5ouzx\">said in a statement</a>: \u201cThe situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have \u2026 Americans who thrived under President Trump can\u2019t even get by because of Kamala Harris \u2013 this strike is a direct result of her actions.\u201d</p> <p>All this and it was still only 1 October. The only surprise now would be if there are no more <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4907731-5-october-surprises-trump-harris-race/\">October surprises</a> to come.</p>",

Last week, Biden told reporters about a plan for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon and seemed to think Netanyahu was onboard; a day later, a massive Israeli airstrike killed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. It looked like a case study in presidential impotence and the limits of American power. Now, after the Iranian missile assault, Israel has vowed to retaliate and Republicans are ready to pounce. Nikki Haley, a former US ambassador to the UN, told Fox News: \u201cYou look at the time under Trump, there were no wars, there were no conflicts, and the reason is at least our allies knew where we stood. With Biden and Harris, they never know where we stand.\u201d This talking point \u2013 a world in disarray under Biden, in contrast to years of glorious peace under Trump \u2013 should come with plenty of caveats, not least Trump\u2019s decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal and strike a deal to end the war in Afghanistan. It is also harder to make now that Biden has made way for Harris. The vice-president has spent her candidacy pursuing a Goldilocks principle: not too hot on Biden, not too cold on Biden, but displaying just-right loyalty. She heaps praise on the president and delivered an address at the Democratic national convention that channelled Biden on US leadership in the world. But she is also the candidate of \u201cturn the page\u201d and \u201ca new way forward\u201d who will never let the phrase \u201cBidenomics\u201d pass her lips again. Current events are again testing where Harris the vice-president ends and Harris the candidate begins. Activists on the left are eager for any hint that she will give Palestinians a more sympathetic ear and take a harder line on Netanyahu. The Uncommitted National Movement has declined to endorse her, citing her unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy. At the White House press briefing, one reporter was eager to know what her engagement had been like during the Iranian attack on Israel. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, was at pains to say that Harris had joined the president in the situation room. \u201cShe was there,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cShe was alongside him in getting that update, and she many times has been in the room or, as you just said, has called in when it\u2019s come to really important, critical national security issues.\u201d Later, Harris herself made an unplanned public appearance to address the Middle East escalation \u2013 reaffirming her commander-in-chief credentials in a way she would not have felt obliged to do four months ago. She took care to note that she had been in the situation room and promised: \u201cMy commitment to the security of Israel is unwavering.\u201d Similarly, both candidates are racing to put their stamp on Hurricane Helene, which crashed ashore in Florida last Thursday with a wind field stretching 350 miles from its centre. It has killed at least 150 people and wiped out hundreds of homes and businesses. The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, described it as being of \u201can historic magnitude\u201d. Trump travelled to Georgia on Monday and falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken to its governor, Brian Kemp. Harris will travel to Georgia on Wednesday and to North Carolina in the coming days. The stakes are high: administrations have long been haunted by the failed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But it is the third crisis that could have the biggest electoral impact of all. The first dockworkers\u2019 strike since 1977 could snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks. That would be a political gift to Trump, whose polling lead on the economy has been eroded by Harris. Both are vying for trade union support. Trump, who has previously praised Elon Musk for firing workers who go on strike, said in a statement: \u201cThe situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have \u2026 Americans who thrived under President Trump can\u2019t even get by because of Kamala Harris \u2013 this strike is a direct result of her actions.\u201d All this and it was still only 1 October. The only surprise now would be if there are no more October surprises to come.",

      "body": "<p>The 2024 County Championship season dribbled to an end on Sunday afternoon, handshakes taken as early as was polite, while the autumn roared in. It was the longest Championship season on record \u2013 stretching from 5 April to 29 September \u2013 finishing with the favourites, Surrey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/20/cricket-county-championship-surrey-title-somerset-lancashire\">easing to victory</a> with one round to go and Sussex winning Division Two on the final day, a thousand supporters hanging around in gloves to watch Clare Connor present the trophy.</p> <p>But how quickly things move on. Rod Bransgrove announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/cricket-hampshire-gmr-group-delhi-capitals-majority-stake\">sale of Hampshire to the Delhi Capitals co-owners</a> before the Spin had time to pull the season\u2019s trophies out of the Guardian cabinet where they have been gathering dust since last year. So belatedly, and somewhat overshadowed by powerbrokers in important shoes rustling papers in mahogany boardrooms, here are the summer\u2019s County Championship awards.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"f0dab35b-f454-45db-b1bd-9f1c99b358b5\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The Mortimer and Whitehouse award for catch of the&nbsp;season</strong></h2> <p>To James Bracey. An incredible match at Cheltenham College in early July finished on a pitch-perfect note as Glamorgan, chasing a world record of 593 to win, faced the last ball with a single needed for victory. The No 11, Jamie McIlroy, had a frantic swing at Ajeet Singh Dale and Bracey, with ungloved hand, leapt like a firecracker behind the stumps and held on before sprinting 50 yards to the boundary in celebration, his teammates a-leaping and a-hollering behind him. The most memorable tie in years.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"11d91df1-c09e-4593-8d52-322cf5e7837b\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The Harry Brook award for taking Test cricket in your&nbsp;stride</strong></h2> <p>To Jamie Smith, spoken about in hallowed whispers at the Oval since he was a teenager, who finally made it into the England Test team against West Indies in July after Jonny Bairstow was forcibly shuffled aside. If not quite as elegant as his unpicked Surrey teammate Ben Foakes behind the stumps, he was outrageously unruffled and his batting princely. Between them, he and Gus Atkinson made the Championship look quite the nursery for the five-day game.</p>    <h2 data-note-id=\"2313fe27-f96a-41f0-b1c2-b1489d18942d\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The John Curtice award for statistical excellence</strong></h2> <p>To Jamie Porter and Ben Coad, who survived the trials and tribulations of various Kookaburra experiments to finish with 56 wickets apiece, the top wicket-takers in Divisions One and Two respectively. At 31 and 30, neither looks as if he will get the nod from England \u2013 but at Championship level, as Essex and Yorkshire know, they are indispensable.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"ea25feb6-4565-4fdb-aebb-bd152cbec77a\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The Liz Truss award for avoidable stock devaluation</strong></h2> <p>To Essex who were docked 12 points after Feroze Khushi was found to have used a bat that was too large after a spot check by umpires. After Durham were docked 10 points in 2022 for a similar bat problem, it seems like quite an easy one to resolve.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"9949ca24-923b-49da-bc4d-70747b2c7fd6\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The Mark Ramprakash award for distinguished domestic service</strong></h2> <p>To Liam Dawson, who won the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association\u2019s most valuable domestic player award last year and went even better in 2024, clutching 50 wickets for the first time, making 956 runs at just under 60 and helping Hampshire out of many a hole as well as escorting them to second place in the Championship. Did England tap him on the shoulder? No they did not. But Dawson seems to have made his peace with being overlooked for Jack Leach, for Rehan Ahmed, for Shoaib Bashir and for Tom Hartley. There\u2019s a lesson in there somewhere \u2013 even if most of us don\u2019t have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/03/liam-dawson-england-test-t20-india-tour\">the consolation</a> of well-paid gigs on the franchise circuit to keep us warm.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"460fb817-65ca-4224-a786-db06d14d7e61\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The Gilbert Jessop award for outrageous hitting</strong></h2> <p>To Louis Kimber. Leicestershire seemed to be slumping to a bog-standard defeat against Sussex in June when Kimber strolled out at No 8, a batting average of 24 under his belt. But something extraordinary happened at Hove that day, a kind of midsummer madness, as Kimber, suddenly seeing the ball like a planet, belted 243 off 127 balls, with 20 fours and 21 sixes, taking 43 from one Ollie Robinson over. The records kept on tumbling: fastest 200 in Championship history (100 balls), most sixes in a Championship innings (overhauling Ben Stokes\u2019s 17), most runs before lunch in a Championship match (191), and all while wearing a thick long-sleeved jumper in June.</p> <h2 data-note-id=\"df1d0fbe-6e30-4f5d-9d43-cd8cb609edee\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The gold award for outstanding performance</strong></h2> <p>To Gareth Roderick\u2019s century. A week after the death of the talented young Worcestershire all-rounder Josh Baker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/09/cricket-worcestershire-josh-baker-kent-canterbury\">his teammates were playing again</a>, at Canterbury, the flags of the Frank Woolley pavilion flying at half mast, the sun absurdly warm. Worcestershire won the toss and, after a minute\u2019s applause in Baker\u2019s memory, walked out to bat. Roderick, somehow, found the wherewithal to hold everything together, out for 117 just before stumps on day one, and celebrated his hundred by tapping the 33 embroidered on the players\u2019 shirts after Baker died (his squad number). Worcestershire defied the odds to avoid relegation and ended the season by retiring shirt 33 in Baker\u2019s memory.</p>    <h2 data-note-id=\"8856cbbc-a405-4300-80b9-f32f1797102d\" data-type=\"subhead\"><strong>The Manchester United award for underachievement</strong></h2> <p>To Lancashire, though it was a close-run thing between three big-name Test counties. Warwickshire, where Mark Robinson seems likely to move on, Nottinghamshire, who finally found their feet as autumn drew near, and relegated Lancashire. But the soggy handshake must go to (the other) Old Trafford where a combination of usually reliable senior pros falling on hard times, overseas imports failing to function and Nathan Lyon being pulled home early by Cricket Australia led to a side stuffed with talented but callow youths being relegated.

      "bodyText": "The 2024 County Championship season dribbled to an end on Sunday afternoon, handshakes taken as early as was polite, while the autumn roared in. It was the longest Championship season on record \u2013 stretching from 5 April to 29 September \u2013 finishing with the favourites, Surrey, easing to victory with one round to go and Sussex winning Division Two on the final day, a thousand supporters hanging around in gloves to watch Clare Connor present the trophy. But how quickly things move on. Rod Bransgrove announced the sale of Hampshire to the Delhi Capitals co-owners before the Spin had time to pull the season\u2019s trophies out of the Guardian cabinet where they have been gathering dust since last year. So belatedly, and somewhat overshadowed by powerbrokers in important shoes rustling papers in mahogany boardrooms, here are the summer\u2019s County Championship awards. The Mortimer and Whitehouse award for catch of the season To James Bracey. An incredible match at Cheltenham College in early July finished on a pitch-perfect note as Glamorgan, chasing a world record of 593 to win, faced the last ball with a single needed for victory. The No 11, Jamie McIlroy, had a frantic swing at Ajeet Singh Dale and Bracey, with ungloved hand, leapt like a firecracker behind the stumps and held on before sprinting 50 yards to the boundary in celebration, his teammates a-leaping and a-hollering behind him. The most memorable tie in years. The Harry Brook award for taking Test cricket in your stride To Jamie Smith, spoken about in hallowed whispers at the Oval since he was a teenager, who finally made it into the England Test team against West Indies in July after Jonny Bairstow was forcibly shuffled aside. If not quite as elegant as his unpicked Surrey teammate Ben Foakes behind the stumps, he was outrageously unruffled and his batting princely. Between them, he and Gus Atkinson made the Championship look quite the nursery for the five-day game. The John Curtice award for statistical excellence To Jamie Porter and Ben Coad, who survived the trials and tribulations of various Kookaburra experiments to finish with 56 wickets apiece, the top wicket-takers in Divisions One and Two respectively. At 31 and 30, neither looks as if he will get the nod from England \u2013 but at Championship level, as Essex and Yorkshire know, they are indispensable. The Liz Truss award for avoidable stock devaluation To Essex who were docked 12 points after Feroze Khushi was found to have used a bat that was too large after a spot check by umpires. After Durham were docked 10 points in 2022 for a similar bat problem, it seems like quite an easy one to resolve. The Mark Ramprakash award for distinguished domestic service To Liam Dawson, who won the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association\u2019s most valuable domestic player award last year and went even better in 2024, clutching 50 wickets for the first time, making 956 runs at just under 60 and helping Hampshire out of many a hole as well as escorting them to second place in the Championship. Did England tap him on the shoulder? No they did not. But Dawson seems to have made his peace with being overlooked for Jack Leach, for Rehan Ahmed, for Shoaib Bashir and for Tom Hartley. There\u2019s a lesson in there somewhere \u2013 even if most of us don\u2019t have the consolation of well-paid gigs on the franchise circuit to keep us warm. The Gilbert Jessop award for outrageous hitting To Louis Kimber. Leicestershire seemed to be slumping to a bog-standard defeat against Sussex in June when Kimber strolled out at No 8, a batting average of 24 under his belt. But something extraordinary happened at Hove that day, a kind of midsummer madness, as Kimber, suddenly seeing the ball like a planet, belted 243 off 127 balls, with 20 fours and 21 sixes, taking 43 from one Ollie Robinson over. The records kept on tumbling: fastest 200 in Championship history (100 balls), most sixes in a Championship innings (overhauling Ben Stokes\u2019s 17), most runs before lunch in a Championship match (191), and all while wearing a thick long-sleeved jumper in June. The gold award for outstanding performance To Gareth Roderick\u2019s century. A week after the death of the talented young Worcestershire all-rounder Josh Baker, his teammates were playing again, at Canterbury, the flags of the Frank Woolley pavilion flying at half mast, the sun absurdly warm. Worcestershire won the toss and, after a minute\u2019s applause in Baker\u2019s memory, walked out to bat. Roderick, somehow, found the wherewithal to hold everything together, out for 117 just before stumps on day one, and celebrated his hundred by tapping the 33 embroidered on the players\u2019 shirts after Baker died (his squad number). Worcestershire defied the odds to avoid relegation and ended the season by retiring shirt 33 in Baker\u2019s memory. The Manchester United award for underachievement To Lancashire, though it was a close-run thing between three big-name Test counties. Warwickshire, where Mark Robinson seems likely to move on, Nottinghamshire, who finally found their feet as autumn drew near, and relegated Lancashire. But the soggy handshake must go to (the other) Old Trafford where a combination of usually reliable senior pros falling on hard times, overseas imports failing to function and Nathan Lyon being pulled home early by Cricket Australia led to a side stuffed with talented but callow youths being relegated. Lancashire lost four games by an innings and gained only 15 batting points. The three points they earned during the draw with Worcestershire in the final game of the season were immediately lost due to a slow over rate. Time to hunker down and try again next year. The party pooper prize A joint award to the England and Wales Cricket Board, which continues to marginalise the Championship, and fossil fuel companies, whose supercharging of the climate crisis makes the jobs of groundstaff almost impossible at times, as well as existentially threatening the future of the game. \u2022 This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

      "body": "<p>The last of the holdouts has fallen. A few weeks ago, the National Football League <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-owners-vote-to-allow-private-equity-funds-to-buy-stakes-in-teams\">passed a resolution</a> to allow private equity investment in individual teams, thereby bringing to an end to the league\u2019s long resistance to the incursion of institutional capital. The NFL joins the National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, all of which have opened up to institutional investment in recent years. Only one of the league\u2019s 32 owners, the Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 Mike Brown, voted against the proposal \u2013 a decision, reports <a href=\"https://www.sportico.com/leagues/football/2024/nfl-private-equity-vote-bengals-mike-brown-1234795032/\">suggest</a>, born of his longstanding desire to maintain the financial viability of smaller franchises in a league where growth in team valuations and media revenues shows no sign of slowing down.</p> <p>The effects of the new ownership regime will be minimal, for now at least. The NFL will not be transformed overnight from a league in which teams are owned by wealthy individuals and families and managed for the benefit of fans and communities to one run according to the whims of private equity\u2019s bullies and money grubbers. But it seems hard to imagine that a shift of this nature won\u2019t take shape eventually. The league has been careful to limit the initial scope of private equity investment in the league: individual funds can buy no more than 10% in a given franchise; will acquire purely passive stakes, stripped of any decision-making, governance or voting rights; and will have to hold on to their investments for at least six years. Only four participating funds are allowed to invest for now; they are all long-dated (meaning they generally have long investment horizons and are not, in theory, looking to generate quick returns) and have a lot of money to burn.

The Premier League\u2019s on-field action remains roaringly entertaining, but it leaves a sour taste.

As the Premier League shows, the exit is not the endgame of professional sports investment today; the point of owning a stake in professional sports franchises today is to hold on to it, for as long as possible, and extract value wherever and whenever you can. The key is revenue generation; even in a club that runs at a loss, revenue can produce dividends, which are what the sophisticated institutional owner is really after. (Losses, in any event, can be used as a tax offset, so they serve their own kind of purpose.)</p> <p>Professional investors in the modern Premier League, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/05/glazer-family-manchester-united-sale-jim-ratcliffe\">as I\u2019ve argued previously</a>, are more like rentiers than carers of the clubs they own: the Glazer family, which has trousered most of the \u00a3166m ($220m) in dividends that Manchester United have paid out to shareholders since 2005, serves as the emblematic example of this parasitic style. These investors\u2019 main function is to own and extract rather than operate, improve, or nurture the assets under their control: their business model is built on minimum investment with maximum drain. Nothing about the protections put in place by the NFL suggests that the new wave of investors entering American football will behave any differently. Carry is irrelevant in a sports investment world built on the principle of perpetual leakage.</p> <p>Indeed everything we know about the NFL\u2019s hand-picked first round of approved private equity investors suggests they are every bit as revenue-focused as the worst culprits among today\u2019s Premier League owner class. Many of these investors are already active in the European football market: Arctos Partners, for instance, holds minority stakes in Liverpool, PSG, and Atalanta, while late last year Ares Management <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ad36a20-5036-4018-aa0f-91c7ecdd286c\">invested</a> $500m in Chelsea. Sixth Street, another fund admitted to the NFL\u2019s first private equity dance, has invested in the media and stadium business of both Barcelona and Real Madrid; in a revealing interview he gave to Sports Business Journal this summer, Sixth Street CEO Alan Waxman <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/07/29/finance\">claimed</a> that until a few years ago, \u201csports were run like family businesses. There was no need for institutional capital, and there was no need to run it like a real company.\u201d</p> <p>Investors like Sixth Street are setting out to change that, and they\u2019re doing it by acquiring as many different sports-related revenue streams as possible; tellingly, Sixth Street\u2019s first major investment was in Legends, the hospitality company that has become one of the US\u2019s most important stadium operators. On the face of it, there\u2019s nothing sinister about any of this, of course; the danger is in what will happen should these types of investors, whose real goal is self-enrichment through revenue generation, gain a bigger foothold in US sports. As the NFL goes out in search of the institutional dollar, there\u2019s a delicate balance to be struck between maintaining the attractiveness of the league as an investment destination and ensuring the sport does not get swallowed whole by its new funders. If the league has any sense, it will maintain the limitations it has put in place on private equity in American football and resist the urge to open the sport up to a bigger class of investors.</p> <p>The saddest spectacle in today\u2019s Premier League is of new stadiums and dynasties taking shape amid communities whose people can\u2019t afford to watch their teams play live. Priced out of regular attendance at matches, fans are condescended to with various shabby substitutes for the real thing, for Live Football: crappy crypto baubles, betting coupons, opportunities to win some desultory prize in response to a social media campaign, merch. Meanwhile, stadiums are increasingly the preserve of those who view football as a networking event, mere background music to the transactions of life rather than the stuff of life itself. The NFL arguably enjoys a less emotional relationship to place than the Premier League \u2013 perhaps not in a place like Buffalo, where team and community hold each other in a lifelong embrace, but outfits such as the Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers have shown that franchises are willing to uproot teams and move when economic conditions make a change of address attractive. Financialization of the league opens the door to more transactionalism of this nature, only on steroids. At this still-early stage of its budding romance with the boffins of Wall Street, the NFL has the opportunity to avoid going down this path. Whether it will seems difficult to believe.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The last of the holdouts has fallen. A few weeks ago, the National Football League passed a resolution to allow private equity investment in individual teams, thereby bringing to an end to the league\u2019s long resistance to the incursion of institutional capital. The NFL joins the National Basketball Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer, all of which have opened up to institutional investment in recent years. Only one of the league\u2019s 32 owners, the Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 Mike Brown, voted against the proposal \u2013 a decision, reports suggest, born of his longstanding desire to maintain the financial viability of smaller franchises in a league where growth in team valuations and media revenues shows no sign of slowing down. The effects of the new ownership regime will be minimal, for now at least. The NFL will not be transformed overnight from a league in which teams are owned by wealthy individuals and families and managed for the benefit of fans and communities to one run according to the whims of private equity\u2019s bullies and money grubbers. But it seems hard to imagine that a shift of this nature won\u2019t take shape eventually. The league has been careful to limit the initial scope of private equity investment in the league: individual funds can buy no more than 10% in a given franchise; will acquire purely passive stakes, stripped of any decision-making, governance or voting rights; and will have to hold on to their investments for at least six years. Only four participating funds are allowed to invest for now; they are all long-dated (meaning they generally have long investment horizons and are not, in theory, looking to generate quick returns) and have a lot of money to burn. Sovereign wealth funds, asset management firms, endowments, and pension funds are barred from investing in the league \u2013 a marked contrast to the NBA, which opened up to this bigger class of investors in 2022. As other US professional leagues began to offer themselves to so-called \u201csmart money\u201d in recent years, the NFL held the private equity barbarians at bay, partly out of a belief that the incentives between the league and the world of institutional investment are fundamentally misaligned: the league wants what\u2019s best for teams, fans and the sport in general (or so the story goes), whereas private equity investors are out to make a buck, for themselves and their shareholders.

Saving from your own plants is cost-effective and hugely rewarding \u2013 I\u2019ve kept some species of annual flower going for more than a decade by harvesting and packeting seeds at the end of each growing year. As such, I\u2019m a huge advocate for keeping a few seed envelopes in my gardening jacket. You may encounter a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/25/10-wildflower-seeds-to-collect-now-from-wild-carrot-to-welsh-poppies\">wildflower</a> worth trying at home, or \u2013 all the more thrilling \u2013 a neighbour\u2019s plant too tempting to resist pocketing a seed head from.

Choose wisely: secateurs are one of those few enduring gardening tools \u2013 look after them well and they become firm familiars, somewhat moulded to your grip. I\u2019ve had the same pair for 15 years and counting.</p>    <p><strong>Model 11 grower secateurs, \u00a356.95</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.worldoffelco.co.uk/felco-model-11-grower-secateurs\"><sub>worldoffelco.co.uk</sub></a><strong> </strong><strong><br>\u00a364.99<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.diy.com/departments/felco-model-11-secateurs-large-right-handed/0783929100104_BQ.prd\"><sub>diy.com</sub></a><strong><br></strong>Manufactured in Switzerland with an elegant yet hard-wearing design, Felco secateurs are where comfort meets durability.

They\u2019re also conspicuously coloured, so they won\u2019t disappear into the undergrowth.</p> <h2><strong>Tarpaulin</strong></h2> <p>As a self-professed messy gardener, my preferred approach with pruning has always been to lay down a big tarp and pile waste and clippings on top, saving the clear up for later. It harks back to my days in city garden maintenance, sprinting between domestic back gardens and the truck into which I\u2019d bundle tarp-loads. A small-sized but sturdy tarp is far better than a large, easily torn one, especially in autumn when there are high winds and damp ground to contend with. Four to six sq metres will do the trick.</p>    <p><strong>Tarpaulin, \u00a313</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.diy.com/departments/brown-green-tarpaulin-l-3m-w-2m/3663602576204_BQ.prd\"><sub>diy.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub>B&amp;Q\u2019s 3x2 metre tarpaulin is tougher than most and less likely to tear with sharper clippings like rose and gooseberry.

It\u2019s also a stylish choice \u2013 yes, even tarps can be smart \u2013 and comes in various sizes.</p> <h2><strong>Gloves</strong></h2> <p>Even for someone who judges a fruitful day\u2019s gardening by the muddiness of his hands, there is definitely a place for good gardening gloves. And never more so than during autumn, between leaf clearances, thorny pruning and mulch spreading. Sadly, the universal glove \u2013 one as amenable to dexterity as it is protective \u2013 does not yet exist. Best, therefore, to have two thicknesses handy, and to go extra thick for the protective pair.</p>    <p><strong>Gardening gloves, \u00a316</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.donkeygloves.co.uk/product-page/donkey-gloves\"><sub>donkeygloves.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a316</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Donkey-Multipurpose-Gardening-Touch-tech-Washable/dp/B0CQK6JBX5/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>Among the more general-purpose gloves, my Donkeys have proved unusually long-lasting: warm yet breathable, lightweight yet tough.</p>    <p><strong>Heavy-duty gardening gloves, \u00a39.99</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.robertdyas.co.uk/draper-heavy-duty-large-leather-gardening-gloves-blue?srsltid=AfmBOopsysXI-GQFcEBnEnAJIRsvrCKy_vBs7BHyaFuW5-ApCijFUFmB\"><sub>robertdyas.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>These thicker gardening gloves have additional guards for thumbs and knuckles to tackle the scratchier jobs: think brambles, thistles and unearthed rubble.</p> <h2><strong>Border spade</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019ve long maintained that the border spade \u2013 slimmer and stouter than your regular garden variety \u2013 is the most versatile tool in the shed. It can sculpt like a mason\u2019s chisel, trench like a digger, multiply perennials with the precision of a scalpel and scatter mulch with surprising accuracy. </p>    <p><strong>Border spade, \u00a346</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.davidaustinroses.co.uk/products/burgon-ball-border-spade?gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADoLBoSj-GOpzejVe4C9nh4vu11LH&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5rmgw67IiAMVfJNQBh0H_xRNEAQYCCABEgIKqvD_BwE\"><sub>davidaustinroses.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>This narrow-bladed, hard-wearing stainless-steel spade is the exemplar of the border spade.

Weeds exist for a reason: they colonise the unnatural state that is exposed soil, to protect against erosion, overheating, nutrient leaching and the breakdown of vital mycorrhizal fungi below ground. Green manure can help with this. Plants sown as cover crops, such as forage pea, red clover and vetch, spend their growing season both blanketing naked soil and inputting nitrogen via nodules on their roots. They are sown directly in autumn to grow through the winter, and can be chopped up and dug into the soil come spring.</p>    <p><strong>Forage pea seeds</strong><strong>, 250g for \u00a33.25 </strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.sowseeds.co.uk/collections/october-sowing/products/forage-pea-green-manure-seeds?variant=923695363\"><sub>sowseeds.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>The deep, channelling root system of the hardy forage pea not only adds nitrogenous fertility to the soil but also improves its structure.</p>    <p><strong>Green manure winter mix</strong><strong>, 250g for \u00a33.45 </strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.seedstosow.co.uk/products/winter-mix-green-manure?variant=43166628118744&amp;currency=GBP&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADNzopAQPO1N8DNTnj3zTebjGD5ee&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIosL_nbLIiAMVj5RQBh0FgAjCEAQYBSABEgIY-PD_BwE\"><sub>seedstosow.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>This blended seed mix of rye and vetch is targeted at breaking down heavier soils and is as attractive over winter as it is productive.</p> <h2><strong>Wheelbarrow</strong></h2> <p>No garden is too small for a wheelbarrow, and you only realise this the moment the work begins. A plump wheel, sturdy frame and comfortable pair of handles lend themselves to all manner of autumn tasks, from carting off prunings to distributing mulches and temporarily storing half-dissected perennials.</p>    <p><strong>85L </strong><strong>steel wheelbarrow, \u00a356</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.diy.com/departments/walsall-endurance-black-steel-heavy-duty-wheelbarrow-85l/1790338_BQ.prd\"><sub>diy.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub>This basic wheelbarrow has seen me through many seasons to date, proving equally robust as a receptacle for heavy aggregates as for compost and plant material alike.</p>    <p><strong>100L</strong><strong> wheelbarrow, \u00a379.99</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.sam-turner.co.uk/products/maingate-cruiser-100l-wheelbarrow\"><sub>sam-turner.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>Maingate\u2019s cruiser wheelbarrow provides ever-useful depth, boasting the hull of a cargo ship to reduce the running back and forth of multiple smaller loads.</p> <h2><strong>Leaf rake</strong></h2> <p>Though there are many categories of garden rake, the leaf variety mustn\u2019t be undervalued. It\u2019s unsuitable for smoothing soil or turning up stones (or, indeed, scooping hay), but its application lies squarely with the organisation of leaves. The light tines are close-set and appropriately flexible to ensure optimum coverage while leaving the surface beneath \u2013 be it lawn, gravel or soil \u2013 unscathed.</p>    <p><strong>Lawn rake, \u00a310</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.wickes.co.uk/Wickes-Carbon-Steel-Garden-Lawn-Rake---1625mm/p/500103?gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADs4IsbQelTmrhM51Lp_unZgkW-eF&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3MTj6rbIiAMVJplQBh2ZOiTYEAQYBCABEgJLAfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\"><sub>wickes.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>A steel-tined option, the narrower fan of this durable leaf rake makes reaching into tighter corners that little bit easier.</p>    <p><strong>Plastic leaf rake, \u00a313.58</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.toolstation.com/bulldog-plastic-lawn-leaf-rake/p14131?store=null&amp;utm_source=googleshopping&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=googleshoppingfeed&amp;mkwid=_dc&amp;pcrid=null&amp;pkw=null&amp;pmt=null&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-vLcVRE7k5wfCC5W9xP6RGvuyGi&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3MTj6rbIiAMVJplQBh2ZOiTYEAQYAiABEgJ7-vD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\"><sub>toolstation.com</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a313.58<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bulldog-BPR-Plastic-Leaf-Rake/dp/B008AAJGRU/\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>Long-handled, lightweight and made of stiff plastic, Bulldog\u2019s leaf rake is the choice for larger areas of lawn, maximising width for a broader reach.</p>    <p><strong>Spear and Jackson flexo lawn rake, \u00a319.50</strong><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://hurst-iw.co.uk/products/4301?variant=8820153091&amp;currency=GBP&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4E8Q_wQAc9K2cfuuZ-wmJp7I_EE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsenZ9LfIiAMVcoBQBh0aqAqUEAQYAyABEgJYUfD_BwE\"><sub>hurst-iw.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub><strong>\u00a318.95</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spear-Jackson-Elements-Flexo-White/dp/B002W5V7GC\"><sub>amazon.co.uk</sub></a><sub><br></sub>Spear and Jackson\u2019s offering is made with rust-resistant metal and a lacquered ashwood shaft, meaning it is likely to stand the test of time.</p> <h2><strong>Leaf grabbers</strong></h2> <p>Oddly, I resisted this tool for many years despite long winters of relentless leaf clearance. Could grabbers really improve on a pair of good gloves? The answer, to my slight embarrassment, is yes. Very much so.

But so much of the vigour and vitality of spring gardens is owed to efforts made the previous autumn. The mulching, splitting, leaf shifting, planting, planning, pruning \u2013 even sowing \u2013 of October and November is what produces the magnificent results. The autumn to-do list can feel daunting, but the beauty of it is its lack of time pressure: spring rushes by in a heartbeat, autumn plays out leisurely, its jobs needn\u2019t be hurried. I have a vague yet fairly well-established running order for the autumn essentials. I\u2019ll start by collecting and packaging seeds, chopping back perennials earmarked for dividing or relocation, and tidying raspberries and gooseberries with secateurs. Spring bulbs then go in the earth, before mulches are spread above, or green manures sown over areas of bare ground. And as the colder days of winter descend, there\u2019s the satisfying tying down of climbing roses. All the while, tree leaves are gathered up and either thrown on to borders, added to the compost or bundled into bags to rot down as leaf mould. Good labour-saving kit makes light(er) work of even the more cumbersome horticultural endeavours.

Just remember to label what it is, when you harvested it and where it came from on the packet as I guarantee you\u2019ll have forgotten when it\u2019s time to sow. Seed-collecting envelopes, 20 for \u00a34.95 greatoutdoorscompany.co.uk Lightweight and simply designed envelopes that will fit neatly into a pocket for impulse gatherings. Seed envelopes, 50 for \u00a32.73 temu.com Boasting a little more vintage flair as well as a resealable lip, Temu\u2019s envelopes are a characterful alternative. Secateurs While there\u2019s merit in leaving many perennial plants standing to provide shelter and forage for wildlife, inevitably there\u2019s going to be a little chopping back to do this side of Christmas. Choose wisely: secateurs are one of those few enduring gardening tools \u2013 look after them well and they become firm familiars, somewhat moulded to your grip. I\u2019ve had the same pair for 15 years and counting. Model 11 grower secateurs, \u00a356.95 worldoffelco.co.uk \u00a364.99 diy.com Manufactured in Switzerland with an elegant yet hard-wearing design, Felco secateurs are where comfort meets durability. Of the brand\u2019s many models of pruning shears, number 11 remains the one for me: simple and unbeatably strong. Pocket pruner, \u00a319.99 burgonandball.com \u00a315.99 amazon.co.uk This RHS-endorsed pocket pruner is, as the name suggests, a distinctly compact pair of bypass secateurs. With its carbon steel blade and alloy handles, however, resilience has not been compromised. Left-handed mainichi secateurs, \u00a342 niwaki.com This popular Japanese model of Niwaki secateurs provides a much-needed left-handed option. They\u2019re also conspicuously coloured, so they won\u2019t disappear into the undergrowth. Tarpaulin As a self-professed messy gardener, my preferred approach with pruning has always been to lay down a big tarp and pile waste and clippings on top, saving the clear up for later. It harks back to my days in city garden maintenance, sprinting between domestic back gardens and the truck into which I\u2019d bundle tarp-loads. A small-sized but sturdy tarp is far better than a large, easily torn one, especially in autumn when there are high winds and damp ground to contend with. Four to six sq metres will do the trick. Tarpaulin, \u00a313 diy.com B&amp;Q\u2019s 3x2 metre tarpaulin is tougher than most and less likely to tear with sharper clippings like rose and gooseberry. Fitted with reinforced eyelets at each metre, it can be pinned down during, or tied up after, use. 350gsm tarpaulin, from \u00a315.99 gardenersdream.co.uk \u00a319.99 for 2 x 2.5 metres amazon.co.uk The robust, blue and beige tarp from Gardeners Dream is made of even tougher stuff, and comes with yet more eyelets. It\u2019s also a stylish choice \u2013 yes, even tarps can be smart \u2013 and comes in various sizes. Gloves Even for someone who judges a fruitful day\u2019s gardening by the muddiness of his hands, there is definitely a place for good gardening gloves. And never more so than during autumn, between leaf clearances, thorny pruning and mulch spreading. Sadly, the universal glove \u2013 one as amenable to dexterity as it is protective \u2013 does not yet exist. Best, therefore, to have two thicknesses handy, and to go extra thick for the protective pair. Gardening gloves, \u00a316 donkeygloves.co.uk \u00a316 amazon.co.uk Among the more general-purpose gloves, my Donkeys have proved unusually long-lasting: warm yet breathable, lightweight yet tough. Heavy-duty gardening gloves, \u00a39.99 robertdyas.co.uk These thicker gardening gloves have additional guards for thumbs and knuckles to tackle the scratchier jobs: think brambles, thistles and unearthed rubble. Border spade I\u2019ve long maintained that the border spade \u2013 slimmer and stouter than your regular garden variety \u2013 is the most versatile tool in the shed. It can sculpt like a mason\u2019s chisel, trench like a digger, multiply perennials with the precision of a scalpel and scatter mulch with surprising accuracy. Border spade, \u00a346 davidaustinroses.co.uk This narrow-bladed, hard-wearing stainless-steel spade is the exemplar of the border spade. It is a premium model designed for utility and comfort, with a smooth handle and supportive treads. Golden spade, \u00a342 niwaki.com \u00a346.20 amazon.co.uk As compact spades go, Niwaki has taken an original approach to its signature golden spade. While the colour may be novel, make no mistake: its strength, acute sharpness and steel (rather than wooden) shaft make it an unbeatably practical tool that is much loved by gardeners. Border spade, \u00a389.99 crocus.co.uk Crocus\u2019s carbon-steel alternative is made in collaboration with specialist garden tool maker DeWit, has an ashwood handle and a lifetime guarantee. Green manure Soil science is an ever-developing realm of horticulture, and something that is becoming increasingly apparent to gardeners are the perils of bare earth. Weeds exist for a reason: they colonise the unnatural state that is exposed soil, to protect against erosion, overheating, nutrient leaching and the breakdown of vital mycorrhizal fungi below ground. Green manure can help with this. Plants sown as cover crops, such as forage pea, red clover and vetch, spend their growing season both blanketing naked soil and inputting nitrogen via nodules on their roots. They are sown directly in autumn to grow through the winter, and can be chopped up and dug into the soil come spring. Forage pea seeds, 250g for \u00a33.25 sowseeds.co.uk The deep, channelling root system of the hardy forage pea not only adds nitrogenous fertility to the soil but also improves its structure. Green manure winter mix, 250g for \u00a33.45 seedstosow.co.uk This blended seed mix of rye and vetch is targeted at breaking down heavier soils and is as attractive over winter as it is productive. Wheelbarrow No garden is too small for a wheelbarrow, and you only realise this the moment the work begins. A plump wheel, sturdy frame and comfortable pair of handles lend themselves to all manner of autumn tasks, from carting off prunings to distributing mulches and temporarily storing half-dissected perennials. 85L steel wheelbarrow, \u00a356 diy.com This basic wheelbarrow has seen me through many seasons to date, proving equally robust as a receptacle for heavy aggregates as for compost and plant material alike. 100L wheelbarrow, \u00a379.99 sam-turner.co.uk Maingate\u2019s cruiser wheelbarrow provides ever-useful depth, boasting the hull of a cargo ship to reduce the running back and forth of multiple smaller loads. Leaf rake Though there are many categories of garden rake, the leaf variety mustn\u2019t be undervalued. It\u2019s unsuitable for smoothing soil or turning up stones (or, indeed, scooping hay), but its application lies squarely with the organisation of leaves. The light tines are close-set and appropriately flexible to ensure optimum coverage while leaving the surface beneath \u2013 be it lawn, gravel or soil \u2013 unscathed. Lawn rake, \u00a310 wickes.co.uk A steel-tined option, the narrower fan of this durable leaf rake makes reaching into tighter corners that little bit easier. Plastic leaf rake, \u00a313.58 toolstation.com \u00a313.58 amazon.co.uk Long-handled, lightweight and made of stiff plastic, Bulldog\u2019s leaf rake is the choice for larger areas of lawn, maximising width for a broader reach. Spear and Jackson flexo lawn rake, \u00a319.50 hurst-iw.co.uk \u00a318.95 amazon.co.uk Spear and Jackson\u2019s offering is made with rust-resistant metal and a lacquered ashwood shaft, meaning it is likely to stand the test of time. Leaf grabbers Oddly, I resisted this tool for many years despite long winters of relentless leaf clearance. Could grabbers really improve on a pair of good gloves? The answer, to my slight embarrassment, is yes. Very much so. It may appear an unnecessary indulgence, but the efficiency of a pair of leaf grabbers saves time, inaccuracy and backache. Once raked to a pile, a flurry of tree leaves can be effortlessly scooped and deposited in seconds. Handheld leaf grabbers, \u00a39.49 diy.com Option one is a pair of individual handheld grabbers in toughened plastic: sturdy and easily manoeuvred. Plastic leaf grabber, \u00a319.99 buxtons.net \u00a322.70 amazon.co.uk Here is an even less toilsome alternative with handles \u2013 my personal preference \u2013 limiting the continual bending. You\u2019d be amazed at the volume these can lift! Matt Collins is a garden, nature and travel writer, and head gardener at the Garden Museum in London",

The US website Axios has reported that Israeli officials are considering a \u201csignificant retaliation\u201d to the Iranian attack within days that could target oil production facilities inside Iran and other strategic sites. Israeli officials are understood to be conferring with the US on how to calibrate their military response, which could propel the Middle East closer to the brink of a regional war. Analysts have also suggested that Israel could target Iranian nuclear programme facilities, although the US may want to rule out that option because of the likelihood it would escalate the conflict further. \u201cThere will be severe consequences for this attack and we will work with Israel to make that the case,\u201d the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Tuesday evening, adding that the US would have \u201congoing consultations with the Israelis this afternoon and this evening\u201d.

Israeli media have reported that about 100 rockets have been launched into Israel from the direction of Lebanon so far on Wednesday, amid reports of the first direct clashes between Israeli ground forces and Hezbollah. So far, Israel has only deployed the 98th Division to launch attacks into southern Lebanon, making the operation far smaller than the incursions that the military has launched into Gaza. The latest Israeli deployment indicates that Israel could intensify its operation there. Israel continued to launch airstrikes against targets in Beirut overnight, and photographs showed smoke rising over the city at daybreak.

Guardian reporters in Jerusalem witnessed dozens of missiles flying over Israel\u2019s main coastal cities in a huge attack shortly after 7.30pm, with the engines of the rockets clearly visible from below. Air sirens sounded across Israel as the missiles, many of them intercepted by Israeli air defences, streaked across the night sky in trails of red and gold. Some missiles, still intact, appeared to continue on towards the coast and central Israel to the sound of distant explosions. In the early hours of Wednesday, at least five Israeli strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, after the Israeli military issued multiple evacuation orders for buildings in the city, saying it was targeting Hezbollah sites. Minutes before Iran began the strike, at least two gunmen in the Israeli seaside city of Jaffa launched an attack that killed six and wounded 10, including an IDF soldier, sowing further concerns that the rising cycle of violence could lead to terrorist attacks inside Israel.",

Members of the Australian-Lebanese community expressed their profound grief and pain in many different ways, with a very small number flying Hezbollah flags. Notwithstanding the heightened emotions, at no time did the rally feel unsafe or violent.</p> <p>The NSW police announcement that they will seek to prohibit this week\u2019s rally seems a disproportionate response to the actions we observed at the rally, and prohibiting a rally on such a key date is a profound attack on political expression and the right to protest.</p> </blockquote>

Victoria University estimates international student cap will cost it over $16m in one year Victoria University (VU) estimates a loss of $16.7m in a single year as a result of the federal government\u2019s proposed international student cap, a new analysis conducted by the university reveals. Under the caps, VU will have its numbers capped at 11% below its 2023 intake level, among 15 universities that would see international student numbers decrease. Its vice-chancellor, professor Adam Shoemaker, said it was \u201cnot a pretty picture\u201d. Every dollar counts for a public-purpose institution like ours. This proposal will hinder VU\u2019s ability to invest and grow our equity and excellence agenda, which directly contradicts the key intent of the federal government\u2019s Universities Accord.\u201d Over a third of VU students are from equity backgrounds, such as First Nations students, students with a disability and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, while almost half are first in family to go to university. Speaking at a Senate inquiry into the bill on Wednesday, the deputy Greens leader and spokesperson for higher education, Mehreen Faruqi, said Labor and Liberal were in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on education policy, labelling the proposed cap \u201cracist dog whistling\u201d.

International student cap allocations derided as \u2018bizarre\u2019 and \u2018illogical\u2019 in Senate inquiry One hundred and sixty pieces of correspondence have been sent to the Department of Education and Workplace Relations (DEWR) from tertiary education providers following the allocation of proposed federal government international student caps. At a Senate inquiry into the bill on Wednesday, DEWR said it had received a \u201cvariety of concerns and issues\u201d from providers over their respective allocations, acknowledging there was \u201cclearly some confusion\u201d around the process. At least one area of the reforms \u2013 aviation schools \u2013 is under review after concerns the industry would collapse as a result of its granted caps, due to its reliance on international students to remain viable. The chief executive of the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia (ITECA), Troy Williams, told the inquiry the damage \u201cdesigned in the bill\u201d would take \u201cyears to repair\u201d, warning it would cause thousands of job losses alongside campus closures. He said the approach to allocating student numbers to independent training providers was \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d, citing a lack of consultation with the sector and apparent shielding of public Tafe colleges from significant enrolment restrictions. Some independent skills training and higher education providers with a proven track record of delivering high-quality outcomes for students are allocated just three or four students under this bill. At the same time, however, a provider with no history of delivery for the past one to four years in some cases might receive an allocation of thirty. This is not just unfair; it\u2019s bizarre and illogical. Jacinta Allan issues statement on potential October 7 protests The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has also warned against people protesting on October 7. In a statement, she said: People should not be protesting on October 7. This is a very traumatic anniversary for all those involved in the conflict. Whilst everyone has a right to protest peacefully, groups should reconsider the need to protest next week in respect to the grief it will cause Jewish, Israeli, Muslim, Palestinian and Lebanese communities. SPC cannery to merge with Original Juice Company and Nature One Dairy Australia\u2019s biggest cannery, SPC, has agreed to merge with the Original Juice Company in a three-way deal to boost the food and beverage businesses\u2019 scale, AAP reports. The Original Juice Company announced on the Australian Stock Exchange it had reached a deal to merge with SPC and the Singapore-registered, Australian-founded dairy and powdered milk company Nature One Dairy. The deal is subject to shareholder approval and ASX requirements. The combined company is expected to deliver more than $400m in revenue this financial year. SPC has produced canned products for more than a century to Australian and global markets, but recently cut pear production as it struggled to compete with supermarket-branded products sourced from cheaper imported fruit. ABC\u2019s director of news, Justin Stevens, has called out the racial abuse Tony Armstrong has been subjected to this week at the same time as the racism report was released. Armstrong shared screenshots of racial attacks he received online after Media Watch reported he had not told the ABC he had been employed to do voiceover for an ad campaign for one of the country\u2019s biggest insurance companies, NRMA. Stevens: The ABC stands by Tony and will not tolerate any racist abuse. The ABC has logged the details of the abusive social media posts and made a complaint regarding the moderation of the comments. More to come. Australian Catholic University at risk of breaching international student cap due to over-enrollment The Australian Catholic University (ACU) has been warned by the Department of Education that it may be at risk of over-enrolling as a result of the federal government\u2019s proposed international student cap. Speaking at a Senate inquiry into the commonwealth\u2019s legislation on Wednesday, the deputy secretary of the department, Ben Rimmer, said ACU had been put \u201con notice\u201d that it was at risk of going beyond its proposed cap. The inquiry has heard that the legislation is \u201carbitrary\u201d, \u201cchaotic\u201d, \u201cfull of errors and flaws\u201d and \u201cmade no sense\u201d as the sector grapples with the implications of the provider-level restrictions. The Greens\u2019 deputy leader and spokesperson for higher education, Mehreen Faruqi, asked Rimmer how the department was navigating universities who, prior to receiving their indicative cap, had already enrolled more international students. \u201cHave they been asked to stop offering places?\u201d she asked. Rimmer said he had been monitoring very closely the number of certificates of enrolment for 2025 that had been made by each provider and in \u201ca couple of cases\u201d had conversations with providers about their numbers. \u201cIn the absence of legislation as yet, decisions about what to do as a result of what government is saying publicly are a matter for each provider \u2026 we have put one university on notice that they may be at risk of over enrolment.\u201d Asked what university that was, he replied: \u201cThe Australian Catholic University.\u201d Katter and Hanson\u2019s parties to preference LNP in Queensland state election Katter\u2019s Australian party will preference the Liberal National Party for the first time in a crucial north Queensland region at the state election. KAP\u2019s state leader, Robbie Katter, has confirmed the party will ask its supporters to preference the opposition in Townsville instead of Labor at the 26 October poll. We\u2019ve always had a position of neutrality on our preferences, and that\u2019s because we don\u2019t like endorsing one side or the other. But it does hit a point where you say, well, if someone\u2019s been that bad, they need to be taught a lesson. And Pauline Hanson launched One Nation\u2019s Queensland campaign today. The One Nation leader announced the party would preference the LNP ahead of Labor and the Greens. She told 4BC: Under Labor the state is in one hell of a mess. The Greens will definitely be last on our how to vote cards. - With AAP Woman charged following Sydney CBD protest: NSW police say they have charged a woman after a Hezbollah flag was allegedly displayed at a pro-Palestine and Lebanon protest in Sydney on the weekend. In a statement, police said: A woman has been charged as part of an investigation into a public order incident in Sydney last Sunday. Operation Shelter was established in October 2023, to ensure community safety in response to protest activity. About 10am today (Wednesday 2 October 2024), the 19-year-old woman presented herself to Kogarah police station following a public appeal. She was arrested and charged with cause public display of prohibited terrorists organisation symbol. She was granted strict conditional bail to appear before the Downing centre local court on Wednesday 23 October 2024. More info here: Sydney councillor-elect calls on police to work with City instead of going to court A City of Sydney councillor elect, Sylvie Ellsmore, has also called on police to work with the city of Sydney to manage how the protest takes place instead of taking the organisers to court: Police have the option of working with the City of Sydney to manage how public space is used for protest and other activities \u2013 they do not need to take community activists to the supreme court to do so. Police submit NSW supreme court application to block pro-Palestine rallies NSW police have applied to the sate\u2019s supreme court to prevent pro-Palestine rallies going ahead on 6 and 7 October. Community Legal Centres NSW, Amnesty International Australia, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Jewish Council of Australia are among 40 groups urging the NSW police commissioner to reconsider the decision. Anastasia Radievska, a protest rights campaigner at the Australian Democracy Network, said: In a democratic society, communities must be able to come together and have their say through protest. The attempt to prohibit a community rally that has safely run for 51 weeks is a serious attack on the right to protest. The NSW police\u2019s citing of flower planter boxes at Town Hall as one of their main safety concerns makes a mockery of the Form 1 process and the supreme court\u2019s time. The Queensland opposition leader also confirmed the LNP would put local One Nation candidate James Ashby ahead of the Labor incumbent, Brittany Lauga, in the seat of Keppel. Crisafulli: We will be putting Greens and Labor last. I\u2019ll tell you why. That does not take a lot of decision making time. In my mind, you\u2019ve got the Labor party that\u2019s been in power for 30 of the last 35 years. They\u2019ve won 11 of the last 12 general elections, and they\u2019ve been a really, really bad government, particularly the last few years. As for the Greens, they are not a movement that reflects the values of a modern Queensland. Both are contesting the seat of Keppel, which neighbours Rockhampton, where Crisafulli spoke on Wednesday. David Crisafulli claims he can meet state emission targets without renewables if elected The Queensland opposition leader has rejected claims from the state\u2019s environmental peak body that he could not meet the state\u2019s emissions target without renewables. The LNP\u2019s leader, David Crisafulli, reconfirmed he would repeal the state\u2019s legislated renewables target if elected. The head of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said reaching the mandated 75% target \u201cwill be impossible if the LNP plans to keep coal open for longer and doesn\u2019t commit to Queensland\u2019s renewable energy targets\u201d. But Crisafulli said agriculture could pick up the slack: You can work with agriculture to do good, sensible use of protected areas. There is a number of ways a government can deal by working with the private sector and indeed looking up its own back yard to reduce your emissions. And Queensland\u2019s shown that over recent years, we have shown there has been a reduction in emissions, and it\u2019s been led largely by the agricultural sector, to its great credit \u2026 the way that Aussie farmers and Queensland farmers had embraced the change and the opportunities that come from market by being clean and green has been spot on, spot on. And we think if you\u2019ve got a government that can partner with them, that is very, very achievable. Energy is the leading emitter in Queensland, representing 36% of the carbon inventory. Agriculture is in fourth place, representing 17%. The LNP leader has travelled to Rockhampton today to promise a new $95m academy for health sciences. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Cait Kelly will be here to guide you through the rest of today\u2019s rolling coverage. See you tomorrow morning. NSW Health has issued a warning about high-dose MDMA, or ecstasy, tablets circulating the state, with a higher dose than usually expected. The tablets are purple shield-shaped (see below from their press release). Dr Hester Wilson, a chief addiction medicine specialist, said consuming high doses of MDMA has been linked to cases of serious illness and death in NSW: MDMA can cause severe agitation, raised body temperature, seizures or fits, irregular heart rhythm and death. Other risks include taking MDMA in combination with other stimulants, such as amphetamines or cocaine. The amount of MDMA in a tablet or capsule can vary significantly, even within the same batch. The health risks from MDMA are greatly increased if high amounts (including multiple doses) are consumed over a short period. Wilson also said hot environments, such as music festivals, increase the risk of harm from MDMA, encouraging people to take a break from dancing, seek shade and drink water. Fears spike about public sector workplace corruption Almost one in three Victorian public sector employees think corruption is a problem in their workplace, according to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission\u2019s latest perceptions of corruption survey. As AAP reports, the survey was released today and collected more than 9,000 responses from Victorians aged 16 and older \u2013 including public sector workers, local government employees, Victoria police members and business suppliers. Roughly nine out of 10 agreed corruption happens in Victoria, the report said. On average, a 19-percentage point gap exists between those agreeing corruption happens versus [those that] perceive that corruption is a problem, suggesting a widespread tolerance for certain types of corruption behaviours. Across the groups, there has tended to be an increase since 2022 in the proportion viewing corruption to be a problem in Victoria. Here\u2019s the full story from Mostafa Rachwani, on news Sydney police told organisers of a pro-Palestine rally this weekend they had safety concerns over the expected crowd size and potential hazards at Town Hall \u2013 including \u201cthe recent addition of over a dozen planter boxes\u201d. Legal activists say right to protest \u2018must be protected\u2019 The Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) is calling on the NSW police commissioner to drop supreme court applications attempting to prevent two pro-Palestine rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. In a statement, the HRLC said that any approach that \u201cdemonises and punishes thousands of people for the actions of a few is disproportionate and a breach of human rights\u201d. David Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the HRLC, said the right to protest is \u201cfundamental to our democracy and must be protected.\u201d While NSW police may seek to restrict or ban the protest, they must be able to show that these actions are both necessary and proportionate, in line with international human rights and constitutional standards. Overly broad restrictions on our right to get together peacefully must not be NSW police\u2019s first response; instead, authorities must focus on facilitating these rights and freedoms. Mejia-Canales said that blanket bans on protests are \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and that restricting and prohibiting protests should \u201conly ever be a measure of last resort.\u201d NSW police must prioritise less intrusive measures and consider allowing the protest to go ahead. If there is poor behaviour by individuals, then this should be dealt with accordingly while allowing everyone else to peacefully protest. The Bureau of Meteorology has shared this satellite view of southwest WA, where a severe weather warning remains in place. A strong cold front will sweep the region today, with an associated deep low pressure system and trough to follow in its wake. Widespread damaging winds around 60-70km/h with peak gusts around 100km/h are forecast across the coastal fringe south of Jurien Bay from this evening. This system is expected to be windier than typical and unusual for this time of year, the Bureau said. Aussies unprepared for money shocks, according to survey Less than a quarter of Australians are satisfied with their financial position, with younger generations increasingly relying on grandparents for support. As AAP reports, research conducted by investment group MLC found 70% of people said financial wellbeing was important to meeting life goals, but only 23% were happy with their money situation. MLC\u2019s financial freedom report, which surveyed more than 2,500 people, found just 25% of respondents were prepared to handle unexpected financial challenges. Some 41% of respondents said they worried about their finances all the time or often. The findings also showed grandparents were playing a larger role in helping younger generations financially, with more than half saying they are assisting monetarily or plan to do so. The findings showed 60% of those in Gen Z received financial support from grandparents \u2013 along with 56% of millennials \u2013 when they reached adulthood. That compares with 20% of generation X and 6% of baby boomers. Those in generation X were the most likely to worry about cost-of-living issues, followed by generation Z, millennials and baby boomers. SPC to merge with Original Juice owner Canned fruit giant SPC Global is planning to merge with the Original Juice Company (OJC) in a deal designed to create a large food conglomerate, with increased Australian manufacturing capability. The deal, which requires approval from OJC shareholders, also includes folding powdered milk products company Nature One Dairy into the new company, according to an ASX release issued today. The 100-year-old SPC, a major employer in Victoria\u2019s Goulburn Valley, is the biggest company of the three and its chief executive, Robert Iervasi, will lead the merged entity. With our market-leading packaged fruit, canned tomatoes and baked bean products, we are excited to expand with OJC both domestically and globally and see significant synergy potential in bringing the two producers together. Best known for the aforementioned canned fruit and baked beans, SPC also produces ready-made meals. The ASX-listed OJC owns several juice brands, including Original Juice and The Juice Lab. OJC is chaired by the former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who will step down from his role after the transaction is finalised. The combined business is expected to generate more than $400m in annual revenue, OJC told shareholders. Woman charged for allegedly causing fires at cemetery chapel and sheds Western Australian police have charged a 28-year-old woman for allegedly setting fire to items inside a chapel. It will be alleged the Mandurah woman forced entry into the Norfolk chapel at Karrakatta cemetery yesterday and set fire to items inside, with the resulting fire causing an estimated $1m damage to the chapel. Police will further allege the woman set fire to a shed at a cemetery in Parklands on 27 September, with the shed and its contents destroyed. Police allege the woman set another fire in a small shed at the same cemetery in Parklands on 30 September. The woman has been charged with one count of burglary and three counts of criminal damage by fire and is due to appear before the Perth magistrates court today. Anne Hollonds says systems outside of youth prisons \u2018need to be doing their job\u2019 Back at the National Press Club, Anne Hollonds told a story about visiting what she thought was the best youth justice facility in the country, with 24 children. She didn\u2019t say what state it was located in, but that she was \u201creally impressed\u201d and asked the principal what happens to the children when they leave? The principle said that was \u201ca problem\u201d, Hollonds said, explaining: She said, \u2018They go back to their community and they try to re-enrol back in the school, and often the school doesn\u2019t want them.\u2019 She said that to me. \u2018The school does not want them.\u2019 Or they start going back to school, but they\u2019re not getting the one on one learning support they need. These kids, they may have dropped out of school about the age of eight or nine. They have missed years and years of schooling. So she said \u2018they drop out, and then they come back, and they come back, and they come back.\u2019 \u2026 And so it\u2019s a failure \u2026 of the systems outside the prison. So even the state that I mentioned, that had the small therapeutic unit, they can\u2019t fix all this on their own. They need the systems outside the prison to be doing their job, and that\u2019s not happening. The NSW Friends of Palestine group have written to the NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, urging the government to help find a compromise with NSW police and allow this weekend\u2019s planned pro-Palestinian protests to go ahead. As the Guardian\u2019s Mostafa Rachwani reported this morning, NSW police plan on applying to the state\u2019s supreme court to prevent the protests going ahead on the grounds of safety concerns, a move protesters say is an attack on the fundamental democratic right to protest. The Labor group are appealing to Catley to find a middle road. In a letter sent to the police minister, Labor members said \u201crank and file ALP branch members have demonstrated consistent support for the Palestinian people through branch and conference resolutions, fundraising for humanitarian aid, and through participation in the weekly rallies\u201d and that Labor Friends of Palestine members \u201chave participated in every Sydney rally for the last 51 weeks\u201d. In a letter seen by Guardian Australia, Louisa Romanous wrote on behalf of the group: Over that time, we have found the rallies to be peaceful and well-organised. We acknowledge that last Sunday\u2019s rally had a different tone \u2013 born out of the shock and distress arising from Israel\u2019s attacks on Lebanon. Members of the Australian-Lebanese community expressed their profound grief and pain in many different ways, with a very small number flying Hezbollah flags. Notwithstanding the heightened emotions, at no time did the rally feel unsafe or violent. The NSW police announcement that they will seek to prohibit this week\u2019s rally seems a disproportionate response to the actions we observed at the rally, and prohibiting a rally on such a key date is a profound attack on political expression and the right to protest. The group said \u201cLabor governments should protect peaceful protest as a critical feature of social democracy and progressive politics\u201d and urged Catley to \u201cintervene in this matter and work constructively with police, rally organisers and affected communities to facilitate an outcome that will allow a peaceful rally and march to occur as planned on Sunday 6th October in Sydney\u201d. Children\u2019s commissioner says minister for children would improve coordination The children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Hollands, has been taking questions following her speech at the National Press Club. She was asked about her call for a minister for children: why was it not sufficient to simply have the existing minister for youth? Hollonds noted the work the youth minister is doing, but said she wants to see a minister for children in cabinet as well: Not because that person can fix it on their own, by the way, because having someone \u2013 it would make my life easier, I would have one minister to talk to, not fifty million \u2013 but at the moment there\u2019s no coordination. That minister would ideally work with colleagues to ensure we get better coordination and work with the jurisdictions on these sorts of reforms we\u2019re talking about. A NSW police letter to organisers of a pro-Palestine rally planned for Sunday at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall says the force has concerns for the safety of participants and the general public given the size of the expected crowd and hazards within the precinct including \u201cthe recent addition of over a dozen planter boxes\u201d for spring. The force also notes the potential impact of the rally on other users of the Town Hall precinct including light rail commuters and attendees at the nearby St Andrews cathedral. The police letter to the organisers does not mention the potential presence of prohibited images such as the Hezbollah flag which was allegedly displayed at last Sunday\u2019s protest in Sydney\u2019s CBD. The NSW Greens justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the move by NSW police to ban this weekend\u2019s protests at Town Hall was \u201coppressive.\u201d It is a harsh and oppressive move by the NSW police force to attempt to prohibit the peaceful, uninterrupted weekly assembly where people have been expressing their collective grief and support of the Palestinian people suffering the most horrific genocide. To learn that the reason for this undemocratic intolerance of the people\u2019s right to protest is [partly] due to a few planter boxes on the street is cruel, callous and frankly dangerous. After a meeting yesterday morning with organisers, NSW police said they were \u201cnot satisfied that the protest could proceed safely\u201d and signalled they would apply to the NSW supreme court to have Sunday\u2019s protest banned \u2013 along with another event scheduled for Monday. Anti-trans activist Kellie-Jay Keen says visa to Australia has not been granted Kellie-Jay Keen, aka Posie Parker, has ditched plans to appear at the conservative talkfest CPAC Australia in Brisbane this weekend after she said her visa to Australia had not been granted. The \u201cgender-critical\u201d activist from the UK, who made headlines in Australia last year when her rally outside the steps of parliament was gatecrashed by nazis, posted on X she was not flying to Australia in the morning due to a visa not being granted and she would instead be watching the live stream of the defamation trial brought by Liberal MP Moira Deeming against state Liberal leader John Pesutto over comments made about her attendance that rally. CPAC Australia also claimed on its website the talk had been \u201cCANCELLED VISA REFUSED\u201d [sic]. But it is understood the Department of Home Affairs was still considering the visa application from Parker and no refusal had been issued. CPAC Australia was approached for comment. The headline act for CPAC Australia will be former UK prime minister Liz Truss. Other speakers include Warren Mundine, Senator Alex Antic, Senator Bridget McKenzie, Senator Matt Canavan, the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and Senator Gerard Rennick. More from Anne Hollonds\u2019 national press club address Anne Hollonds is calling for the government to appoint a cabinet minister for children and to establish a ministerial council for child wellbeing that reports to national cabinet. She said Australia ratified the convention on the rights of the child in 1990 but \u201cunlike other countries, we have no legislation to underpin the responsibilities we have signed up to\u201d: There is currently noone held responsible, for example, when the conditions in detention are breaching international human rights conventions. And this was made clear at a recent inquest into the tragic death by suicide of young Cleveland Dodd. Hollonds argued the concept that children have human rights is \u201cnot well understood\u201d in Australia: You never hear children\u2019s rights talked about in question time, or on the news. But you\u2019ll hear about workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights, consumer rights, for example. The term children\u2019s rights, well, it doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it, in Australia. And that helps to explain why we continue to see breaches of human rights, and in child justice system. It\u2019s getting worse, not better, and it has to stop. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Commissioner says some politicians told her: \u2018there\u2019s no votes in children\u2019 Circling back to the National Press Club, where the children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, has been speaking. She said that when she has raised issues of youth justice with members of Parliament, some have said \u201cthere\u2019s no votes in children\u201d: The truth is while we may all be shocked in the moment when there\u2019s a tragedy reported in the media \u2013 and there\u2019s just about every week \u2013 these serious failures and systemic neglect of children do not seem to affect a party\u2019s political fortunes at elections. Despite the economic costs and the questionable morality of strategies contrary to the evidence, when I ask about lack of progress on reform, I\u2019m told by some members of Parliament there\u2019s no votes in children. Attempts to stop pro-Palestine rallies in Sydney \u2018deeply anti democractic\u2019, Greens senator says Greens senator David Shoebridge has labelled the move by NSW police to try to stop pro-Palestine rallies from taking place in Sydney as \u201cdeeply anti democratic\u201d. In a post to X, Shoebridge said the protests have been held weekly for 51 weeks and have been \u201coverwhelmingly peaceful,\u201d with families and the community coming together to \u201cmourn their loved ones and call for the end of violence.\u201d The organisers were in discussions with police on how to hold the protest and keep the community safe but then found out via the media that police were trying to block it! It\u2019s a deeply anti-democratic move. Children\u2019s commissioner \u2018shocked and distressed\u2019 after visiting youth detention centres Continuing from our last post: Anne Hollonds said that what she saw during visits to the nation\u2019s youth detention centres left her \u201cshocked and distressed\u201d. As AAP reports, she told the audience: What was most chilling for me was to meet children who had no one, who were completely alone, who spoke of feeling shut out and shunned by society. These children were unable to tell me about any hopes or dreams or plans for the future. All they could see in their future was more of the same but in adult prison. Barely literate, their lack of education or training gave them no prospects for a job, and they had no one to help them. The light had gone out of their eyes. The children\u2019s commissioner warned unless the nation started paying attention to the evidence, the community would be having the same conversation in a decade\u2019s time, only with a lot more tragedies along the way. Australia can be \u2018smart on crime\u2019 by acting on the evidence, dealing with the barriers to reform, and building safe communities where children can get the best start in life. Children\u2019s commissioner addresses National Press Club The national children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, has begun addressing the National Press Club in Canberra. As AAP reports, Hollonds is making the case that Australia must abandon its tough approach to managing youth crime and start looking to evidence-based solutions \u2013 including earlier intervention to help save children from \u201cdisadvantage, despair and desperation\u201d. Youth detention centres are the places where the most egregious breaches of the human rights of children are happening. Australia cannot continue with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and should ditch its failed approach of longer sentencing, more policing and more children\u2019s prisons, she said. Instead, it should look to change youth justice to improve child wellbeing. After the child protection system, often the next station on the train line for them is the criminal justice system. More activists sought over violent anti-war protests The search for anti-war protesters wanted over clashes outside a controversial Melbourne weapons expo has stepped up, AAP reports. Images of eight people \u2013 seven men and one woman \u2013 have been released after the unrest triggered by the Land Forces expo on 11 September. Rocks, projectiles, liquids, horse manure and eggs were hurled at officers, horses and expo attenders, police say. Twenty-seven officers were injured and about 12 horses were exposed to various substances. Victoria police said in a statement today: Several police horses and riders were splashed with a liquid irritant including being sprayed under face protectors, going into their mouths and nostrils, and were repeatedly pushed and hit with plastic crates. Riot officers returned fire on the 1,500 demonstrators with rubber bullets, teargas and flashbang devices. Activity over the following two days of the expo was less volatile. Eighty-nine people were charged or issued fines, with police setting up an investigative team to track down more offenders. They have also released an image of a man wearing a blue shirt and keffiyeh after a council bin was set alight on Spencer Street. The chief commissioner, Shane Patton, defended his officers\u2019 use of force against the protesters, who he called \u201ca bunch of hypocrites\u201d. He said at the time: \u201cThey come here to protest against anti-war, so presumably [they are] anti-violence.\u201d The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, says the \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d in the Middle East requires \u201cpeople and governments around the world to keep pushing for peace through taking action.\u201d In a series of posts to X, Bandt said underlying the conflict is \u201cthe state of Israel\u2019s continued illegal occupation of Palestine\u201d and \u201cuntil this ends, there will be no just [and] lasting peace for Palestinians, Israelis and their neighbours.\u201d He said that Labor \u201cmust do more than simply call for a ceasefire\u201d and should pressure the Netanyahu government \u201cwith sanctions and an end to military trade\u201d. This is what can help end the cycle of violence \u2026 The Greens continue to call for the release of the hostages, an end to the invasion of Gaza and Lebanon, and an end to the illegal occupation of Palestine. More on the evacuations from Lebanon More Australians have left Lebanon after the Israeli military strikes, however, the government is continuing to warn people to move quickly. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says staff are continuing to work with allied nations, including the UK and Canada, to help Australians leave Lebanon. A Dfat spokesperson says the time to act is now: A number of Australians were assisted onto commercial flights on Monday and overnight. Further seats have been secured on additional flights on Thursday and we are working to access more flights over the coming days. The Australian embassy in Beirut remains open and for the meantime there are still commercial options, although contingency plans are in place. However officials have warned people not to wait any longer if they want to leave. The Australian government understands this is a distressing time for many who are being impacted by the conflict. We urge Australians in Lebanon to take the first opportunity to leave. Please do not wait for a preferred route. There is estimated to be about 15,000 Australians in Lebanon although the government does not have exact numbers. More than 100 airline seats secured for Australians fleeing Lebanon AAP has reported more than 100 commercial airline seats have been secured for Australians trying to leave Lebanon as dire warnings continue for people to evacuate amid an escalation of conflict in the region. Flights across Monday and Tuesday carried dozens of Australians out while another scheduled flight for Thursday will add to the tally. It comes as Australians in Lebanon are urged to take any available option to get out of the country as the security situation deteriorates following an increase in missile strikes across Lebanon and Israel. The federal government continues to work on contingencies to evacuate citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families from Lebanon should the situation deteriorate further. But grave warnings have been issued that any effort cannot accommodate the some 15,000 Australians in the country, although exact figures are unknown. There\u2019s a new report out from NRMA Insurance looking at the road ahead for electric vehicle adoption in Australia. It says EV sales have grown in Australia, from less than 1% of new car sales in 2020 to 8.5% of light vehicle sales in 2023. Uptake has been strongest among drivers with annual household incomes over $200,000, families with children and those in capital cities. Currently 5% of Australian drivers own an EV. The two biggest drivers for purchasing one were sustainability reasons, at 77%, and affordability, at 76%. But one of the biggest barriers is an \u201cimage problem\u201d, the report states, with \u201cpetrol and hybrid vehicles are seen by many purchasers as being superior vehicles to EVs.\u201d Some of barriers to buying an EV among non-considerers were vehicle attributes (82%), infrastructure (64%), cost (63%) and safety (51%). 44% also listed the risk of battery fires as a concern, even though research shows road registered EVs do not present a greater risk of fire than internal combustion vehicles. NRMA CEO Julie Batch says the report highlights the work needed to bust the myths about range anxiety, safety and cost. The report is based on research involving 2,079 interviews conducted in February. Victorian minister says protesters should \u2018think twice\u2019 about holding rallies on 7 October Victoria\u2019s assistant treasurer and minister for transport, Danny Pearson, says pro-Palestine protesters should \u201cthink twice\u201d about holding rallies on the anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Speaking to reporters, Pearson said 7 October will be an \u201cincredibly challenging and difficult day for many members of our community.\u201d I would really encourage people to really think twice about whether that\u2019s a day where these sorts of activities should be occurring. This is a day of immense trauma and grief for many in our community ... I don\u2019t think a protest is an appropriate way to mark a day of grief and trauma. In Melbourne, a pro-Palestine rally is planned for Sunday, the day before the anniversary. For more on this topic, our reporter Tory Shepherd has put together an explainer on what Australian law says about the display of hate symbols, and if we need any new legislation \u2013 as Peter Dutton has been calling for. More information on arrest of woman in Sydney NSW Police have made their first arrest as part of their investigations into people allegedly holding Hezbollah imagery at the pro-Palestine protest last Sunday. At around 10am this morning, a 19-year-old woman presented herself to Kogarah Police Station following a public appeal for her to come forward. Police said in a statement she was arrested and is currently assisting police with inquiries. The Guardian understands she has been arrested for the alleged display of Hezbollah imagery, which the police have described as \u201cprohibited symbols\u201d. She was arrested as part of Operation Shelter\u2019s investigation into the protest, with the taskforce established to \u201censure community safety in response to protest activity.\u201d Investigations continue. Victoria police say they have no powers to halt a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne this weekend, ahead of the anniversary of the 7 October attacks in Israel. A spokesperson says the police will have a presence at the Melbourne rally on Sunday, a day before the anniversary. The spokesperson says the focus will be on ensuring the safety of those attending and the broader community: Victoria Police respects the right for peaceful protest, however any unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated. Victoria Police does not have the power to deny a protest from occurring, so long as it is lawful. There is no permit system for protests in Victoria. A woman has been arrested as part of an investigation into a public order incident at a protest last Sunday. About 10am today, the 19-year-old woman presented to Kogarah police station following a public appeal for information. Earlier, NSW police released images of a woman and said she might be able to assist with inquiries into the alleged display of prohibited symbols at the protest. She has been arrested and is currently assisting police with inquiries. Shorten pleads with Australians to \u2018live and let live\u2019 Retiring federal minister Bill Shorten has urged Australians deeply distressed about events in the Middle East to \u201clive and let live\u201d and not to prosecute their arguments in ways that break Australian law. At a news conference alongside prime minister Anthony Albanese in Shorten\u2019s Melbourne seat of Maribyrnong, the minister echoed Albanese\u2019s concerns about public demonstrations planned for this weekend to mark a year since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel. I respect that people from Gaza, from the West Bank, from Lebanon, from Israel, feel really strongly and they\u2019re going through pain, which the rest of us who don\u2019t have family there can\u2019t even begin to understand. But people shouldn\u2019t bring their arguments to this country and disrespect our laws. He and Albanese both acknowledged that the October 7 attacks represented the single largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. Albanese, who earlier indicated he will attend a vigil for Israeli victims of the attacks in Melbourne, urged people to rethink plans to stage public protests (see earlier in the blog). Shorten endorsed Albanese\u2019s comments and asked: Can\u2019t we just live and let live here and try the best we can to maintain harmony? New study aims to improve health outcomes for NSW prisoners Researchers will examine how to improve the \u201chealth literacy\u201d and provide better care for New South Wales prisoners, particularly those who are Aboriginal, in what the state government says is a world-first study. The Minns Labor government has announced a $500,000 grant for Justice Health NSW (JHNSW), the agency responsible for providing healthcare to people in the criminal justice system. The purpose of the study is to work out how to provide prisoners with better and more equitable access to health information and services, including to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. The government hopes to improve health outcomes for prisoners and in turn reduce the need for more expensive acute care. The study will be led by JHNSW\u2019s Dr Julia Bowman and Swinburne University\u2019s Professor Richard Osborne. It follows previous research that found people incarcerated in NSW prisons, particularly Aboriginal people, have poorer health outcomes and lower health literacy than those in the wider community. In a statement, the state minister for Aboriginal affairs, David Harris, said: While there are many strengths in the current service provision for people in prison, there is an opportunity to better address the specific needs of Aboriginal people. This grant will fund an extensive co-design process to build on existing strengths and further enhance the overall health of people in NSW prisons. China\u2019s green tech investment tsunami could lap Australian shores, report says There\u2019s no doubt China has grabbed market leadership in many of the technologies we need to decarbonise our economies, from solar panels and wind turbines to electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. Australia stands to benefit from those advances and potentially from soaring outbound investment in low-emissions technology, according to a new report by Climate Energy Finance, out today. Since 2023, US$100bn (A$145bn) of Chinese investment has poured out of China into at least 100 deals, a flow of funds that Australia has partly benefitted from, with more to come, the report finds. A 1.4 gigawatt windfarm with a big battery is one such project. However, barriers to Chinese money \u2013 including foreign investment approvals \u2013 have meant \u201cChinese private investment in Australia is weak relative to the rest of the world\u201d, the report by Tim Buckley and other authors says. It makes geopolitical and economic sense for Australia to find a strategic way to work with our biggest trading partner and the region\u2019s major power, while navigating the challenges and risks Chinese technology and manufacturing expansion and its global critical minerals supply chain dominance pose. Others, though, say Australia may have to choose between teaming up with the dominant clean energy supply or joining the US, the European Union and other regions (eg India) in trying to push back against that dominance. That dilemma will play out in Albanese government plans for a $1bn solar panel plant in NSW\u2019s Hunter Valley. The most likely route of success would be to lure one of China\u2019s huge solar firms but that would then run counter to efforts to reduce reliance on a nation that supplies as much as 90% of the global market. One thing for sure, though, the world needs to accelerate decarbonisation, one way or another. Fourth-hottest Australian September on record Peter Hannam has shared a few graphics on September\u2019s national weather. As is pretty much a given, the month was warmer than the 1961-90 benchmark, and by mean temperatures (that average out maximums and minimums) it was the fourth hottest on record. And here\u2019s those maximums \u2013 with September 1.9C on average warmer than the 1961-90 gauge: Minimums were notably above average across much of the country, and at record warm levels in the north-west: Those overnight temperatures were warm because there was a lot of cloud around, producing a record wet September for a large chunk of that north-west region. And the relatively warm September followed a \u201cgobsmackingly\u201d hot August, which shattered records for that month. Albanese on Dutton: \u2018not strong to not understand there\u2019s a separation of powers in this country\u2019 Anthony Albanese was asked whether he agrees with comments from the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, accusing Peter Dutton of seeking to \u201cthrow more kerosene on the fire\u201d on public debate around the Middle East conflict. The PM told reporters: Peter Dutton has never seen an issue in which he does not seek to promote division. And that is the characteristic that Peter Dutton has had his entire political career. It\u2019s not strong to not understand that there\u2019s a separation of powers in this country. As Dutton flagged earlier, Albanese confirmed he spoke with Dutton on Saturday to provide a briefing on the situation in the Middle East and on domestic security concerns. The prime minister also commented on the alleged display of Hezbollah flags at a rally last weekend, and said: The Hezbollah flag is quite clearly a hate symbol and should not be displayed here in Australia. Anthony Albanese says he believes 7 October is not a time for demonstrations to occur. Speaking about the protests planned for 6 and 7 October, he told reporters: What I would encourage at all times is for there to be appropriate moderation. These are difficult times. I understand that, for many Australians with family \u2013 be it in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, or in Lebanon, this is a very difficult time. It\u2019s not a time to raise temperature. It\u2019s a time to try to make sure that social cohesion in Australia is valued. So October 7, I think, is not a time for demonstrations to occur. Because it will be perceived as \u2013 whether that\u2019s the intention or not \u2013 as being something that is less than an appropriate commemoration of the atrocities that occurred on October 7, and it will do nothing to advance the cause. Albanese is asked if Australia supports Israel\u2019s efforts to \u2018take out Hezbollah\u2019 Asked if Israel must disable Hezbollah to defend itself, and if the Australian government supports Israel\u2019s efforts to \u201ctake out Hezbollah\u201d, Anthony Albanese responds: We regard Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation, as we regard Hamas as a terrorist organisation. We have been working with like-minded countries and issuing appropriate statements, such as the one that I referred to. This is the statement he was referring to: Prime minister addresses media from Melbourne The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking to the media from Melbourne. He reiterated the call for a de-escalation to the conflict in the Middle East and said: We\u2019re very concerned about Iran\u2019s actions, which is why we condemn them. It is a good thing that it would appear that the defence of Israel, supported by the United States, has ensured that there is no loss of civilian life, it would appear, at this stage. There\u2019s been too much loss of life in that region \u2026 Israel, of course, has a right to defend itself. What we have called for consistently is for a de-escalation in the region, along with our friends in the United States and others. Queensland opposition leader hits back at premier\u2019s public power promise The Queensland opposition leader David Crisafulli his back at the premier\u2019s power retailer announcement at an event in Brisbane. (We covered this earlier in the blog, here). The LNP leader called the plan \u201ca desperate thought bubble \u201c. The solution is state owned generators running at capacity, not more, state owned retailers running off with your money. And I want to give you certainty that what Queenslanders want is security when it comes to energy; a maintenance guarantee on our assets. What they don\u2019t need is a distraction to take away from ten years of bad planning that has meant that you are paying more for your electricity. Speaking at day two of the AgForce agricultural industry conference, Crisafulli announced a $30m agricultural innovation fund. Dutton says he was briefed by director general of national security Peter Dutton said he received a briefing from the director general of national security a couple of weeks ago in Canberra. We had a discussion, obviously, around the Middle East, as well as on other topics. The opposition leader said he has asked his office to organise briefings from the director general of Asio and Defence, \u201cif the government deems it appropriate\u201d and with the head of Asis as well. I had a conversation with the prime minister on the weekend, and I was sent a piece of intelligence in relation to \u2013 which is at a fairly high level, but nonetheless, I appreciated that update as well. Dutton says Minns \u2018has shown leadership\u2019 over pro-Palestinian protests Q: If NSW police fail to block pro-Palestinian protests in Sydney, how should police respond? Should they go out and arrest people who turn up? Peter Dutton said he pays credit to NSW premier Chris Minns \u201cwho I think has shown leadership in relationship to this particular issue, and I think that\u2019s recognised in the Jewish community as well.\u201d (You can read Minns\u2019 comments earlier in the blog here). Dutton said he hoped Victorian police would follow suit with NSW police in applying to court to stop the protests. That is not an anniversary that should be celebrated. Dutton claims PM\u2019s response to Iran strikes \u2018has made it more precarious for us here\u2019 The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is speaking to reporters and commented on the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. Dutton said he \u201ccondemn[s] absolutely\u201d the actions of Iran, and argued \u201cthe way in which the prime minister has responded, or has not responded here, has made it more precarious for us here in Australia as well.\u201d The prime minister should be standing up, as the United States has stood up overnight, as the United Kingdom has, as Canada has, to condemn the actions and to make sure that decisions are made to keep us safe here in Australia as well. Earlier this morning, Anthony Albanese said the Australian government condemns the attack on Israel by Iran as an \u201can extremely dangerous escalation\u201d. He also said there \u201cdoes at some point need to be a diplomatic solution here.\u201d You can read his full comments here and here. Police want to speak with woman regarding alleged display of prohibited symbols at protest NSW police have released images of a woman they believe can assist with investigations into a public order incident in Sydney last Sunday. The investigation is part of Operation Shelter, which police launched in October 2023 to \u201censure community safety in response to protest activity.\u201d In a statement NSW police said the woman might be able to assist with inquiries into the alleged display of prohibited symbols last Sunday. The woman is described as being of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern appearance, of medium build, with long brown hair, wearing all black clothing and black sunglasses. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Premier backs NSW police bid to stop pro-Palestine rallies from going ahead The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, says he supports the police\u2019s decision to apply to the supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. Speaking to reporters earlier this morning, he said: I want to make it clear, we completely support police\u2019s decision in relation to that application. The reasons are, it\u2019s the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack in Israel. Obviously, community anger and concern on the streets is heightened as a result of that anniversary. It\u2019s also in the middle of the school holidays. The protests and march was scheduled to take place in the evening. It\u2019s a long weekend in Sydney, and the police \u2026 [believed] that there was a high prospect of conflict on the streets of Sydney. Special envoy on antisemitism responds to Iranian missile attack on Israel Jillian Segal, the special envoy on combatting antisemitism, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning after the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. Segal said she is \u201cvery concerned about what we are seeing on our streets\u201d in Australia, and pointed to the alleged display of Hezbollah flags at a rally last weekend: I think that was truly shocking for the Jewish community, and should be shocking for the general community, because we must challenge terrorism. Segal said that if the current legislation isn\u2019t strong enough to address this, \u201cthen we need to revise them\u201d. You can read more about this below: Segal also said she plans to set up a meeting with the special envoy on combatting Islamophobia, Aftab Malik: I think it\u2019s very important that we work separately with our communities and with the general community, and we work together, because we\u2019re all about reducing antisemitism, reducing hatred, and increasing social cohesion. And we need to put our heads together and work with the community as a whole, and try and bring about that situation here where what happens in the Middle East does not undermine our social cohesion here in Australia, and I think that\u2019s everyone\u2019s wish. Queensland premier Steven Miles would create a publicly owned \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d energy provider in a bid to drive down power prices if his government is re-elected later this month. The promise comes on day two of the sunshine state\u2019s election campaign with Miles in the north Queensland city of Mackay \u2013 a seat held by Labor for more than a century. Miles posted on social media: The people\u2019s provider will ensure households and businesses reap the benefits of that \u2013 not foreign shareholders. We know how important it is to make energy bills cheaper for Queenslanders. It\u2019s simple \u2013 people before profits. UNHCR\u2019s Australia chief says thousands of people looking for shelter in Beirut Trudi Mitchell, the CEO of the UN Human Rights Council in Australia, says an estimated 1 million people have been displaced within Lebanon amid the conflict in the Middle East. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Mitchell described the situation as \u201cterrible for innocent civilians\u201d. We\u2019re hearing that people are sleeping on the ground and that, in Beirut, there\u2019s thousands of people just looking for shelter right now. Asked what message UNHCR has for the Australian government \u2013 in terms of its role with partner countries in pushing for de-escalation \u2013 she said: Obviously we want a political solution to this situation. Without that, we need support from a humanitarian aid perspective, and we ask that of the government, and we welcome that from the government as well as the Australian general public. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has responded to reports that NSW police have applied to the state\u2019s supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. In a post to social media, Faruqi wrote: Peaceful protests against Israel\u2019s genocide have been happening weekly for almost a year now. This is silencing dissent. Anthony Albanese has declined to describe the rapidly shifting events in the Middle East as a \u201cwar\u201d, choosing instead to call it \u201can escalation of the conflict\u201d. Asked on ABC Radio in Melbourne why he wouldn\u2019t call it a war, Albanese repeated his description and said: I don\u2019t want to get into a definitional argument. What you have is a tragedy. The prime minister said diplomacy \u201ccannot succeed\u201d in an escalating conflict but that must be the ultimate objective. There does at some point need to be a diplomatic solution here. On the reported plans for public gatherings over the weekend to mark one year since the 7 October Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, Albanese said there should not be \u201canything that looks like a celebration\u201d because it would cause disharmony and was inappropriate. He confirmed he would attend a vigil in Melbourne and declined to say whether pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel gatherings, including vigils, should be cancelled, saying those decisions were a matter for police and they had his backing. Albanese also confirmed that the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, would no longer be travelling to Israel to represent Australia at commemorative events over the weekend, citing the security situation. \u2018It\u2019s important we reflect the nation back to itself\u2019 Host Patricia Karvelas asks the ABC\u2019s managing director how lived experience should be incorporated in journalism? David Anderson said there were \u201ca few absolutes\u201d, including the legislation the ABC operates within \u2013 stating that \u201cimpartiality and accuracy are absolutely paramount\u201d. When it comes to people\u2019s personal and lived experience in storytelling, it\u2019s important that we reflect the nation back to itself. It\u2019s important that we \u2013 in who we are and what we do \u2013 that we [are] a good cross section of the population. So what we intend to do is sort of better clarify when people can bring in their personal, lived experience that doesn\u2019t impede their obligations with regard to impartiality. Anderson said there are good examples of this over time, and there are \u201csome not great examples of where this has attempted to happen, and we failed and failed around editorial standards.\u201d So this is why we accept that we can clarify this. We could do that better to provide better guidance for people. And I have to say, internally, the ABC people are asking for it. ABC managing director says he reached out to Stan Grant ahead of racism review\u2019s release The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, spoke with ABC RN this morning after the release of the independent racism review yesterday. Asked if the review was triggered by the resignation of prominent First Nations journalist Stan Grant, Anderson said it was a \u201ccombination of things\u201d but \u201cthat was certainly one of them\u201d. Anderson said he has reached out to Grant, and said: I don\u2019t want to focus on that too much. I think that I\u2019ve got a great deal of respect for Stan. I simply told Stan, this was coming. What I\u2019m looking to do through media I\u2019ve done yesterday and today is really focus on the report itself, on the findings of that report, the 120 people that gave their testimony to this, that described the racism that they have experienced \u2026 [and] concentrate on those recommendations. Here\u2019s a look at the national weather forecast across Australia\u2019s capital cities today, thanks to the Bureau of Meteorology: Anthony Albanese says that the Australian government condemns Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. In a post to X, the prime minister wrote: This is an extremely dangerous escalation \u2013 Australia and the global community have been clear in our calls for de-escalation. Further hostilities put civilians at risk. We are monitoring the situation closely and encourage Australians in Israel to follow the advice of local authorities. One in three Australians throwing unwanted clothes in rubbish, survey finds Most Australians are confused about what to do with their unwanted clothes, leading about a third to throw their closet clutter in the rubbish, according to the first national survey of clothing use and disposal habits. The RMIT-led survey of 3,080 Australians found 84% of people owned garments they hadn\u2019t worn in the past year, including a third who hadn\u2019t touched more than half of their wardrobe. The survey\u2019s lead author, Dr Alice Payne, said the results revealed consumers were confused about how to responsibly discard clothing. Continue reading below: Shadow foreign minister on Iranian attacks on Israel The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, has issued the following statement on social media following the Iranian attacks on Israel overnight: Iran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism, including Hamas, Hezbollah [and] Houthis, has inflicted great suffering on many. We condemn Iran\u2019s attacks on Israel via proxy [and] their direct strikes. Australia must support Israel\u2019s right to self defence, including the removal of such threats. Government secures more seats for Australians to leave Lebanon on Thursday The foreign minister, Penny Wong, said the government is working to help Australians who want to leave Lebanon, \u201cincluding with partners such as Canada and the UK.\u201d She said a number of Australians were assisted onto commercial flights on Monday and overnight, and additional seats have been secured for flights on Thursday. We are working to access more flights over coming days. DFAT is contacting registered Australians with updates. Australians in Lebanon who wish to leave should ensure they are registered via DFAT\u2019s crisis portal. Three Russians from the cybercrime group Evil Corp have been slapped with fresh sanctions and travel bans by the federal government, AAP reports. The senior officials from the group, which has carried out ransomware attacks across the United States and Europe, will be banned from entering Australia under the penalties. The sanctions on Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets, Igor Olegovich Turashev and Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov will make it an offence for people to provide or deal with assets belonging to the Russians. The Russian cyber criminal gang have been accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars around the world in hacking efforts. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said the sanctions would help to deter other cyber attacks: These sanctions are only possible because of the efforts of our domestic and international partner agencies who work tirelessly to disrupt cybercriminals and protect Australians from ransomware. Murray Watt was also asked about the move from NSW police to try to stop a pro-Palestine protest planned for 7 October, and whether he thinks this is appropriate. The employment minister said protest permits are \u201calways going to be a matter for state governments and state police\u201d. But what I can make clear is that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable for anyone to celebrate the October 7 terrorist attack, whether that be on seventh of October in a few days time or any other date. It was an appalling terrorist incident cost many lives\u2026 the worst loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a cause for anyone to celebrate. Amal Naser, spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, yesterday said protesters are intending to \u201cdefending our right to protest and are determined to continue standing for justice for Palestine and Lebanon.\u201d Asked if the Australian government wants Israel to temper its response to the Iranian attack overnight, Murray Watt said: \u201cWe want to see hostilities end from all sides of this conflict.\u201d International law applies to all countries. There\u2019s no doubting whatsoever that Hezbollah is a terrorist organisation and it needs to be dealt with, as does Hamas. That\u2019s been something that our ministers and our government have been saying for some time. But we don\u2019t want to see Lebanese or Israeli civilians continue to pay the price of this conflict\u2026 Watt was again asked if Australian believes Israel should \u201cnow hold back\u201d, and responded that a ceasefire is the preference. And that does involve all parties de-escalating rather than continuing to ramp up the hostilities. We support Israel and the entire region\u2019s security \u2026 but we need to end this dangerous cycle of violence, and that requires all parties to negotiate, to cease hostilities and to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically. Australia \u2018very willing to play our part\u2019 in deescalating Middle East conflict, Watt says Murray Watt said the Australian government wants to see the \u201cimmediate de-escalation of the conflict in and around Lebanon\u201d and for this to be \u201cresolved diplomatically\u201d. We have already seen far too many civilians killed in the conflict around Gaza. We\u2019re deeply concerned about the risk of more civilian deaths in and around Lebanon, and this needs an effort from the international community to bring this to an end, to have an immediate ceasefire, and Australia is very willing to play our part in getting to that point. Patricia Karvelas asked if Israel has a right to respond to the attack overnight? Watt said \u201cwe certainly acknowledge that there have been hostilities inflicted on Israel for some time now\u201d, and continued: This is this is a situation [where] we want to work with Israel and neighbouring countries to bring to an end \u2013 It\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interest, whether it be Israel or its neighbouring countries, for this conflict to go on, to continue to see civilian deaths on both sides of the border, and we\u2019re determined to work with the international community to bring that to an end. The Labor minister Murray Watt has been speaking to ABC RN about the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. Host Patricia Karvelas says Australia is calling for a ceasefire but the US has been providing Israel support \u2013 and asks where the Australian government stands. Watt says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t put it that way\u201d. This is obviously an extremely dangerous escalation that we\u2019ve seen overnight, and Australia unreservedly condemns Iran\u2019s actions in what it\u2019s done overnight. But I think what we\u2019ve seen in recent days is that not just Australia, but the global community generally, has been very clear in our calls for de-escalation in the region. You would have seen a few days ago, 21 countries from around the world \u2013 including Australia, the US, the UK, the EU and a number of other countries \u2013 called for an immediate ceasefire in and around Lebanon. So our position, I think, is actually consistent with those of like-minded countries in many parts of the world. Heatwave continuing in Top End of NT In more weather news, the heatwave is continuing in the Top End, with hot days and warm, humid nights. Heat in the Daly district peaked yesterday and is expected to peak again today, reaching extreme heatwave conditions. The heatwave is expected to continue through the weekend. Severe weather warning for south-west WA A severe weather warning has been issued for large parts of south-west Western Australia. Damaging wind gusts up to 100km/h are forecast as a cold front moves through, and locally destructive gusts up to 125km/h are possible about the coast later this evening. Australian Jewry chief says planned 7 October rallies are \u2018callous\u2019 and \u2018shameful\u2019 Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, has spoken with ABC News Breakfast after the Iranian missile attack on Israel overnight. He was asked about planned protests on 6 and 7 October this weekend (7 October is a public holiday in NSW), and whether people be able to peacefully rally and hold vigils to mark the anniversary? Ryvchin said \u201cwe have never opposed the right of anyone to gather peacefully\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019re talking about October 7\u201d. So for the pro-Palestinian people to want to gather on that day, which is about a week before Israel\u2019s response even began, it is callous, it\u2019s heartless and it\u2019s shameful. And I ask these people \u2013 show some concern for peace-loving Australians who just want to gather on October 7 and mourn and remember those who were needlessly massacred. Amal Naser, spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, said yesterday: \u201cWe intend on defending our right to protest and are determined to continue standing for justice for Palestine and Lebanon.\u201d About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, died on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel. More than 41,000 people have been killed in Gaza, mostly civilians, one in 55 of the pre-war population. More than 700 people have died in Lebanon in the recent wave of Israeli attacks. The origins of a human bone located at a Western Australian beach is being investigated by police. A member of the public located the bone at Cottesloe Beach in Perth on Saturday. It has since undergone assessment by a pathologist who determined it to be human. Western Australia police said in a statement that further forensic testing will take place to \u201cmatch the bone to any outstanding missing persons\u201d. The children\u2019s commissioner said that when it comes to the role of the media in this issue, what she has observed is \u201ca lack of interest in the solutions to the problem\u201d. Anne Hollonds told ABC RN: There\u2019s a lot of reporting of apparent youth crime, you know, lots of headlines like \u2018teenage dirt bags\u2019 and \u2018kindergarten crims\u2019. We know crime sells\u2026 But there\u2019s not a lot of digging in and asking, \u2018well, why are these children offending, and what can we do to prevent that?\u2019 \u2026 The media, in just reporting it again and again, in showing all the footage that we get from CCTV and dashcam and body cam and iPhones now, that\u2019s kind of creating more and more fear \u2013 which really is just escalating the pressure on the politicians to be tough. Many police and frontline staff aren\u2019t trained to care for children, Hollonds says Anne Hollonds was asked about her proposal to build a capable and child-specialised workforce \u2013 and how this could happen amid broader workforce issues? She said it was the \u201cfailures of support and training\u201d for frontline personnel that \u201ccame up again and again\u201d in submissions and roundtables and interviews while compiling the report. We see it in the police watch houses, for example \u2026 Those police have no training to care for any children, let alone children with serious disabilities and mental health issues, and who are traumatised. So it\u2019s not fair on those frontline staff, by the way \u2013 it\u2019s not fair on them to put them in those positions, but mostly I\u2019m worried about the children, because it\u2019s not fair on them. We can\u2019t expect them to get the care they need if we don\u2019t support the staff. Q: Is there any appetite from the federal government to coordinate such an approach with the states to youth justice? Anne Hollonds said \u201cso far, I haven\u2019t had that indication\u201d, but she has had indication from the state\u2019s they would be willing to work together on this: I am hoping that we may have reached a tipping point whereby the horrendous failures in these systems that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 such as the two tragic suicides of children in youth detention recently, within less than a year, and other horrific stories \u2013 I\u2019m hoping that there is an appetite for thinking \u2018well, we need to take a different approach\u2019. We need to pivot towards the solutions that will focus on addressing the underlying causes, because just locking up these children is not a winning strategy at all for anybody. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Children\u2019s commissioner to address National Press Club today on youth justice The children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Hollonds, is due to address the National Press Club today on a new report calling for an overhaul of Australia\u2019s approach to child justice. The report has been developed over 12 months and contains 24 recommendations, focusing on elevating child wellbeing to a national priority, coordinating action on child justice reform across Australia\u2019s federation, and ensuring reform is based on evidence and human rights. She spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning ahead of the speech, and was asked about a campaign slogan from the Queensland opposition \u2013 \u201cadult crime, adult time\u201d \u2013 at the centre of the Liberal National party\u2019s youth justice campaign. Is her approach at the polar opposite of that? Hollonds responded: That kind of slogan really is trying to show that \u2018we\u2019re really tough up here, we\u2019re going to be tough on crime\u2019. And what our report shows is that that approach, that traditional approach in this country, hasn\u2019t worked and and that basically it\u2019s evident that we\u2019ve misunderstood the nature of the problem we\u2019re trying to solve. We know that toughening up the justice system doesn\u2019t actually prevent crime by children. Hollonds argued there is currently \u201cno accountability and no national coordination\u201d on how the wellbeing of children is looked after in the country. The idea that the states and territories could fix this on their own has been misguided, we need to work together on it. \u2018Absolutely shocking allegations there\u2019: O\u2019Neil on ABC racism review Claire O\u2019Neil was also asked about a report commissioned and released by the ABC, which spoke to 120 current and former staff \u2013 and all but one said they had personally experienced racism at the national broadcaster. The ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, has apologised to ABC staff who experienced racism at the public broadcaster: O\u2019Neil told Sunrise: I was really surprised by this. I was really surprised. We have really high standards for our national broadcaster and that is appropriate \u2026 [The ABC] is meant to represent all Australians and to hear this I was genuinely shocked. I am glad that they have made this report public and the CEO has made that public [apology] to all staff. Some of those things in that report was horrendous reading and not much fun for people at the end of that conduct. Great that it is public, but absolutely shocking allegations there. Hume asked about planned pro-Palestine protests As Mostafa Rachwani reported yesterday, the organisers behind the weekly pro-Palestine protests have criticised New South Wales police for their decision to apply to the state\u2019s supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead on 6 and 7 October. Amal Naser, spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, said the group \u201cunequivocally opposes this attempt to silence protests\u201d and that the application was an \u201cattack on fundamental democratic rights\u201d. The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, was also up on Sunrise this morning and commented on those protests planned for the weekend: My biggest concern for Monday for protest \u2013 that is a very important day for many people in Australia, particularly the Jewish community who will be acknowledging the anniversary of the largest loss of Jewish people\u2026 We would expect police will be doing everything that they can to make sure that their [is] peace on our streets\u2026 The housing minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, spoke with Sunrise just earlier about the Iranian missile attack on Israel \u2013 which she described as a \u201chugely concerning development\u201d that the Australian government \u201cutterly condemn[s]\u201d. Asked how many Australians were still in the region, O\u2019Neil said: There [are] roughly 15,000 [Australian\u2019s] still in Lebanon and the Australian government is doing what it can to assist those people. Clearly to those people in Lebanon it is not a safe place for you to be. Please get on commercial flights if you have those openings available. O\u2019Neil said there was a flight last night organised by the government to support Australians leaving the region, and there would be another one tonight. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. I\u2019ll be with you for most of the day, as we bring you our rolling coverage this Wednesday. As always, you can get in touch via X, @emilywindwrites, or email, emily.wind@theguardian.com, with any tips or thoughts. Let\u2019s get started. Users still frustrated despite falling telco complaints Complaints about telcos are slowly falling, but fed-up customers still deserve better service and faster fixes, the industry watchdog says. As AAP reports, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman reported a near-15% drop in complaints in 2023/24 compared to the previous year, with more issues needing escalation settled in a timely manner. Power players Telstra and Optus accounted for around two-thirds of all complaints, although Optus recorded the largest decrease of any of the 10 biggest providers. Optus\u2019s decline in complaints came despite its monstrous service outage in November 2023 that affected around 10 million people, with customers seeking remedies ranging from reconnection to a personal apology. Ombudsman Cynthia Gebert said the nature of the complaints still being received showed an unsatisfied customer base that should expect better. A provider either delaying or failing to take action featured in 63% of all complaints, while disputes about service and equipment fees were involved in one-third. Gebert: The data shows consumers remain frustrated by the same issues: poor customer service, delays in fixing problems, and service and equipment fees. Can (and should) authorities take action against protesters who wave the Hezbollah flag? Peter Dutton wants parliament urgently recalled to debate new anti-terror laws in the light of the Hezbollah flag-waving controversy at the weekend. But is he fanning the flames of division as Labor says? Get up to speed with our explainer: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is suing Coles and Woolworths over allegations they misled shoppers by offering \u201cillusory\u201d discounts on hundreds of products. It\u2019s a practice that helps them make huge profits in an already overheated economy. Guardian Australia columnist Greg Jericho tells Matilda Boseley why he thinks corporations, not consumers, should be made to pay for the cost-of-living crisis. Stronger consumer spending should not be an excuse for the Reserve Bank to potentially lift interest rates ahead of Christmas, retail bodies have warned. AAP reports that Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra said the Reserve Bank needs to offer a rate cut when it meets to discuss interest rates on 5 November. Whilst there is great resilience within retail, we know there are many businesses in the sector that are doing it tough, especially small businesses. This remains one of retail\u2019s most difficult years \u2013 with a continued slowdown in discretionary spend, high business costs along with ongoing challenges. Retail trade figures for August revealed a 0.7% increase for the month and 3.1% for the year, with warmer weather driving discretionary spending on outdoor items as well as dining out. The spike followed a sluggish 0.1% rise in July. The National Retail Association interim chief executive, Lindsay Carroll, said while August\u2019s figures were trending in the right direction, the retail sector was still struggling. The industry is at the mercy of consumer sentiment, that\u2019s just the nature of retail. Business owners need every win they can get in the lead-up to Christmas. We are asking our policymakers to give retailers some breathing room to recover during this year\u2019s holiday sale season. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be running through the top overnight stories before Emily Wind takes the reins. The organisers behind weekly pro-Palestine protests in Sydney have criticised NSW police for their decision to apply to the state\u2019s supreme court to prevent two rallies from going ahead this weekend. The Palestine Action Group has submitted the required paperwork for rallies on Sunday and Monday (a public holiday in NSW). But the police say they will seek to ban the marches to preserve public safety. The Albanese government made a last-minute rejection to proposed questions on sexuality and gender diversity in the upcoming 2026 census, sending bureaucrats into a weekend scramble, new documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information show. Late on Friday 23 August and into the next day officials at the Australian Bureau of Statistics agreed to cancel a scheduled media briefing on Monday 26 August and the rollout of its \u201clarge-scale\u201d test census to 50,000 households from Tuesday 27 August as a result of the 11th-hour decision. The retailers\u2019 peak body has pleaded today with the Reserve Bank not to raise rates before Christmas \u2013 and consider lowering them instead \u2013 despite stronger-than-expected consumer spending. We have more coming up on this, plus why supermarket superprofits could be fuelling inflation.",

And there are more ghosts for the affable 69-year-old actor to compete with: <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/stars-played-abraham-lincoln-henry-fonda-daniel-day-lewis/\">past portrayals of Lincoln</a> by everyone from Henry Fonda to Hal Holbrook to Daniel Day-Lewis.</p> <p>It represents a gear change for Bakula, best known for TV roles such as the time travelling Dr Samuel Beckett in Quantum Leap, Captain Jonathan Archer in Star Trek: Enterprise and Special Agent Dwayne Pride in NCIS: New Orleans. But he has always been \u201ca big Lincoln fan\u201d and felt the piquancy of playing Lincoln a month before a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/11/prosecutor-kamala-harris-put-trump-on-trial-but-the-court-of-public-opinion-can-be-fickle\">bitterly divided country goes to the polls</a>.</p> <p>He says: \u201cThe timing to do this kind of piece in front of the election made a lot of sense and was intriguing to me \u2013 to see if we could mount a show like this in the climate that we\u2019re in now. And get people to come see it for a fresh perspective on not only Lincoln but on history and history repeating itself and the many similarities that exist between the Lincoln times and the times today in our country.\u201d</p> <p>In a partisan nation where even Taylor Swift and Christmas have become politicised, Lincoln is one of the few figures who remain transcendent, admired and claimed by both major parties. Republicans point out he was one of their own; Democrats now see him embodying their values. When rehearsals began for Mister Lincoln, the director, <a href=\"https://fords.org/an-interview-with-fords-theatre-director-of-artistic-programming-jose-carrasquillo/\">Jos\u00e9 Carrasquillo</a>, noted that Lincoln was the only president named more than once at both the Republican and Democratic national conventions this summer.</p> <p>Bakula reflects: \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, his struggles as a president, what he was going through as a human being. There\u2019s so many similarities to what we\u2019re going through, not to the point of civil war but being in a divided country and being with voters who are split minded. He was faced with all of that and way more. Every day I learn more and more about him and every night in the show I learn more and more about him.\u201d</p>    <p>For Bakula there are particular parallels with Joe Biden, who spent more than half a century on the national political stage then, in July, made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/21/biden-decision-drop-analysis\">the selfless decision to step aside</a> for the sake of party and country. \u201cLincoln was a self-made man and came out of nowhere but he had strong convictions and he put country and the constitution before himself,\u201d he continues. \u201cI feel that Biden has done that his whole life.</p> <p>\u201cJoe has made a career out of working with other people on his team and without. Lincoln famously \u2013 crazily to me \u2013 filled his cabinet with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/28/abraham-lincoln-review\">people who were on the other side</a>, who had different opinions, who he ran against. He thrived on hearing the opinions of other people and getting both sides of the story and desperately trying to work with anybody that would come and meet him anywhere near halfway so he could keep things together as long as he could.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine taking over the presidency and you have one state who\u2019s already seceded day one. He wrestled with a lot of things and found a way to walk the tightrope for a long time, even during the war, keeping the union together. He worked and worked and selflessly and I feel that\u2019s Joe\u2019s thing. He never felt like he wanted to be famous but he wanted to do a good job for the people<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>An ardent theatregoer, Lincoln chose to celebrate the Union\u2019s victory in the civil war in April 1865 by attending the comedy Our American Cousin at Ford\u2019s Theatre. John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathiser, slipped into the president\u2019s box and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/apr/14/president-lincoln-assassination-1865\">shot Lincoln </a>with a Deringer pistol (now on display in a museum beneath the theatre). Booth fled into the night and Lincoln died the following morning.</p> <p>Bakula reflects: \u201cHad he lived who knows where we would be today in terms of the progress that we might have made coming out of the civil war. But by losing him and the chaos that ensued, we are where we are.\u201d</p> <p>Ford\u2019s went dark for more than a century, then reopened as a working theatre in 1968 with a detailed reconstruction of the presidential box (the original was removed a few months after Lincoln\u2019s death). The box is kept empty and is a brooding presence during performances. The theatre <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/theater/fords-theater-lincoln-murder-re-enactment.html\">has a longstanding position</a> of discouraging dramatic re-enactments of the assassination (its website <a href=\"https://fords.org/why-fords-theatre-doesnt-stage-assassination-reenactments/\">has a post headlined</a>, \u201cWhy Ford\u2019s Theatre Doesn\u2019t Stage Assassination Re-enactments\u201d).</p> <p>Mister Lincoln, written by Herbert Mitgang, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/01/15/an-honest-abe/601dde2f-4b9d-4a38-abe9-584d944a1dc2/\">was first performed at the theatre</a> by Roy Dotrice in 1980. The play explores Lincoln as both person and politician and includes recitations of the Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg Address \u2013 words so celebrated that, for an actor, it it like trying to compete with audience memories of \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzOddiP-w3U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jzOddiP-w3U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Bakula says: \u201cThey\u2019re magnificent words and they\u2019re so well crafted and there\u2019s so much terror that you\u2019re going to somehow mess them up. I joked with somebody the other day: look, Lincoln was a human being also, he wasn\u2019t a robot, so when he would he give speeches odds are he would make a mistake and not say exactly what he wanted to say.</p> <p>\u201cThese are things that he has written down and whether he said them exactly that way on the day, who knows? Those are the little lies that I tell myself so that I\u2019m not totally freaked out every time I\u2019m saying these iconic words<em>.\u201d</em></p> <p>But this is more than a theatrical version of <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/linc/index.htm\">the marble and granite Lincoln Memorial</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about his personal life, about his journey as a young man, about his relationship in various stages with Mary and his own relationship with depression and melancholia and his own state of mind and his relationships with his cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what people are expecting when they come into the theatre but it goes in a different direction and explores the human \u2013 darker side, almost \u2013 of who he was as a person and how he survived the pressures and the fears and the sadness and the loss and the weight of bringing up the militia to defend the Union against the Confederacy and the over a half million men who died during the war.</p> <p>\u201cIt weighed on him. He aged dramatically, as all of our leaders seem to do when they get into office. And then it ends tragically also.\u201d</p> <p>The son of a lawyer and schoolteacher, Bakula grew up in St Louis, Missouri. Once he was among those children sitting in a theatre audience spellbound what he was unfolding on stage.</p> <p>\u201cI can remember being in the theatre in my very young teens and being overwhelmed by the whole thing \u2013 in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up as a musical theatre kid. I sang, I had a band, I did all that kind of stuff. I loved to perform but I never thought of it as an option. I didn\u2019t dream that big when I was a kid but I knew that I loved it.\u201d</p> <p>In his 20s, however, Bakula decided to pursue his passion and move to New York. \u201cI\u2019m glad I made that decision. That\u2019s the things you do when you\u2019re young. I look back on it and think I could never do that now \u2013 just pack up and go someplace I\u2019d never been before and try and start a brand new career with not knowing a soul. But that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re a young person and thank goodness for the ignorance of youth.\u201d</p>    <p>He never intended to be a TV star but \u201cfell into it\u201d, he recalls. Bakula became known to millions of viewers of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096684/\">Quantum Leap</a> playing Sam Beckett, a physicist who, after creating a time travel experiment that goes awry, finds himself \u201cleaping\u201d into the bodies of different people through history and fixing their problems. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/13/quantum-leap-review-this-reboot-is-cheesier-than-a-brie-fondue\">A 2022 reboot</a>, starring Raymond Lee, was set 30 years after the original.</p> <p>Bakula says: <em>\u201c</em>It was a great experience for me and I love how deeply it affected people all over the planet. There\u2019s nowhere to go where people haven\u2019t seen Quantum Leap. Most people have fond memories of it and, because of the kind of show it was, so many people have memories of watching it with their family.</p> <p>\u201cThat to me is so touching because that\u2019s not really happening that much anymore: that idea of let\u2019s all sit down and watch Quantum Leap tonight or The Wonderful World of Disney or All in the Family or Cheers or anything more modern.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are watching their own things in their hands with their phones or laptops so you don\u2019t have that communal nature of, \u2018I loved watching Quantum Leap, my grandpa and I, we watched that every week.\u2019 I love those kind of stories when they could share that time together.\u201d</p> <p>Bakula went on to take the captain\u2019s chair in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244365/\">Star Trek: Enterprise</a>, a prequel series set a hundred years before Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. He recalls:<em> \u201c</em>It was a blast. It was a great privilege. The icing on the cake is to get to know [William] Shatner and Patrick [Stewart] and and Kate [Mulgrew] and everybody.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all really fun and different people. There\u2019s a burden in that sci-fi fans have a very high standard.

      "bodyText": "Scott Bakula has just finished a noon student matinee. The audience included fidgety fourth graders (aged nine or 10). \u201cThey can be very challenging and this piece I wouldn\u2019t say is necessarily kid friendly,\u201d he says by phone. \u201cBut they did pretty well.\u201d Then he reflects: \u201cYou always know that in the midst of that group of kids, regardless of how some are not great at behaving and sitting \u2013 and I don\u2019t blame them necessarily \u2013 a show strikes a chord in some children. That\u2019s all you need. That gets you through it. You know there are kids that are glued to it and you do the work for them.\u201d Bakula is starring in Mister Lincoln, a one-man show about the 16th US president, at Ford\u2019s Theatre \u2013 which, poignantly, is the venue in Washington DC where Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded after prevailing in the civil war in 1865. And there are more ghosts for the affable 69-year-old actor to compete with: past portrayals of Lincoln by everyone from Henry Fonda to Hal Holbrook to Daniel Day-Lewis. It represents a gear change for Bakula, best known for TV roles such as the time travelling Dr Samuel Beckett in Quantum Leap, Captain Jonathan Archer in Star Trek: Enterprise and Special Agent Dwayne Pride in NCIS: New Orleans. But he has always been \u201ca big Lincoln fan\u201d and felt the piquancy of playing Lincoln a month before a bitterly divided country goes to the polls. He says: \u201cThe timing to do this kind of piece in front of the election made a lot of sense and was intriguing to me \u2013 to see if we could mount a show like this in the climate that we\u2019re in now. And get people to come see it for a fresh perspective on not only Lincoln but on history and history repeating itself and the many similarities that exist between the Lincoln times and the times today in our country.\u201d In a partisan nation where even Taylor Swift and Christmas have become politicised, Lincoln is one of the few figures who remain transcendent, admired and claimed by both major parties. Republicans point out he was one of their own; Democrats now see him embodying their values. When rehearsals began for Mister Lincoln, the director, Jos\u00e9 Carrasquillo, noted that Lincoln was the only president named more than once at both the Republican and Democratic national conventions this summer. Bakula reflects: \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, his struggles as a president, what he was going through as a human being. There\u2019s so many similarities to what we\u2019re going through, not to the point of civil war but being in a divided country and being with voters who are split minded. He was faced with all of that and way more. Every day I learn more and more about him and every night in the show I learn more and more about him.\u201d For Bakula there are particular parallels with Joe Biden, who spent more than half a century on the national political stage then, in July, made the selfless decision to step aside for the sake of party and country. \u201cLincoln was a self-made man and came out of nowhere but he had strong convictions and he put country and the constitution before himself,\u201d he continues. \u201cI feel that Biden has done that his whole life. \u201cJoe has made a career out of working with other people on his team and without. Lincoln famously \u2013 crazily to me \u2013 filled his cabinet with people who were on the other side, who had different opinions, who he ran against. He thrived on hearing the opinions of other people and getting both sides of the story and desperately trying to work with anybody that would come and meet him anywhere near halfway so he could keep things together as long as he could. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine taking over the presidency and you have one state who\u2019s already seceded day one. He wrestled with a lot of things and found a way to walk the tightrope for a long time, even during the war, keeping the union together. He worked and worked and selflessly and I feel that\u2019s Joe\u2019s thing. He never felt like he wanted to be famous but he wanted to do a good job for the people.\u201d An ardent theatregoer, Lincoln chose to celebrate the Union\u2019s victory in the civil war in April 1865 by attending the comedy Our American Cousin at Ford\u2019s Theatre. John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathiser, slipped into the president\u2019s box and shot Lincoln with a Deringer pistol (now on display in a museum beneath the theatre). Booth fled into the night and Lincoln died the following morning. Bakula reflects: \u201cHad he lived who knows where we would be today in terms of the progress that we might have made coming out of the civil war. But by losing him and the chaos that ensued, we are where we are.\u201d Ford\u2019s went dark for more than a century, then reopened as a working theatre in 1968 with a detailed reconstruction of the presidential box (the original was removed a few months after Lincoln\u2019s death). The box is kept empty and is a brooding presence during performances. The theatre has a longstanding position of discouraging dramatic re-enactments of the assassination (its website has a post headlined, \u201cWhy Ford\u2019s Theatre Doesn\u2019t Stage Assassination Re-enactments\u201d). Mister Lincoln, written by Herbert Mitgang, was first performed at the theatre by Roy Dotrice in 1980. The play explores Lincoln as both person and politician and includes recitations of the Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg Address \u2013 words so celebrated that, for an actor, it it like trying to compete with audience memories of \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d. Bakula says: \u201cThey\u2019re magnificent words and they\u2019re so well crafted and there\u2019s so much terror that you\u2019re going to somehow mess them up. I joked with somebody the other day: look, Lincoln was a human being also, he wasn\u2019t a robot, so when he would he give speeches odds are he would make a mistake and not say exactly what he wanted to say. \u201cThese are things that he has written down and whether he said them exactly that way on the day, who knows? Those are the little lies that I tell myself so that I\u2019m not totally freaked out every time I\u2019m saying these iconic words.\u201d But this is more than a theatrical version of the marble and granite Lincoln Memorial. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about his personal life, about his journey as a young man, about his relationship in various stages with Mary and his own relationship with depression and melancholia and his own state of mind and his relationships with his cabinet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what people are expecting when they come into the theatre but it goes in a different direction and explores the human \u2013 darker side, almost \u2013 of who he was as a person and how he survived the pressures and the fears and the sadness and the loss and the weight of bringing up the militia to defend the Union against the Confederacy and the over a half million men who died during the war. \u201cIt weighed on him. He aged dramatically, as all of our leaders seem to do when they get into office. And then it ends tragically also.\u201d The son of a lawyer and schoolteacher, Bakula grew up in St Louis, Missouri. Once he was among those children sitting in a theatre audience spellbound what he was unfolding on stage. \u201cI can remember being in the theatre in my very young teens and being overwhelmed by the whole thing \u2013 in a good way,\u201d he says. \u201cI grew up as a musical theatre kid. I sang, I had a band, I did all that kind of stuff. I loved to perform but I never thought of it as an option. I didn\u2019t dream that big when I was a kid but I knew that I loved it.\u201d In his 20s, however, Bakula decided to pursue his passion and move to New York. \u201cI\u2019m glad I made that decision. That\u2019s the things you do when you\u2019re young. I look back on it and think I could never do that now \u2013 just pack up and go someplace I\u2019d never been before and try and start a brand new career with not knowing a soul. But that\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re a young person and thank goodness for the ignorance of youth.\u201d He never intended to be a TV star but \u201cfell into it\u201d, he recalls. Bakula became known to millions of viewers of Quantum Leap playing Sam Beckett, a physicist who, after creating a time travel experiment that goes awry, finds himself \u201cleaping\u201d into the bodies of different people through history and fixing their problems. A 2022 reboot, starring Raymond Lee, was set 30 years after the original. Bakula says: \u201cIt was a great experience for me and I love how deeply it affected people all over the planet. There\u2019s nowhere to go where people haven\u2019t seen Quantum Leap. Most people have fond memories of it and, because of the kind of show it was, so many people have memories of watching it with their family. \u201cThat to me is so touching because that\u2019s not really happening that much anymore: that idea of let\u2019s all sit down and watch Quantum Leap tonight or The Wonderful World of Disney or All in the Family or Cheers or anything more modern. \u201cPeople are watching their own things in their hands with their phones or laptops so you don\u2019t have that communal nature of, \u2018I loved watching Quantum Leap, my grandpa and I, we watched that every week.\u2019 I love those kind of stories when they could share that time together.\u201d Bakula went on to take the captain\u2019s chair in Star Trek: Enterprise, a prequel series set a hundred years before Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. He recalls: \u201cIt was a blast. It was a great privilege. The icing on the cake is to get to know [William] Shatner and Patrick [Stewart] and and Kate [Mulgrew] and everybody. \u201cThey\u2019re all really fun and different people. There\u2019s a burden in that sci-fi fans have a very high standard. If they don\u2019t like you then it\u2019s not good but, when they do embrace you, it\u2019s a lovely marriage.\u201d He admits: \u201cThere were a lot of challenges with it. We had a theme song that was different and some people hated that. I had a dog and some people hated that. People are very possessive about their their experiences within sci-fi and they like a certain captain or they like a certain Doctor Who. \u2018I don\u2019t like that Doctor Who, the next person I don\u2019t like, I\u2019m not gonna watch it,\u2019 whatever. You have to be willing to tough some of that stuff out but overall that was another great experience and continues to this day.\u201d But for all his TV work, Bakula has theatre running through his veins. This year he starred in The Connector, a new musical off Broadway, and Man of La Mancha in New Hampshire. With Mister Lincoln at Ford\u2019s to boot, he feels like he is coming home. \u201cI may not have been doing a lot of theatre,\u201d he muses, \u201cbut I started in the theatre and I\u2019m going to end in the theatre.\u201d Mister Lincoln is playing at Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington DC until 13 October",

In the past, Fangio has relied on showing identical shell coverages while shifting to zone coverage to confuse opposing quarterbacks. But this predictable playcalling allowed Mayfield to slice and dice Philadelphia in familiar swashbuckling style. Fangio has a tough task on his hands to revive the misfiring Eagles. Jacksonville Jaguars Trevor Lawrence has lost nine starts in succession and his nightmare shows no sign of ending. The former No 1 overall pick is struggling mightily as he continues to miss easy throws \u2013 failing to punch in a vital touchdown on the one-yard line in the Jags\u2019 loss to the Texans on Sunday will be a bitter disappointment for a QB in a deep rut. But the playcalling has been shoddy too. There needs to be a big shake-up in Jacksonville to avoid earning the worst record in the NFL this season. London fans will be thrilled they have to endure this dross when the team makes their trip across the Atlantic later this month.",

And he mishandled a question about why he had wrongly claimed to have visited China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, woodenly trying to dodge the issue by calling himself a \u201cknucklehead\u201d. But when push came to shove, Walz came through. On the subjects that matter most to Harris in her bid to become the first female president, and the first woman of color in the Oval Office, he hit Vance hard \u2013 civilly, but hard. On abortion he followed his running mate\u2019s lead and spoke movingly about the personal impact of Trump\u2019s effective evisceration of Roe v Wade. He invoked the story of Amber Thurman, who died as she traveled in search of reproductive care from Georgia to North Carolina. That even extracted one of the most surprising \u201cI agree\u201d remarks of the evening from the staunchly anti-abortion Vance: \u201cGovernor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive \u2026 and I certainly wish that she was.\u201d There was only one point in the evening when the kid gloves came off, and the cod display of gentility was discarded by both parties. It came when Vance had the audacity to claim \u2013 silkenly, naturally \u2013 that Harris\u2019s attempts to \u201ccensor\u201d misinformation in public discourse posed a far greater threat to democracy than Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election on January 6. \u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future,\u201d Vance deflected when Walz asked him directly whether Trump had lost that contest. \u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d the Democrat shot back, his face pained. In the last analysis, both men were only there playing the role of sidekick. They may have raised hopes that civility could make a comeback to US politics, but let Trump have the last word. \u201cWalz was a Low IQ Disaster - Very much like Kamala,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social site shortly after the debate had ended. And just like that, it was business as usual.",

The former Post Office chair Henry Staunton told the hearing that during his time in the role he formed a view that the state-owned body had a bureaucratic, unsympathetic and adversarial approach. \u201cWith respect to remediation, the government and Post Office were dragging their heels,\u201d he said. Bates said last week that financial redress schemes \u201ccan\u2019t be allowed to drag on for years again\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason it\u2019s just the bureaucracy driving them into the ground again. There are potential legal avenues we can take but it\u2019s going to then be another year, 18 months, for the group. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get these things resolved shortly, if we can\u2019t get an affirmation from them of a March 2025 deadline, then we may as well follow other routes.\u201d Last month, Bates said the Department for Business and Trade appeared to be trying to get away with paying out as little as possible to victims while maximising the income for the legal firms involved. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 post office operators were wrongly prosecuted after the faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing from branch accounts.",

      "bodyText": "British forces were involved in thwarting Iran\u2019s missile attack against Israel, the UK\u2019s defence secretary has suggested. In a carefully worded statement on Tuesday night, John Healey said: \u201cBritish forces have this evening played their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East.\u201d The statement did not go into military details on how British forces may have helped combat the barrage of 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran in an attack that caused limited damage. US defence officials confirmed that US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took down multiple missiles launched by Iran. And, following a similar attack by Iran on Israel in April, it was later confirmed that RAF Typhoons, from the Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus, had shot down Iranian drones. Healey is visiting Cyprus to meet troops who are preparing for the possibility of evacuating British citizens from Lebanon. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said on Tuesday night he was \u201cdeeply concerned that the region is on the brink\u201d, and again urged British nationals in Lebanon to leave amid escalating violence in the Middle East. In a televised statement from Downing Street, Starmer said Iran had \u201cmenaced the Middle East for far too long\u201d and called on the country to \u201cstop these attacks\u201d. \u201cWe stand with Israel and we recognise her right to self-defence in the face of this aggression,\u201d he said. \u201cIran must stop these attacks. Together with its proxies like Hezbollah, Iran has menaced the Middle East for far too long, chaos and destruction brought not just to Israel, but to the people they live amongst in Lebanon and beyond. \u201cMake no mistake, Britain stands full square against such violence. We support Israel\u2019s reasonable demand for the security of its people.\u201d Iran said it launched the strikes in retaliation for the killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut last week, the Associated Press reported. The escalation came after Israel began a ground offensive in Lebanon, carrying out what it described as \u201climited, localised\u201d operations. The Iranian attack on Israel began while Starmer was talking to Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday, Downing Street said earlier. In his statement on Tuesday evening, Starmer said he was \u201cdeeply concerned that the region is on the brink\u201d and \u201cdeeply concerned about the risk of miscalculation\u201d. He repeated the advice for Britons in Lebanon to leave and said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get people out, but the situation is extremely volatile.\u201d A chartered flight to get Britons out of the country is due to depart from Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport on Wednesday, at a cost of \u00a3350 a seat. Lebanon\u2019s Middle East Airlines, the only commercial operator still flying from Beirut, has a regular scheduled flight to the UK leaving on Wednesday. The attack on Israel by Iran has attracted condemnation from British political leaders.",

Three teams were fighting for survival \u2013 Sutjeska knew they would survive with a win, but they were playing the leaders Red Star Belgrade and were expected to lose. The other two, Prishtina and Celik, were playing each other in Prishtina, with Prishtina needing a win and Sutjeska to lose, and Celik needing a win and Sutjeska not to win.</p> <p>\u201cPrishtina, clearly the better team, raced into a 2-0 lead. However, the game kicked off around five minutes later than all the others, and, with minutes to go, news filtered through that Sutjeska had drawn against Red Star Belgrade, a result that secured the title for Red Star.</p> <p>\u201cAt that point Prishtina \u2013 who knew they were relegated \u2013 effectively stopped playing and allowed <strong>Celik</strong> to score three late goals and win 3-2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDgTFevhZG0\">The footage</a> suggests that they didn\u2019t try very hard to prevent those goals, which were scored in the 89th, 89th and 90th minute according to the text below the YouTube video (no VAR checks in those days!).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDgTFevhZG0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDgTFevhZG0?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cIt never became clear if this kind of finish was planned in advance in case Sutjeska drew or if Prishtina, urged by their own fans, did it out of spite, with Celik profiting through no fault of their own. In the aftermath, Prishtina and Celik were both deducted points for \u2018match-fixing\u2019, effective the following season, but, remarkably, the authorities decided that the result should stand.

So, to summarise: booked for a club he never played a senior game for, a season before making his first appearance for any club.\u201d</p>    <p>Lewis-Skelly\u2019s story had a different payoff: he came on later in the game and was asked \u201cWho the eff are you?\u201d by an increasingly vexed Erling Haaland after full time.</p> <p>Talking of blond, long-haired goalscorers, here\u2019s a related answer. \u201cSimilar but not exactly the same: Claudio Caniggia didn\u2019t play a single minute in World Cup 2002 but was sent off in the match against Sweden,\u201d writes Pablo Miguez. \u201cHad Argentina won the match and progressed further, he could have played his first game after serving the ban.\u201d</p> <p>Last and never, ever least, there\u2019s the legendary Brazilian Carlos Kaiser, who didn\u2019t kick a ball in professional football but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/26/the-forgotten-story-of-carlos-kaiser-footballs-greatest-conman\">still managed get himself sent off</a>.

The two permanent managers before Naismith, Robbie Neilson and Daniel Stendel, were also sacked after defeats to St Mirren. Is a team taking out three consecutive managers a record?\u201d</strong> wonders Tom Ball.</p> <p>The next time St Mirren host Hearts, they really should pipe the Jaws theme into the away dugout. If seeing off three Hearts managers in a row is a record, they\u2019ll have to share it with \u2013 fingers on buzzers \u2013 <strong>Curzon Ashton</strong>. \u201cThree consecutive York City managers were sacked following disappointing results against the Nash,\u201d writes Richard Gunn. \u201cMartin Gray in August 2018 after a 1-1 draw at home; Sam Collins swiftly followed in losing the return fixture 1-0 in January 2019; and Big Steve Watson following a 0-0 draw at the Tameside Stadium in November 2021. It became known as the Curse of Curzon Ashton.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Knowledge archive</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201cIn their 1988 FA Cup final besting of Liverpool, Wimbledon had the shirt sponsor Carlsberg despite having played the whole of the 1987-88 season with another Carlsberg Brewery brand, Truman, on their shirts,\u201d</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/27/knowledge-england-wembley-sponsors-religion\">wrote Martin Allen-Smith in 2009</a>. <strong>\u201cHave any other teams had their sponsors shamelessly take advantage of unexpected success in this way?\u201d</strong></p> <p>At least Truman were ousted by one of their own. In the 1987 Scottish Cup final between Dundee United and eventual winners St Mirren, the Buddies did a right number on the company who had supported them through thin and thin during the regular season.</p>    <p>\u201cSt Mirren played the full 1986-87 season sponsored by Graham\u2019s Buses,\u201d explains Dave Cherry. \u201cTheir deal ended after the final league game of the season, at which point rival bus company Clydeside Buses nipped in and got their logo on the front of the cup-winning shirt!\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, this sort of chicanery doesn\u2019t always occur. \u201cIn a neat reversal of the Wimbledon scenario, Cardiff City\u2019s then sponsor Comms Direct were offered \u00a3500,000 by an online bookies to have their name on the Bluebirds\u2019 shirts for the final instead,\u201d remembers Peter Newbitt. \u201cComms Direct stood firm and kept their name on the shirt for the last game of their sponsorship deal.

Has a team ever been two goals ahead so late in a top-flight game and still lost?\u201d asks Shaun Tooze. We had this question in 2022, when Borussia Dortmund blew a 2-0 lead after 88 minutes against Werder Bremen. The only answer we had that time was Inter 3-2 Sampdoria from 2004-05, when Samp led 2-0 after 87 minutes, but our readers have unearthed/remembered a couple of gems. First, a team who were 2-0 down going into injury time and still won: Royal Antwerp in the Uefa Cup in 1989-90. \u201cAfter a 0-0 draw against Vitosha Sofia in Bulgaria, Antwerp were 3-1 down at home after conceding in the 85th and 89th minutes,\u201d writes Dirk Maas. \u201cHowever, Nico Claesen (90+1 and 90+4) and Rapha\u00ebl Quaranta (90+6) made the miracle happen.\u201d What makes it even better is that, because of the away goals rule, a draw was a defeat for Antwerp so they needed all three goals. You can watch the highlights here. Boris Cule has a slightly murkier tale. \u201cThere was an infamous example of this in former Yugoslavia on the final day of the 1987-88 season. Three teams were fighting for survival \u2013 Sutjeska knew they would survive with a win, but they were playing the leaders Red Star Belgrade and were expected to lose. The other two, Prishtina and Celik, were playing each other in Prishtina, with Prishtina needing a win and Sutjeska to lose, and Celik needing a win and Sutjeska not to win. \u201cPrishtina, clearly the better team, raced into a 2-0 lead. However, the game kicked off around five minutes later than all the others, and, with minutes to go, news filtered through that Sutjeska had drawn against Red Star Belgrade, a result that secured the title for Red Star. \u201cAt that point Prishtina \u2013 who knew they were relegated \u2013 effectively stopped playing and allowed Celik to score three late goals and win 3-2. The footage suggests that they didn\u2019t try very hard to prevent those goals, which were scored in the 89th, 89th and 90th minute according to the text below the YouTube video (no VAR checks in those days!). \u201cIt never became clear if this kind of finish was planned in advance in case Sutjeska drew or if Prishtina, urged by their own fans, did it out of spite, with Celik profiting through no fault of their own. In the aftermath, Prishtina and Celik were both deducted points for \u2018match-fixing\u2019, effective the following season, but, remarkably, the authorities decided that the result should stand. So Celik survived and Sutjeska were relegated.\u201d Booked before first appearance \u201cArsenal\u2019s Myles Lewis-Skelly was booked against Manchester City before his first appearance for the club.

So, to summarise: booked for a club he never played a senior game for, a season before making his first appearance for any club.\u201d Lewis-Skelly\u2019s story had a different payoff: he came on later in the game and was asked \u201cWho the eff are you?\u201d by an increasingly vexed Erling Haaland after full time. Talking of blond, long-haired goalscorers, here\u2019s a related answer. \u201cSimilar but not exactly the same: Claudio Caniggia didn\u2019t play a single minute in World Cup 2002 but was sent off in the match against Sweden,\u201d writes Pablo Miguez. \u201cHad Argentina won the match and progressed further, he could have played his first game after serving the ban.\u201d Last and never, ever least, there\u2019s the legendary Brazilian Carlos Kaiser, who didn\u2019t kick a ball in professional football but still managed get himself sent off. Probably. St Mirren\u2019s run of getting Hearts managers sacked \u201cThe long-running comedy series that is Heart of Midlothian FC continued when they sacked Steven Naismith a week ago on Sunday following a 2-1 defeat by St Mirren. The two permanent managers before Naismith, Robbie Neilson and Daniel Stendel, were also sacked after defeats to St Mirren. Is a team taking out three consecutive managers a record?\u201d wonders Tom Ball. The next time St Mirren host Hearts, they really should pipe the Jaws theme into the away dugout. If seeing off three Hearts managers in a row is a record, they\u2019ll have to share it with \u2013 fingers on buzzers \u2013 Curzon Ashton. \u201cThree consecutive York City managers were sacked following disappointing results against the Nash,\u201d writes Richard Gunn. \u201cMartin Gray in August 2018 after a 1-1 draw at home; Sam Collins swiftly followed in losing the return fixture 1-0 in January 2019; and Big Steve Watson following a 0-0 draw at the Tameside Stadium in November 2021. It became known as the Curse of Curzon Ashton.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cIn their 1988 FA Cup final besting of Liverpool, Wimbledon had the shirt sponsor Carlsberg despite having played the whole of the 1987-88 season with another Carlsberg Brewery brand, Truman, on their shirts,\u201d wrote Martin Allen-Smith in 2009. \u201cHave any other teams had their sponsors shamelessly take advantage of unexpected success in this way?\u201d At least Truman were ousted by one of their own. In the 1987 Scottish Cup final between Dundee United and eventual winners St Mirren, the Buddies did a right number on the company who had supported them through thin and thin during the regular season. \u201cSt Mirren played the full 1986-87 season sponsored by Graham\u2019s Buses,\u201d explains Dave Cherry. \u201cTheir deal ended after the final league game of the season, at which point rival bus company Clydeside Buses nipped in and got their logo on the front of the cup-winning shirt!\u201d Thankfully, this sort of chicanery doesn\u2019t always occur. \u201cIn a neat reversal of the Wimbledon scenario, Cardiff City\u2019s then sponsor Comms Direct were offered \u00a3500,000 by an online bookies to have their name on the Bluebirds\u2019 shirts for the final instead,\u201d remembers Peter Newbitt. \u201cComms Direct stood firm and kept their name on the shirt for the last game of their sponsorship deal. They have now been replaced by Vans Direct.\u201d Can you help? \u201cTuv Azarganuud have lost their opening five games of the Mongolian Premier League season by an aggregate score of 67-0. Is this the worst start to a season in the history of football?\u201d asks Jack Hayward, possibly rhetorically. \u201cLike all Aberdeen fans, I\u2019m delighted with our start to the season under our new boss Jimmy Thelin: 11 games, 11 wins [now 12 games, 12 wins]. I know unbeaten runs are not uncommon under new managers, but is such a run of successive wins getting close to any sort of record?\u201d asks Craig Davidson. \u201cAfter six games of the Premier League season, five (!) teams are winless,\u201d notes Bob Zoellner. \u201cHas that happened before? And has any winless team (excluding the first couple of weeks) been higher in the league than Ipswich, who currently sit in 15th place?\u201d \u201cWith four or five games left in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top six are separated by only seven points, so it\u2019s possible any of them could win the title. What is the lowest position a team has been with, let\u2019s say, 10 games to go and come through to win their league?\u201d wonders John Brennan. Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU",

      "body": "<p>Dalglish, Francis, Robertson and Kennedy. Not a group of solicitors, but a list of players who scored winners in European Cup finals between 1978 and 1981. A time when English clubs ruled Europe. After Liverpool\u2019s 1977 triumph, four 1-0 wins continued England\u2019s continental dominance. Yet there was more to come.</p> <p>The name of Peter Withe would soon be added to this merry band of players. But there is a lot of ground to cover before we arrive at the right boot/shin of the England centre forward at the De Kuip, Rotterdam. Someone has kindly covered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2016/may/26/aston-villa-european-cup-relegated-1982\">the story of Aston Villa\u2019s 1982 European Cup glory</a> before. However, a recap may be useful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/17/how-aston-villa-won-the-1982-european-cup-bayern-munich-football\">Billy Connolly, blisters and Bayern: how Aston Villa won the 1982 European Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The smell of rotting fish in Iceland; the heroics of keeper Jimmy Rimmer and winger Tony Morley in Berlin; the small matter of title-winning manager Ron Saunders departing before the quarter-final against Dynamo Kyiv; a change of location from Kyiv to Simferopol; cockroaches in bread rolls; violence in Anderlecht that threatened Villa\u2019s participation in the final.</p> <p>Somehow Villa, under their new manager, Tony Barton, made it to the final played on Wednesday 26 May. Barton had previously assisted Saunders and, as chief scout at the club, had spotted half of the 14-man squad used during the title-winning season. His rise to permanent manager of Villa was another chapter in the chaotic story of that 1981/82 campaign.</p> <p>Awaiting Villa in the final were the mighty Bayern Munich, the last club outside of England to have lifted the trophy. Understandably seen as big favourites, the team contained players such as Paul Breitner, Klaus Augenthaler, and a two-time European Footballer of the Year in Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. And there would be another twist in the tale after just nine minutes of the final.</p>    <p>Rimmer, who unbeknown to most had entered the final with a concern over a neck injury, was forced off, resulting in only a second appearance for Nigel Spink. The 23-year-old would perform heroics in his first match since Boxing Day 1979, keeping out the best efforts Bayern threw at him. Such was his demeanour, Spink looked like a seasoned pro come the end of the evening.</p> <p>It would be a bona fide seasoned pro who would provide Villa with their winning moment. Yet just like the club he was playing for, Withe\u2019s path to that glorious moment was not smooth. Having helped Nottingham Forest win the First Division in 1977/78, Withe left before their European party had even started.</p> <p>Withe would later reveal the reason behind his departure. Trying to negotiate a pay increase with Brian Clough, both men dug their heels in, Withe stating that he left the club due to the fact his manager would not pay him an extra \u00a310 a week. Refused a move to another top-flight club, the centre forward was transferred to Second-Division Newcastle.</p> <p>Although he says he never regretted the move, Withe surely must have experienced mixed emotions as his former club won two European Cups. As his old strike partner Tony Woodcock formed a new relationship with Garry Birtles, Withe looked on from the outside as Newcastle languished midtable in the Second Division.</p> <p>Yet as the 1980/81 season approached, Saunders brought Withe to Villa for a then record fee of \u00a3500,000. The journey to redemption had started. His move proved to be the final piece in the jigsaw that Saunders required. Winning their first league title since the 1909/10 season, Villa pipped Ipswich, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVCbgLXB-qE&amp;t=64s\">as transistor radios clutched by many of the Villa faithful</a> inside Highbury spread the good news on the terraces.</p> <p>Withe\u2019s partnership with Gary Shaw was one of the key components of Villa\u2019s success. The little and large duo scored 38 league goals between them, instantly striking up an understanding. In <em>Odd Man Out</em>, Graham Fenton\u2019s fine book on Saunders\u2019 time at Villa, Fenton details the commentator Gerald Sinstadt stating that the pair \u201cwent together like bacon and eggs, and they sizzled\u201d.</p> <p>Shaw would win the PFA Young Player of the Year in 1981, and would also scoop the Bravo Award as the best under-23 player in European football the following year. A boyhood Villa fan, Shaw thrived for his club during the first few years of the decade. Only a terrible knee injury suffered at Nottingham Forest in September 1983 prevented him from realising his full potential.</p>    <p>Both Withe and Shaw would demonstrate the qualities they brought to Villa with the goal that would see them crowned champions of Europe. Collecting a pass from Dennis Mortimer, Withe shielded the ball before laying it back to Villa\u2019s skipper. Then a moment of pure skill from Shaw provided the spark.</p> <p>Taking the ball towards the left touchline, Shaw cut back inside, leaving Wolfgang Dremmler falling to the ground, before releasing a perfect first-time pass to Morley. The winger surged into the penalty area, jinked right then left as he twisted the blood of a bemused Hans Weiner, and then laid a chance on a plate for Villa\u2019s No 9.</p> <p>It should have been a formality. Less than six yards out, Withe had the opportunity to hand Villa a priceless lead. Yet the ball bobbled, and as the centre forward attempted to strike the ball with his right foot, his heart must have been in his mouth as the ball edged closer and closer to the post.</p> <p>\u201cI half hit it with my foot and half hit it with my shin,\u201d Withe later revealed, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJYoZ37SjDw\">as fortunately both the ball and the 30-year-old ended up in the back of the net</a>. Fittingly, Shaw was first to congratulate his strike partner, with Gordon Cowans then pulling the pair to the ground. Villa had something to hold on to for 23 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cThe big centre forward almost made a hash of it,\u201d Jeff Powell wrote in his Daily Mail match report. \u201cHis shot from barely a yard hitting the inside of a post before entering the net. But at moments like that, it doesn\u2019t matter how you score them, as long as they go in.\u201d Anyone associated with Villa would certainly agree with that.</p> <p>Withe\u2019s winning goal is remembered on a banner at Villa Park, quoting the commentary of Brian Moore. \u201cShaw, Williams, prepared to venture down the left. There\u2019s a good ball played in for Tony Morley. Oh, it must be! And it is!

      "bodyText": "Dalglish, Francis, Robertson and Kennedy. Not a group of solicitors, but a list of players who scored winners in European Cup finals between 1978 and 1981. A time when English clubs ruled Europe. After Liverpool\u2019s 1977 triumph, four 1-0 wins continued England\u2019s continental dominance. Yet there was more to come. The name of Peter Withe would soon be added to this merry band of players. But there is a lot of ground to cover before we arrive at the right boot/shin of the England centre forward at the De Kuip, Rotterdam. Someone has kindly covered the story of Aston Villa\u2019s 1982 European Cup glory before. However, a recap may be useful. The smell of rotting fish in Iceland; the heroics of keeper Jimmy Rimmer and winger Tony Morley in Berlin; the small matter of title-winning manager Ron Saunders departing before the quarter-final against Dynamo Kyiv; a change of location from Kyiv to Simferopol; cockroaches in bread rolls; violence in Anderlecht that threatened Villa\u2019s participation in the final. Somehow Villa, under their new manager, Tony Barton, made it to the final played on Wednesday 26 May. Barton had previously assisted Saunders and, as chief scout at the club, had spotted half of the 14-man squad used during the title-winning season. His rise to permanent manager of Villa was another chapter in the chaotic story of that 1981/82 campaign. Awaiting Villa in the final were the mighty Bayern Munich, the last club outside of England to have lifted the trophy. Understandably seen as big favourites, the team contained players such as Paul Breitner, Klaus Augenthaler, and a two-time European Footballer of the Year in Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. And there would be another twist in the tale after just nine minutes of the final. Rimmer, who unbeknown to most had entered the final with a concern over a neck injury, was forced off, resulting in only a second appearance for Nigel Spink. The 23-year-old would perform heroics in his first match since Boxing Day 1979, keeping out the best efforts Bayern threw at him. Such was his demeanour, Spink looked like a seasoned pro come the end of the evening. It would be a bona fide seasoned pro who would provide Villa with their winning moment. Yet just like the club he was playing for, Withe\u2019s path to that glorious moment was not smooth. Having helped Nottingham Forest win the First Division in 1977/78, Withe left before their European party had even started. Withe would later reveal the reason behind his departure. Trying to negotiate a pay increase with Brian Clough, both men dug their heels in, Withe stating that he left the club due to the fact his manager would not pay him an extra \u00a310 a week. Refused a move to another top-flight club, the centre forward was transferred to Second-Division Newcastle. Although he says he never regretted the move, Withe surely must have experienced mixed emotions as his former club won two European Cups. As his old strike partner Tony Woodcock formed a new relationship with Garry Birtles, Withe looked on from the outside as Newcastle languished midtable in the Second Division. Yet as the 1980/81 season approached, Saunders brought Withe to Villa for a then record fee of \u00a3500,000. The journey to redemption had started. His move proved to be the final piece in the jigsaw that Saunders required. Winning their first league title since the 1909/10 season, Villa pipped Ipswich, as transistor radios clutched by many of the Villa faithful inside Highbury spread the good news on the terraces. Withe\u2019s partnership with Gary Shaw was one of the key components of Villa\u2019s success. The little and large duo scored 38 league goals between them, instantly striking up an understanding. In Odd Man Out, Graham Fenton\u2019s fine book on Saunders\u2019 time at Villa, Fenton details the commentator Gerald Sinstadt stating that the pair \u201cwent together like bacon and eggs, and they sizzled\u201d. Shaw would win the PFA Young Player of the Year in 1981, and would also scoop the Bravo Award as the best under-23 player in European football the following year. A boyhood Villa fan, Shaw thrived for his club during the first few years of the decade. Only a terrible knee injury suffered at Nottingham Forest in September 1983 prevented him from realising his full potential. Both Withe and Shaw would demonstrate the qualities they brought to Villa with the goal that would see them crowned champions of Europe. Collecting a pass from Dennis Mortimer, Withe shielded the ball before laying it back to Villa\u2019s skipper. Then a moment of pure skill from Shaw provided the spark. Taking the ball towards the left touchline, Shaw cut back inside, leaving Wolfgang Dremmler falling to the ground, before releasing a perfect first-time pass to Morley. The winger surged into the penalty area, jinked right then left as he twisted the blood of a bemused Hans Weiner, and then laid a chance on a plate for Villa\u2019s No 9. It should have been a formality. Less than six yards out, Withe had the opportunity to hand Villa a priceless lead. Yet the ball bobbled, and as the centre forward attempted to strike the ball with his right foot, his heart must have been in his mouth as the ball edged closer and closer to the post. \u201cI half hit it with my foot and half hit it with my shin,\u201d Withe later revealed, as fortunately both the ball and the 30-year-old ended up in the back of the net. Fittingly, Shaw was first to congratulate his strike partner, with Gordon Cowans then pulling the pair to the ground. Villa had something to hold on to for 23 minutes. \u201cThe big centre forward almost made a hash of it,\u201d Jeff Powell wrote in his Daily Mail match report. \u201cHis shot from barely a yard hitting the inside of a post before entering the net. But at moments like that, it doesn\u2019t matter how you score them, as long as they go in.\u201d Anyone associated with Villa would certainly agree with that. Withe\u2019s winning goal is remembered on a banner at Villa Park, quoting the commentary of Brian Moore. \u201cShaw, Williams, prepared to venture down the left. There\u2019s a good ball played in for Tony Morley. Oh, it must be! And it is! Peter Withe!\u201d The sweetest goal in Villa\u2019s history, one that has come into focus even more in recent weeks. Villa\u2019s return to the competition \u2013 featuring a fixture against Bayern \u2013 coupled with the tragic news that Shaw had passed away, stirred the memories of the early 80s. A key figure in the history of the club, the adoration shown for Shaw highlighted the joy he brought to many. His part in Withe\u2019s golden goal is a permanent tribute to a man who lived the dream of representing the club he loved. \u2022 This is an article by That 1980s Sports Blog \u2022 Follow Steven Pye on X",

But what is the difference between a wonder and a sign \u2013 and which do we prefer? Such questions flow through Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd\u2019s Morning Star series of novels, an ongoing effort to open fiction up into a kind of vast Book of Revelation in which visions of red deer, landlocked crabs and devils stream across a rural Norway populated by Knausg\u00e5rd\u2019s familiar hotel bars and supermarkets.</p> <p>In the first volume, 2021\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/01/the-morning-star-by-karl-ove-knausgard-review-bloated-and-inconsequential\">The Morning Star</a>, a disparate group of Knausg\u00e5rdian characters \u2013 a jaded academic with a manic-depressive wife, a doubting vicar with a jealous husband \u2013 found their lives illuminated and sent off kilter by a new, preternaturally bright star in the sky. The vicar buried a man she\u2019d seen alive after his death; two characters shared a vision of a ghost. This was followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/05/the-wolves-of-eternity-by-karl-ove-knausgard-review-cosmic-mysteries\">The Wolves of Eternity</a>, a tighter story where a funeral director with an unexpected zest for life meets his half-sister, watched over by that same potentially diabolical star, amid a series of disquisitions on resurrection. Both novels had flashes of brilliance, but were unable to find a satisfying structure to blend the everyday with the supernatural and philosophical.</p> <p>The Third Realm is quite different, even though the characters come from the earlier novels. With breathtaking confidence, Knausg\u00e5rd mirrors The Morning Star, giving us other, richer perspectives on the material. The book opens and closes with Tove, the manic-depressive wife of the academic Arne. And her mix of despair and insight, humour and visionary brilliance turns out to be what these novels need most.</p> <p>\u201cHell isn\u2019t the psychosis. Hell is leaving the psychosis,\u201d she observes, awakening from the manic episode she entered in The Morning Star. Scenes from that book are then enacted from her perspective. The result is an exemplary masterclass in what fiction can offer: the expansion of readerly sympathies, bringing a sense that there are potentially endless perspectives available.</p> <p>Into this is thrown the possibility that there really are incarnated devils wandering the land. Indeed, three members of one of Norway\u2019s notorious black-metal bands are murdered in a lurid act that doesn\u2019t seem humanly possible. Throughout, devils communicate primarily with the already psychotic. There\u2019s a kind of RD Laingian suggestion that psychotics may be more capable of imaginative insight, but also a sense that we could all see like this if we looked differently. By the end, the exhausted policeman with a double life is found earnestly espousing a belief in devils to the vicar.</p> <p>And the point of it all? Not many readers will come away believing in devils, so what\u2019s gained isn\u2019t new theological insight but something else: a commitment to the possibilities of transcendence within realism. Arguably, this has been Knausg\u00e5rd\u2019s project all along, even as he was describing himself clearing up his dead alcoholic father\u2019s flat in his breakthrough autofictional series My Struggle. But now the transcendent more luridly floods<strong> </strong>the everyday.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Knausg\u00e5rd seems prepared to be a brilliant failure \u2013 that may be part of his genius</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a lot of music here, and in one of the mini-essays written by the characters, a neuroscientist called Jarle muses on whether music offers a revelation of the soul. This becomes more viscerally felt when Valdemar, the lead singer in another black-metal band, or cult, gathers his followers for a secret concert. The narrator here is Line, a strait-laced young woman he\u2019s in the process of seducing, who finds her body quivering in \u201ctransports of rapture\u201d as the audience comes together in collective ecstatic movement and tears. The signs of danger proliferate: it\u2019s Valdemar whose notion of a desired \u201cThird Realm\u201d provides the book\u2019s title; he says he\u2019s referencing a medieval third realm of the Holy Spirit, but the Norwegian title <em>Det tredje riket</em> explicitly echoes the Third Reich. Yet the transcendence here is convincingly redemptive, and the book suggests that we should look to these extreme states for reality, or perhaps just that we ignore the soul\u2019s more neglected corners at our peril.</p> <p>In interviews, Knausg\u00e5rd exhibits a heady mixture of grandiosity and humility, and the two come together here revealingly. The book, with its disquisitions on death and eternity, is extremely grandiose. But it\u2019s also pervaded by the feeling of failure that permeates My Struggle. Knausg\u00e5rd has said that he laboriously follows his characters on to buses and into supermarkets not because he wants to make the mundane interesting, but because he doesn\u2019t know how to fast forward the action. The prose here bears witness to this. Here\u2019s Jarle arriving to test the brain of a patient in a coma. \u201cThe taxi slid with a hum through the rain that was already gushing through the gutters, occasionally flooding at the roadsides. The area in front of the hospital was deserted but the car park was almost full.\u201d With his more desperately humdrum passages, Knausg\u00e5rd seems to suggest that his credentials for interrogating the nature of being and eternity are not that he knows everything but that he knows nothing. He\u2019s engaged in a kind of cosmic<strong> </strong>yet earthly experiment, as Jarle himself is. If he can record the ordinary lives of enough people faced with the extraordinary presence of the star, perhaps he will, as if inadvertently,<strong> </strong>reveal something about the nature of our limited present and its relationship to a more credulous and therefore possibly more enlightened past.</p> <p>The book read to me as the final part in a trilogy, but it turns out there are at least two more to come. Thinking it was a finale, I found it magisterial. There is both sufficient resolution, brought by the feeling of endlessly proliferating perspectives, and sufficient ambiguity. As a midpoint in a longer work, I find it less promising, though it makes sense that Knausg\u00e5rd wants to undercut any sense of resolution.<strong> </strong>The story is now at the point where it would be hard to write more without becoming more explicit about the&nbsp;presence of the demonic, which may take it too far&nbsp;into genre fiction and absurdity. But Knausg\u00e5rd seems prepared to be a brilliant failure \u2013 that may be part of his genius. And on he will go and on some of us will go with him, because even at his most flawed he has such an electrifyingly capacious sense of what the novel can be.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

Around 180 ballistic missiles were launched, just hours after the US warned that Iran was preparing an imminent attack.</p> \n<p>To bolster Israel\u2019s defence, US forces shot down Iranian missiles. President Joe Biden later said that the attack appears to have been \u201cdefeated and ineffective\u201d, and Israel said that most of the missiles were intercepted.</p> \n<p>Iranian officials, however, announced that 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets. The extent of the damage caused by the missiles remains unclear.</p> \n<p>The order to launch the strike was made by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with the backing of the SNSC and the Iranian defence ministry. Iran has said the attack was a \u201clegal, rational and legitimate response to the terrorist attacks of the Zionist regime\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"180d02ab-30ed-4848-81e9-376d2db29846\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p0B1_iSgrGo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This attack is far more aggressive than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/14/iran-missile-and-drone-attack-on-israel-what-we-know-so-far\">Iran\u2019s one in April</a>, which was largely considered a symbolic strike. Iran gave several days\u2019 notice then and the main target was a military base in the underpopulated Negev desert. This time, the missiles themselves seem to be much faster and the targets appear to have included dense cities.</p> \n<p>The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/stopping-iran-attack-would-have-forced-israel-to-use-sophisticated-and-expensive-defences\">Dan Sabbagh has</a> useful insight into Iran\u2019s military strategy now: \u201cFiring so many ballistic missiles in a few minutes also represents a serious effort to overwhelm or exhaust Israel\u2019s air defences. Because they are sophisticated, the interceptor missiles are expensive \u2013 and their stocks uncertain,\u201d he writes.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>Why did Iran do this?</strong></p> \n<p>In late September, Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, insisted that the country does not \u201cwish to be the cause of instability in the region.\u201d It seems the impending threat of war has lost its deterrent power, with the spokesperson of the parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy commission saying that Iran is \u201cnot afraid of going to war. We are not warmongers, but we are ready for any war.\u201d</p> \n<p>Iran\u2019s risky and unprecedented retaliation \u201creflects a growing consensus inside the Iranian elite that its decision not to mount a military reprisal after the assassination of [Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh] in Tehran in July was a strategic mistake\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/iran-calls-missile-attack-on-israel-legal-rational-and-legitimate\">Patrick Wintour writes</a>.</p> \n<p>The perceived inaction has led to a growing frustration among some hardliners in Iran that Tehran has become \u201cpassive\u201d in the face of Israeli aggression. Instead of placating Israel, they say, it has emboldened Netanyahu to mount further attacks and has weakened its image as the leader of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d.</p> \n<p>Iran held off from ordering a reprisal for the assassination of Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July, because of US assurances that a ceasefire deal in Gaza was imminent and restraint from Iran would be key in making sure it happens.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Iran launched a wave of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening in retaliation for a series of attacks against its proxies. Officials in Tehran cited the assassinations of top Hezbollah and Hamas commanders \u2013 including Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed on Friday \u2013 and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It is Iran\u2019s second attack on Israel this year, although this one is widely considered to have been more aggressive and is likely to be more consequential. Guardian reporters in Jerusalem witnessed dozens of missiles darting through the sky towards the country\u2019s coastal cities. Most of the missiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defences, supported by western allies, but there have been multiple images of craters in central and southern Israel. Two people have reportedly been wounded in Tel Aviv. Elsewhere, the only reported fatality was Sameh al-Asali, a 37-year-old Palestinian from Gaza living in the occupied West Bank, who was killed by falling shrapnel. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Iran has \u201cmade a big mistake tonight, and will pay for it\u201d, although US officials have said that Israel has not made a decision yet on the scope or timeframe of this reprisal. Meanwhile, overnight, the Israeli military continued to pound Lebanon\u2019s capital, Beirut, with at least five strikes hitting the city\u2019s southern suburbs. Today\u2019s newsletter takes you through the last 24 hours in the Middle East, as the crisis intensifies. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories US election | JD Vance refused to say whether Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and sidestepped questions over whether he would certify a Trump loss this autumn, bringing out sharp attacks by his Democratic opponent, Tim Walz, during the vice-presidential debate last night. Surveillance | UK government ministers have been warned not to resurrect Conservative plans to tackle welfare fraud by launching mass algorithmic surveillance of bank accounts. Rights and privacy groups fear the government is poised to deliver a \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d using automation and possibly AI to crack down on benefit cheating and mistakes that cost \u00a310bn a year. UK news | A 14-year-old girl was left with potentially life-changing injuries while a 16-year-old boy was in hospital after a substance \u2013 believed to be acidic \u2013 was thrown at them by a male who approached them on the street outside their London school, police have said. Lucy Letby | A senior doctor said he was \u201cashamed\u201d he failed to stop the nurse Lucy Letby from harming babies and that police should have been contacted a year earlier. John Gibbs told a public inquiry that doctors received \u201cvery firm pushback\u201d from senior nurses when they raised growing suspicions about Letby in early 2016. Space | A comet that has not been seen from Earth since Neanderthals were alive has reappeared in the sky, with astronomers saying it might be visible to the naked eye. In depth: Israel readies for reprisal as \u2018forces of restraint\u2019 weaken Iran\u2019s surprise attack lasted for just under an hour and came after its supreme national security council (SNSC) chair, Ali Akbar Ahmadian, declared that Iran was at war. Around 180 ballistic missiles were launched, just hours after the US warned that Iran was preparing an imminent attack. To bolster Israel\u2019s defence, US forces shot down Iranian missiles. President Joe Biden later said that the attack appears to have been \u201cdefeated and ineffective\u201d, and Israel said that most of the missiles were intercepted. Iranian officials, however, announced that 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets. The extent of the damage caused by the missiles remains unclear. The order to launch the strike was made by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with the backing of the SNSC and the Iranian defence ministry. Iran has said the attack was a \u201clegal, rational and legitimate response to the terrorist attacks of the Zionist regime\u201d. This attack is far more aggressive than Iran\u2019s one in April, which was largely considered a symbolic strike. Iran gave several days\u2019 notice then and the main target was a military base in the underpopulated Negev desert. This time, the missiles themselves seem to be much faster and the targets appear to have included dense cities. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh has useful insight into Iran\u2019s military strategy now: \u201cFiring so many ballistic missiles in a few minutes also represents a serious effort to overwhelm or exhaust Israel\u2019s air defences. Because they are sophisticated, the interceptor missiles are expensive \u2013 and their stocks uncertain,\u201d he writes. *** Why did Iran do this? In late September, Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, insisted that the country does not \u201cwish to be the cause of instability in the region.\u201d It seems the impending threat of war has lost its deterrent power, with the spokesperson of the parliament\u2019s national security and foreign policy commission saying that Iran is \u201cnot afraid of going to war. We are not warmongers, but we are ready for any war.\u201d Iran\u2019s risky and unprecedented retaliation \u201creflects a growing consensus inside the Iranian elite that its decision not to mount a military reprisal after the assassination of [Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh] in Tehran in July was a strategic mistake\u201d, Patrick Wintour writes. The perceived inaction has led to a growing frustration among some hardliners in Iran that Tehran has become \u201cpassive\u201d in the face of Israeli aggression. Instead of placating Israel, they say, it has emboldened Netanyahu to mount further attacks and has weakened its image as the leader of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Iran held off from ordering a reprisal for the assassination of Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July, because of US assurances that a ceasefire deal in Gaza was imminent and restraint from Iran would be key in making sure it happens. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh\u2019s death). No such deal materialised. Early last month, Pezeshkian accused the US of lying, adding that Israel\u2019s actions would not go \u201cunanswered\u201d. Iranian officials were also alarmed by Netanyahu\u2019s announcement last weekend that Israel\u2019s latest actions are steps towards changing \u201cthe balance of power in the region for years to come\u201d. To show restraint after the series of escalations would, they believed, put them in an even weaker strategic position. *** What\u2019s next? Leaders across Europe condemned Iran\u2019s attack and the UK prime minister Keir Starmer said that Britain stands with Israel and recognises \u201cher right to self-defence in the face of this aggression\u201d. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, condemned \u201cescalation after escalation\u201d in the region. \u201cThis must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire,\u201d he said. Israel has already launched attacks in Yemen, Lebanon and Syria this week, indicating its willingness to keep fighting on all fronts. Analysts have noted that Israel has a much freer hand to respond more comprehensively and aggressively. What little \u201cforces of restraint\u201d there were in the Middle East are \u201cweakening with every passing day,\u201d Julian Borger writes in his analysis. \u201cPolitically speaking, the Biden administration cannot be seen as tying Israel\u2019s hands in the face of an Iranian attack on Israeli cities.\u201d The looming fear of this deepening conflict has been a direct confrontation between Tehran and Washington, which gets closer with each attack. As Israel readies for a reprisal and Iran\u2019s leadership vows that any retaliation would be met with a \u201cmore crushing and ruinous\u201d response, the cries for peace continue to go unheeded.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s senior aides saw JD Vance as having a slick debate performance over Tim Walz, according to people close to Trump, that made his campaign appear palatable despite the former president\u2019s increasingly caustic threats such as vowing to prosecute his perceived enemies. The campaign aides also believed that Vance reset the narrative over his image and likely came across in a more favorable light to undecided voters after a brutal few months of being hammered for making disparaging remarks about women as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. Vance\u2019s favorability issue was perhaps the principal priority for Trump\u2019s senior aides because they saw it as potentially fixable and if so, beneficial to the Trump campaign with fewer than five weeks until election day in what has become a vanishingly close race against Kamala Harris. Afterwards, Trump predictably claimed Vance won the debate, but a CBS News poll confirmed how vice-presidential debates matter increasingly less in close elections compared to ground game efforts to drive turnout. In the post-debate poll, 42% of respondents said Vance won the debate, 41% gave the win to Walz, while 17% said it was tied \u2013 suggesting the main takeaway remains that it is unlikely to play any material role in which campaign wins each of the seven battleground states in November. Broadly, Trump\u2019s aides were relieved that Vance came across as more polished than Walz in his answers and that Vance, for the most part, was able to deliver attack lines without interruption or immediate factchecking from Walz of the CBS News moderators Norah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan. They were also relieved that Vance got away with whitewashing Trump\u2019s record on trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election that culminated in the January 6 Capitol attack and resulted in criminal prosecution. Vance falsely claimed Trump did not want to destroy Obamacare but wanted a bipartisan solution to affordable health care, when in actuality Trump was thwarted in the Senate by Senator John McCain. Regarding the Capitol attack, Trump never called the National Guard and resisted calling off the rioters until it was already over. Trump\u2019s vice-presidential nominee got called out on uncomfortable territory \u2013 namely abortion and gun violence, to the second of which Vance at one point said his policy solution to prevent mass school shootings was to have stronger doors and windows. But Trump\u2019s aides suggested after the debate that Walz had enough of his own flubs that they could use to distract from Vance\u2019s shaky answers. In particular, the Trump aides noted that Walz misspoke on gun violence when he said he had become friends with some of the school shooters \u2013 he clearly meant to say shooting victims \u2013 and then struggled to explain why he falsely claimed he had visited Hong Kong at the time of the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square. \u201cTonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate.

      "body": "<p>Ports, rivers, canals, railways, pilgrims\u2019 pathways: these oft-overlooked, deeply engaging towns grew around transport and, as they expanded, created local networks. We usually think of leisure travel in terms of long-distance trains, cars on open roads, coaches from A to B and country walks. But suburban bus trips, urban hikes and commuter trains offer rich possibilities.</p> <h2><strong>Wolverhampton, West Midlands</strong></h2> <p>Approaching from the north by rail, it\u2019s where the green turns grey, though not unrelentingly. A canal, a railway, riotous quantities of buddleia, garish splashes of graffiti. The first big-brand box to come into view is Tesla, which looks like the cars \u2013 hermetically sealed, plasticky, futuristic but without flair. Beside it is a mountain of scrap metal: the end of all car journeys. Two centres of learning are next up. One is the Thomas Telford university technical college \u2013 named, aptly, for the colossus of roads. A slick looking building closer to the line is the <a href=\"https://www.wlv.ac.uk/business-services/national-brownfield-institute/\">National Brownfield Institute</a>. This, too, is right at home; all it surveys is potentiality and prospects of a good return.</p> <p>A serious built-up area will produce different emotions in different people at different times. I live in a farmhouse; I\u2019ve not been out for two weeks. I can feel my shins twitching. Edgelands can be exhilarating.</p> <p>Wolverhampton became a city in 2000. It feels and looks as if it\u2019s been one for 150 years. It has grand civic buildings, a serious railway station, a flash multi-platformed bus station. My first stop is the <a href=\"https://pubheritage.camra.org.uk/pubs/10111\">Posada</a>, a proper city pub. I\u2019ve been told the Black Country still drinks mild but the man behind the bar tells me he bought a keg for some Camra chaps, but they had two halves and never came back, and he was left with a drink no one wanted. Perhaps I\u2019m not in the real Black Country yet?</p>    <p>Across the road is the <a href=\"https://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/\">city-sized art gallery</a>. Without prompting from me, a staff member takes me back to the entrance and tells me to make sure I see that building and that obelisk, adding that TE Lawrence drank at the Posada and Jim Lea of Slade is a regular visitor to the gallery. Lawrence of Arabia? \u201cYes, apparently he worked in engineering,\u201d she says. I look him up. Apparently, TE was overseeing the assembly of a new batch of RAF boat engines at Henry Meadows Ltd. He called Wolverhampton \u201csqualid\u201d and a \u201ccesspit\u201d \u2013 his lodgings were allegedly bug-infested \u2013 adding that it had \u201cthe worse mannered local press of my experience!\u201d</p> <p>The gallery has <a href=\"https://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/wolvesart-pop-art/\">the UK\u2019s largest pop art collection outside London</a>. Curator David Rodgers began collecting in the late 1960s when the style was new and controversial \u2013 and pieces affordable. Parts of the media thought he was squandering public money. But he was a visionary. I spent an hour all by myself with world-class works including a 1964 Warhol oil, Jacqueline, and one of his Campbell\u2019s Soup screenprints, Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s Purist Painting With Bottles (1975) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/nov/26/pauline-boty-swinging-60s-london-art-scene-solo-show\">Pauline Boty</a>\u2019s tender portrait of Marilyn Monroe, Colour Her Gone (1962). Captions by local LGBTQ+ opinion-formers added a queer slant. Patrick Caulfield\u2019s 1971 painting Tandoori Restaurant \u2013 in shades of turmeric and saffron flower \u2013 truly belongs here in the West Midlands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Wolverhampton art gallery has the UK\u2019s largest pop art collection outside London. I spent an hour all by myself with world-class works</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wolverhampton\u2019s motto is \u201cOut of darkness cometh light\u201d. The Black Country was once \u201cthe workshop of the world\u201d. Areas had specialisms, as did genders in some cases. There were female chainmakers in Cradley Heath. Children could start making nails from the age of seven. Wolverhampton was known for its locks, keys, horseshoes, as well as grease, beer and kitchen furniture. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanning\">Japanning</a> was a huge trade. A cabinet on the first floor is filled with exquisite brooches, belt buckles, rosaries, buttons and pendants made in Bilston, formerly a powerhouse of \u201cdecorative enamel production\u201d. It was also home to houseware brand Beldray. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edisaacsartist/?hl=en-gb\">Ed Isaacs</a>, a retired Wolverhampton council housing officer, has reinvented himself as an urban sketcher. His drawings capture the contemporary sprawl-scape: Lidl stores, Greggs branches, parked cars, landfill sites, street furniture, tubing and piping and the unexplained bits of industry that jut out from weeds and behind railings. He calls it \u201cobsessive markmaking\u201d. There is an evolving tradition of West Midlands new impressionism; the works of Ed Isaacs, Tom Hicks, David Rayson and George Shaw make you want to walk to see the actual places, just as Monet-worshippers go to Rouen or Van Goghers go vagabond in Arles. Again pop art comes to mind; the horribly familiar, seen afresh.<br><em>Things to see and do: Walk the <a href=\"https://www.wolverhampton.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/City_Trail_Booklet_2013_sp.pdf\">city trail</a> and <a href=\"https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/media/library/1875.pdf\">locks walk</a> along local canals, <a href=\"http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/listed/chubb.htm\">Chubb building</a>, Molineux Stadium <a href=\"https://events.wolves.co.uk/molineux-stadium-tours/\">tour</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Harwich, Essex</strong></h2>    <p>Mockba. Hoek. Warszawa. Berlin. Minsk. My one memory of Harwich relates to the boat train from Liverpool Street station in the mid-80s. Parkeston Quay didn\u2019t sound like a song from Bowie\u2019s Low album, but it was a portal to them. I arrived on the Hook-Harwich ferry after visits to Poland and Czechoslovakia but never used it to escape London to go east. But how I wanted to. I was obsessed with the writers Ha\u0161ek, Kundera, Kafka, Mi\u0142osz \u2013 and the cold war frontier. I was at university in London and, passing through Liverpool Street in the early evening on my way home, I would glance enviously at the destinations before grumbling my way down to the tube.</p> <p>In the lounge at the <a href=\"https://www.milsomhotels.com/the-pier/\">Pier hotel</a> are vintage posters proclaiming \u201cHarwich for the continent\u201d and advertisements for holidays in Zeebrugge and Antwerp. In the era before car ferries and cheap flights, there were boats to Esbjerg, Gothenburg, Hamburg, Helsingborg, Hirtshals and Oslo. A century ago, ferries transported entire trains to Europe in true roll-on, roll-off fashion. Between 1924 and 1987, trains from the Hook linked it to Munich, Stockholm and, briefly, the <a href=\"https://retours.eu/en/32-Hoek-van-Holland-Harwich-Continent/#8\">Orient Express</a> routes.</p> <p>A heritage trail takes an hour but dazzles with epoch-making storylines and notable names; the Harwich Society offers <a href=\"https://www.harwich-society.co.uk/guided-tours/\">free guided tours</a> to individuals every Saturday between May and September. Sue Daish, the town council\u2019s first female high steward and a trustee of the society, opens doors for me. We visit the High Lighthouse, Low Lighthouse (which houses a Maritime Museum), Treadwheel Crane and circular Redoubt Fort \u2013 built on a tump south of the centre in 1808 to repel Napoleon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not sure I have ever seen such a density of period architecture in so small an area</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We linger upstairs in the jettied house of Mayflower captain Christopher Jones, and in a room in the town\u2019s Guildhall once used to hold prisoners awaiting trial, daubed with elaborate carvings of ships, gallows and symbols to ward off evil spirits, dating from the late 18th century. One shows a ship flying the stars and stripes around the time of the American war of independence \u2013 possibly the earliest depiction of the US flag. I nostalgise at the Electric Palace cinema, built in 1911 and the oldest unaltered purpose-built cinema in Britain.</p> <p>Harwich\u2019s pubs are among the finest in England. Some 94 pubs have been named at 48 different sites. Our ancestors were sociable creatures, thirsty workers; home was not the high-walled castle it has become. Only about 10 remain and are lovely and look ancient but well used.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure I have ever seen such a density of period architecture in so small an area. Heritage in cities exists in pockets, providing diversions from now. In the countryside, it might be a stately home or ruined abbey, with ice lollies and cream tea. Harwich Town, though, is haunted by its old, alluringly allusive places. Do they hold it back, or anchor it?</p> <p>After dark, I stand and watch the ships load and unload at Felixstowe, and am thrilled when a horn sounds and one pushes away for Shanghai, Santos, Panama, Singapore, Hoek.<br><em>Things to see and do: <a href=\"https://www.harwichmuseum.com/\">Harwich Museum</a>, seal watching at <a href=\"https://sealwatching.co.uk/\">Hamford Water nature reserve</a>, <a href=\"https://www.harwich-society.co.uk/harwich-maritime-trail-map/\">Maritime walking trail</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Gateshead, Tyne and Wear</strong></h2>    <p>A circular bus route \u2013 uniquely relaxing \u2013 is a great way to recce a new town. The 51 and 52 (one route, two directions) is known as the <a href=\"https://www.gonortheast.co.uk/services/GNE/51\">East Gateshead Orbital</a>. In just over an hour, I will be able to say I have been to all the places I can see on my map. There\u2019s Felling and Deckham, Wrekenton, Low Fell, High Fell, Sheriff Hill, Leam Lane, and Windy Nook. There will be those who never made it to Sheriff Hill, for one reason or another. I can tell them about it.</p> <p>On the top deck at the front, I get a rolling tour of social stratification and architectural styles \u2013 terraced rows, Tyneside flats (houses with two front doors, one for each flat), redbrick semis, older stone houses, prefabs. Front gardens are like family confessions, curiously moving seen from above. It\u2019s been a welcome hot day in a non-starter summer, and the early evening is sultry. Neighbours lean on fences talking. Two children splash as much as possible in a paddling pool. A man prunes his privets. Someone sucks on a hookah on a driveway filled with family members. We stop a lot. Teens split from groups and get on the bus to go home. Only I ride all the way, the safely lost tourist, scanning the houses, looking for what \u2013 clues?</p> <p>This is estate-land, laid out where slums were cleared. From the bus it\u2019s confusingly, endearingly human. But look at a map and Gateshead contains the evolutionary history of street patterns, from the straight rows north of Saltwell Park to labyrinths of crescents and cul-de-sacs obeying the rubric of the garden suburb (with street names like Gorsehill, Harebell Road and Celandine Way) to council estate Lego-land \u2013 full of right angles and hard edges, rigged with zigzags, doglegs and quasi-communal areas.</p>    <p>JB Priestley, passing through, asked: \u201cHow is it that a town can contain one hundred and twenty-five thousand persons and yet look like a sprawling, swollen industrial village?\u201d Being a Yorkshireman, he didn\u2019t wait for a reply. \u201cThe answer is that this is a dormitory for the working class.\u201d The most quoted lines in the Gateshead section of his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-30152684\">English Journey</a> are \u201cthe whole town appeared to have been carefully planned by an enemy of the human race\u201d.</p> <p>Commentators say Priestley was in a foul mood due to too much travelling, a nasty cold and medicines that left him feeling rough. But slagging off has long been the prerogative of the metropolitan travel writer \u2013 and insults stick.</p> <p>Gateshead faces Newcastle across the Tyne, shares the bracing bridges, musical accent, fierce local identity. On the posts of the High Level Bridge are terse graffiti, sentences in a flicker book. One says \u201cNorth East or Nowhere\u201d. Newcastle looks civic and cluttered with churches and offices and a castle and the huge stadium on its summit. Gateshead is residential, suburban, a town with a centre like everyone else\u2019s: the big Tesco, the bookies, boozers, transport interchange.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Gateshead has challenges, but grassroots arts projects are the way to ensure its revival has longevity. Gateshead can be like Brooklyn</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Stone, Vane Gallery</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Roads and rail dominate, budging things out of their way: trains into and out of Newcastle use different lines. Fast, four-lane A-roads, including the A167 \u2013 laid out over the medieval Great North Road and still named \u201cHigh Street\u201d \u2013 have left gaping canyons flooded with toxins. But off the highways and under the ironwork there\u2019s hope.</p> <p>A new wine bar, a lovely old wedge-shaped pub, a horror-themed cafe. From <a href=\"https://www.vane.org.uk/\">Vane Gallery</a>, housed in a long-dead pub called the Dun Cow on said High Street, art trickles up to grant-hogging showcase museums such as the Baltic. The ground floor has been hung for the town\u2019s first Pride. \u201cGateshead is a place of potential,\u201d says director Paul Stone, who co-founded Vane and its umbrella non-profit community organisation <a href=\"https://www.orbiscommunity.com/\">Orbis</a> in 1997. \u201cI\u2019ve been through several cycles of funding and regeneration. I\u2019m feeling optimistic. For the first time ever, we\u2019re being listened to. Gateshead has challenges, but grassroots arts projects are the way to ensure its revival has longevity. Gateshead can be like Brooklyn.\u201d But art is a strange world; \u201cProbably more people know us outside Gateshead than in Gateshead,\u201d he says.<br><em>Things to see and do: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/prismcoffeeuk/?hl=en\">Prism Coffee</a>; walk the <a href=\"https://www.tynederwentway.co.uk/article/27358/Explore-the-way\">Tyne Derwent Way</a>; <a href=\"https://www.dunstonstaiths.org.uk/\">Dunston Staiths</a>, <a href=\"https://baltic.art/\">Glasshouse International Centre for Music (ex-Sage); Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art</a>, Angel of the North</em></p> <h2><strong>Armagh, County Armagh</strong></h2>    <p>Widow\u2019s friend apples lie forgotten in flowerbeds outside a smart redbrick house at the top of Abbey Street. Bramleys are piled high outside a door for passersby to collect. Apple trees soften the aspects of the towering Roman Catholic cathedral and the capacious City hotel. I missed Armagh\u2019s food festival by one day but I haven\u2019t missed the harvest. I had no idea this was the centre of \u201corchard county\u201d. Then again, I didn\u2019t know the city is the mother-metropolis of Irish Catholicism and the Church of Ireland \u2013 Canterbury, Westminster and Liverpool all at once. Or that it\u2019s a Celtic mythology vortex.

But Armagh does give up hints and secrets that point to the causes of its modern history. The underpinning Celtic sources are there in the name. Armagh alludes to the Ard Mhacha or the high place of the goddess Macha; outside town is a place known as Emain Macha \u2013 and by the anglicised name <a href=\"https://visitarmagh.com/places-to-explore/navan-centre-fort/\">Navan Fort</a>, though it was a ceremonial site rather than a fortress.</p> <p>Celtic energies drew St Patrick in the fifth century. His founded a monastery that became a scholastic powerhouse. The <a href=\"https://armaghrobinsonlibrary.co.uk/collections/exhibitions-past-present/the-book-of-armagh/\">Book of Armagh</a>, less famous than Kells, is a priceless illuminated manuscript. It\u2019s kept at Trinity College in Dublin. But Armagh remains the capital of the two churches. The Church of Ireland cathedral is thought to stand on a site chosen by Patrick. It\u2019s been burned to the ground \u2013 by Vikings and lightning strikes \u2013 and rebuilt as many as 17 times over the long years, and is largely a 19th-century decorated gothic structure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Armagh cathedral is russet-coloured.

Its nave is crooked, echoing Christ\u2019s bowed head on the cross. The stained glass is beautiful. There\u2019s a stone figure called the Tandragee Idol from the iron age and a weather-worn Celtic cross that once stood outside. I\u2019m most drawn to the list of abbots, bishops and archbishops, which runs continuously from 444 (Patrick) to today. The names start off as Old Irish (Ailill, Carlaen, Nuadha), turn Norse (de Jorse, Fitzralph), become principally English (Kite, Lancaster) with the Reformation and plantation of Ulster, visit Rome (Spinelli de Palatio) dip some toes in Scotland (Stuart, Gregg, Armstrong) and then revert to Irish-born clerics, mainly (McCann, McDowell).

Before the Norman invasion, a chapel of ease was established in a clearing in the woods on the edge of Windsor Forest. The clearing became the town\u2019s oldest street, Le Rothe Strete \u2013 today\u2019s Rose Street. It was given a charter by Elizabeth I, became known for its bell foundry, brickmaking and the manufacture of silk stockings. Nine Mile Ride, connecting Bracknell to Finchampstead, was built around 1702 so that Queen Anne could observe the hunt from her carriage. Running parallel to a Roman road, it was expanded by George III, who loved to ride with hounds in the royal forest. Today, Nine Mile Ride is the B3430, just 6.7 miles long, and throbbing with traffic, but there are patches of woodland along its length. The smartest houses are on unmetalled streets. Thrushes and blackbirds contend with the snarl of SUVs and the whirr of EVs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Wokingham routinely tops admittedly unscientific surveys of happiest places to live, wealthiest streets rankings, best town in Berkshire</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The road to becoming a commuter town was indirect.

      "bodyText": "Ports, rivers, canals, railways, pilgrims\u2019 pathways: these oft-overlooked, deeply engaging towns grew around transport and, as they expanded, created local networks. We usually think of leisure travel in terms of long-distance trains, cars on open roads, coaches from A to B and country walks. But suburban bus trips, urban hikes and commuter trains offer rich possibilities. Wolverhampton, West Midlands Approaching from the north by rail, it\u2019s where the green turns grey, though not unrelentingly. A canal, a railway, riotous quantities of buddleia, garish splashes of graffiti. The first big-brand box to come into view is Tesla, which looks like the cars \u2013 hermetically sealed, plasticky, futuristic but without flair. Beside it is a mountain of scrap metal: the end of all car journeys. Two centres of learning are next up. One is the Thomas Telford university technical college \u2013 named, aptly, for the colossus of roads. A slick looking building closer to the line is the National Brownfield Institute. This, too, is right at home; all it surveys is potentiality and prospects of a good return. A serious built-up area will produce different emotions in different people at different times. I live in a farmhouse; I\u2019ve not been out for two weeks. I can feel my shins twitching. Edgelands can be exhilarating. Wolverhampton became a city in 2000. It feels and looks as if it\u2019s been one for 150 years. It has grand civic buildings, a serious railway station, a flash multi-platformed bus station. My first stop is the Posada, a proper city pub. I\u2019ve been told the Black Country still drinks mild but the man behind the bar tells me he bought a keg for some Camra chaps, but they had two halves and never came back, and he was left with a drink no one wanted. Perhaps I\u2019m not in the real Black Country yet? Across the road is the city-sized art gallery. Without prompting from me, a staff member takes me back to the entrance and tells me to make sure I see that building and that obelisk, adding that TE Lawrence drank at the Posada and Jim Lea of Slade is a regular visitor to the gallery. Lawrence of Arabia? \u201cYes, apparently he worked in engineering,\u201d she says. I look him up. Apparently, TE was overseeing the assembly of a new batch of RAF boat engines at Henry Meadows Ltd. He called Wolverhampton \u201csqualid\u201d and a \u201ccesspit\u201d \u2013 his lodgings were allegedly bug-infested \u2013 adding that it had \u201cthe worse mannered local press of my experience!\u201d The gallery has the UK\u2019s largest pop art collection outside London. Curator David Rodgers began collecting in the late 1960s when the style was new and controversial \u2013 and pieces affordable. Parts of the media thought he was squandering public money. But he was a visionary. I spent an hour all by myself with world-class works including a 1964 Warhol oil, Jacqueline, and one of his Campbell\u2019s Soup screenprints, Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s Purist Painting With Bottles (1975) and Pauline Boty\u2019s tender portrait of Marilyn Monroe, Colour Her Gone (1962). Captions by local LGBTQ+ opinion-formers added a queer slant. Patrick Caulfield\u2019s 1971 painting Tandoori Restaurant \u2013 in shades of turmeric and saffron flower \u2013 truly belongs here in the West Midlands. Wolverhampton\u2019s motto is \u201cOut of darkness cometh light\u201d. The Black Country was once \u201cthe workshop of the world\u201d. Areas had specialisms, as did genders in some cases. There were female chainmakers in Cradley Heath. Children could start making nails from the age of seven. Wolverhampton was known for its locks, keys, horseshoes, as well as grease, beer and kitchen furniture. Japanning was a huge trade. A cabinet on the first floor is filled with exquisite brooches, belt buckles, rosaries, buttons and pendants made in Bilston, formerly a powerhouse of \u201cdecorative enamel production\u201d. It was also home to houseware brand Beldray. Ed Isaacs, a retired Wolverhampton council housing officer, has reinvented himself as an urban sketcher. His drawings capture the contemporary sprawl-scape: Lidl stores, Greggs branches, parked cars, landfill sites, street furniture, tubing and piping and the unexplained bits of industry that jut out from weeds and behind railings. He calls it \u201cobsessive markmaking\u201d. There is an evolving tradition of West Midlands new impressionism; the works of Ed Isaacs, Tom Hicks, David Rayson and George Shaw make you want to walk to see the actual places, just as Monet-worshippers go to Rouen or Van Goghers go vagabond in Arles. Again pop art comes to mind; the horribly familiar, seen afresh. Things to see and do: Walk the city trail and locks walk along local canals, Chubb building, Molineux Stadium tour Harwich, Essex Mockba. Hoek. Warszawa. Berlin. Minsk. My one memory of Harwich relates to the boat train from Liverpool Street station in the mid-80s. Parkeston Quay didn\u2019t sound like a song from Bowie\u2019s Low album, but it was a portal to them. I arrived on the Hook-Harwich ferry after visits to Poland and Czechoslovakia but never used it to escape London to go east. But how I wanted to. I was obsessed with the writers Ha\u0161ek, Kundera, Kafka, Mi\u0142osz \u2013 and the cold war frontier. I was at university in London and, passing through Liverpool Street in the early evening on my way home, I would glance enviously at the destinations before grumbling my way down to the tube. In the lounge at the Pier hotel are vintage posters proclaiming \u201cHarwich for the continent\u201d and advertisements for holidays in Zeebrugge and Antwerp. In the era before car ferries and cheap flights, there were boats to Esbjerg, Gothenburg, Hamburg, Helsingborg, Hirtshals and Oslo. A century ago, ferries transported entire trains to Europe in true roll-on, roll-off fashion. Between 1924 and 1987, trains from the Hook linked it to Munich, Stockholm and, briefly, the Orient Express routes. A heritage trail takes an hour but dazzles with epoch-making storylines and notable names; the Harwich Society offers free guided tours to individuals every Saturday between May and September. Sue Daish, the town council\u2019s first female high steward and a trustee of the society, opens doors for me. We visit the High Lighthouse, Low Lighthouse (which houses a Maritime Museum), Treadwheel Crane and circular Redoubt Fort \u2013 built on a tump south of the centre in 1808 to repel Napoleon. We linger upstairs in the jettied house of Mayflower captain Christopher Jones, and in a room in the town\u2019s Guildhall once used to hold prisoners awaiting trial, daubed with elaborate carvings of ships, gallows and symbols to ward off evil spirits, dating from the late 18th century. One shows a ship flying the stars and stripes around the time of the American war of independence \u2013 possibly the earliest depiction of the US flag. I nostalgise at the Electric Palace cinema, built in 1911 and the oldest unaltered purpose-built cinema in Britain. Harwich\u2019s pubs are among the finest in England. Some 94 pubs have been named at 48 different sites. Our ancestors were sociable creatures, thirsty workers; home was not the high-walled castle it has become. Only about 10 remain and are lovely and look ancient but well used. I\u2019m not sure I have ever seen such a density of period architecture in so small an area. Heritage in cities exists in pockets, providing diversions from now. In the countryside, it might be a stately home or ruined abbey, with ice lollies and cream tea. Harwich Town, though, is haunted by its old, alluringly allusive places. Do they hold it back, or anchor it? After dark, I stand and watch the ships load and unload at Felixstowe, and am thrilled when a horn sounds and one pushes away for Shanghai, Santos, Panama, Singapore, Hoek. Things to see and do: Harwich Museum, seal watching at Hamford Water nature reserve, Maritime walking trail Gateshead, Tyne and Wear A circular bus route \u2013 uniquely relaxing \u2013 is a great way to recce a new town. The 51 and 52 (one route, two directions) is known as the East Gateshead Orbital. In just over an hour, I will be able to say I have been to all the places I can see on my map. There\u2019s Felling and Deckham, Wrekenton, Low Fell, High Fell, Sheriff Hill, Leam Lane, and Windy Nook. There will be those who never made it to Sheriff Hill, for one reason or another. I can tell them about it. On the top deck at the front, I get a rolling tour of social stratification and architectural styles \u2013 terraced rows, Tyneside flats (houses with two front doors, one for each flat), redbrick semis, older stone houses, prefabs. Front gardens are like family confessions, curiously moving seen from above. It\u2019s been a welcome hot day in a non-starter summer, and the early evening is sultry. Neighbours lean on fences talking. Two children splash as much as possible in a paddling pool. A man prunes his privets. Someone sucks on a hookah on a driveway filled with family members. We stop a lot. Teens split from groups and get on the bus to go home. Only I ride all the way, the safely lost tourist, scanning the houses, looking for what \u2013 clues? This is estate-land, laid out where slums were cleared. From the bus it\u2019s confusingly, endearingly human. But look at a map and Gateshead contains the evolutionary history of street patterns, from the straight rows north of Saltwell Park to labyrinths of crescents and cul-de-sacs obeying the rubric of the garden suburb (with street names like Gorsehill, Harebell Road and Celandine Way) to council estate Lego-land \u2013 full of right angles and hard edges, rigged with zigzags, doglegs and quasi-communal areas. JB Priestley, passing through, asked: \u201cHow is it that a town can contain one hundred and twenty-five thousand persons and yet look like a sprawling, swollen industrial village?\u201d Being a Yorkshireman, he didn\u2019t wait for a reply. \u201cThe answer is that this is a dormitory for the working class.\u201d The most quoted lines in the Gateshead section of his English Journey are \u201cthe whole town appeared to have been carefully planned by an enemy of the human race\u201d. Commentators say Priestley was in a foul mood due to too much travelling, a nasty cold and medicines that left him feeling rough. But slagging off has long been the prerogative of the metropolitan travel writer \u2013 and insults stick. Gateshead faces Newcastle across the Tyne, shares the bracing bridges, musical accent, fierce local identity. On the posts of the High Level Bridge are terse graffiti, sentences in a flicker book. One says \u201cNorth East or Nowhere\u201d. Newcastle looks civic and cluttered with churches and offices and a castle and the huge stadium on its summit. Gateshead is residential, suburban, a town with a centre like everyone else\u2019s: the big Tesco, the bookies, boozers, transport interchange. Roads and rail dominate, budging things out of their way: trains into and out of Newcastle use different lines. Fast, four-lane A-roads, including the A167 \u2013 laid out over the medieval Great North Road and still named \u201cHigh Street\u201d \u2013 have left gaping canyons flooded with toxins. But off the highways and under the ironwork there\u2019s hope. A new wine bar, a lovely old wedge-shaped pub, a horror-themed cafe. From Vane Gallery, housed in a long-dead pub called the Dun Cow on said High Street, art trickles up to grant-hogging showcase museums such as the Baltic. The ground floor has been hung for the town\u2019s first Pride. \u201cGateshead is a place of potential,\u201d says director Paul Stone, who co-founded Vane and its umbrella non-profit community organisation Orbis in 1997. \u201cI\u2019ve been through several cycles of funding and regeneration. I\u2019m feeling optimistic. For the first time ever, we\u2019re being listened to. Gateshead has challenges, but grassroots arts projects are the way to ensure its revival has longevity. Gateshead can be like Brooklyn.\u201d But art is a strange world; \u201cProbably more people know us outside Gateshead than in Gateshead,\u201d he says. Things to see and do: Prism Coffee; walk the Tyne Derwent Way; Dunston Staiths, Glasshouse International Centre for Music (ex-Sage); Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Angel of the North Armagh, County Armagh Widow\u2019s friend apples lie forgotten in flowerbeds outside a smart redbrick house at the top of Abbey Street. Bramleys are piled high outside a door for passersby to collect. Apple trees soften the aspects of the towering Roman Catholic cathedral and the capacious City hotel. I missed Armagh\u2019s food festival by one day but I haven\u2019t missed the harvest. I had no idea this was the centre of \u201corchard county\u201d. Then again, I didn\u2019t know the city is the mother-metropolis of Irish Catholicism and the Church of Ireland \u2013 Canterbury, Westminster and Liverpool all at once. Or that it\u2019s a Celtic mythology vortex. And that it hosts a Georgian architecture festival every November. Armagh has its own dedicated Troubles page on Wikipedia. Anyone who grew up between the 60s and 90s is familiar with the name from television news and bloody headlines. South Armagh in particular was portrayed as a Provisional IRA redoubt. Would-be dark tourists might be disappointed. But Armagh does give up hints and secrets that point to the causes of its modern history. The underpinning Celtic sources are there in the name. Armagh alludes to the Ard Mhacha or the high place of the goddess Macha; outside town is a place known as Emain Macha \u2013 and by the anglicised name Navan Fort, though it was a ceremonial site rather than a fortress. Celtic energies drew St Patrick in the fifth century. His founded a monastery that became a scholastic powerhouse. The Book of Armagh, less famous than Kells, is a priceless illuminated manuscript. It\u2019s kept at Trinity College in Dublin. But Armagh remains the capital of the two churches. The Church of Ireland cathedral is thought to stand on a site chosen by Patrick. It\u2019s been burned to the ground \u2013 by Vikings and lightning strikes \u2013 and rebuilt as many as 17 times over the long years, and is largely a 19th-century decorated gothic structure. The cathedral is russet-coloured. Like an apple. Its nave is crooked, echoing Christ\u2019s bowed head on the cross. The stained glass is beautiful. There\u2019s a stone figure called the Tandragee Idol from the iron age and a weather-worn Celtic cross that once stood outside. I\u2019m most drawn to the list of abbots, bishops and archbishops, which runs continuously from 444 (Patrick) to today. The names start off as Old Irish (Ailill, Carlaen, Nuadha), turn Norse (de Jorse, Fitzralph), become principally English (Kite, Lancaster) with the Reformation and plantation of Ulster, visit Rome (Spinelli de Palatio) dip some toes in Scotland (Stuart, Gregg, Armstrong) and then revert to Irish-born clerics, mainly (McCann, McDowell). Among them stands out the name of James Ussher \u2013 the prolific Dublin-born scholar who came up with the date of 22 October 4004BC for the creation. Northern Ireland towns are loaded with history, heavy with claims about myth and memory. Outside its cathedral, Armagh offers a sequence of gorgeous green spaces: a monastic herb garden with dwarf box hedging; an orchard garden with bush fruit trees and espalier trees on the walls; a more formal parterre garden, and a contemplative garden, divided into \u201crooms\u201d for contemplation and meditation. The high king of Ireland, Brian Boru, was buried here in 1014 and a large bronze mask of his face made by Mayo sculptor Rory Breslin occupies a central position in the herb garden. His face is shown sliced up perhaps to show that light streams even through violent death. Things to see and do: Palace Demesne and public park, Roman Catholic cathedral, Market Place theatre and arts centre Wokingham, Berkshire According to online house-seller Yopa, the average price for properties within a half-a-mile walk from a Waitrose store was \u00a3599,000 in comparison to \u00a3243,000 for homes that were within a 10- to 20-mile radius of a Waitrose. Wokingham, the epitome of a home counties town, has a Waitrose at the heart of its centre, \u201ca regular haunt for [former] Maidenhead MP and prime minister Theresa May\u201d, a local newspaper reports. On Google Maps, its only rivals are a masonic centre, a shrink, a cinema, a wine store and something called Giggling Squid. I don\u2019t know the mollusc, but I know Wokingham, as my partner was brought up there. We have used the town for the station, restaurants (Argentinian steak, posh Italian), barista coffee, and to source authentic Spanish deli produce such as padr\u00f3n peppers and barquillos. The town does not stint on aspirational supplies. I wondered if the Spanish owner had Googled \u201cplace in UK where people can afford authentic Spanish deli produce\u201d. Framing the retail are solid redbrick buildings \u2013 a grand, churchy town hall, tidy and elegant houses on Shute End, gracious Grade I-listed almshouses \u2013 and a peppering of timber-framed Tudor properties. Wokingham\u2019s origins are Saxon. The name probably means \u201cWocca\u2019s place\u201d, a tribal settlement. Before the Norman invasion, a chapel of ease was established in a clearing in the woods on the edge of Windsor Forest. The clearing became the town\u2019s oldest street, Le Rothe Strete \u2013 today\u2019s Rose Street. It was given a charter by Elizabeth I, became known for its bell foundry, brickmaking and the manufacture of silk stockings. Nine Mile Ride, connecting Bracknell to Finchampstead, was built around 1702 so that Queen Anne could observe the hunt from her carriage. Running parallel to a Roman road, it was expanded by George III, who loved to ride with hounds in the royal forest. Today, Nine Mile Ride is the B3430, just 6.7 miles long, and throbbing with traffic, but there are patches of woodland along its length. The smartest houses are on unmetalled streets. Thrushes and blackbirds contend with the snarl of SUVs and the whirr of EVs. The road to becoming a commuter town was indirect. A line through Wokingham was first built to connect Reading with Redhill, on the Brighton line. It is a gorgeous North Downs journey. Later, a line from Wokingham to London Waterloo opened, then in 2022 the Elizabeth line reduced the journey time to Tottenham Court Road to around an hour. The texture and mood of a suburb derives a lot from the travelling time to work. Over an hour and a place can retain at least an attitude of countrification. It\u2019s a commonplace to call pleasant, safe towns that resist caricature dull or bland. Wokingham \u2013 which routinely tops admittedly unscientific surveys of happiest places to live, wealthiest streets rankings, best town in Berkshire \u2026 merits a visit because it partly answers the questions: What do British people want? What does affluence look like? What is English happiness? But all towns lie within a constellation of proximal forces and when I drew Wokingham\u2019s on a map, it looked like a spidery new Zodiac sign. In near orbit are Ascot racecourse, Sandhurst, Wellington College, Farnborough airport, Broadmoor \u2013 and Waitrose\u2019s head office.

      "body": "<p>Floods are seemingly unavoidable these days. Florida, North Carolina, Nigeria, Tunisia, Mexico, India, Nepal, Vietnam, Poland and Austria are among the places that have experienced flooding in the last month. Those floods should no longer come as much of a surprise. Climate change leads to <a href=\"https://www.metlink.org/resource/ipcc-2021-which-regions-have-been-affected-the-most-by-climate-change/\">more frequent and intense</a> rain almost everywhere on the planet, and most infrastructure, from roads and bridges to canals and hydroelectric dams,<strong> </strong>is simply not built to withstand such extremes. </p> <p>That\u2019s where Vienna stands out. The floods that have deluged central Europe over the past two weeks caused plenty of disruptions in Lower Austria, including to a <a href=\"https://www.meinbezirk.at/tulln/c-lokales/immer-noch-orte-ueberflutet-und-unzugaenglich_a6905145\">newly built train station</a> meant to connect the burgeoning suburbs to the city. But aside from some disruption to Vienna\u2019s otherwise well-functioning<strong> </strong>subway system, Viennese homes were largely spared. Why? It\u2019s not because Vienna sits on higher ground than the surrounding areas (by and large it does not). The reason the city escaped the worst of the floods is because of human engineering and political foresight dating back to the 1960s, which emerged in response to earlier floods that devastated parts of the city.</p> <p>The train station that was damaged, which sits to the west of Vienna, was built in 2012 and is itself a sign of the growing problem. Lower Austria\u2019s <a href=\"https://atlas.noe.gv.at/atlas/portal/noe-atlas/map/Wasser/Hochwasser\">own flood maps</a> show how the Tullnerfeld suburbs are particularly vulnerable to flooding, yet thousands of new single-family homes have been built in suburban areas surrounding the station. Continued <em>Bodenversiegelung</em> <em>\u2013</em> German for \u201csoil sealing\u201d, where green fields are concreted over for development \u2013 all but ensure that flooding is going to get worse for years to come.</p> <p>One problem is that the yardstick for sensible flood protection is changing fast as the climate crisis accelerates. In the 20th century, a \u201c100-year\u201d flood was so-called because it might have only happened once in 100 years. Now, such extreme events are more regular. A months-long cleanup once a century may be a risk worth taking, but doing the same clean-up every decade, or even once a year, is not. All that makes Vienna\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240920-our-plan-worked-how-vienna-prepared-itself-for-a-5000-year-flood\">flood protection all the more impressive</a>. Built along the Danube, Vienna had endured its share of floods over the years. The largest in <a href=\"https://www.wien.gv.at/umwelt/gewaesser/hochwasserschutz/donau/katastrophenhochwaesser.html\">recorded history</a> happened in 1501, when the Danube carried about 20 times as much water towards Vienna than in an average year. The biggest flood in the last century was in 1954, and devastated parts of the city. Years of political handwringing followed about what to do to protect it.</p> <p>In 1969, Vienna\u2019s city council voted to build what has since become known as the <em>Donauinsel</em>, a 21km-long island in the middle of the Danube. The island effectively created a dam and a relief channel north of central Vienna that was able to hold enough water to help protect the city against the kind of flood that occurred in 1501. So far, it has held up its promise.</p> <p>Then there are the wider political questions raised by Vienna\u2019s experience. Initially, when parliament voted to build the <em>Donauinsel</em>, Austria\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) opposed the new island on the basis that Vienna had more <a href=\"https://www.profil.at/home/hochwasser-donauinsel-der-hochwasserschutz-wiens-359528\">\u201curgent\u201d</a> tasks to solve. Vienna\u2019s conservatives might since have come around to seeing the error in their opposition. But the national party is as opposed to climate action as it has always been, and is now only surpassed in its zealotry by the far-right Freedom party. The latter just emerged as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/far-right-freedom-party-winning-austrian-election-first-results-show\">strongest force in Austria\u2019s parliamentary elections</a>. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/rightwing-populist-parties-blight-climate-policy-study-finds\">right\u2019s opposition to climate action</a>, of course, extends well beyond Austria.</p>    <p>There are ample steps cities the world over must take to protect themselves against the climate crisis. Building \u201c1,000-year\u201d flood protections is only the beginning. In a world where fossil fuel emissions anywhere can lead to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/lightning-high-arctic-rise-scientists-worried\">drastic rise in Arctic lightning</a>, where Arctic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/21/arctic-zombie-viruses-in-siberia-could-spark-terrifying-new-pandemic-scientists-warn\">\u201czombie viruses\u201d could spark pandemics</a> and where Canadian wildfire smoke <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/wildfire-air-pollution-climate-1f6f88cb\">turns</a> New York City\u2019s skies orange, adapting to climate change goes well beyond building dams.</p> <p>Yet a dam \u2013 the simple piece of engineering that has so far protected Vienna \u2013 has numerous benefits.

      "bodyText": "Floods are seemingly unavoidable these days. Florida, North Carolina, Nigeria, Tunisia, Mexico, India, Nepal, Vietnam, Poland and Austria are among the places that have experienced flooding in the last month. Those floods should no longer come as much of a surprise. Climate change leads to more frequent and intense rain almost everywhere on the planet, and most infrastructure, from roads and bridges to canals and hydroelectric dams, is simply not built to withstand such extremes. That\u2019s where Vienna stands out. The floods that have deluged central Europe over the past two weeks caused plenty of disruptions in Lower Austria, including to a newly built train station meant to connect the burgeoning suburbs to the city. But aside from some disruption to Vienna\u2019s otherwise well-functioning subway system, Viennese homes were largely spared. Why? It\u2019s not because Vienna sits on higher ground than the surrounding areas (by and large it does not). The reason the city escaped the worst of the floods is because of human engineering and political foresight dating back to the 1960s, which emerged in response to earlier floods that devastated parts of the city. The train station that was damaged, which sits to the west of Vienna, was built in 2012 and is itself a sign of the growing problem. Lower Austria\u2019s own flood maps show how the Tullnerfeld suburbs are particularly vulnerable to flooding, yet thousands of new single-family homes have been built in suburban areas surrounding the station. Continued Bodenversiegelung \u2013 German for \u201csoil sealing\u201d, where green fields are concreted over for development \u2013 all but ensure that flooding is going to get worse for years to come. One problem is that the yardstick for sensible flood protection is changing fast as the climate crisis accelerates. In the 20th century, a \u201c100-year\u201d flood was so-called because it might have only happened once in 100 years. Now, such extreme events are more regular. A months-long cleanup once a century may be a risk worth taking, but doing the same clean-up every decade, or even once a year, is not. All that makes Vienna\u2019s own flood protection all the more impressive. Built along the Danube, Vienna had endured its share of floods over the years. The largest in recorded history happened in 1501, when the Danube carried about 20 times as much water towards Vienna than in an average year. The biggest flood in the last century was in 1954, and devastated parts of the city. Years of political handwringing followed about what to do to protect it. In 1969, Vienna\u2019s city council voted to build what has since become known as the Donauinsel, a 21km-long island in the middle of the Danube. The island effectively created a dam and a relief channel north of central Vienna that was able to hold enough water to help protect the city against the kind of flood that occurred in 1501. So far, it has held up its promise. Then there are the wider political questions raised by Vienna\u2019s experience. Initially, when parliament voted to build the Donauinsel, Austria\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) opposed the new island on the basis that Vienna had more \u201curgent\u201d tasks to solve. Vienna\u2019s conservatives might since have come around to seeing the error in their opposition. But the national party is as opposed to climate action as it has always been, and is now only surpassed in its zealotry by the far-right Freedom party. The latter just emerged as the strongest force in Austria\u2019s parliamentary elections. And the right\u2019s opposition to climate action, of course, extends well beyond Austria. There are ample steps cities the world over must take to protect themselves against the climate crisis. Building \u201c1,000-year\u201d flood protections is only the beginning. In a world where fossil fuel emissions anywhere can lead to a drastic rise in Arctic lightning, where Arctic \u201czombie viruses\u201d could spark pandemics and where Canadian wildfire smoke turns New York City\u2019s skies orange, adapting to climate change goes well beyond building dams. Yet a dam \u2013 the simple piece of engineering that has so far protected Vienna \u2013 has numerous benefits. Dams can double as a low-carbon source for hydropower (Vienna\u2019s dam doesn\u2019t produce any electricity, although Austria gets two thirds of its own electricity from hydropower, accounting for most of its low-carbon generation). There are plenty of other steps that are triple-wins: good for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, adapting to climate change and the economy. Particularly in Britain, this could start with insulating homes against the elements, to cut down on heating and cooling costs and associated emissions. It also extends to smart spatial planning. It seems obvious that we should cease building more suburban houses on floodplains \u2013 or more suburban houses in the first place, for that matter. After all, it is far easier to protect homes within a city such as Vienna than the sprawling enclaves surrounding the city, and dense urban neighbourhoods allow for much lower-carbon living than suburban subdivisions. That\u2019s a win for flood protection, and a win for cutting carbon emissions. Vienna frequently ranks among the world\u2019s most livable cities for good reason.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden led congratulations on Tuesday to Jimmy Carter on his 100th birthday, a milestone that makes Carter the first former US president to become a centenarian. Carter entered hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia, 19 months ago. His grandson, Jason Carter, has said the former president is eager to cast his ballot for Kamala Harris, a fellow Democrat, in the presidential election. The White House paid tribute with a display of big lettering declaring \u201cHappy Birthday President Carter\u201d and the number 100 outside the north portico. Carter has asked Biden to eulogise him at his state funeral when the time comes. In a statement Biden, 81, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter\u2019s 1976 election campaign, said his predecessor has always been \u201ca moral force for our nation and the world\u201d. He added: \u201cYour hopeful vision of our country, your commitment to a better world, and your unwavering belief in the power of human goodness continues to be a guiding light for all of us.\u201d Barack Obama posted a video message on the social media platform X that said: \u201cHappy 100th birthday, President Carter! Thank you for your friendship, your fundamental decency, and your incredible acts of service through the @CarterCenter. Michelle and I are grateful for all you\u2019ve done for this country.\u201d About 25 family members filled Carter\u2019s home on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, enjoying cupcakes on the front lawn while second world war planes flew over in his honour. Chip Carter said his father\u2019s next goal is to make it to election day. \u201cHe\u2019s plugged in,\u201d Chip told the AP. \u201cI asked him two months ago if he was trying to live to be 100 and he said, no, I\u2019m trying to live to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d Tributes flowed all day. Former president Bill Clinton tweeted: \u201cJimmy Carter\u2019s long, good life is a testament to love, work, and faith, and an enduring beacon to all people working to make better tomorrows. Happy 100th birthday, Mr. President.\u201d Jonathan Alter, author of the biography His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful to see that he is alive for the reassessment that I and others attempted almost a decade ago when I started this project. I wanted to contribute to a better understanding of who he is and what he accomplished. He\u2019s lived long enough to see that he\u2019s now appreciated.\u201d Alter added: \u201cAs journalists we judge politicians by how they\u2019re doing politically, how popular they are, but as historians we have a different responsibility and that is to judge them by how they changed the country and the world. And by that latter standard, he\u2019s getting the revival that we all hoped. It\u2019s nice to see and great he\u2019s lived to see it.\u201d Carter, who has lived longer than any US president in history, served a single term from January 1977 to January 1981 and was beleaguered by high inflation and the Iran hostage crisis. But more recently historians have argued that his record deserves reappraisal and he was ahead of his time in calling for action to tackle the climate crisis. His decades of humanitarian work after leaving office, including the promotion of human rights and alleviating poverty in countries around the world, earned him the Nobel peace prize in 2002. His birthday is being marked by the broadcast of a tribute concert by stars of country, rock and gospel music recorded at Atlanta\u2019s Fox Theatre last month. The concert raised more than $1m towards the international programme of the Carter Center, which he founded with his wife, Rosalynn Carter. The former president plans to tune in to the concert on Georgia Public Broadcasting, according to his grandson Jason Carter. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were married for 77 years. Rosalynn Carter died in November last year and the former president was last seen in public at his wife\u2019s funeral, where he used a wheelchair and appeared frail. He has been diagnosed with cancer and other health issues, and decided to end medical intervention and enter hospice care in February 2023. Carter is expected to mark his birthday in the same one-storey home that he and Rosalynn built in the early 1960s \u2013 before his first election to the Georgia state senate. He taught Sunday school at his hometown Baptist church in Plains until a few years ago. Jason Carter, who is chair of the Carter Center governing board, told the Associated Press: \u201cNot everybody gets 100 years on this earth, and when somebody does, and when they use that time to do so much good for so many people, it\u2019s worth celebrating. \u201cThese last few months, 19 months, now that he\u2019s been in hospice, it\u2019s been a chance for our family to reflect and then for the rest of the country and the world to really reflect on him. That\u2019s been a really gratifying time.\u201d Early voting in Georgia begins on 15 October, two weeks into Carter\u2019s 101st year. Jason Carter added: \u201cWhen we started asking him about his 100th birthday, he said he was excited to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d The Carters have worked with the non-profit group Habitat for Humanity International since the 1980s, and the ex-president has regularly joined other volunteers to help build homes for people affected by poverty or disasters. This week, to mark Carter\u2019s birthday, scores of Habitat volunteers, including country music stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, will build 30 homes in St Paul, Minnesota. Jonathan Reckford, Habitat\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cThe Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project serves not only as a way to honor the Carters\u2019 legacy, but also as a reminder of what is possible when people from all walks come together to work toward one common goal.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In hindsight, the quiff was probably a bad idea. It was the morning of my final audition to play Harry Potter in 2000. I should have been rehearsing the scene I\u2019d be performing later that day at Leavesden Studios, in front of a panel that included director Chris Columbus. Instead, I spent half an hour papier-macheing my fringe with fistfuls of wet-look hair gel, intent on giving these Hollywood bigwigs some of the old razzle dazzle.</p> <p>Needless to say, securing the lead role in one of the biggest film franchises of all time requires more than a hairstyle. Mid-audition, as I anxiously fumbled through my lines, I locked eyes with one of the producers. He gave me a smile that I\u2019m sure was meant to be encouraging, but it was clear he\u2019d already made up his mind.</p> <p>The journey to this point started on Christmas Day, 1998. What I had really wanted that year was the latest novel in the Goal Kings series, which followed a team of teenage football players. Instead, I got a book about a child with a lightning-bolt scar. But like the other 120 million people who bought Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, I quickly came around to the young wizard and his outcast mates.</p> <p>The following year, an unusual announcement was made during one of my school assemblies: auditions for the Harry Potter film adaptation had begun, and they were open to any would-be wizards in my age range.</p> <p>The film-makers were determined to cast children who were British and relatively unknown to the film industry, so had flung the net surprisingly wide. I was a relatively unknown British child living in rural West Sussex, but outside a few school productions I\u2019d not done any acting, so I have no idea what compelled me to believe I stood a chance. Either way, I excitedly told my mum the second I got home, and she signed me up for the casting call at a nearby school in Brighton.</p> <p>My main recollection of that day is queueing for a really long time. About 300 kids reportedly auditioned for the role of Harry, and it felt as if they were all standing in front of me that drizzly afternoon.</p> <p>After I finally did my bit, one of the casting directors took my mum aside. \u201cHe\u2019s rather good,\u201d she whispered. This inspired some optimism on the drive home. But as the weeks rolled on and we heard nothing, the hope faded and I got back to more important stuff, like watching WWF.</p> <p>Months later, the house phone rang. I\u2019d been invited to audition for Harry, at Leavesden, where the films were going to be shot. It didn\u2019t seem real, but before long confirmation came in the form of the scenes I\u2019d need to learn: a conversation about dementors, and the poignant moment in which Harry\u2019s late parents are revealed to him in the magical Mirror of Erised, which as far as I remember mostly boiled down to me pulling a variety of concerned facial expressions.</p> <p>Having spent a few weeks practising looking a bit worried, then a bit sad, then a bit shocked, and then ultimately quite happy, it was go-time. I got my hair looking just how I wanted it (objectively bad) and hopped in the car with my dad.</p> <p>I remember getting a brief tour of the studio and seeing the early sketches for the Golden Snitch, the most important ball in a game of Quidditch, which was an incredibly exciting moment for an 11-year-old Potterhead. I also recall sitting opposite a pair of gangly, red-headed brothers in the waiting area. I found out years later that they were James and Oliver Phelps, who would play the Weasley twins.</p>    <p>What I remember least is the audition itself, which isn\u2019t some kind of minor trauma response, because the experience wasn\u2019t at all traumatic. The casting team \u2013 made up of Columbus, producers David Heyman and Mark Radcliffe, and casting directors Janet Hirshenson and Karen Lindsay-Stewart \u2013 were all incredibly kind, gentle and welcoming.</p> <p>Really, I think I just left as little of a mark on myself as I did on that panel. I felt shy, froze up and didn\u2019t deliver my lines with as much gusto as I had while practising them at home. (The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently revealed on social media that I\u2019d subsequently been considered for boy-villain Draco Malfoy, which is somehow worse than not being cast as Harry. Learning that you\u2019d make a good match for one of literature\u2019s most unlikable characters is a truly humbling experience.)</p> <p>Leaving the room, I knew I hadn\u2019t got the part. Even as an 11-year-old amateur, it was clear I\u2019d missed the mark. On the drive home, I experienced two emotions more starkly than I ever had before: disappointment that my life wasn\u2019t about to be transformed, and regret at my half-hearted performance. Worse still, I was dreading the embarrassment of updating everyone at school, having proudly told them all about the casting director\u2019s \u201crather good\u201d remark.</p> <p>Relative to what some 11-year-olds are being forced to endure, not becoming a multimillionaire actor isn\u2019t exactly history\u2019s biggest boo-hoo moment. But that three-pronged poker of dismay, remorse and shame was fairly crushing as a kid, and took a while for me to shake.</p> <p>That said, it also forced me to confront and process those emotions, which was helpful training for a lifetime studded with just as much disappointment and embarrassment as is customary. And while Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s (estimated) \u00a395m fortune would be nice, I honestly wouldn\u2019t want to swap his younger years for mine. After all, you only get one shot at being an awkward, clumsy teenager, more concerned with your hairstyle than your life prospects, and I\u2019m glad I was able to experience all those highs and lows in complete and utter anonymity.</p>",

Vance was polished and played nice</h2> \n<p>Walz won his place on Harris\u2019s campaign in part because of his zesty and energetic attacks on Vance, whom he accused of being a faux supporter of struggling rural Americans, and of simply being \u201cweird\u201d.</p> \n<p>But in the days before this debate, Walz also tried to manage expectations about his face-off with Vance, with news outlets running stories about Walz\u2019s nerves and his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/politics/tim-walz-vice-president-debate/index.html\">belief that he is a bad debater</a>.</p> \n<p>And, in fact, Walz appeared anxious and uncomfortable in his debate with Vance. Instead of mocking or attacking Donald Trump\u2019s unpopular vice-presidential pick, the Minnesota governor appeared to be working hard to land his prepared talking points, while a more relaxed Vance easily maneuvered around him.</p> \n<p>Walz admitted that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d in past comments, when he repeatedly recalled being in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre, though news outlets found evidence he could not have been there at that exact time. Walz also said in a garbled comment on gun violence that \u201che became friends with mass shooters\u201d, a gaffe that is now widely circulating in conservative media.</p> \n<p>Vance, who has faced intense criticism for spreading racist misinformation about Haitian immigrants in Ohio, and has refused to apologize, appeared to be trying to present both himself and Trump as genial and affable moderates, describing Trump, for instance, as the savior of Obamacare, though fact-checkers noted the former president consistently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/walz-vance-debate-fact-check-updates\">attacked and undermined</a> Obamacare.</p> \n<p>By the end of the debate, both candidates appeared to be making some efforts to be cordial to each other, and to note moments of agreement with each other, as if trying to win points for \u201ccivility\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Vance refused to say whether Trump had lost the 2020 election </h2> \n<p>In one of Walz\u2019s stronger moments, he asked Vance to state clearly whether Trump had lost the 2020 election, which the former president still denies.</p> \n<p>Vance would not say whether Trump had won or lost.</p> \n<p>\u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future,\u201d Vance said, trying to pivot to accusing Harris of censoring Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d Walz said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1841306806347350107\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WALZ: Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?<br><br>VANCE: Tim, I'm focused on the future<br><br>WALZ: That's a damning non-answer <a href=\"https://t.co/D6tVg8HOFC\">pic.twitter.com/D6tVg8HOFC</a></p>\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1841306806347350107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2024</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>When questioned about threats to democracy and January 6, Vance responded by drawing a false equivalence between a violent mob storming the Capitol and forcing members of Congress to flee and hide, and Democrats protesting and complaining after previous presidential elections. Vance argued it was unfair for Democrats to describe Trump\u2019s refusal to admit he had lost the 2020 election as undermining democracy, and said the claim \u201cthat this is just a problem that Republicans have had \u2013 I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cJanuary 6 was not Facebook ads,\u201d Walz responded, referring to Democrats\u2019 allegations that Russia\u2019s buying of ads in 2016 influenced the election. \u201cI think a revisionist history on this \u2013 look, I don\u2019t understand how we got to this point, but the issue was, that happened.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Vance blamed a wide swathe of problems, from school shootings to the housing crisis, on undocumented immigrants and US border policy </h2> \n<p>Is there a social problem in America that, according to JD Vance, doesn\u2019t come back to Harris\u2019s supposed failure to secure the US-Mexico border?</p> \n<p>Vance asserted that the US housing crisis was a result of undocumented immigrants competing with US citizens for homes, and suggested that Trump\u2019s pledge to conduct mass deportations of undocumented people in the US would bring down rents and housing costs, a repeated suggestion that struck many commentators as <a href=\"https://x.com/alex_shephard/status/1841279803900506399\">troubling</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alex_shephard/status/1841279803900506399\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">listing \u201cmass deportation\u201d as a housing proposal is literally fascistic <a href=\"https://t.co/XzNG4sDwGS\">pic.twitter.com/XzNG4sDwGS</a></p>\u2014 Alex Shephard (@alex_shephard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex_shephard/status/1841279803900506399?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2024</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cTwenty five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It\u2019s why we have a massive increase in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien populations under Kamala Harris\u2019s leadership,\u201d Vance said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here,\u201d he said at another point.</p> \n<p>The Associated Press\u2019s factcheckers noted that, \u201cMost economists blame a long-term <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/housing-treasury-homelessness-yellen-interest-rates-9055dd9394a0e01609d04294f40ae6a7\">decline in the housing supply</a> for the steady increase in home prices\u201d and \u201cHomebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes,\u201d meaning that mass deportations of workers would not in fact increase the supply of housing in the US.</p> \n<p>When asked about school shootings and his opposition to gun control laws, Vance endorsed adding more security measures to schools. In response to gunmen opening fire at schools, he said: \u201cWe have to make the doors stronger. We have to make the windows stronger.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he also pointed a finger at Mexico, asserting that most gun violence in the US is carried out with illegally obtained firearms, and drawing a connection between the \u201copen border\u201d with Mexico and a rise in illegal guns in the US.</p> \n<p>There is official data that shows a <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/infographics-arms-trafficking-across-us-mexico-border#:~:text=Mexico's%20Secretariat%20of%20Foreign%20Relations,and%20ultimately%20found%20in%20Mexico.\">rising number of guns used in crimes</a> have crossed the US-Mexico border in recent years. But it\u2019s not Mexico sending guns to the US: it\u2019s <a href=\"https://home.watson.brown.edu/research/research-briefs/exit-wounds-how-americas-guns-fuel-violence-across-border\">guns</a> from the US fueling crime and violence in Mexico. As Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mexico-usa-guns/\">reported last year</a>: \u201cThe great majority of illegal guns in Mexico come from the United States, Mexican and US authorities say,\u201d noting that, \u201cMexico, a country of 127 million people, has tight gun laws \u2013 and just a single gun store, located on a military base.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Vance talked a lot about the GOP needing to regain women\u2019s trust on abortion policy</h2> \n<p>Vance paired a lot of soft rhetoric acknowledging American women\u2019s concerns about the GOP\u2019s extreme anti-abortion policies with a reiteration of his support for leaving abortion law to the states, many of which have passed laws that criminalize women who seek abortions and medical providers who assist them.</p> \n<p>He opened his comments on abortion by talking about a friend who told him, years after having an abortion as a young woman, that her ability to have that abortion had been crucial to her life, and allowed her to escape an abusive relationship.</p> \n<p>He also said that the state of Ohio\u2019s 2023 referendum enshrining access to abortion as a right in the state constitution, when \u201cpeople in Ohio voted overwhelmingly against my position\u201d, taught him \u201cthat we have to do a better job at winning back people\u2019s trust\u201d.</p> \n<p>When Walz mentioned one of the Georgia women who died of what an investigation found to be a \u201cpreventable\u201d death that experts linked to a state law criminalizing abortion procedures, Vance agreed with Walz: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/19/georgia-abortion-ban\">Amber Thurman</a> should still be alive.\u201d</p> \n<p>But, of course, leaving abortion law to the states resulted in the Georgia law that Thurman\u2019s family, as well as experts, blame for her death.</p> \n<p>Thurman\u2019s family was having none of Vance\u2019s rhetoric. In a comment shared after the debate, they praised Walz for defending women\u2019s rights and criticized Republican policies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1841315023068533233\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The family of Amber Thurman has issued a statement following discussions during the Vice Presidential debate about Amber and women\u2019s reproductive rights:<br><br>Tonight, we commend Governor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Tim_Walz</a> for telling Amber\u2019s story and for his unwavering commitment to defending women\u2019s\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/SRUihCKvw2\">pic.twitter.com/SRUihCKvw2</a></p>\u2014 Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1841315023068533233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2024</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<h2>There was only one question about the Middle East, which is on the brink of a regional war </h2> \n<p>On Tuesday, Iran launched a major missile attack on Israel. Israel pledged revenge. On Tuesday night, as Israeli missiles struck neighborhoods across Beirut, and Israel warned Lebanese civilians to flee their homes at 3am, the US vice-presidential debate largely ignored the escalating global crisis, instead focusing on questions about the economy and the priorities of US consumers.</p> \n<p>Vance and Walz faced a single opening question about the Middle East: would they support a pre-emptive US strike on Iran? Both candidates more or less dodged the question, while emphasizing that they supported Israel. Walz added that Trump\u2019s own defense advisers had decided he was unfit for office, and that the US needed a \u201csteady\u201d leader like Kamala Harris. Vance said it was up to Israel to decide the best way to keep themselves safe, and: \u201cWe should support our allies wherever they are when they\u2019re fighting the bad guys.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the Middle East spiraled towards full-scale war, the US vice presidential debate focused largely on domestic issues, like school shootings and the cost of housing, healthcare, and childcare. The CBS News debate moderators largely declined to factcheck JD Vance or Tim Walz, asking them instead to respond to each other. Here are some key takeaways from the debate between the Republican senator from Ohio who wrote a bestselling memoir about poverty in Appalachia and the Democratic football-coach-turned-governor of Minnesota. Walz was plodding and failed to attack Vance. Vance was polished and played nice Walz won his place on Harris\u2019s campaign in part because of his zesty and energetic attacks on Vance, whom he accused of being a faux supporter of struggling rural Americans, and of simply being \u201cweird\u201d. But in the days before this debate, Walz also tried to manage expectations about his face-off with Vance, with news outlets running stories about Walz\u2019s nerves and his belief that he is a bad debater. And, in fact, Walz appeared anxious and uncomfortable in his debate with Vance. Instead of mocking or attacking Donald Trump\u2019s unpopular vice-presidential pick, the Minnesota governor appeared to be working hard to land his prepared talking points, while a more relaxed Vance easily maneuvered around him. Walz admitted that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d in past comments, when he repeatedly recalled being in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre, though news outlets found evidence he could not have been there at that exact time. Walz also said in a garbled comment on gun violence that \u201che became friends with mass shooters\u201d, a gaffe that is now widely circulating in conservative media. Vance, who has faced intense criticism for spreading racist misinformation about Haitian immigrants in Ohio, and has refused to apologize, appeared to be trying to present both himself and Trump as genial and affable moderates, describing Trump, for instance, as the savior of Obamacare, though fact-checkers noted the former president consistently attacked and undermined Obamacare. By the end of the debate, both candidates appeared to be making some efforts to be cordial to each other, and to note moments of agreement with each other, as if trying to win points for \u201ccivility\u201d. Vance refused to say whether Trump had lost the 2020 election In one of Walz\u2019s stronger moments, he asked Vance to state clearly whether Trump had lost the 2020 election, which the former president still denies. Vance would not say whether Trump had won or lost. \u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future,\u201d Vance said, trying to pivot to accusing Harris of censoring Americans. \u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d Walz said. When questioned about threats to democracy and January 6, Vance responded by drawing a false equivalence between a violent mob storming the Capitol and forcing members of Congress to flee and hide, and Democrats protesting and complaining after previous presidential elections. Vance argued it was unfair for Democrats to describe Trump\u2019s refusal to admit he had lost the 2020 election as undermining democracy, and said the claim \u201cthat this is just a problem that Republicans have had \u2013 I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d \u201cJanuary 6 was not Facebook ads,\u201d Walz responded, referring to Democrats\u2019 allegations that Russia\u2019s buying of ads in 2016 influenced the election. \u201cI think a revisionist history on this \u2013 look, I don\u2019t understand how we got to this point, but the issue was, that happened.\u201d Vance blamed a wide swathe of problems, from school shootings to the housing crisis, on undocumented immigrants and US border policy Is there a social problem in America that, according to JD Vance, doesn\u2019t come back to Harris\u2019s supposed failure to secure the US-Mexico border? Vance asserted that the US housing crisis was a result of undocumented immigrants competing with US citizens for homes, and suggested that Trump\u2019s pledge to conduct mass deportations of undocumented people in the US would bring down rents and housing costs, a repeated suggestion that struck many commentators as troubling. \u201cTwenty five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It\u2019s why we have a massive increase in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien populations under Kamala Harris\u2019s leadership,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here,\u201d he said at another point. The Associated Press\u2019s factcheckers noted that, \u201cMost economists blame a long-term decline in the housing supply for the steady increase in home prices\u201d and \u201cHomebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes,\u201d meaning that mass deportations of workers would not in fact increase the supply of housing in the US. When asked about school shootings and his opposition to gun control laws, Vance endorsed adding more security measures to schools. In response to gunmen opening fire at schools, he said: \u201cWe have to make the doors stronger. We have to make the windows stronger.\u201d But he also pointed a finger at Mexico, asserting that most gun violence in the US is carried out with illegally obtained firearms, and drawing a connection between the \u201copen border\u201d with Mexico and a rise in illegal guns in the US. There is official data that shows a rising number of guns used in crimes have crossed the US-Mexico border in recent years. But it\u2019s not Mexico sending guns to the US: it\u2019s guns from the US fueling crime and violence in Mexico. As Reuters reported last year: \u201cThe great majority of illegal guns in Mexico come from the United States, Mexican and US authorities say,\u201d noting that, \u201cMexico, a country of 127 million people, has tight gun laws \u2013 and just a single gun store, located on a military base.\u201d Vance talked a lot about the GOP needing to regain women\u2019s trust on abortion policy Vance paired a lot of soft rhetoric acknowledging American women\u2019s concerns about the GOP\u2019s extreme anti-abortion policies with a reiteration of his support for leaving abortion law to the states, many of which have passed laws that criminalize women who seek abortions and medical providers who assist them. He opened his comments on abortion by talking about a friend who told him, years after having an abortion as a young woman, that her ability to have that abortion had been crucial to her life, and allowed her to escape an abusive relationship. He also said that the state of Ohio\u2019s 2023 referendum enshrining access to abortion as a right in the state constitution, when \u201cpeople in Ohio voted overwhelmingly against my position\u201d, taught him \u201cthat we have to do a better job at winning back people\u2019s trust\u201d. When Walz mentioned one of the Georgia women who died of what an investigation found to be a \u201cpreventable\u201d death that experts linked to a state law criminalizing abortion procedures, Vance agreed with Walz: \u201cAmber Thurman should still be alive.\u201d But, of course, leaving abortion law to the states resulted in the Georgia law that Thurman\u2019s family, as well as experts, blame for her death. Thurman\u2019s family was having none of Vance\u2019s rhetoric. In a comment shared after the debate, they praised Walz for defending women\u2019s rights and criticized Republican policies. There was only one question about the Middle East, which is on the brink of a regional war On Tuesday, Iran launched a major missile attack on Israel. Israel pledged revenge. On Tuesday night, as Israeli missiles struck neighborhoods across Beirut, and Israel warned Lebanese civilians to flee their homes at 3am, the US vice-presidential debate largely ignored the escalating global crisis, instead focusing on questions about the economy and the priorities of US consumers. Vance and Walz faced a single opening question about the Middle East: would they support a pre-emptive US strike on Iran? Both candidates more or less dodged the question, while emphasizing that they supported Israel. Walz added that Trump\u2019s own defense advisers had decided he was unfit for office, and that the US needed a \u201csteady\u201d leader like Kamala Harris. Vance said it was up to Israel to decide the best way to keep themselves safe, and: \u201cWe should support our allies wherever they are when they\u2019re fighting the bad guys.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Conservative party has become a weak tribute act to itself. Candidates in a leadership contest belt out classic Tory tunes to an audience that only wants the oldies and knows the words by heart. Cut taxes; crack down on immigration; slash red tape to unleash enterprise \u2013 policy karaoke for wannabe prime ministers with no original material.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick, the candidate of the hard right, does cover versions of other people\u2019s campaign hits. He promises to \u201cget immigration done\u201d because it sounds like the Brexit slogan that worked for Boris Johnson in 2019. Jenrick was an acolyte of David Cameron when metropolitan liberalism was the available lubricant to his ambition. He voted remain in 2016. Now he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/30/jenrick-faces-scrutiny-over-claim-uk-special-forces-kill-rather-than-capture-terrorists\">makes bizarre claims</a> that European human rights law is responsible for British special forces \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists.</p> <p>Tom Tugendhat, representing his party\u2019s One Nation caucus, trots through the famous Tory moderate dance routine: turn your back on the centre, tuck your principles down low, keep stepping to the right. As a former security minister and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tugendhat knows the damage that leaving the European court of human rights would do to Britain\u2019s international reputation. He boasts of his readiness to do it anyway.</p> <p>Flapping incoherently in the middle of the field is James Cleverly. He says it was unrealistic of Rishi Sunak to claim he could \u201cstop the boats\u201d. He also pledges to revive the Rwanda deportation scheme on which the boat-stopping boast was predicated (and that he reportedly once <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-67440137\">described as \u201cbatshit\u201d</a>).</p> <p>And of course no Tory parade would be complete without a Margaret Thatcher impersonation. Enter Kemi Badenoch, comparing herself <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-compares-herself-margaret-33787556\">to the Iron Lady</a> as the explanation for bad publicity over her claim that \u201cexcessive\u201d UK maternity pay has \u201cgone too far\u201d. Enemies of conservatism took the quote out of context, Badenoch complained. The same had happened to Thatcher when she <a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/106689\">told Woman\u2019s Own magazine</a> there was \u201cno such thing as society\u201d.</p> <p>It is unlikely that Badenoch remembers that episode from 1987. She was seven at the time. But when you are playing to the Conservative crowd, there isn\u2019t much safe repertoire beyond the 1980s. There have been six Tory prime ministers since Thatcher. None provides a serviceable model for emulation. They are all either despised by the public or doctrinally unsound in the eyes of the party faithful.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2024/09/losing-it-the-conservative-party-and-the-2024-general-election/\">recent survey</a> by Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory party chair, voters were asked to identify \u201cthe best Conservative leader of recent times\u201d. The overall winner was David Cameron on 27%, although 31% had no answer. Among those who voted Conservative in July, Boris Johnson was most popular, on 40%. Liz Truss, who told an audience on Monday that she would have performed better than Rishi Sunak in a general election, was rated best by just 1% of respondents. (Her average score was redeemed from zero by Reform UK voters, who rated Truss joint second-worst among former Tory leaders, alongside Theresa May, fractionally ahead of Sunak.)</p> <p>There is one measure on which Sunak beats all other Tory prime ministers of the 21st century. His was the only constituency that still has a Conservative MP. Witney, Maidenhead and Henley-on-Thames, formerly represented by Cameron, May and Johnson, all turned Liberal Democrat on 4 July. Truss\u2019s South West Norfolk seat and Uxbridge, Johnson\u2019s second parliamentary berth, went to Labour.</p> <p>The leadership candidates can hardly ignore their party\u2019s recent electoral rout, but they aren\u2019t confronting it with candour. They speak of defeat as a combination of accident, misunderstanding and moral retribution. In some versions it was a failure of organisational discipline \u2013 good policies poorly sold. In others it was a deserved punishment for deviations from ideological orthodoxy. Both explanations tend towards a single convenient diagnosis. The public craved proper Conservative government and the Conservative party disappointed them by offering something else.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked right but governed left,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/kemi-badenoch-says-conservatives-talked-right-but-governed-left-leadership-bid/\">Badenoch laments</a>. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the ideas that failed,\u201d insists Tugendhat. So while the election result might look from the outside like a massive rejection of all Tories and their works, from the inside it is read not as an instruction to change but an invitation to be the same, only more so.</p> <p>This is a familiar trap for beaten parties. The new leader is nominated from a shrunken pool of MPs and approved by a ballot of hardcore believers. The whole process militates against original thinking or confronting the membership with hard truths.</p> <p>Labour has been there enough times. Now it\u2019s the Tories\u2019 turn. Two additional factors tempt them away from an honest appraisal of their predicament.</p> <p>First, there is the perception that Keir Starmer\u2019s government is already floundering. The prime minister\u2019s personal ratings have tanked from a low base. He has failed to impose his own terms on political debate, leaving the public without a distinct sense of the new government\u2019s purpose or a national destination.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jul/04/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-in-full\">huge governing majority</a> has shallow foundations. The pattern of recent elections suggests immense underlying volatility. A modest swing could topple scores of Labour MPs, putting power within the reach of a competent opposition.</p> <p>That makes it easy for Tories to dream of a swift return to power by natural operation of political gravity. And there lies the second trap. The vacancy on offer in Birmingham this week is for a leader of the opposition, a thankless job at which most people fail after a few years spent lurching between crisis and irrelevance. Yet in Birmingham the candidates pose as potential prime ministers because that is the established idiom of the race.</p> <p>In each of the past four Tory leadership contests, the winner has moved straight into Downing Street. The last party leader who never made it to No 10 was Michael Howard, 20 years ago.</p> <p>There are sound historical reasons to see Conservative rule as the default setting of British democracy, punctuated by occasional public indulgence of Labour. That has been the pattern for the past 100 years. Predicting that events will follow long-established trends is often a safe bet, even in turbulent times. But not always.</p> <p>The election result that makes Labour\u2019s command of parliament look brittle doesn\u2019t suggest any hidden resilience in the Tory position. With even stronger coordination of tactical voting, and less public confidence that regime change was a foregone conclusion, the punishment beating might have been more thorough.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/01/prime-ministers-tory-leadership-ballot-conservative-politics\">Former PMs have a wealth of experience.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party has become a weak tribute act to itself. Candidates in a leadership contest belt out classic Tory tunes to an audience that only wants the oldies and knows the words by heart. Cut taxes; crack down on immigration; slash red tape to unleash enterprise \u2013 policy karaoke for wannabe prime ministers with no original material. Robert Jenrick, the candidate of the hard right, does cover versions of other people\u2019s campaign hits. He promises to \u201cget immigration done\u201d because it sounds like the Brexit slogan that worked for Boris Johnson in 2019. Jenrick was an acolyte of David Cameron when metropolitan liberalism was the available lubricant to his ambition. He voted remain in 2016. Now he makes bizarre claims that European human rights law is responsible for British special forces \u201ckilling rather than capturing\u201d terrorists. Tom Tugendhat, representing his party\u2019s One Nation caucus, trots through the famous Tory moderate dance routine: turn your back on the centre, tuck your principles down low, keep stepping to the right. As a former security minister and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tugendhat knows the damage that leaving the European court of human rights would do to Britain\u2019s international reputation. He boasts of his readiness to do it anyway. Flapping incoherently in the middle of the field is James Cleverly. He says it was unrealistic of Rishi Sunak to claim he could \u201cstop the boats\u201d. He also pledges to revive the Rwanda deportation scheme on which the boat-stopping boast was predicated (and that he reportedly once described as \u201cbatshit\u201d). And of course no Tory parade would be complete without a Margaret Thatcher impersonation. Enter Kemi Badenoch, comparing herself to the Iron Lady as the explanation for bad publicity over her claim that \u201cexcessive\u201d UK maternity pay has \u201cgone too far\u201d. Enemies of conservatism took the quote out of context, Badenoch complained. The same had happened to Thatcher when she told Woman\u2019s Own magazine there was \u201cno such thing as society\u201d. It is unlikely that Badenoch remembers that episode from 1987. She was seven at the time. But when you are playing to the Conservative crowd, there isn\u2019t much safe repertoire beyond the 1980s. There have been six Tory prime ministers since Thatcher. None provides a serviceable model for emulation. They are all either despised by the public or doctrinally unsound in the eyes of the party faithful. In a recent survey by Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory party chair, voters were asked to identify \u201cthe best Conservative leader of recent times\u201d. The overall winner was David Cameron on 27%, although 31% had no answer. Among those who voted Conservative in July, Boris Johnson was most popular, on 40%. Liz Truss, who told an audience on Monday that she would have performed better than Rishi Sunak in a general election, was rated best by just 1% of respondents. (Her average score was redeemed from zero by Reform UK voters, who rated Truss joint second-worst among former Tory leaders, alongside Theresa May, fractionally ahead of Sunak.) There is one measure on which Sunak beats all other Tory prime ministers of the 21st century. His was the only constituency that still has a Conservative MP. Witney, Maidenhead and Henley-on-Thames, formerly represented by Cameron, May and Johnson, all turned Liberal Democrat on 4 July. Truss\u2019s South West Norfolk seat and Uxbridge, Johnson\u2019s second parliamentary berth, went to Labour. The leadership candidates can hardly ignore their party\u2019s recent electoral rout, but they aren\u2019t confronting it with candour. They speak of defeat as a combination of accident, misunderstanding and moral retribution. In some versions it was a failure of organisational discipline \u2013 good policies poorly sold. In others it was a deserved punishment for deviations from ideological orthodoxy. Both explanations tend towards a single convenient diagnosis. The public craved proper Conservative government and the Conservative party disappointed them by offering something else. \u201cWe talked right but governed left,\u201d Badenoch laments. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the ideas that failed,\u201d insists Tugendhat. So while the election result might look from the outside like a massive rejection of all Tories and their works, from the inside it is read not as an instruction to change but an invitation to be the same, only more so. This is a familiar trap for beaten parties. The new leader is nominated from a shrunken pool of MPs and approved by a ballot of hardcore believers. The whole process militates against original thinking or confronting the membership with hard truths. Labour has been there enough times. Now it\u2019s the Tories\u2019 turn. Two additional factors tempt them away from an honest appraisal of their predicament. First, there is the perception that Keir Starmer\u2019s government is already floundering. The prime minister\u2019s personal ratings have tanked from a low base. He has failed to impose his own terms on political debate, leaving the public without a distinct sense of the new government\u2019s purpose or a national destination. The huge governing majority has shallow foundations. The pattern of recent elections suggests immense underlying volatility. A modest swing could topple scores of Labour MPs, putting power within the reach of a competent opposition. That makes it easy for Tories to dream of a swift return to power by natural operation of political gravity. And there lies the second trap. The vacancy on offer in Birmingham this week is for a leader of the opposition, a thankless job at which most people fail after a few years spent lurching between crisis and irrelevance. Yet in Birmingham the candidates pose as potential prime ministers because that is the established idiom of the race. In each of the past four Tory leadership contests, the winner has moved straight into Downing Street. The last party leader who never made it to No 10 was Michael Howard, 20 years ago. There are sound historical reasons to see Conservative rule as the default setting of British democracy, punctuated by occasional public indulgence of Labour. That has been the pattern for the past 100 years. Predicting that events will follow long-established trends is often a safe bet, even in turbulent times. But not always. The election result that makes Labour\u2019s command of parliament look brittle doesn\u2019t suggest any hidden resilience in the Tory position. With even stronger coordination of tactical voting, and less public confidence that regime change was a foregone conclusion, the punishment beating might have been more thorough. Some security was traditionally guaranteed by an electoral system that channels support to the two biggest parties, but that mechanism is also breaking down as the Greens and Reform join the Lib Dems in feasting on Labour and Tory vote shares. First past the post could start to produce some wild election results if four or five English parties are all polling in the teens and 20s. In Birmingham this week there has been much talk of reviving Conservatism as a mass movement. But the terrain where the leadership contenders imagine pitching their big tent has been partitioned by Labour, the Lib Dems and Reform. The Tories are not just out of power \u2013 they are in electoral banishment. They keep their spirits up by singing the old anthems and imagining that voters will send for them in due course, once Labour falters. But that is an article of faith and, where party loyalty is concerned, Britain is a nation of unbelievers. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

Over the course of the contest, the Republican, JD Vance, was as slick as a CEO\u2019s lawyer, emitting almost snake-oil salesman energy, while the Democrat, Tim Walz, was predictably folksy, exuding an overly talkative teddy bear vibe. But on substance, both men tended to agree on a number of points ranging from the need to fortify our border crossings (at the expense of <a href=\"https://www.refugeesinternational.org/statements-and-news/new-asylum-regulation-an-unacceptable-violation-of-u-s-responsibility-toward-people-fleeing-persecution/\">legitimate asylum seekers</a>) to promoting affordable housing to protecting the Affordable Care Act.</p> \n<p>Significant differences nevertheless did emerge, the most important of which was about reproductive health. While Walz spoke powerfully about the need to protect the right to abortion, Vance found ways to quietly blame immigrants for gun violence, border insecurity and the housing shortage.</p> \n<p>But the debate will be forgotten by next week, if only because the world is currently a powder keg, and no one seems ready to challenge these two candidates about finding a real path to peace, justice and security for all.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Ben Davis: \u2018Vance made extremist Trumpism sound moderate and reasonable\u2019</h2> \n<p>Vice-presidential debates rarely affect the election or move voters. Even by those standards, this one was a non-event. Vance and Walz seemed to be competing with each other regarding how friendly and agreeable they could be, and each avoided taking shots where they could have obviously landed. Vance was nimble, if smarmy, showing his background as a debater and a lawyer. Walz was nervous at the start but settled in once the questions got to areas he focuses on as governor, like housing and agriculture. </p> \n<p>One of the most notable aspects of the debate was the framing by the moderators, accepted dutifully by the candidates. It was taken as a given that Israel\u2019s wars on Gaza and Lebanon and its expansionist ambitions are morally just. It was taken as a given that the United States should have a bellicose foreign policy in the Middle East. It was taken as a given that immigrants are hurting the economy and spreading crime. The moderators even framed a question around the notion that building new housing could harm the economy. That these ideas are considered unbiased and non-partisan is an extremely bleak sign for the country\u2019s near future.</p> \n<p>The second notable thing is what Vance\u2019s positioning and rhetoric says about the Republican party. Vance saw his primary task as shaping Trump\u2019s often nonsensical and entirely personally motivated ideas into a coherent, explicable political program. But Vance went beyond explaining away Trump\u2019s comments, into introducing Trumpism as an full-scale ideology, and not just one explicated by the Claremont Institute and the Heritage Foundation and aimed at the dark corners of the internet.</p> \n<p>This project \u2013 nationalism, protectionism, welfare chauvinism and a sort of communitarian-sounding social conservatism \u2013 floundered two years ago with candidates like Blake Masters or Vance himself. Vance was able to maneuver it to sound almost moderate and reasonable. There was no talk of birth rates or skull shapes. Even his outrageous defense of Trump\u2019s attempted coup was couched in soft, compromise-oriented language. This is insidious, because in nearly every answer he gave, the core premise was still that white Americans are under attack by a nebulous other.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Lloyd Green: \u201890 minutes that won\u2019t move the needle\u2019</h2> \n<p>Walz and Vance clashed for 90 forgettable minutes. The debate likely won\u2019t move the needle but may leave Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both feeling vindicated in their selection of running mates. Vance channeled a smarter and more disciplined version of his would-be boss. He whitewashed January 6 and the absence of Mike Pence from the stage. Once upon a time, the senator from Ohio compared his running mate to Hitler \u2013 not anymore.</p> \n<p>Walz was clearest and most impassioned when it came to abortion and healthcare. On that score, he wisely framed abortion as a matter of personal autonomy, one between a woman and her physician. Vance couldn\u2019t run from the supreme court\u2019s decision in Dobbs. On election day, the end of Roe v Wade may cost the Republican party a win.</p> \n<p>When it came to healthcare, Trump\u2019s line on \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d won\u2019t die. Walz also reminded Vance that he once dinged the 45th president as unsuitable for office. Regardless, Vance\u2019s thumbnail biography probably appealed to blue-collar voters without four-year degrees. He also spun his mother\u2019s history of substance addiction into a story of upward arc and personal redemption. Betting markets pegged Vance as the winner of the evening.</p> \n<p>In the end, Walz and Vance delivered little material for late-night talk shows or SNL to spoof. Their debate was more about policies than personas. The race is a dead heat with about 35 days to go.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Arwa Mahdawi: \u2018Trump and Vance may have the last laugh\u2019</h2> \n<p>The night started off with a uranium-enriched bang, with the CBS moderators asking the candidates whether they would commit to a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. As an opening question, it speaks volumes about how war-mongering even \u201creasonable\u201d sections of American society are. Why not ask how the candidates would de-escalate the crisis? Why jump straight into baiting both candidates into endorsing a catastrophic nuclear war?</p> \n<p>Vance and Walz both did their best to avoid answering this question and rattled off their favorite talking points instead; Vance started waxing lyrical about his mother, who had a drug addiction. Trump, meanwhile, started going nuclear on Truth Social. \u201cBoth young ladies have been extremely biased Anchors!\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113235130024144763\">wrote</a> on his social network two minutes into the debate.</p> \n<p>While Trump was being his usual unhinged and sexist self, Vance was being surprisingly normal. On superficial optics alone, he was the clear winner of the night. There has (quite rightly) been a lot of emphasis on Vance\u2019s weird and incel-like viewpoints. Amid all that, one can forget how slick and polished he can be \u2013 and he certainly reminded us of that in this debate.</p> \n<p>Walz, on the other hand? Oh, dear. The media training the governor of Minnesota obviously had managed to train all the midwestern charm out of him. This wasn\u2019t the lovable and empathetic high school coach we have come to know. Walz got better later into the night \u2013 particularly when he pushed Vance on whether Trump lost the 2020 election, a question that Vance dodged \u2013 but he was largely robotic and charmless, a man out of his depth.</p> \n<p>Look, VP debates don\u2019t tend to have much impact on elections. But this was something of a wake-up call. The Trump-Vance campaign may seem like a joke but there is a very real chance they could have the last laugh in November.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Bhaskar Sunkara: \u2018Vance gave a slightly stronger performance\u2019</h2> \n<p>We\u2019ve come a long way from the libertarian 1990s, when both Bill Clinton\u2019s new Democrats and Bob Dole\u2019s Republican party were firm believers in free trade, couldn\u2019t care less about manufacturing jobs, and found bipartisan agreement on shrinking the welfare state.</p> \n<p>Instead, we just had a vice-presidential debate where both candidates brought up social-democratic Finland as a positive example; Walz declared himself a \u201cunion man\u201d; and Vance foregrounded the bread-and-butter concerns of millions of Americans. The candidates repeatedly went out of their way to identify areas of agreement on issues like housing and childcare.</p> \n<p>Of course, there was also a lot of bipartisanship <em>not </em>to like in the debate: war-mongering towards Iran, sycophantic support for Israel, the unwillingness of candidates to say that America is a nation of immigrants who create far more value for our nation than they take away.</p> \n<p>Still, both hopefuls were at their best talking about domestic issues. Vance spoke about the fraying American dream, economic anger and the loss of hope in many communities. But his solutions \u2013 industrial policy, manufacturing, domestic energy production \u2013 sounded close to the program Joe Biden embarked on in office. Vance praised the \u201cblue-collar Democrats\u201d who raised him \u2013 implying that Republicans are now the true party of the working class \u2013 but almost every Democrat stood with Biden\u2019s union-backed agenda, and almost no Republicans.</p> \n<p>The biggest problem for Vance, who overall gave a slightly stronger performance, with fewer stumbles than Walz, is he has to tie his ideas to the contradictions of Trump\u2019s economic program and his legacy of billionaire tax cuts. When Trump first ran for office, Vance hyperbolically called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. When Trump left office, Vance was closer to the mark, privately calling him a \u201cfake populist\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tying himself to a potential administration bound to offer nothing but deregulation, mismanagement, and handouts for the rich makes Vance that kind of populist, too.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Bhaskar Sunkara is the president of the Nation, founding editor of Jacobin and author of The Socialist Manifesto: The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequalities</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>LaTosha Brown: \u2018Vance was a chameleon\u2019</h2> \n<p>The debate underscored a stark contrast between Waltz and Vance. Walz played the role of \u201cthe coach\u201d, bringing receipts, sharing practical solutions and demonstrating real experience in addressing pressing issues. Walz showed that he knows how to govern \u2013 standing firmly with Kamala Harris\u2019s vision and focusing on delivering tangible benefits to everyday Americans. His grounded explanations and proven record painted him as a steady, trustworthy leader ready to solve problems, not just win arguments.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, JD Vance lived up to his reputation as a bit of a chameleon. He shifted positions throughout the debate to make himself more palatable. At one point, he flat-out lied about never supporting an abortion ban, a claim contradicted by his past actions. He refused to give a clear answer about who won the 2020 election and downplayed the January 6 insurrection as merely a protest. As Walz put it, Vance\u2019s response was a \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d.</p> \n<p>Vance appeared cut from the same cloth as Donald Trump \u2013 willing to say anything to win, regardless of the truth. The debate made clear that voters face a choice: between Walz, whose authenticity and steady leadership reflect readiness to govern, and Vance, whose evasiveness shows a fixation on power over principle.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>LaTosha Brown is the co-founder of Black Voters Matter</p></li> \n</ul>",

Trump, meanwhile, started going nuclear on Truth Social. \u201cBoth young ladies have been extremely biased Anchors!\u201d Trump wrote on his social network two minutes into the debate. While Trump was being his usual unhinged and sexist self, Vance was being surprisingly normal. On superficial optics alone, he was the clear winner of the night. There has (quite rightly) been a lot of emphasis on Vance\u2019s weird and incel-like viewpoints. Amid all that, one can forget how slick and polished he can be \u2013 and he certainly reminded us of that in this debate. Walz, on the other hand? Oh, dear. The media training the governor of Minnesota obviously had managed to train all the midwestern charm out of him. This wasn\u2019t the lovable and empathetic high school coach we have come to know. Walz got better later into the night \u2013 particularly when he pushed Vance on whether Trump lost the 2020 election, a question that Vance dodged \u2013 but he was largely robotic and charmless, a man out of his depth. Look, VP debates don\u2019t tend to have much impact on elections. But this was something of a wake-up call. The Trump-Vance campaign may seem like a joke but there is a very real chance they could have the last laugh in November. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Bhaskar Sunkara: \u2018Vance gave a slightly stronger performance\u2019 We\u2019ve come a long way from the libertarian 1990s, when both Bill Clinton\u2019s new Democrats and Bob Dole\u2019s Republican party were firm believers in free trade, couldn\u2019t care less about manufacturing jobs, and found bipartisan agreement on shrinking the welfare state. Instead, we just had a vice-presidential debate where both candidates brought up social-democratic Finland as a positive example; Walz declared himself a \u201cunion man\u201d; and Vance foregrounded the bread-and-butter concerns of millions of Americans. The candidates repeatedly went out of their way to identify areas of agreement on issues like housing and childcare. Of course, there was also a lot of bipartisanship not to like in the debate: war-mongering towards Iran, sycophantic support for Israel, the unwillingness of candidates to say that America is a nation of immigrants who create far more value for our nation than they take away. Still, both hopefuls were at their best talking about domestic issues. Vance spoke about the fraying American dream, economic anger and the loss of hope in many communities. But his solutions \u2013 industrial policy, manufacturing, domestic energy production \u2013 sounded close to the program Joe Biden embarked on in office. Vance praised the \u201cblue-collar Democrats\u201d who raised him \u2013 implying that Republicans are now the true party of the working class \u2013 but almost every Democrat stood with Biden\u2019s union-backed agenda, and almost no Republicans. The biggest problem for Vance, who overall gave a slightly stronger performance, with fewer stumbles than Walz, is he has to tie his ideas to the contradictions of Trump\u2019s economic program and his legacy of billionaire tax cuts. When Trump first ran for office, Vance hyperbolically called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. When Trump left office, Vance was closer to the mark, privately calling him a \u201cfake populist\u201d. Tying himself to a potential administration bound to offer nothing but deregulation, mismanagement, and handouts for the rich makes Vance that kind of populist, too. Bhaskar Sunkara is the president of the Nation, founding editor of Jacobin and author of The Socialist Manifesto: The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequalities LaTosha Brown: \u2018Vance was a chameleon\u2019 The debate underscored a stark contrast between Waltz and Vance. Walz played the role of \u201cthe coach\u201d, bringing receipts, sharing practical solutions and demonstrating real experience in addressing pressing issues. Walz showed that he knows how to govern \u2013 standing firmly with Kamala Harris\u2019s vision and focusing on delivering tangible benefits to everyday Americans. His grounded explanations and proven record painted him as a steady, trustworthy leader ready to solve problems, not just win arguments. On the other hand, JD Vance lived up to his reputation as a bit of a chameleon. He shifted positions throughout the debate to make himself more palatable. At one point, he flat-out lied about never supporting an abortion ban, a claim contradicted by his past actions. He refused to give a clear answer about who won the 2020 election and downplayed the January 6 insurrection as merely a protest. As Walz put it, Vance\u2019s response was a \u201cdamning non-answer\u201d. Vance appeared cut from the same cloth as Donald Trump \u2013 willing to say anything to win, regardless of the truth. The debate made clear that voters face a choice: between Walz, whose authenticity and steady leadership reflect readiness to govern, and Vance, whose evasiveness shows a fixation on power over principle.

      "bodyText": "Israel has vowed to retaliate after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at targets across Israel in a dramatic intensification of a conflict that appeared to be escalating out of control. \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his security cabinet late on Tuesday. \u201cThe regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies \u2026 They will understand.\u201d The unprecedented Iranian salvo of more than 180 ballistic missiles came less than 24 hours after the Israeli prime minister ordered the largest ground incursion into southern Lebanon in a generation. Guardian reporters in Jerusalem witnessed dozens of missiles flying overhead towards Israel\u2019s main coastal cities in a huge attack just after 7.30pm, with the engines of the rockets clearly visible from below. Air sirens sounded across Israel as the missiles, many of them intercepted by Israeli air defenses, streaked across the night sky in trails of red and gold. Other missiles, still intact, appeared to continue on towards the coast and central Israel to the sound of distant explosions. In the early hours of Wednesday, at least five Israeli strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, after the Israeli military issued multiple evacuation orders for buildings in the city, saying it was targeting Hezbollah sites. Minutes before Iran began the strike, at least two gunmen in the Israeli seaside city of Jaffa launched an attack that killed six and wounded 10, including an IDF soldier, sowing further concerns that the rising cycle of violence could lead to terror attacks inside Israel. Israel\u2019s military said it was not aware of any injuries from the missile attacks, but the Palestinian civil defence authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said a man was killed near Jericho and falling rocket debris had caused damage and started fires in the area. Iran said it launched the missiles toward three Israeli military bases as retaliation for a series of Israeli strikes in Lebanon against its proxy Hezbollah that has devastated the southern suburbs of Beirut, the capital, as well as villages in the country\u2019s south. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed by an Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday, dealing a heavy blow to the militant group. Iran\u2019s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, hailed the attack as \u201ca decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime\u201d, adding: \u201cLet Netanyahu know that Iran is not a belligerent, but it stands firmly against any threat \u2026 Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.\u201d The order to launch missiles at Israel was made by the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, senior Iranian officials told Reuters. Late on Tuesday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran\u2019s action was \u201cconcluded unless Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation\u201d. In a statement on X, he said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s enablers now have a heightened responsibility to rein in the warmongers in Tel Aviv instead of getting involved in their folly.\u201d Diplomatic efforts to contain the conflict were unravelling quickly as the tit-for-tat attacks threatened to set the Middle East alight less than one week after the US and France announced an effort to broker a 21-day ceasefire between the two sides. World leaders called for restraint, with the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, condemning \u201cescalation after escalation\u201d in the region. \u201cThis must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire,\u201d he said. Emmanuel Macron condemned Iran\u2019s attack and said France mobilised its \u201cmilitary resources in the Middle East to counter the Iranian threat\u201d. France\u2019s president also called on Israel to end its military operations in Lebanon \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the Iranian attack as serious and vowed to retaliate. The US also warned that Iran would face consequences for launching the strike, raising the spectre of a direct confrontation between Tehran and Washington. \u201cWe are on high alert both defensively and offensively,\u201d the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a broadcast statement before the attacks. \u201cThis attack will have consequences. We have plans, and we will operate at the place and time we decide.\u201d US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took down multiple missiles launched by Iran, US defence officials said. Those there include the USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole and USS Bulkeley. Additional destroyers are in the Red Sea. On the edge of the Old City, many stopped to watch the missiles flying overhead in what appears to have been an unprecedented attack, as explosions thudded in the distance at a staccato pitch. Millions of Israelis were told to take shelter as the country closed its airspace to civilian aircraft. Orli Mircus, 56, a social worker and a psychotherapist from Tel Aviv, said she had witnessed the attacks and felt \u201cfear \u2026 a lot of fear, mainly with the explosions over our heads\u201d. \u201cAt that moment I wanted to know where were our beloved ones were,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking, I was so afraid.\u201d \u201cI am worried about what will come, I am worried about Israel\u2019s reaction to the attack, who logically wants to defend itself and that will bring another reaction, possible not only from Iran,\u201d she said. Israeli media, citing the military, said the country\u2019s air force would continue conducting \u201cpowerful strikes\u201d throughout the Middle East on Tuesday evening. Already this week, Israel had launched strikes in three countries: Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. The White House earlier warned it had indications that Iran was preparing to \u201cimminently\u201d launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel. The state department later said there had been no warning from Tehran, although some reports suggested the Iranians had told the Russians what they were planning. \u201cWe are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack,\u201d a senior official said in a statement, warning that such an action \u201cwill carry severe consequences for Iran\u201d. What those consequences could be remain unclear. Oil prices shot up 5% on the news of the Iranian missile strikes, which raise the prospect of a wider war between the two arch enemies. The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, who was on the phone with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, when the barrage of missiles began on Tuesday, condemned the Iranian attack. Downing Street said he reiterated to Netanyahu the UK\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security and the protection of civilians, but emphasised the importance of seeking ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, said that British forces \u201cplayed their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East\u201d. On Monday Israel began a ground incursion into southern Lebanon, which it has called operation northern arrow, with a barrage of shelling across the border. The ground incursion marks the first time Israeli troops have launched sustained operations in Lebanon since 2006, when the two countries signed a peace deal that ended a 34-day war between Israel and the Shia militia Hezbollah, which dominates large swaths of southern Lebanon. In the first concrete demands since the military launched its incursion, Israeli officials on Monday ordered the residents of about 30 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate. An Israeli military spokesperson told people to evacuate to north of the Awali River, nearly 35 miles (55km) from the blue line between the two countries, as the IDF targeted what it called Hezbollah \u201cattack infrastructure\u201d along the UN boundary. The Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, met UN officials on Tuesday and said it was \u201cone of the most dangerous stages in [Lebanon\u2019s] history\u201d. He claimed that \u201cabout 1 million of our people have been displaced due to the devastating war waged by Israel on Lebanon\u201d. US officials have voiced cautious support for the operation, with the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, agreeing with the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, \u201con the necessity of dismantling [Hezbollah\u2019s] attack infrastructure along the border\u201d. The Israeli offensive has followed a number of Israeli successes against Hezbollah that appear to have emboldened Netanyahu to move against the Iran-backed organisation despite considerable diplomatic efforts to avert an escalation in the war. Nasrallah\u2019s death followed two weeks of strikes that began with the explosion of pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members that killed dozens of people and injured thousands more. Israel has since continued to pound Beirut and has also launched strikes on Yemen and Syria, saying it was launching attacks against Iranian-backed militias across the Middle East.

Politically speaking, the <strong>Biden</strong> administration cannot be seen as tying <strong>Israel\u2019s</strong> hands in the face of an <strong>Iranian</strong> attack on Israeli cities. The Iranian regime (the <strong>IRGC</strong> in particular) is feeling the pressure to show its regional proxies and allies, from <strong>Hezbollah</strong> to the <strong>Houthis</strong> in <strong>Yemen</strong>, that it is not a weakling but a regional power of substance, the leader of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, meanwhile, has a freer hand. With Iranian missiles over <strong>Tel Aviv</strong>, it is far harder for <strong>Washington</strong> to try to influence his actions, and much tougher for the prime minister\u2019s opponents to call for his ousting.</p> \n  <p>Today, Netanyahu is also significantly closer to his longstanding ambition: to involve the US in a war on Iran which will destroy its nuclear programme, now close to the capacity to make a weapon after the collapse of the 2015 multilateral agreement, the <strong>JCPOA</strong>, which kept the programme within limits.</p> \n  <p>In such dangerous times, the region has historically looked to Washington to contain and reverse the logic of escalation. But the man currently inhabiting the <strong>Oval Office</strong> is a lame duck president who has been ignored to the point of humiliation in recent months by the US\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East.</p> \n  <p>There have long been voices in the <strong>US</strong> defence establishment calling for the US to act preemptively against the Iranian nuclear programme. Those will now increase in an effort to influence a president who has vowed to defend Israel against the Iranian threat.</p> \n  <p>Biden\u2019s administration has generally been cautious when it comes to military ventures abroad, and Kamala Harris is expected to follow a similar path, with less of a sentimental attachment to Israel.

Meanwhile in <strong>Gaza</strong>, the humanitarian situation has eroded further. With little to no infrastructure available to support the displaced population, disease is rampant and civilians are living in the most catastrophic conditions. There is little political incentive for <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> to let up, as the assassination of the Hezbollah leader <strong>Hassan Nasrallah</strong> has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. Israel has shown no intention of relenting.</p> \n  <p>At this point, there is too much uncertainty to predict the long term impact of the assassination of Nasrallah on Hezbollah but in the short term \u201cit\u2019s a really devastating blow\u201d, Jason says. \u201cNot only have they lost a charismatic and popular leader \u2013 among his supporters at least \u2013 [but] Nasrallah was also competent and effective. You don\u2019t get to stay at the top of a group like that for 32 years without being good at what you do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>As expected, the Shia militia group has sworn to enact revenge attacks but, as of yet, it appears to have been unable to retaliate in any serious way. \u201cEven though Israeli air defences are very effective, it\u2019s been said for a long time that Hezbollah, which has massive stocks of rockets and missiles, would be able to overwhelm those defences and cause significant casualties and destruction in much of northern and central Israel but so far, they\u2019ve not been able to do anything much,\u201d Jason says.</p> \n  <p>This hesitation perhaps is borne of an awareness that Israel\u2019s response to such an attack is likely to be equally if not more devastating. \u201cHezbollah is a state within a state and primarily acts in its own interests, or those of its sponsor, Iran. But whatever happens the consequences for Lebanon are going to be very tough indeed.</p> \n  <p><strong>You can read more of Jason Burke\u2019s analysis in the First Edition newsletter: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/first-edition-israel-lebanon-hezbollah\">Tuesday briefing \u2013 What we know so far about Israel\u2019s overnight \u2018ground operation\u2019 in Lebanon</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/first-edition-israel-lebanon-hezbollah\">Tuesday briefing: What we know so far about Israel\u2019s overnight \u2018ground operation\u2019 in Lebanon</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email\">Sign up here for our free daily newsletter, First Edition</a></em></p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-66fb8c718f0894769732d4ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-10-01T06:08:31.961Z\">7.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A suspected attack by <strong>Yemen\u2019s</strong> <strong>Houthi</strong> rebels targeted a ship in the <strong>Red Sea</strong>, likely marking their first assault on commercial shipping in weeks, the Associated Press reported.</p> \n  <p>The attack Tuesday morning took place off the port city of <strong>Hodeida</strong> in the Red Sea, which has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships travelling through the waterway.</p> \n  <p>A captain on a ship saw four \u201csplashes\u201d near his vessel, the British military\u2019s <strong>United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations</strong> centre said in a warning.

      "bodyText": "This live blog is closing shortly, but our live coverage of the events in the Middle East will continue here. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand as the region wakes up: Israel launched strikes across Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the early hours of Wednesday, with the Israeli military issuing multiple evacuation orders for buildings in Beirut, saying it was targeting Hezbollah sites. The strikes came hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at targets across Israel, in a dramatic intensification of a conflict that some fear could escalate into a regional war. Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his security cabinet that \u201cIran made a big mistake tonight \u2013 and it will pay for it.\u201d The Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, spoke on television reacting to what the country called the \u201cserious attack\u201d on Israel by Iran today. Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), pledged that the attack \u201cwill have consequences\u201d. He added that the country remained on high alert. There continues to be very little information about how much damage Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel caused. In its attack on Tuesday, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles, Israel\u2019s government said. No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. Images show missiles fallen in Ramallah, in the West Bank. Late on Tuesday, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran\u2019s action was \u201cconcluded unless Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation\u201d. In a statement on X, he said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s enablers now have a heightened responsibility to rein in the warmongers in Tel Aviv instead of getting involved in their folly.\u201d Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, gave the order to launch missiles at Israel, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that Tehran \u201cis fully ready for any retaliation\u201d. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission to the United Nations has defended the country\u2019s missile launches against Israel today, calling it a response to \u201cterrorist acts\u201d by Israel. US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took down multiple missiles launched by Iran, US defence officials said. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, said that British forces \u201cplayed their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East\u201d. Six people were killed and 10 wounded in a shooting and knife attack on the Israeli seaside city of Jaffa that occurred minutes before Iran launched its attack. Five of the wounded were described as being in a serious condition. CCTV footage showed two men, reportedly armed with an assault rifle and a knife, dressed in black emerging from a train near the light-rail stop along Jerusalem Boulevard where they opened fire on passersby as well as on a second nearby street. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said he spoke with the Israeli minister of defence, Yoav Gallant, telling him that the attack from Iran was an \u201coutrageous act of aggression\u201d. The Minister and I expressed mutual appreciation for the coordinated defense of Israel against nearly 200 ballistic missiles launched by Iran and committed to remain in close contact. It\u2019s 6.30am in Beirut. Live footage being broadcast by Reuters shows smoke continuing to hang over the Lebanese capital. Overnight Israel launched at least five strikes on the city\u2019s southern suburbs, with reports of fires breaking out in several locations. It\u2019s currently unclear if there were any casualties as a result of Wednesday morning\u2019s attack, but according to the Lebanese health ministry, at least 55 people were killed across the country on Tuesday. The IDF has announced that a soldier was seriously injured in Tuesday\u2019s shooting and knife attack on the Israeli city of Jaffa. The wounded soldier was evacuated to receive medical treatment at a hospital and her family was informed. Six people were killed and 10 wounded in the attack on the Israeli seaside city of Jaffa that occurred minutes before Iran launched its huge missile attack. Five of the wounded were described as being in a serious condition. It was unclear whether the Israeli soldier was among the numbers. Air defence alerts have been activated in Misgav Am, a town in Israel\u2019s north that sits right on the border with Lebanon. Flydubai said it has cancelled flights to Jordan, Iraq, Israel and Iran on 2-3 October. In a statement to Reuters, the airline said the cancellations were due to the temporary closure of a number of airspaces. Japan\u2019s new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has called the missile attacks by Iran on Israel \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Iran\u2019s attack is unacceptable. We will condemn this strongly. But at the same time, we would like to cooperate to defuse the situation and prevent it from escalating into a full-on war.\u201d As we just reported, the scale of the damage on Israel after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack remains unclear. No injuries have been reported in Israel, but one person was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. There are however multiple images of craters in central and southern Israel. PBS foreign affairs and defense correspondent, Nick Schifrin posted this report from close to the Mossad headquarters on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, showing a large crater. There continues to be very little information about how much damage Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel caused. In its attack on Tuesday, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles, Israel\u2019s government said. Some of the missile fired by Iran were hypersonic Fattah missiles, with a maximum speed estimated at 10,000mph. According to the Revolutionary Guards, 90% of its missiles successfully hit their targets. Israel however says most missiles were intercepted by its air defence and that statement appears to be backed up by comments from the UK and US who played a role in Israel\u2019s defence. Images from central Israel show officials inspecting an impact crater. No injuries were reported in Israel, but one man was killed in the occupied West Bank, authorities there said. Images show missiles fallen in Ramallah, in the West Bank. The IDF\u2019s Daniel Hagari said there were \u201ca small number\u201d of hits. The Israeli military published video of a school in the central city of Gadera that was heavily damaged by an Iranian missile. In Hebron in the West Bank, a fallen projectile was moved to the centre of a square where people posed for pictures with it. The forces of restraint in the Middle East are weakening with every passing day. Politically speaking, the Biden administration cannot be seen as tying Israel\u2019s hands in the face of an Iranian attack on Israeli cities. The Iranian regime (the IRGC in particular) is feeling the pressure to show its regional proxies and allies, from Hezbollah to the Houthis in Yemen, that it is not a weakling but a regional power of substance, the leader of the \u201caxis of resistance\u201d. Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, has a freer hand. With Iranian missiles over Tel Aviv, it is far harder for Washington to try to influence his actions, and much tougher for the prime minister\u2019s opponents to call for his ousting. Today, Netanyahu is also significantly closer to his longstanding ambition: to involve the US in a war on Iran which will destroy its nuclear programme, now close to the capacity to make a weapon after the collapse of the 2015 multilateral agreement, the JCPOA, which kept the programme within limits. In such dangerous times, the region has historically looked to Washington to contain and reverse the logic of escalation. But the man currently inhabiting the Oval Office is a lame duck president who has been ignored to the point of humiliation in recent months by the US\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East. There have long been voices in the US defence establishment calling for the US to act preemptively against the Iranian nuclear programme. Those will now increase in an effort to influence a president who has vowed to defend Israel against the Iranian threat. Biden\u2019s administration has generally been cautious when it comes to military ventures abroad, and Kamala Harris is expected to follow a similar path, with less of a sentimental attachment to Israel. But the escalating violence in the Middle East will damage her chances of succeeding Biden in the White House, and bring closer the prospect of the return of the greatest wild card of all, Donald Trump. In the United States, vice-presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance are facing off in the first VP debate of this election. The first question was about the current issues in the Middle East; both candidates were asked whether they would support or oppose a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Walz said Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself is \u201cabsolutely fundamental\u201d and said \u201csteady leadership\u201d is fundamental. Walz noted that Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the president was \u201cthe most flawed human being he\u2019d ever met\u201d and that Trump\u2019s secretaries of defence and his national security advisers \u201csaid he should be nowhere near the White House\u201d. For his part, Vance said Donald Trump \u201cconsistently made the world more secure\u201d and that Trump, as president, recognised that \u201cyou needed peace through strength\u201d. Vance said that it is up to Israel to do what they need to do to keep their country safe, adding \u201cwe should support our allies wherever they are when they\u2019re fighting the bad guys.\u201d You can follow the debate live here. Emmanuel Macron has condemned Iran\u2019s attack on Israel and said France mobilised its \u201cmilitary resources in the Middle East to counter the Iranian threat.\u201d France\u2019s president also called on Israel to end its military operations in Lebanon \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d In a statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Macron said too many civilians were already victims and that \u201cLebanon\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d should be restored. The Head of State also reiterated France\u2019s demand that Hezbollah cease its terrorist actions against Israel and its population.\u201d The \u00c9lys\u00e9e said France would soon organise a conference in \u201csupport of the Lebanese people and their institutions.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, will lead the Friday prayer in Tehran this week and deliver a sermon that is expected to set the tone for Iran\u2019s strategy against Israel, New York Times journalist Farnaz Fassihi has reported. Fassihi notes that Khamenei only does this \u201cunder extraordinary circumstances\u201d. Crude futures rose 1.56% on fears of oil supply disruptions in the Middle East. Brent gained 2.6%. Iran, a member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (Opec), is a major oil producer in the region. \u201cThe direct involvement of Iran, an OPEC member, raises the prospect of disruptions to oil supplies,\u201d ANZ Research said in a note, referring to the conflict. At least five Israeli strikes hit Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in the early hours of Wednesday, a Lebanese security source told the AFP news agency. The Israeli military has issued multiple evacuation orders for buildings in the city, saying it is targeting Hezbollah sites. In the last few minutes it issue a new evacuation order for a building in the Hadath al-Gharb neighbourhood. Reuters and AFP correspondents reported multiple explosions and smoke rising in at least one area while a fire appeared to burn. Israel has repeatedly bombarded Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs since last week. Lebanon said on Tuesday that almost 240,000 people, mostly Syrians, have crossed to Syria since Israel began hitting the country last week with intense air strikes. Lebanese authorities registered \u201cthe crossing of 176,080 Syrian citizens and 63,373 Lebanese citizens into Syrian territory\u201d from 23 September, a report from the country\u2019s disaster management unit said. Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d and should be condemned by the entire world, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said. \u201cInitial reports suggest that Israel, with the active support of the United States and other partners, effectively defeated this attack,\u201d Blinken told reporters. S&amp;P Global has downgraded Israel\u2019s long-term ratings to \u201cA\u201d from \u201cA+\u201d, citing risks to the country\u2019s economy and public finances from the escalating conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon. The rating agency highlighted concerns over potential security threats, including retaliatory rocket attacks against Israel, which could worsen the economic impact. We now consider that military activity in Gaza and an upsurge in fighting across Israel\u2018s northern border - including a ground incursion into Lebanon - could persist into 2025, with risks of retaliation against Israel.\u201d It comes after fellow ratings agency Moody\u2019s cut the country\u2019s credit rating two notches to \u201cBaa1\u201d last week and warned of a drop to \u2018junk\u2019 if the current heightened tensions with Hezbollah turned into a full-scale conflict. The Israeli military has issued more warnings to residents in Beirut \u2013 this time aimed at the Shiyah and Hadath Gharb neighbourhoods. An IDF spokesperson said residents in a specific building should evacuate. The IDF has now urged evacuations at five locations, including Hadath Beirut, Haret Hreik and Choueifat Al-Omrousieh. The Israeli military continues to attack Beirut, with media reporting fires at several locations. Reuters journalist, Timour Azhari, posted the below image of strikes on Beirut just a few minutes ago, As the Israeli military continues to attack Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry has issued a new updated on the number of casualties across the country on Tuesday. Fifty-five people were killed and 156 wounded in Israeli attacks across Lebanon on Tuesday, the health ministry said in a statement. Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, most in the past two weeks, according to Lebanese government statistics. The Israeli military has issued another warning to residents in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2013 the third such warning in the last hour. An IDF spokesperson said residents in a specific building in the Hadath Beirut neighbourhood should evacuate. You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, against which the IDF will operate in the near future. For your safety and the safety of your family members, you must evacuate this building and the surrounding buildings immediately and stay away from them for a distance of no less than 500 meters.\u201d The IDF has said it is currently attack Beirut. Previously it issued warnings for the Haret Hreik and Choueifat Al-Omrousieh neighbourhoods. Defence secretary Lloyd Austin has said the US is determined \u201cto defend Israel from Iranian aggression.\u201d In a statement online, Austin said he had spoken with French defence minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu \u201cto continue the close coordination between our countries on the evolving situation in the Middle East.\u201d The United States remains committed to pushing for a diplomatic solution, avoiding further expansion of the conflict, and to protecting our personnel and facilities in the region.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister has reportedly held calls with the foreign ministers of the UK, Germany, France and a number of other countries. Abas Aslani, senior research fellow at the center for Middle East strategic studies said that Seyed Abbas Araghchi told his counterparts that \u201cafter two months of restraint, Iran targeted only military and security sites\u201d in Israel. The Israeli military has issued another warning to residents in the southern suburbs of Beirut. An IDF spokesperson warned residents of a building in the Choueifat Al-Omrousieh neighbourhood to evacuate. It comes soon after the military issued a call for residents in buildings in Haret Hreik to evacuate. Iran\u2019s president has issued a statement on this evening\u2019s attack on Israel. Masoud Pezeshkian warned Israel not to enter into a conflict with Iran and described the attack as \u201conly a corner of our power\u201d. This action was in defense of the interests and citizens of Iran. Let Netanyahu know that Iran is not a belligerent, but it stands firmly against any threat.\u201d Israel\u2019s military has said it is \u201cattacking terrorist targets in Beirut\u201d. A Lebanese security source told the AFP news agency that Israeli strikes were hitting the city\u2019s southern suburbs, after the Israeli military issued a new call for residents of parts of the area to evacuate. AFP correspondents heard the sound of an explosion from the area, which Israel has struck repeatedly since last week. Reuters is reporting that explosions are being heard in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Arabic media is also reporting strikes in the city\u2019s south. Earlier, the IDF warned residents in the Haret Hreik neighbourhood to evacuate, saying the Israeli military would shortly \u201cact forcefully\u201d in the area. Israel\u2019s home front command says it has eased restrictions on large gatherings in much of Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Earlier, authorities issued directives limiting gatherings to limits of 30 people in an open area and up to 300 people in closed spaces. Offices and educational spaces could only be held in places near protected areas in case of an alert. IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee has urged residents in buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, \u201cspecifically in the Haret Hreik neighborhood\u201d to evacuate. Urgent warning to the residents of the southern suburb, specifically in the Haret Hreik neighborhood, in the buildings specified in the two maps and the buildings adjacent to them. You are located near dangerous Hezbollah installations that the IDF will act forcefully against in the near future.\u201d UK defence secretary John Healey has said the British forces \u201cplayed their part in attempts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East\u201d this evening. In a statement on X, Healey condemned Iran\u2019s attack on Israel and said the UK stood \u201cfully behind Israel\u2019s right to defend its country and its people against threats.\u201d I want to thank all British personnel involved in the operation for their courage and professionalism.\u201d Seyed Abbas Araghchi, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, put out a statement via X in the last hour that the country\u2019s latest military action against Israel, a barrage of missiles fired at the state, is over. \u201cOur action is concluded unless Israeli regime decides to invite further retaliation. In that scenario, our response will be stronger and more powerful,\u201d he posted. It appeared to be an attempt to draw a line under the military offensive today, which Iran said was in retaliation for Israel\u2019s recent attacks on its proxies around Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, which killed leaders of each organization. There is also a plea for Israel\u2019s allies to put pressure on the Jewish state to deescalate in the region. \u201cIsrael\u2019s enablers now have a heightened responsibility to rein in the warmongers in Tel Aviv instead of getting involved in their folly,\u201d he posted. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards threatened Tuesday to carry out \u201ccrushing attacks\u201d against Israel if it retaliated for an Iranian missile attack. If the Zionist regime reacts to Iranian operations, it will face crushing attacks,\u201d the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement carried by the Fars news agency, AFP reports. The IRGC said Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel earlier in the day was \u201cin accordance with the United Nations Charter\u201d. It said the missile attack came \u201cafter a period of restraint\u201d following an \u201cattack on the sovereignty\u201d of Iran \u2013 a reference to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July. The IRGC said the missile attacks targeted \u201cthree military bases\u201d around Tel Aviv as well as air and radar bases, adding that \u201c90 percent\u201d of the missiles \u201chit their targets\u201d. There are few externally verified details on the full impact of Iran\u2019s unleashing almost 200 missiles on Israel earlier, most of which appeared to have been intercepted, with Israel reporting \u201cno injuries\u201d. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has now spoken out on the missile attack on Israel by Iran a little earlier on Tuesday. Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it. Whoever attacks us, we attack them,\u201d he said, as he gathered his security cabinet for a meeting late Tuesday. The Israeli military says it has received no reports of injuries from the Iranian missile attack. The military\u2019s spokesperson, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, said the country\u2019s air defenses intercepted many of the incoming missiles, though some landed in central and southern Israel. This strike will have consequences,\u201d he said. He urged the public to continue to listen to public-safety guidelines from the army. Kamala Harris, the US vice-president and Democratic nominee for president in this November\u2019s election, rather unexpectedly popped up in Washington DC moments ago to say that she \u201cfully supports\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s order to the US military earlier to take part in the shooting down of Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel. Harris said: We are still assessing the impact but initial indications are that Israel, with our assistance, was able to defeat this attack [by Iran]. I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran.\u201d Harris was in the situation room at the White House with the US president earlier on Tuesday when they were briefed on what was going on in Israel, as Iran launched a barrage of missiles at it, the vast majority of which, according to reports from Israel, were intercepted in the sky above the country and did not injure anyone on the ground. Harris added that: We will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our interests against Iran.\u201d Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the US was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of Israel after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attacks, describing Tehran\u2019s assault as \u201cdefeated and ineffective\u201d. The US president said he would now discuss with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how to respond to Iran, but that it remained to be seen what shape that response would take. The attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective, and this is a testament to Israeli military capability and the US military. Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel,\u201d Biden told reporters at the White House. Asked by reporters what the response towards Iran would be, Biden replied: That\u2019s in active discussion right now. That remains to be seen.\u201d Biden indicated he would be talking to Netanyahu in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s developments. The Agence France-Presse (AFP) has some background on Israel\u2019s so-called Iron Dome, its anti-missile shield. The Iron Dome air defence system has intercepted thousands of rockets since it went into operation in 2011, providing the country with crucial cover during times of conflict, the agency writes. It has been heavily relied upon to protect military and civilian sites from frequent barrages of rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Israel\u2019s air defences were in operation on Tuesday night, when Iran fired missiles at Israel in what it said was a response to Israel\u2019s killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders. Herzi Halevi, Israel\u2019s military chief, said Tuesday that the Iranian barrage had been blunted partly by \u201ca very strong aerial defence array\u201d. Israel initially developed the Iron Dome alone after the 2006 Lebanon war and was later joined by the United States, which has provided funds and know-how. Iranian state television, long controlled by hard-liners, has aired images of people in Arak, Qom and Tehran celebrating Iran\u2019s missile attack in Israel. The Associated Press reported that some shouted slogans: God is great! Death to America. Death to Israel.\u201d However, Iran\u2019s support of regional militias abroad has been a point of anger domestically during protests, as the country suffers under international sanctions. The United States has now called on every nation in the world to join it in condemning Iran\u2019s salvo of ballistic missiles against Israel earlier today. The US state department called the assault brazen and unacceptable. Matthew Miller, the state department\u2019s spokesperson, was talking a little earlier. This statement has been swiftly and enthusiastically reported by Israeli media. British prime minister Keir Starmer said Israel had the right to defend itself and said Iran \u201cmust stop these attacks\u201d. Iranian state TV reported earlier that in today\u2019s attack, the Iranian military used Fattah hypersonic missiles on Israel for the first time. It appears that Israeli defenses, aided by the US, largely intercepted today\u2019s rockets before they could do significant damage or injure anyone on the ground, as Israelis sheltered amid the wailing of air raid sirens. The Tasnim News Agency, which is associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, posted a little earlier on reports of Iran using Fattah missiles in its assault on Israel today. The US Department of Defense said that in its assessment, Iran intended to inflict on Israel with its missile attack earlier today and that the barrage of missiles was about \u201ctwice the scope\u201d of the Islamic Republic\u2019s attack on the Jewish state back in April of this year. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have calculated that about 180 ballistic missiles were launched from Iran at Israel today. Back on 14 April, Iran had launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel on a Saturday night in its first ever direct attack on the Israeli state. But it seems as though the weapons fired by Iran today made the overall barrage significantly more powerful than the spring attack. In April, Tehran said it was responding to a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on 1 April that killed a senior figure in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and eight other officers. The US Department of Defense says US navy destroyers positioned in the Middle East region fired about a dozen interceptor weapons against the barrage of missiles that were fired from Iran into Israel earlier today. Pentagon spokesperson Maj Gen Patrick Ryder told reporters that no other US military assets were used to shoot down the missiles, which were all fired from inside Iran, Reuters reports. An unnamed US official had earlier said that the US would support Israel in its defensive capabilities against any incoming rockets, just prior to Iran launching missiles against the Jewish state. The Pentagon also said it was not aware of any warning by Iran prior to the missile barrage earlier, signaling, perhaps, that prior apparent knowledge of an \u201cimminent attack\u201d came from US/allied intelligence. It called Iran\u2019s attack on Israel \u201csignificant\u201d. The United States national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Tuesday that Iran\u2019s attack on Israel appeared to have been defeated, although Biden\u2019s administration was still monitoring a \u201cfluid\u201d situation. Sullivan said the administration was tracking the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in the West Bank, Reuters reports. Sullivan was talking at the daily media briefing at the White House in Washington DC. Hamas has praised the Iranian missile strikes on Israel that Iran said were launched to avenge the deaths of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and Iranian Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan. We congratulate the heroic rocket launch carried out by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran, on large areas of our occupied territories, in response to the occupation\u2019s continuing crimes against the peoples of the region, and in retaliation for the blood of our nation\u2019s heroic martyrs,\u201d the Hamas statement said, Reuters reported. Hamas, the Islamic political and military group, controls the besieged Palestinian territory of Gaza. Britain \u201ccompletely condemns\u201d Iran\u2019s actions after it fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel. Keir Starmer\u2019s office said the prime minister called for de-escalation across the region. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister spoke to Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon, and they discussed the escalating situation across the Middle East. \u201cThe prime minister condemned Iran\u2019s attack on Israel today in the strongest terms, which began during the leaders\u2019 conversation, and expressed the UK\u2019s steadfast commitment to Israeli security and the protection of civilians. \u201cDuring the call, the prime minister also underlined the importance of a ceasefire in Lebanon to allow space for a political solution in line with UNSC Resolution 1701.\u201d The spokesperson added Starmer \u201calso raised the situation in Gaza and the importance of a ceasefire and action to bring home the hostages\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s video editors have footage from the ground in Tel Aviv showing the moment missiles caused huge explosions and damage to a restaurant on the coast: Iran has cancelled all flights until 10am local time on Wednesday, Reuters reports. The latest update came after Iran\u2019s civil aviation authority earlier said all flight routes were being changed. Kuwait\u2019s state news agency said earlier all flights were being rerouted due to the \u201ccurrent situation\u201d. The Israel Defense Forces said about 180 missiles were fired from Iran towards Israel, the BBC reports. A security official said most of the missiles were intercepted by the Israeli air force. Where missiles made impact, the military is assessing the damage. An IDF official also reportedly said Israel was going to continue strikes across the Middle East: The Israeli military has said it killed the commander of the Imam Hussein division, a Hezbollah-linked group based in Syria, in Beirut. Israel\u2019s air force said Al-Faqar Hanawi was killed at the same time as Muhammad Jaafar Qasir, a commander in charge of weapons transfers from Iran and its affiliates to Lebanese armed group Hezbollah earlier in the day. It\u2019s been a dramatic few hours in Middle East news as warnings that Iran planned to launch ballistic missiles at Israel came to fruition. Israel\u2019s defenses appear to have repelled the approximately 200 weapons that were fired from reaching Israeli citizens and infrastructure, even though Iran said most of the rockets reached their targets. It\u2019s shortly after 9pm in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beirut, 7pm in London and 2pm in New York, where the White House press briefing is due to begin soon. Israel has pledged retaliation against Iran, while Iran said its assault was retaliation for Israel\u2019s attacks on its regional Islamist proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. And so the tit-for-tat language continues, as the United Nations chief calls for this regional escalation \u201cto stop\u201d and ceasefires to be agreed immediately. Here\u2019s where things stand: Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, condemned the \u201cbroadening of the Middle East conflict, with escalation after escalation\u201d and said \u201cwe absolutely need a ceasefire\u201d. The Iranian missile attack on Israel appears to be over, with reports coming through that the Israeli military has told residents across the country that they are \u201cpermitted to leave protected spaces\u201d. The Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, spoke on television reacting to what the country called the \u201cserious attack\u201d on Israel by Iran today. Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), pledged that the attack \u201cwill have consequences\u201d. He added that the country remained on high alert. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, gave the order to launch missiles at Israel, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that Tehran \u201cis fully ready for any retaliation\u201d. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission to the United Nations has defended the country\u2019s missile launches against Israel today, calling it a response to \u201cterrorist acts\u201d by Israel. The United States had stood ready to be involved in supporting Israel\u2019s defenses against incoming rockets from Iran, an unnamed official had said prior to the missiles actually beginning to rain down on Israel. The Iranian revolutionary guard said the missile launches against Israel were in retaliation for Israel\u2019s killing of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July and, last week, the killing in Lebanon of the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan. Two waves of ballistic missiles were incoming over Israel today, fired from Iran, and were seen over Jordanian and Syrian air space before whizzing above Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities in parts of northern Israel. Two gunmen were involved in what the Israeli authorities reportedly called a \u201cterror shooting\u201d, firing at Jewish residents in Jaffa, which is part of greater Tel Aviv. Initial reports came in shortly before Iran launched its attack on Israel and after the barrage of missiles stopped arriving over Israel, it further emerged that four had been killed and seven wounded. The two gunmen had been killed. Few details are known yet. While a senior American administration official raised the alarm a little earlier that Iran is preparing \u201cimminently\u201d to launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel, the US also warned of \u201csevere consequences\u201d should such an assault take place. Air raid sirens were heard across Israel, starting in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as Israelis were ordered to seek shelter from an imminent missile attack from Iran. Prior to sirens going off, the US embassy in Israel directed all American government employees and their family members in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza to shelter in place until further notice. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, condemned the \u201cbroadening of the Middle East conflict, with escalation after escalation\u201d, moments ago, after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel\u2019s campaign against Tehran\u2019s Hezbollah allies in Lebanon. This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire,\u201d Guterres said in a statement, Reuters reported. This follows comments from Israel and Iran in a belligerent tit-for-tat, warning each other of the consequences of further millitary assaults from either side. At this point, what is an offensive action and what is a counteroffensive action is hard to discern, from Beirut to Tel Aviv to Tehran. Guterres\u2019s statement follows pleas from him earlier and multiple international urgings in the last week for the cessation of hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon. When sirens sounded across Israel earlier, people were seen taking shelter by the side of the road, under vehicles and under bridges as Iran launched missiles towards the country. Here are some of the images from the newswires as missiles started flying across Israel: Now back to that shooting incident in the Tel Aviv area that was still unfolding as Iranian missiles began raining down on Israel less than 90 minutes ago. Four people were killed and seven were wounded in the shooting attack in the Jaffa neighborhood of Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Israeli police said in a statement, Reuters reports. The police said there were two shooters and they had both been \u201cneutralised\u201d. Law enforcement added that the situation was \u201cunder control\u201d. The authorities previously called it a \u201csuspected terror\u201d shooting targeting Jewish residents. The police said the families of the victims had been notified. We\u2019ll bring you more details on this tragedy as we get them. Here\u2019s a post with a report from CBS News. Reports are coming through that the Israeli military has told residents across the country that they are \u201cpermitted to leave protected spaces\u201d. The ballistic missiles began flying into the Israeli skies, passing over parts of Jordan, just over an hour ago, after several tense hours after warnings that an attack was imminent. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, said moments ago in a televised address that there were no reports of injuries on the ground as Iran fired what is believed to be around 200 rockets. He added that there appeared to be no more threat of incoming weapons from Iran \u201cfor now\u201d but added that Israel remained ready. Israel has within the past few moments reopened its airspace. The Israeli military spokesperson is now on television reacting to what the country is calling the \u201cserious attack\u201d on Israel by Iran today. Daniel Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), pledged that the attack \u201cwill have consequences\u201d. He added that the country remained on high alert. The situation across Israel and the region is extremely tense tonight. It is just after 8.30pm in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The Guardian\u2019s Andrew Roth has tweeted footage of missiles flying over Jerusalem: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, gave the order to launch missiles at Israel, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that Tehran \u201cis fully ready for any retaliation\u201d. Meanwhile, the Iranian mission to the United Nations has defended the country\u2019s missile launches against Israel today, calling it a response to \u201cterrorist acts\u201d by Israel \u2013 as the Jewish state has stepped up its military offensive against Iran\u2019s proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon in recent days, almost a year into Israel\u2019s war on Hamas, which has decimated Gaza. The mission team posted on X: \u201cIran\u2019s legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime \u2013 which involved targeting Iranian nationals and interests and infringing upon the national sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2013 has been duly carried out.\u201d It appeared to indicate that there may be no more missiles launched in this current incident. The post added: \u201cShould the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.\u201d The raining down of missiles over Israel moments ago followed followed warnings earlier today from a senior US administration official, who has not been named, that Iran was preparing to \u201cimminently\u201d launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel. It was not long before the threatened attack unfolded and we await news of the effect on the ground in Israel, as residents across the country were ordered to take shelter and many rushed to get into air raid shelters, and rockets were seen and hears whizzing over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Associated Press reported also that the US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence, said the US is actively supporting Israeli defensive preparations. Israel has an air defense system it calls the iron dome designed to intercept incoming missiles before they can hit their targets. When Iran launched drone and cruise missile attacks on Israel in April, in the Islamic Republic\u2019s first ever direct attack on the Jewish state, Israel claimed that with the help of key western allies including the US, UK and Jordan, it intercepted some 99% of the launches during the mass strike. Some ballistic missiles had reached Israel, damaging the key Nevatim air base in southern Israel, which remained operational. Israel has shut down air travel in and out of the country, and Iraq, which lies directly to the east of Israel\u2019s easterly neighbor Jordan, has shut down its air space, Reuters reports. Just prior to these latest developments, Israeli army radio said that all take-off and landing at Ben Gurion international airport near Tel Aviv has stopped after Iran launched missiles towards Israel. Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the primary branch of the Iranian military, have said that the flurry of missiles being fired at Israel by Iran is in retaliation for the killing of the leaders of their principle proxies next to Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas. Reuters reports that almost 200 missiles have been launched from Iran at Israel, according to Israeli army radio. It is unclear at this time how many have reached any targets, with most reports from witnesses recounting missiles flying overhead. The Iranian revolutionary guard said the missile launches are in retaliation for Israel\u2019s killing of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July and, last week, the killing in Lebanon of the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan. A second wave of missiles has been reported flying above Jerusalem, where the Guardian has reporters covering the news. Barely 10 minutes after a first flurry of bombs whizzing overhead, a second wave of missiles passed over the city, apparently from a different direction, with the bright flashes of interceptions lighting up the sky as the sound of loud booms rang out across Jerusalem. Guardian reporters in Jerusalem witnessed dozens of missiles heading over the city going towards Israel\u2019s main coastal cities in a huge attack at not long after 7.30pm local time, with the engines of the rockets clearly visible as they passed over. While some interceptions could be heard over the city many of the missiles appeared to continue on unharmed and proceed towards the coast and central Israel to the sound of distant bombs. On the edge of the Old City, many stood to watch the missiles flying overhead in what appears to have been an unprecedented attack. Explosions can be heard above Tel Aviv and the sound of warning sirens wailing across the city, Israel\u2019s largest urban and economic metropolis. In Jerusalem, explosions are also being heard, witnesses have told Reuters. Israeli media is reporting that Iran has launched more than 100 missiles at Israel. It\u2019s unclear whether missiles are hitting home or being intercepted in the sky above the cities. This is a rapidly unfolding, ongoing situation. The Israeli military is now reporting that sirens are sounding across the country. The Israeli military says missiles have now been launched from Iran towards Israel, Reuters is reporting. There have already been reports of air raid sirens going off in Tel Aviv and now warning sirens are sounding in Jerusalem, according to the news agency. Here is a post on X from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), saying that all Israeli civilians are in bomb shelters as rockets from Iran are fired at Israel. There are initial reports emerging from Israel with talk of two gunmen firing on Israelis and a number of injuries reported in Jaffa, which is part of greater Tel Aviv. According to first reports from the scene, firing was occurring in two locations in Jaffa near the tram station on Gaza Street and Jerusalem Avenue. At least seven people appear to have been wounded, according to several sources, including Agence France-Presse citing emergency services. Reuters cites Israeli police referring to a suspected \u201cterror\u201d shooting. Israel\u2019s military spokesperson said today that any missile attack from Iran was expected to be on a wide scale and urged citizens to take shelter in safe rooms in such an event. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing, also said a barrage of rocket attacks aimed at the Tel Aviv region, which set off sirens, came from the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon, Reuters reports. That means that explosions in recent minutes could involve local weapons, not incoming missiles from Israel. The situation on the ground is obviously not very clear at the moment, and we are reporting what we hear from reliable sources while not drawing solid conclusions about what is actually occurring moment by moment. Top military chiefs in Israel and the US are talking about the intelligence reports that Iran is about to attack Israel, in retaliation for the massive Israeli strikes on Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon in recent days, according to various reports. Israel\u2019s Yoav Gallant and US defense secretary Lloyd Austin have spoken today, according to Axios. While a senior American administration official raised the alarm a little earlier that Iran is preparing \u201cimminently\u201d to launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel, the US also warned of \u201csevere consequences\u201d should such an assault take place. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence, said the US is actively supporting Israeli defensive preparations, the Associated Press reported. To recap: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning yesterday to Iran, which backs Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach,\u201d Netanyahu said, just days after an airstrike south of Beirut killed the leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah group, AP said. Hezbollah\u2019s acting leader, Naim Kassem, promised the group will fight on following the death Friday of its longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has also assassinated several of the group\u2019s top commanders in recent days. Kassem said the group\u2019s fighters are ready and the slain commanders have already been replaced. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since 8 October last year, the day after Hamas sent fighters into Israel and sparked the war in Gaza. Israel\u2019s security cabinet is expected to convene for a meeting in just over 30 minutes, that is 7.30pm local time, according to a post on X moments ago. Meanwhile, there are reports citing the Israeli military that rockets are landing in the country and hitting open areas. There are reports of air raid sirens going off in Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s largest commercial center with an urban population over 4 million, and also of residents being told to enter or be ready to enter bomb shelters for protection. The Jerusalem Post reported that people in Tel Aviv are being told to seek shelter against warnings of an imminent missile attack from Iran. The Times of Israel reported: \u201cRocket alert sirens are sounding in dozens of towns across central Israel and the Sharon region as well as in the northern West Bank, including Kfar Saba, Kafr Kassem, Rosh Ha\u2019ayin and Hod Hasharon.\u201d It also reports that explosions have been heard near Tel Aviv. There are no reports yet of missiles actually striking any targets in Israel. An Axios reporter posted on X about air raid sirens. The reporter also posted about hearing that the imminent attack from Iran that is being reported will use ballistic missiles that can reach Israel within 12 minutes. The Israel Defense Forces are \u201ctaking seriously\u201d the US warning moments ago that Iran is preparing \u201cimminently\u201d to launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel, the IDF spokesperson just said in a TV interview. Peter Lerner, the IDF spokesperson, spoke live on the US TV cable channel, MSNBC. He also confirmed that \u201cyes, there are operations that are ongoing\u201d on the ground in Lebanon against Hezbollah and that Israel has been \u201cconducting covert operations\u201d that have uncovered the powerful militant group\u2019s \u201cstaging grounds\u201d and plans to continue and escalate attacks against Israel. He said Israel has uncovered \u201cvast amounts of tools of terror and death\u201d that if Hezbollah had been able to use to carry out its intentions \u201cit would have made what happened on October 7 would pale\u201d in comparison \u2013 drawing a parallel with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel almost a year ago that triggered this game-changing escalation in the region. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, urged Tuesday for a de-escalation of the conflict in Lebanon, his spokesperson said, as an intensifying Israeli offensive against Hezbollah raises fears of a spiraling regional war. Spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric said, according to Agence France-Presse, that Guterres: Appeals for an immediate ceasefire \u2026 an all-out war must be avoided in Lebanon at all costs, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon must be respected. World leaders had gathered at the UN headquarters in New York last week for the international body\u2019s annual general assembly, but calls for ceasefires in Gaza between Israel and Hamas and in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, offers of deals and brokerage and expressions of outrage, did not bear fruit in the Middle East, as the conflict only escalated. The US embassy in Israel has directed all American government employees and their family members in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza to shelter in place until further notice. In a security alert release on its website, the embassy wrote: As a result of the current security situation, the US embassy has directed all US government employees and their family members to shelter in place until further notice. This is provided for your information as you make your own security plans. The US embassy in Jerusalem reminds US citizens of the continued need for caution and increased personal security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire and unmanned aircraft system UAS intrusions, often take place without warning. The security environment remains complex and can change quickly depending on the political situation and recent events. In response to security incidents and without advance notice, the US Embassy may further restrict or prohibit US government employees and their family members from traveling to certain areas of Israel (including the Old City of Jerusalem) and the West Bank. Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Israel could be as big or potentially bigger than the one in April, if it goes ahead, a US official has told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. US officials have said Iran appeared to be preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that the IDF is on a high state of alert and that an Iranian attack on Israel would have repercussions. In April, Iran launched hundreds of drones as well as cruise missiles towards Israel, in the Islamic Republic\u2019s first ever direct attack on the Jewish state, in response to the strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed a senior figure in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards and eight other officers. Egypt\u2019s foreign minister condemned what Cairo described as Israel\u2019s \u201cserious escalation\u201d in southern Lebanon, after the Israeli military said it launched a \u201climited and focused\u201d ground incursion. Badr Abdelaty warned that Israel\u2019s escalation threatens to inflame the entire region \u201cin a way that will lead to dire security and humanitarian consequences,\u201d according to a statement from the Egyptian foreign ministry. Abdelaty also said Egypt will reject any attempts to establish a new status quo that violates Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Sunday he had ordered the immediate dispatch of emergency medical and humanitarian aid to Lebanon. Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, says it has launched missiles towards Sde Dov airbase on the outskirts of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, Reuters has reported in a snap alert. Hezbollah said its fighters launched \u201ca salvo of Fadi-4 rockets at the Sde Dov air base in Tel Aviv\u201d, adding the attack came in defence of Lebanon and \u201cin response to the targeting of civilians and the massacres that the enemy carried out\u201d. Back in April, Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel in its first ever direct attack on the Israeli state. Tehran said then it was responding to a strike on an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on 1 April that killed a senior figure in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards. About 99% of the incoming barrage was intercepted either outside Israeli airspace or over the country itself, Israel said. Iran has vowed in recent days to avenge the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated by Israel in an airstrike on Beirut last Friday. A senior White House official has also told CBS that Iran is preparing to \u201cimminently\u201d launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel. The official said that the US is supporting \u201cdefensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack\u201d. AP reports Iran is preparing to \u201cimminently\u201d launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel, according to a senior US administration official, who warned Tuesday of \u201csevere consequences\u201d should it take place. White House officials did not immediately offer any evidence backing its intelligence finding. William Christou reports from Beirut for the Guardian Israel carried out at least two airstrikes in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday afternoon, with the sounds of the strikes heard across the city and two smoke plumes seen emanating from Dahieh. A low-flying drone was heard flying over Beirut and Dahieh for at least an hour preceding the strikes, the target of which was unclear. The IDF has announced in a message on Telegram that Israel\u2019s military is calling up \u201cfour additional reserve brigades for operational missions in the northern arena\u201d. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said Turkey \u201cwill never leave our Lebanese brothers on their own in these difficult days and will support them with all our means.\u201d Erdo\u011fan has been a strong critic of Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government since the IDF began its ground offensive in Gaza after the 7 October Hamas attack inside southern Israel. The Israeli military has begun what it called a \u201climited, localised and targeted\u201d ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, as it continued shelling areas close to the border and carrying out airstrikes on the capital, Beirut Israel\u2019s military spokesperson ordered the residents of about 30 border villages in south Lebanon to evacuate. Earlier an IDF spokesperson claimed there had been \u201cheavy fighting\u201d, but a later statement to Reuters from a security source suggested there had been no direct engagement between Israeli troops inside Lebanon and Hezbollah Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel would do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to avoid a 7 October style attack happening again on \u201cany one of our borders\u201d. He claimed Hezbollah had turned Lebanese villages near Israeli villages at the UN-drawn blue line into military bases from which to spring an attack Lebanon\u2019s government has said about 1,000 people have been killed, about 6,000 wounded and one million displaced from their homes as a result of Israeli attacks in recent days. Israel\u2019s military claims it is targeting Hezbollah and terrorist infrastructure. Local residents have told Reuters that at least 600 people have sought refuge in a monastery on the Israel-Lebanon border as airstrikes continue Caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati has made an appeal for more international aid, saying \u201cLebanon is facing one of the most dangerous stages in its history, as about one million of our people have been displaced due to the devastating war waged by Israel on Lebanon\u201d Spanish foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said Israel should end the operation. Spain is currently commanding the UN peacekeeping force Unifil in Lebanon, which said it had been warned by the Israelis about their plans. Turkey and Russia have also condemned Israel\u2019s move to open up a new ground front in its conflict. Turkey said it was an illegal attempt at occupation that violated Lebanese territorial integrity One of the UN\u2019s social media accounts posted to remind members that article 2.4 of the UN Charter states that \u201cAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\u201d Poland has said will limit the number of staff at its embassy in Beirut. The UK government has chartered a plane to bring British people who want to leave back to the UK. A helicopter carrier from France will arrive in the eastern Mediterranean in the next five to six days and take up position in case a decision is taken to evacuate foreign nationals Two Israelis were injured when a rocket hit a road in central Israel. The Israeli military extended home front safety restrictions on Tuesday to many towns and cities across the country, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Gatherings are limited and workplaces and educational setting can only open if they have access to protected spaces Israeli airstrikes have also reportedly hit Syria. Syria\u2019s official news agency Sana said early on Tuesday the country\u2019s air defence systems had intercepted three rounds of strikes in the Damascus area. Sana reported three civilians killed and nine others wounded. Israel has struck at least three anti-aircraft radar stations in southern Syria, including one stationed in a military airfield, Reuters has been told by sources At least 41,638 Palestinian people have been killed and 96,460 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. The toll includes 23 people killed in the last 24-hour reporting period, according to the ministry The Palestine Red Crescent Society reports that two of its staff were fired at with live ammunition by Israeli security forces at the entrance of Balata camp in Nablus when they were trying to transport an injured person. One Palestinian was killed by Israeli forces in Nablus, while Israeli media reports four of its security forces were wounded Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement targeted Israeli military posts in Tel Aviv and Eilat with drones on Tuesday, the group\u2019s military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised speech. There were also reports of a vessel being targeted in the Red Sea Israeli forces have been carrying out raids into southern Lebanon for months, uncovering Hezbollah tunnels and weapon caches under homes and uncovering invasion plans by the militant group, the spokesperson for the Israeli military has said, according to Reuters. Daniel Hagari said the details are being declassified for the first time, hours after Israel officially announced a ground operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military\u2019s claims have not yet been independently verified by us. We will give you more on Hagari\u2019s comments as soon as we get more information on them. Here are some of the latest images coming from the newswires out of Israel and Lebanon: Israel has struck at least three anti-aircraft radar stations in southern Syria, including one stationed in a military airfield, Reuters has been told be sources. These reports have not been independently verified by the Guardian. The drone strikes hit two radar stations west of the city of Sweida, including one located in an airbase in the area, the two military sources told Reuters, while another hit a radar station in the adjoining Daraa province. They are part of the Syrian army\u2019s air defences in the southern region, the sources said. Syrian state media reported early on Tuesday that three civilians had been killed in Israeli strikes on the capital Damascus (see opening summary for more details). Israel has been carrying out strikes against Iran-linked targets in Syria for years but these attacks have intensified since last October. Local residents have told Reuters that at least 600 people have sought refuge in a monastery on the Israel-Lebanon border as Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon are continuing. An Israeli military spokesperson warned residents of Ain Ebl and at least 20 other towns to evacuate their homes immediately because the military said it would target homes the IDF said Hezbollah was using. The residents fled to the monastery in the town of Rmeish, in southern Lebanon, which did not receive an Israeli warning, and were waiting for an army convoy to escort them to Beirut, they told Reuters. At least 41,638 Palestinian people have been killed and 96,460 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. The toll includes 23 people killed in the last 24-hour reporting period, according to the ministry. The health ministry has said thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the enclave. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, on Tuesday called on Israel to withdraw troops from Lebanon, and warned that the attack would lead to a further escalation of violence in the Middle East. Reuters reports Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement \u201cRussia strongly condemns the attack on Lebanon and calls on the Israeli authorities to immediately cease hostilities, withdraw their troops from Lebanese territory and engage in a real search for peaceful ways to resolve the Middle East conflict.\u201d Earlier Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed concern over Israeli troops crossing into Lebanon, and at reports of an Israeli airstrike in Damascus killing three civilians. The Israeli military extended home front safety restrictions on Tuesday to many towns and cities across the country, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. In a message on its official Telegram channel, the IDF said the changes would come into effect from 2pm local time (11am GMT). It said: The main changes are as follows: Educational activities can be held in a place where you can reach a protected space in case of an alert. Gatherings and services can be held with a limit of up to 30 people in an open area and up to 300 people in closed spaces. Workplaces can operate in a building or place where you can reach a protected space in case of an alert. Reuters reports that Poland will limit the number of staff at its embassy in Beirut, with a foreign ministry spokesperson adding that Warsaw would organise transport for Polish citizens who want to leave Lebanon. Israel\u2019s air force has published a map illustrating what it says is the extent of rocket fire into Israeli-held territory from the direction of Lebanon today. UK foreign secretary David Lammy has warned that the situation in Lebanon could become \u201cmuch, much more dangerous\u201d as he urged Britons to leave the country, and said the way forward is a political solution, not a military one. PA Media quotes him saying the situation is \u201cvolatile and has the potential to deteriorate quickly,\u201d adding: We continue contingency planning for a range of scenarios in the region but you should not wait for these. We know that events can escalate with little warning and the situation on the ground could become much, much more dangerous. This means there\u2019s no guarantee that another option will become available. The UK government is providing an option for you to leave now. My message is clear: take it. Speaking later to the BBC, Lammy said: Our position remains the same. Having spoken to our American colleagues and other allies, we\u2019re calling for an immediate ceasefire. We need a diplomatic solution to the problems in Lebanon, so that Israelis can go back to their homes in northern Israel, and Lebanese can return to their homes in southern Lebanon. So at this time, we want to see a political solution, the Amos Hochstein plan, which is on the table from the Americans, and an immediate ceasefire. Pressed that neither Israel or Hezbollah was listening to pleas from the international community, Lammy said \u201cWe will continue to speak to the Israelis and indeed to other actors in the Middle East. At this time, none of us want to see a regional escalation.\u201d Hezbollah is a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. Lammy continued: None of us want to return to the years in which Israel found itself bogged down in a quagmire in southern Lebanon and pitched battles between Israeli soldiers and the Lebanese side. And that is why we believe that resolution 1701 should be implemented, and that Hezbollah should withdraw up to the Litani River so that Israelis can feel safe in northern Israel. But the way forward is a political solution, not a military one. The National News Agency in Lebanon reporters that caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati has met with UN organisations and ambassadors of donor countries. It quotes Mikati saying: We meet today at a time when Lebanon is facing one of the most dangerous stages in its history, as about one million of our people have been displaced due to the devastating war waged by Israel on Lebanon. We are working diligently in cooperation with the UN institutions to secure the basic needs of the displaced Lebanese, as we have done during all the difficult stages that Lebanon has gone through. We greatly appreciate the continued support provided by the UN, as well as the support of our sister Arab countries and other friendly countries. Today, we urgently appeal for more support to enhance our ongoing efforts to provide essential assistance to displaced civilians. The Palestine Red Crescent Society reports that two of its staff were fired at with live ammunition by Israeli security forces at the entrance of Balata camp in Nablus when they were trying to transport an injured person. Earlier Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that a 33-year-old was killed by Israeli security forces in Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It reports that 30 people, including a child, have been detained by Israeli forces in the last 24 hours. Israeli media reports that four soldiers were injured, one seriously, when they were fired upon while trying to detain a suspect. William Christou reports from Lebanon for the Guardian Israel\u2019s military spokesperson ordered the residents of about 30 border villages in south Lebanon to evacuate, Tuesday at noon, telling them to head north of the Awali river, nearly 35 miles from the border, as Israel conducted what it said were \u201climited\u201d raids into Lebanon. The Awali river is a bit north of Sidon, far beyond what is now considered the theatre of fighting in Lebanon. It is unclear why Israel asked residents of certain towns in the south, and not neighbouring ones, to evacuate, nor is it clear why they ordered them to evacuate so far north. Besides the 30 villages named by the Israeli military spokesperson, many villages south of the Awali river, including Sidon and the southern city of Tyre, were not asked to evacuate. \u201cThe IDF does not want to harm you and for your own safety you must evacuate your homes immediately\u201d Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, adding that Israel would tell residents when they could return home. The noon-time announcement came after the Israelis told residents not to move southwards past the Litani river, about 20 miles away from the UN-drawn blue line that separates Lebanon and Israel. For almost a year, the Israelis have demanded that Hezbollah be removed from the area south of the Litani as fighters used it as a staging ground for rocket attacks on north Israel. Hezbollah has thus far rebuffed its demand. Israel should cease conducting ground raids in southern Lebanon to avoid an escalation of the conflict enveloping the region, Spanish foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares told reporters on Tuesday. El Pa\u00eds quoted the minister saying: It is an unbearable conflict and it has to stop now. We cannot resign ourselves to war being the normal way of relating between the peoples of the Middle East. To achieve peace there is only one way: respect for international humanitarian law. This spiral of violence has to stop. He called for a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza. Since February 2022, Spain has commanded the United Nations\u2019 Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), and it has over 650 troops deployed there as part of the 10,000 strong force. Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s ground offensive into Lebanon was an illegal attempt at occupation that violated Lebanese territorial integrity, and added the operation must immediately end with Israel withdrawing from Lebanon. Reuters reports that in a statement the foreign ministry also said the move increased regional instability, and that it was highly likely it would lead to a wave of migration. Lebanon\u2019s government has said that one million people \u2013 a fifth of the population \u2013 have been displaced from their homes by Israeli airstrikes in recent days, and tens of thousands are believed to have travelled across the border into Syria. Hezbollah has claimed to have fired missiles at the Mossad headquarters and at a military intelligence unit on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Unifil, said on Tuesday the Israeli army had notified it of its intention to undertake what the Israelis have termed \u201climited ground incursions\u201d. Reuters reports that in a statement, Unifil said that despite the developments in Lebanon, peacekeepers remained in position. It reminded Israel that \u201cAny crossing into Lebanon is in violation of Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a violation of UN security council resolution 1701.\u201d Israel earlier today accused the Lebanese government of not enforcing resolution 1701, which calls for the Lebanese army and the UN peacekeeping force to be the only armed groups permitted between the Litani River and the UN-drawn blue line which separates Israel and Lebanon. The line was drawn, and the resolution passed, in 2006. Israel accuses Lebanon of allowing Hezbollah to build a stronghold south of the Litani, right up against northern Israel. Syria\u2019s foreign ministry has condemned an Israeli strike on Damascus earlier today which it said killed three people. In a statement the ministry said: The Israeli enemy launched an air aggression at dawn today targeting several points in the city of Damascus, which led to the martyrdom of three civilians, the injury of nine, and the occurrence of significant damage to private property. Syria condemns this brutal Israeli aggression and renews its call to the world to put an end to this Israeli chaos that is igniting the entire region and threatening regional and international peace and security. The ministry said Syria had a \u201clegitimate right to defend its land and people and to resist these crimes by all means guaranteed by international law.\u201d The Israeli defense minister\u2019s office said Yoav Gallant has briefed US defense secretary Lloyd Austin on Israel\u2019s raids into Lebanon, Reuters reports. A road has been blocked in central Israel after it appears it was hit by a rocket. The Magen David Adom ambulance service now says it has treated two people at the scene \u2013 a bus driver who was hit by shrapnel, and another motorist. The military correspondent for the Times of Israel, Emanuel Fabian, posted images from the scene. The raids by Israeli troops in southern Lebanon that began overnight were limited and went only a short distance over the border, an Israeli security official has told Reuters, adding that no direct clashes with Hezbollah fighters were reported. Reuters said the official would not be drawn on how far inside Lebanon the IDF service personnel had reached, but suggested it was within walking distance of the UN-drawn blue line which separates the two countries. The official told the news agency a wider operation targeting the Lebanese capital Beirut, which has been hit by repeated airstrikes in recent days, was \u201cnot on the table\u201d. The suggestion there has been no clashes directly contradicts an earlier statement by IDF Arabic language spokesperson Avichay Adraee, who in a warning to Lebanese citizens that they should not move south of the Litani River claimed that there was heavy fighting. Israeli media is reporting that one person has been \u201cmoderately wounded\u201d after a rocket barrage fired from inside Lebanon aimed at locations in central Israel. A helicopter carrier from France will arrive in the eastern Mediterranean in the next five to six days and take up position in case a decision is taken to evacuate foreign nationals from Lebanon, Reuters reports a French army spokesperson said on Tuesday. Earlier the British government said it is chartering a flight to assist Britons who want to flee Lebanon, where the government says Israeli airstrikes have killed about 1,000 people and injured about 6,000 more in the past few days. Fighting continues in the Gaza Strip. Local medical sources say that 21 people have been killed so far on Tuesday by Israeli strikes, Reuters reports. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller militant factions have said in separate statements that their fighters attacked Israeli forces operating in several areas of Gaza with anti-tank rockets, mortar fire, and explosive devices. Air raid sirens have sounded in central Israel, including in Tel Aviv. The IDF said \u201ca number of projectiles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, some of which were intercepted.\u201d More details soon \u2026 It remains unclear exactly what has transpired in the Red Sea, but at the moment the latest indication is that a vessel was struck by a missile and sustained damage at 97 nautical miles northwest of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah port, and the crew are safe. More details soon \u2026 Here are some of the latest pictures sent to us over the news wires from Lebanon. Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Daniel Hagari has issued a video message in English, in which he has claimed Israel is attacking villages inside Lebanon which Hezbollah has converted to military bases as part of a plan to launch an attack on Israel, and said his nation will \u201ccontinue doing whatever necessary\u201d to avoid a 7 October style attack happening again on \u201cany one of our borders\u201d. In the statement, Hagari says: The Israel Defense Forces is conducting limited and targeted raids along Israel\u2019s northern border against the threat Hezbollah poses to civilians in northern Israel. These localized ground raids will target Hezbollah strongholds that threaten Israeli towns, kibbutzim and communities along our border. Hezbollah turned Lebanese villages next to Israeli villages into military bases all ready for an attack on Israel. Hezbollah had prepared to use those villages as staging grounds for an 7 October style invasion into Israeli homes. Hezbollah planned to invade Israel, attack Israeli communities and massacre innocent men, women and children. They called this plan \u201cConquer the Galilee\u201d. For decades, UN security council resolutions have called on Lebanon to make sure that its territory is free of non-governmental armed groups. UN security council resolution 1701 from 2006, agreed upon by Israel and Lebanon, requires that there be no armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the government of Lebanon and Unifil in southern Lebanon. 18 years after [resolution] 1701, Hezbollah is the world\u2019s largest non-state army, and southern Lebanon is swarming with Hezbollah terrorists and weapons. If the state of Lebanon and the world can\u2019t push Hezbollah away from our border, we have no choice but to do it ourselves. I want to make it clear our war is with Hezbollah, not with the people of Lebanon. We do not want to harm Lebanese civilians, and we are taking measures to prevent that. We will not let [a] 7 October happen again on any one of our borders. We will continue doing whatever necessary so that Israeli families can return to their homes in safety and security. The Lebanese government has said that since Israel stepped up its airstrikes on the country, about 1,000 people including women and children have been killed, about 6,000 injured, and an estimated one million people displaced from their homes. About 60,000 people in northern Israel have been displaced from their homes by rocket fire from Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli forces operating inside Lebanon. Dozens were killed in Lebanon and thousands more wounded when pagers and walkie-talkies were detonated last month. Although it has not directly claimed responsibility, the attack is widely attributed to an Israeli operation targeting Hezbollah operatives. One of the UN\u2019s social media accounts this morning posted to remind members that article 2.4 of the UN Charter states that \u201cAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, recently described a non-binding vote by the UN general assembly that Israel end its nearly six decades of occupying the Palestinian West Bank territory as \u201cshameful.\u201d William Christou is in Beirut for the Guardian, and has this latest report on the situation this morning: Following Israel\u2019s announcement that it was starting a \u201climited\u201d incursion into south Lebanon, Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued a statement on Tuesday morning, telling Lebanese not to travel in vehicles from the north to the region south of the Litani river \u201cfor their personal safety\u201d. \u201cHeavy fighting is taking place in southern Lebanon, with Hezbollah elements using the civilian environment and the population as human shields to launch attacks,\u201d Adraee said in an announcement on X. The Litani river, about 20 miles north of the Lebanon-Israel border, separates the border region from the rest of Lebanon. Israel has demanded that Hezbollah withdraw its fighters north of the Litani river since fighting began on 8 October. Hezbollah has refused to negotiate on its presence south of the Litani until a ceasefire in Gaza was achieved. Israeli jets carried out strikes on over a dozen targets in south Lebanon overnight, while shelling targeted areas facing the closed military zone established by Israel on Monday night. Israel also struck what it said were \u201cHezbollah installations\u201d in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, in successive waves of airstrikes. Hezbollah announced that it was targeting Israeli soldiers who were approaching the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon with rockets and shelling. The group said that it had fired on Israeli troops in Metula, a town on the Israeli side of the line, on Monday morning. Lebanese authorities had yet to report casualties for the overnight fighting, but a medical source in Marjayoun public hospital in south Lebanon said they received wounded overnight. Residents of south Lebanon found themselves unable to flee during the intense bombing overnight, with at least two major roads reported impassable due to airstrikes. The Palestinian Wafa news agency has reported 19 civilians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes this morning, including on the Shuja\u2019iyya school, which was housing displaced people near Gaza City. It claims that women and children were among the victims. The IDF earlier issued a statement claiming it was targeting a Hamas command and control centre at the school, which has Israel has previously bombed. The claims have not been independently verified. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement targeted Israeli military posts in Tel Aviv and Eilat with drones on Tuesday, the group\u2019s military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised speech, Reuters reports. A couple of images have appeared on the news wires which show the Israeli military operation in which IDF troops have entered Lebanon. Itamer Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right interior security minister, who has previously threatened to collapse Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government if it agreed a ceasefire with Hezbollah, has posted to social media saying he prays for the success of Israel\u2019s ground invasion inside Lebanon. He said: The decisions we made in the last few days are important, correct and necessary decisions. At the same time, this is the time not to stop, [but] to continue doing everything, with all our might, and crush the terrorist organisation Hezbollah, in order to return the residents of the north to their homes safely. I pray for the success of the IDF soldiers who are currently fighting in difficult conditions in southern Lebanon, the people of Israel stand behind them. In the warning issued by Israel\u2019s Arabic language military spokesperson, Lebanese residents have been cautioned against moving their vehicles while what Avichay Adraee described as \u201cheavy fighting\u201d was taking place. It says: Heavy fighting is taking place in southern Lebanon, with Hezbollah elements using the civilian environment and the population as human shields to launch attacks. For your personal safety, we ask you not to move vehicles from the northern region to the southern region of the Litani River. This warning is in effect until further notice. Israel claims to be targeting Hezbollah inside Lebanon, where more than 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks, 6,000 wounded and, according to the Lebanese government, one million displaced. About 60,000 Israelis have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel by near constant rocket fire from Hezbollah from the direction of Lebanon into Israel since 8 October 2023. Hebrew media outlet Ynet has published what it claims are recordings of the address to Israeli troops as they entered Lebanon. It quotes Brig Gen Guy Levy of the IDF 98th division telling service personnel: You fight with courage, aggression, lethality and determination. At the beginning of the new year we are on the battlefield, the first to attack for a new reality for the residents of the north. Our mission is to attack the terrorist organisation Hezbollah, to destroy its infrastructure, weapons and terrorists, in order to remove the threat to the residents of the state of Israel and to create the conditions for the return of the residents of the north to their homes in safety. There is some breaking news via Reuters that a vessel in the Red Sea has reported being struck by an \u201cuncrewed surface vessel\u201d. More details soon \u2026 As reported earlier, the UK Government has chartered a flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave the country. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, described the situation in Lebanon as \u201cvolatile\u201d and with the \u201cpotential to deteriorate quickly\u201d. British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under 18 are eligible for the flight, and those who are vulnerable will be prioritised. There are 5,000 British single and dual nationals in Lebanon, including members of their immediate families, and the government said it was working on \u201call contingency options\u201d. Nadeem Badshah and Helen Sullivan have more details here: UK charters flight from Lebanon as governments prepare evacuation plans Israel\u2019s military has published more detail of rocket fire aimed into Israeli territory, saying that in the last hour or so Metula has been targeted twice, and several projectiles were also fired at Avivim. Both Israeli communities are very close to the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon. The IDF, in its message on Telegram, said that \u201csome of the projectiles were intercepted and fallen projectiles were identified\u201d and that some fell into open areas. There were no immediate reports of any casualties. In today\u2019s First Edition newsletter, my colleague Nimo Omer spoke to the Guardian\u2019s international security correspondent, Jason Burke, about the latest developments in the region: More than 1,000 people in Lebanon have been killed in the past two weeks, 6,000 wounded and, according to the Lebanese government, one million displaced. Meanwhile in Gaza, the humanitarian situation has eroded further. With little to no infrastructure available to support the displaced population, disease is rampant and civilians are living in the most catastrophic conditions. There is little political incentive for Benjamin Netanyahu to let up, as the assassination of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has given the embattled Israeli prime minister a political boost. Israel has shown no intention of relenting. At this point, there is too much uncertainty to predict the long term impact of the assassination of Nasrallah on Hezbollah but in the short term \u201cit\u2019s a really devastating blow\u201d, Jason says. \u201cNot only have they lost a charismatic and popular leader \u2013 among his supporters at least \u2013 [but] Nasrallah was also competent and effective. You don\u2019t get to stay at the top of a group like that for 32 years without being good at what you do.\u201d As expected, the Shia militia group has sworn to enact revenge attacks but, as of yet, it appears to have been unable to retaliate in any serious way. \u201cEven though Israeli air defences are very effective, it\u2019s been said for a long time that Hezbollah, which has massive stocks of rockets and missiles, would be able to overwhelm those defences and cause significant casualties and destruction in much of northern and central Israel but so far, they\u2019ve not been able to do anything much,\u201d Jason says. This hesitation perhaps is borne of an awareness that Israel\u2019s response to such an attack is likely to be equally if not more devastating. \u201cHezbollah is a state within a state and primarily acts in its own interests, or those of its sponsor, Iran. But whatever happens the consequences for Lebanon are going to be very tough indeed.

The attack Tuesday morning took place off the port city of Hodeida in the Red Sea, which has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships travelling through the waterway. A captain on a ship saw four \u201csplashes\u201d near his vessel, the British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre said in a warning. That likely would have been missiles or drones launched at the vessel. \u201cAll crew are safe and the vessel is proceeding to (its) next port of call,\u201d the UKMTO said. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack. However, they sometimes take hours or days to acknowledge one of their assaults. The Houthis had threatened \u201cescalating military operations\u201d targeting Israel on Monday. Hezbollah has said it targeted Israeli troops in a town in the country\u2019s north early on Tuesday. According to a statement from the militant group published in some Arabic media, Hezbollah targeted \u201cIsraeli soldiers at the Metula site with artillery shells and achieved casualties.\u201d The Israeli military has made no comment on reported casualties, but said that after an air raid alert in Metula, five rocket launches were detected. \u201cSome of them were intercepted\u201d, the IDF said, adding that crashes were detected in the area. First details are now beginning to emerge over the scope of Israel\u2019s ground incursion into southern Lebanon. So far the focus of the Israeli operation appears to a series of villages in the area of the border north of the Israeli border communities of Metula, Kfar Giladi and Misgav Am. The border at this point, north of the town of Kiryat Shimona, pokes up into Lebanon like a finger, exposed on three sides and overlooked at points by high wooded ridges. Beyond is a small plain leading towards the town of Marjayoun (once the headquarters of the Israeli allied South Lebanon Army). According to Lebanese correspondents in the area the villages on the northern side of the border were targeted heavily during the night by Israeli artillery fire and machine gun fire from the area of Metula. More, albeit vague details, were provided by the Jerusalem Post which said that the IDF had \u201cmanoeuvreed into several villages in the eastern sector of Lebanon on Tuesday, where, according to intelligence, Hezbollah has terrorist infrastructure. IDF artillery also fired at the area, aiming to destroy terrorist infrastructure, kill Hezbollah terrorists, and disrupt terrorist activity.\u201d The objectives of the \u201climited operation\u201d as described by Israel remained largely unclear. In previous wars and operations \u2013 including Operation Litani in 1978, the Israeli invasion and occupation of Lebanon in the 1980s through to 2000, and the Second Lebanese war in 2006, Israel has struggled to secure any lasting gains from its military operations. Airstrikes also continued over night in other parts of Lebanon, including heavy explosions that occurred in the south Beirut suburbs and a strike targeting the Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp in Sidon where at least six people were reported killed including three children in a strike on a member of the Palestinian Fatah movement. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed in the early hours of Tuesday that it had launched what it called a \u201climited\u201d ground operation in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, while it continued to bombard the rest of the country and also reportedly carried out deadly strikes on Syria. There were reports of casualties from an Israeli strike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the Lebanese city of Sidon, while towns near the border with Israel, including Aita al-Shaab, Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam were shelled on Monday night. The IDF has not commented on the claims. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant and that the pair had \u201cagreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border\u201d with Lebanon. He also said he had \u201cmade clear that the United States is well-postured to defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations\u201d. Israel carried out more airstrikes in Dahieh in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The neighbourhood is where Israel levelled several apartment blocks on Friday when it is believed to have used a so-called bunker buster bomb to kill Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Syrian state media reported that three civilians were killed in Israeli airstrikes, while state television reported that one of its anchors was killed; it was not clear if they were among the three civilians. In other developments: Heavy shelling into Lebanon was taking place along the border in the area north of Kiryat Shimona. The towns of Marjayoun, Wazzani and Khiam were being shelled on Monday night. There were also reports of a heavy presence of Israeli aircraft over southern Lebanon. Israel launched a strike on a building in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian camp near southern Lebanon\u2019s city of Sidon, a Palestinian source told the Reuters news agency. Israeli media is reporting that Mounir Maqdah, who is reportedly a commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the purported target of the strike, was injured in the attack. Al Jazeera has reported multiple casualties in the strike. Ain al-Hilweh is Lebanon\u2019s largest camp for Palestinian refugees. If confirmed it would be the first strike on the overcrowded camp since cross-border hostilities broke out nearly a year ago. Syrian state media reported early on Tuesday that three civilians had been killed in Israeli strikes on the capital Damascus. State television had earlier said one of its presenters had been killed; it was not immediately clear whether they were among the three mentioned by state media. The reports could not be verified independently. Israel carried out more airstrikes in Dahieh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, after the Israeli military issued new instructions ordering residents of three buildings in the neighbourhood to evacuate immediately. Huge explosions were heard in the Lebanese capital late on Monday night. Israel\u2019s military spokesperson Avichay Adraee issued maps of three locations in Dahieh, instructing residents to evacuate more than 500 metres away, marking the second time Israel instructed residents of Dahieh to evacuate prior to strikes. At least 95 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Lebanon on Monday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. An airstrike early on Monday hit an apartment building in central Beirut \u2013 the first to hit in the heart of the Lebanese capital since 2006. The Lebanese army said it was \u201crepositioning and regrouping forces\u201d amid reports it had withdrawn three miles from the country\u2019s southern border. The Lebanese army has evacuated observation posts at Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel and moved to barracks in the border villages, according to reports. UN peacekeepers in Lebanon can no longer patrol border areas in the south due to heavy artillery fire from Israeli forces and Hezbollah, a UN spokesperson said. The peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 personnel \u201cremain in position\u201d but cannot carry out road patrols due to \u201cthe intensity of the rockets going back and forth\u201d, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general said on Monday. A US state department spokesperson said Israel had informed the US that it was conducting \u201climited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, said he was aware of Israel\u2019s plans to launch an operation into Lebanon as he urged against such a move. \u201cI\u2019m more aware than you might know and I\u2019m comfortable with them stopping,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe should have a ceasefire now.\u201d The US is sending a \u201cfew thousand\u201d troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said on Monday. The increased presence will involve multiple fighter jet and attack aircraft squadrons, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. The additional forces would raise the total number of troops in the region to as many as 43,000. The UK government announced it has chartered a commercial flight out of Lebanon for Britons wanting to leave amid escalating violence. The flight is due to leave Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport on Wednesday, the Foreign Office said, with priority given to vulnerable British nationals and their spouses, partners and children under 18. Canada has announced it has reserved 800 seats on commercial flights to evacuate its citizens from Lebanon. \u201cThe security situation in Lebanon is becoming increasingly dangerous and volatile,\u201d Canadian foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly wrote on X.",

Ravneet, who previously worked at an IT company, described a similarly toxic work environment where employees were not allowed to talk or socialise in the workplace, had all their breaks closely monitored and had their pay arbitrarily docked. \u201cEverything we did was so heavily policed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew they could exploit people because everyone is desperate and wait years to get these kinds of jobs. They can\u2019t afford to lose them, so they don\u2019t complain even when we know when we are being exploited or labour laws are being broken.\u201d Ravneet said working there had taken a major toll on his mental health before one day he was fired, with no reason given. Employees in other sectors, from media to entertainment, said the problem was endemic there too. Sara, who has worked in corporate events for over a decade, said it was completely normalised to work 16-hour days and be given tasks on at 11pm Sunday night and told to have them done by first thing Monday morning. \u201cThese companies actually encourage gruesome office politics because they think it\u2019s good for business to have employees feeling uncertain and threatened in their jobs, so they will work harder,\u201d she said. She eventually went freelance to free herself from some of the toxic corporate culture of the office where she worked. \u201cYou barely have time to eat or sleep properly and in the end you lose sight of yourself completely,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course it takes a huge toll \u2013 but no one seems to care.\u201d",

A lot of people are looking at this meeting to see if there\u2019s any meat in the sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been taken aback by how frustrated both sides are actually \u2026 There\u2019s a sense on the European side that Labour raised expectations in opposition. They\u2019ve got a stonking majority and yet the government\u2019s rhetoric on Europe seems very unambitious.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real sense there is no plan. Senior officials on the European side are asking, what does Labour actually want to do? The suspicion is that the principals in the cabinet \u2013 Starmer, Cooper, Reeves, Thomas-Symonds \u2013 aren\u2019t aligned.\u201d</p> <p>A Whitehall source said Labour ministers had \u201caccidentally boxed themselves into this position\u201d where they opposed a youth mobility scheme for fear that it would look like a form of freedom of movement with the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they [Labour] were in opposition they were keen not to be seen as undoing Brexit so they ruled out absolutely everything,\u201d the source said. \u201cIn reality this only affects a really small proportion of people.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview last week, Pedro Serrano, the EU\u2019s ambassador to London, suggested young people from Britain could do gap years in the EU an example of how the scheme could work. His remarks were interpreted as a softening in Brussels\u2019 position, because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/19/sunak-rejects-offer-of-mobility-scheme-for-young-people-between-eu-and-uk\">original proposal</a> envisioned young people spending up to four years in the UK or EU.</p> <p>Three EU diplomats said the EU had not taken a final position on the length of stay and that options ranged from three years to multiple \u201cmini stays\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer and von der Leyen are expected to agree to a work programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/29/starmer-visit-to-brussels-could-lead-to-overhaul-of-brexit-deal\">aiming for a reset on some of the easier issues by next spring</a>. The UK is pursuing closer cooperation with the EU on defence and security and mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</p> <p>The prime minister will also meet Charles Michel and Roberta Metsola, the heads of the European Council and the European parliament.</p> <p>In a statement before the trip, the prime minister said: \u201cThe UK is undeniably stronger when it works in lockstep with its closest international partners. This has never been more important \u2013 with war, conflict and insecurity all knocking on Europe\u2019s door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will only be able to tackle these challenges by putting our collective weight behind them, which is why I am so determined to put the Brexit years behind us and establish a more pragmatic and mature relationship with the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>Sandro Gozi, who is expected to be elected chair of the European parliament\u2019s UK delegation on Thursday, said: \u201cThe momentum for positive change created by prime minister Starmer\u2019s election and a new European commission should not be wasted, but this will require boldness and flexibility from the UK government.\u201d</p> <p>The UK has an existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/25/23000-people-came-uk-youth-mobility-visas-brexit-deal\">youth mobility scheme with a dozen countries</a> including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Korea.</p>",

This and the fact he has yet to have a formal meeting with von der Leyen has stunted the much-anticipated reset in UK-EU relations. The pair spoke on the margins of the UN general assembly in New York. Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said youth mobility had become a \u201ctoken of good faith\u201d in the relationship between London and Brussels. He said: \u201cThere is a sense of apprehension that nice talk is all there is, and when it comes to the substance either the Labour party isn\u2019t really willing to do anything or doesn\u2019t know what it wants. A lot of people are looking at this meeting to see if there\u2019s any meat in the sandwich.\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been taken aback by how frustrated both sides are actually \u2026 There\u2019s a sense on the European side that Labour raised expectations in opposition. They\u2019ve got a stonking majority and yet the government\u2019s rhetoric on Europe seems very unambitious. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense there is no plan. Senior officials on the European side are asking, what does Labour actually want to do? The suspicion is that the principals in the cabinet \u2013 Starmer, Cooper, Reeves, Thomas-Symonds \u2013 aren\u2019t aligned.\u201d A Whitehall source said Labour ministers had \u201caccidentally boxed themselves into this position\u201d where they opposed a youth mobility scheme for fear that it would look like a form of freedom of movement with the EU. \u201cWhen they [Labour] were in opposition they were keen not to be seen as undoing Brexit so they ruled out absolutely everything,\u201d the source said. \u201cIn reality this only affects a really small proportion of people.\u201d In an interview last week, Pedro Serrano, the EU\u2019s ambassador to London, suggested young people from Britain could do gap years in the EU an example of how the scheme could work. His remarks were interpreted as a softening in Brussels\u2019 position, because the original proposal envisioned young people spending up to four years in the UK or EU. Three EU diplomats said the EU had not taken a final position on the length of stay and that options ranged from three years to multiple \u201cmini stays\u201d. Starmer and von der Leyen are expected to agree to a work programme aiming for a reset on some of the easier issues by next spring. The UK is pursuing closer cooperation with the EU on defence and security and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. The prime minister will also meet Charles Michel and Roberta Metsola, the heads of the European Council and the European parliament. In a statement before the trip, the prime minister said: \u201cThe UK is undeniably stronger when it works in lockstep with its closest international partners. This has never been more important \u2013 with war, conflict and insecurity all knocking on Europe\u2019s door.\u201d \u201cWe will only be able to tackle these challenges by putting our collective weight behind them, which is why I am so determined to put the Brexit years behind us and establish a more pragmatic and mature relationship with the European Union.\u201d Sandro Gozi, who is expected to be elected chair of the European parliament\u2019s UK delegation on Thursday, said: \u201cThe momentum for positive change created by prime minister Starmer\u2019s election and a new European commission should not be wasted, but this will require boldness and flexibility from the UK government.\u201d The UK has an existing youth mobility scheme with a dozen countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Korea.",

Fashion for Relief put on a spectacular star-studded fashion show and charity auction held at the British Museum in 2019 at which it said it was working with the global children\u2019s charity to raise funds for it and a third charity, the Mayor\u2019s Fund for London. However, Unicef UK said it had never been a partner of Fashion for Relief, had been unaware of the event, and received no proceeds from the fundraiser.

It said Campbell had never held an official role with the charity. Campbell received a five-year ban from running a charity last week after a highly critical commission inquiry revealed financial misconduct and chaotic management at Fashion for Relief, the charity she founded and was a trustee for. The inquiry report revealed Fashion for Relief had raised nearly \u00a34.8m in five years up to 2020 but gave just a fraction of the \u00a34.6m it spent on charitable activities \u2013 10% \u2013 to partner charities in the form of grants.

      "body": "<p>Any motorist or dog-walker traversing the narrow lanes around Denise Coates\u2019 home in Cheshire would most likely stray within range of one of the many CCTV cameras that jut out from the surrounding foliage. These towering hedgerows, interrupted by sturdy security fences, hide not a military base or a top secret research facility but a family home, albeit one of immense proportions.</p> <p>The 21-hectare (52-acre) estate is large enough to accommodate landing space for the helicopters that neighbours have seen ferrying people in and out. Inside the gates, there is a lake, boathouse, tennis courts, horse stables and a treehouse with a zip wire, according to local planning applications and architectural plans.</p> <p>The owner of this complex is Britain\u2019s richest woman and the multi-billionaire mastermind behind the Bet365 online gambling empire. Coates\u2019 renown is such that one expert says people in the gambling industry rarely even refer to Bet365, but simply \u201cDenise\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an indicator of her almost mythical status,\u201d says Alun Bowden, a gambling consultant at Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, which provides research for the industry. \u201cNobody tries to copy her, because there is no point. You can\u2019t. She\u2019s unique.\u201d</p> <p>Coates\u2019 status has not deterred unkind comments from some neighbours. One says her home looks like a Tesco Extra superstore. No, says another, it\u2019s \u201cmore like an Aldi depot\u201d.</p> <p>All in all, the house and grounds in which Coates, her husband and their five children live are estimated to have cost close to \u00a390m. Building began in 2019 and did not stop until this year. The project was overseen by the practice of renowned architect Norman Foster, the man behind London\u2019s Gherkin, Wembley Stadium and Berlin\u2019s Reichstag. It hasn\u2019t won Coates too many friends in the area. Months of road closures have infuriated drivers and horse-riding enthusiasts. One local, who described the work as a \u201cpain in the arse\u201d, says: \u201cAt least she retarmacked the road \u2013 but she could have brought round a bottle of wine.\u201d</p> <p>Still, there were millions on the table for neighbours who were willing to sell up. Coates spent more than \u00a38.5m buying surrounding land so she couldn\u2019t be overlooked \u2013 and many local farmers took the money. However, Coates is shrewd. One neighbour says they ended up in a stalemate with her after refusing a bid for their land. \u201cShe\u2019s a clever woman,\u201d they said. \u201cShe\u2019ll offer more than it\u2019s worth but not 10 times more.\u201d</p> <p>However, other than those directly affected by Coates\u2019 building work, there aren\u2019t many people in and around Stoke-on-Trent with a bad word to say about her. Stoke is an agglomeration of six towns that once sat at the heart of the global pottery industry, home to Wedgwood, Portmeirion and Spode. Ceramics delivered prosperity to the region in the 18th century, while coal and steel brought more growth as the Industrial Revolution progressed. But the slow decline of British industry saw the boom times vanish and Stoke declined with it. The emergence of Bet365 has been one of the city\u2019s rare recent success stories.</p> <p>Bet365 \u201cdirectly and indirectly\u201d supports about 12,000 jobs in the city, says Mark Gregory, a former chief economist at global accounting giant EY, who was born and raised in Stoke. His estimate includes jobs at Stoke City football club, which is owned by Coates\u2019 brother John. That\u2019s about \u201c10% of employment\u201d, he says. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s a higher-wage company, even more than that in terms of value.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a huge generator of wealth locally,\u201d says Jeff Nash, who owns the local office and hospitality complex Potbank, on the site of the former Spode pottery factory. \u201cIf you\u2019re a graduate, you can look at Bet365 and want to stay in Stoke. That\u2019s the future.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Jackson, who runs creative agency i-Creation from an office in Potbank, praises the work Coates has put in to improve maths skills in the city, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/23/stoke-council-and-bet365-launch-1m-scheme-to-attract-maths-teachers\">including funding for a scheme to attract maths teachers</a> in partnership with the council. \u201cShe was really clear about 10 years ago that for Bet365 to have a talent pool to work for them, numeracy was important. They put their money where their mouth was.\u201d</p> <p>But perhaps the most reputation-enhancing investment the Coates family made was when they bought Stoke City FC for \u00a31.7m in 2006. It has always been very much a family affair: Peter was joint chairman with Denise\u2019s brother John, until a restructuring that saw John take full control of the club this year. Denise\u2019s husband, Richard, is responsible for the stadium and training ground. The family\u2019s smart stewardship and financial muscle helped elevate Stoke up a division to the Premier League in 2008, where they stayed for a decade before relegation in 2018. The Coates family does not just bankroll the team \u2013 it even pays for free travel for fans who want to attend away games.</p> <p>Few of those fans will have followed Stoke for longer than 81-year-old <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65383711\">Nigel Johnson</a>, a former schoolteacher turned football commentator who covered Stoke for the BBC over more than five decades until his retirement last year. Johnson says he is grateful for the \u201cfantastic amount of money\u201d that the Coates family has pumped into the club he loves. </p>    <p>But it is more than that. \u201cWhen I watch cricket from Cape Town or Sydney, I see the Bet365 logo flashing round the stadium and it\u2019s like it\u2019s Stoke\u2019s name up in lights,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Denise Coates was born and bred in the Stoke area, and the seat of her family power remains here, in the shape of a sparkling, 2,400-seat headquarters proudly displaying the Bet365 name to passing traffic, as it rises from the centre of a sprawling complex that also includes a training centre.</p> <p>Coates was 33 when she began building her online betting empire in 2000 from a portable building in a car park in the city. Within a few years she transformed the British gambling landscape, recognising that the future lay not in high street bookies but online \u2013 allowing users around the world to place bets at any hour of day or night, every day of the year. Perhaps her biggest coup was Bet365\u2019s development and perfection of in-play betting, a product that invites punters to wager in real time on minute-by-minute action, such as who will win the next corner in a football match, or the next point in a game of tennis. It is now the most ubiquitous form of online gambling.</p> <p>It has certainly made Coates rich. Together with her family, the 57-year-old is estimated to be worth \u00a37.5bn, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. She is almost as famous for her record-breaking pay packets as her entrepreneurial talent. In 2021, she took home \u00a3469m. This year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/08/billionaire-bet365-boss-pockets-further-270m-payday\">it was \u00a3271m</a>. In total, she has extracted about \u00a32.5bn in pay and dividends from the company.</p> <p>Denise was, from a young age, very good with numbers. David Owen, who taught Coates maths in the 1980s at Sandbach High School, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b09jxn5m\">told the BBC</a> that she was a \u201ctop-of-the-range\u201d student. \u201cIf we were talking Mensa, she\u2019d be in the top 1% \u2026 She was going somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Her father, Peter, the son of a miner, was a moderately successful local businessman who made his money in the catering industry, serving up burgers and pies to hungry fans at football stadiums (Coates\u2019 mother, Deirdre, is a director of the family catering business now). Peter also owned a string of betting shops \u2013 Provincial Racing \u2013 where Coates worked during her holidays. It was here that she honed her business acumen, working as a cashier and gaining an intuitive understanding of how bets were priced and what kept punters coming back.</p> <p>She graduated from the University of Sheffield with a first-class econometrics degree and returned to Stoke, where she sought to move her dad\u2019s gambling business online. She bought the domain name Bet365.com from eBay for $25,000, borrowed \u00a315m against the Coates family\u2019s bricks-and-mortar stores, and invested it all in sports betting technology.</p> <p>By 2005, Bet365 had sold off its high street shops \u2013 for \u00a340m \u2013 to focus entirely on its web offering, which would expand beyond sports betting to casino games such as roulette and digital slot machines. The timing could not have been better. First, Labour introduced a broadly permissive overhaul of Britain\u2019s gambling laws in 2005, triggering a surge in marketing and advertising that dragged betting out of the realm of smoke-filled bookmakers and firmly into the mainstream. The arrival of the smartphone \u2013 the iPhone hit the market in 2007 \u2013 would soon put a casino in every pocket.</p>    <p>Before long, Bet365.com was bringing in punters in their droves, leaving established but slower-moving rivals such as Ladbrokes and William Hill struggling to catch up. In the 2006-07 financial year, the last before Labour\u2019s reform of gambling laws took effect, Bet365 booked revenues of \u00a391m. By 2012, the year Coates was awarded a CBE for services to the community and business, they had reached \u00a3648m. Last year, it soared past the \u00a33bn mark. Savvy marketing helped it along its way, especially the ubiquitous slots during football broadcasts, featuring the actor Ray Winstone, who began urging fans to \u201cBet in play, now\u201d in 2009.</p> <p>The company no longer discloses how many wagers are placed on its products, but the last time it did, in 2018-19, \u00a364bn worth of bets were made worldwide in just one year. The Gambling Commission estimated the total volume of all online wagers placed in Britain that year at \u00a3118bn.</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Head just one mile north of the Bet365 headquarters on the A53 and you will come to the <a href=\"https://www.midlandsgamblingclinic.org/\">West Midlands Gambling Harms Clinic</a>.

Demand for their services has <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/big-rise-in-gambling-addictions-g6nd7jkmp\">risen dramatically</a> in recent years. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/07/tax-gambling-firms-to-fund-addiction-treatment-says-nhs-director\">warned that it was being left to \u201cpick up the pieces\u201d</a> of the gambling industry. Experts have been particularly vocal about the boom of online gambling, in particular in-play betting and products such as digital slot machines, which are designed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/12/what-gambling-firms-dont-want-you-to-know-and-how-they-keep-you-hooked\">deploy an arsenal of psychological tricks</a> to boost profits.</p> <p>\u201cThese features have been called \u2018addiction by design\u2019,\u201d says Prof Heather Wardle of the University of Glasgow, one of the UK\u2019s leading experts on gambling-related harm. \u201cThe features which make these games so immersive are the same features which make them harmful.\u201d According to <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/Global/CitizensAdvice/Debt%20and%20Money%20Publications/Evening%20the%20Odds.pdf\">Citizens Advice</a>, some 18% \u2013 or 3.3 million \u2013 of online gamblers in Britain are in debt, owing \u00a310,000 on average. In 2021, Public Health England estimated that there are 400 gambling-related suicides each year in England alone: more than one every day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/20/gambling-addiction-tennis-bet365-online-betting-hannah-jane-parkinson\">Game, set, bankrupt: how an addiction to gambling on tennis lost me \u00a340,000</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I meet Mark on a Zoom call at the Stoke gambling harms clinic, where he is a client. He is in his late 30s, and came into some money after he and his ex-wife divorced and sold their home. He had always gambled in bookmakers but during the pandemic, when shops were shut, he started gambling online, something he\u2019d never done before. He soon found that the online experience was far more intense. \u201cIt\u2019s the casino in your pocket that never goes away. You can do it on the toilet, at work, on your lunch break, at home while watching TV, in bed when you wake up. So Covid didn\u2019t help because I needed the escape.\u201d </p> <p>For a gambling problem to start to become an addiction, \u201cyou need time, you need money and you need opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I had all three, it was a recipe for disaster.\u201d The exact amount Mark lost over the course of 18 months, is irrelevant, he says. \u201cIt was tens of thousands, but if I\u2019d had a million I\u2019d have gambled that. I would lose a month\u2019s salary in a few minutes.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, he and his new partner were each saving for a deposit on a house together. Mark lost the lot. Telling her that the money was gone was \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, including watching my dad die. Her initial reaction was shock because she didn\u2019t understand. Not one single other person knew \u2026 Gambling wants you on your own. It was the dirty little secret.\u201d</p> <p>Clinics such as the West Midlands one where Mark is being treated have a colossal task on their hands to mop up the industry\u2019s collateral damage. The <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2022-03-28/debates/8769891E-1F28-4D3B-9596-B930877F8B1A/NHSGamblingTreatmentServices\">annual budget for all 15 new NHS clinics</a> is just \u00a36.75m. Or, to put it another way, less than a day\u2019s worth of revenue at Bet365.</p> <p>Sammy, also in his late 30s, is another client here, and a former customer of Bet365, among other operators. Sammy grew up surrounded by gambling, whether it was horse racing, 2p pushers at the funfair or fruit machines in the pub. But it was online casino games that tipped him over the edge. \u201cI opened accounts in my mum\u2019s name, my dad\u2019s, my brother\u2019s. I had credit cards with different limits,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a gambler, you\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p>    <p>Sammy\u2019s particular favourite was online games of blackjack \u2013 he loved the thrill of winning or losing within a matter of seconds. \u201c I remember the excitement of having \u00a35,000 at the tip of my fingers. I used to kid myself that I could turn it into \u00a350,000.\u201d</p> <p>Like many gamblers, Sammy tried to quit. But gambling companies know what works to retain customers. One of the most controversial tactics online businesses offer is \u201cfree\u201d spins and bonuses. \u201cThey\u2019d do everything and anything they can to keep you gambling. And you think it\u2019s fine because you\u2019re not using your own money, but then you do start using your own money.</p> <p>\u201cI joined about 20 to 25 companies because they\u2019d match your deposit. My thought process was that if I join 10 companies and deposit \u00a350 into each, I\u2019ve doubled my money straight away. And that\u2019s how they entice you in.\u201d</p> <p>One month, Sammy used his month\u2019s salary to build up winnings of about \u00a32,000. Inevitably, he lost it. \u201cI used both mine and my wife\u2019s wages to get it back. And then I lost that. I remember thinking: I\u2019ve got no funds, I\u2019m going to have to tell my wife. There was nothing left for the month \u2026 I\u2019d have to take out another loan.\u201d It was a Sunday night and his wife was giving their two young children a bath. <em>\u201c</em>My heart was pounding out of my chest. I thought: \u2018It\u2019s now or never.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t find another way out. I just said: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gambling addiction.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Sammy is benefiting from treatment at the West Midlands clinic but still finds it hard to escape the relentless bombardment of gambling adverts. A massive Liverpool FC fan, he is surrounded by club memorabilia when we speak online. He believes he sees more gambling advertising because of his online activities. \u201cI see it on Twitter all the time \u2013 famous footballers doing ads for bookmakers. You think you can get away from it, but it\u2019s everywhere. Join now and get a bonus boost, or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>The gambling industry, and Bet365 in particular, has targeted football relentlessly. Gambling adverts saturate TV, radio and podcasts and scroll relentlessly across pitchside hoardings in stadiums. Most clubs now have an official betting partner and some have even taken a cut of fans\u2019 losses under commercial arrangements with sponsors. The demographic, young and male, also happens to be the cohort most likely to suffer from a gambling addiction \u2013 not just the fans but the players, too.</p> <p>Some players have no choice but to wear betting companies\u2019 logos on the front of their shirts, despite several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/24/betting-in-football-fa-rules-players-owners\">high-profile cases of star footballers</a> \u2013 from Michael Owen to Wayne Rooney \u2013 speaking publicly about their struggles with gambling addiction. Nowhere is the symbiotic relationship more evident than at Stoke City FC, which is owned by the Bet365 group and plays at the Bet365 stadium, where the players run out with Bet365 emblazoned across their chests.</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Bet365 may be hard to escape in Britain, particularly for football fans, but Denise Coates keeps a much lower profile. The last time Britain\u2019s most successful businesswoman gave an interview was to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/08/denise-coates-woman-bet365-gambling\">the Guardian</a>, 12 years ago. She does not often make public appearances or speak at business conferences. Bet365 is a private business, so there are no annual shareholder meetings. The rare times she is seen are in publicity images announcing donations made by her charity, the Denise Coates Foundation. And so this vacuum of information has been filled by myth-making.</p> <p>One oft-repeated line features an Aston Martin DB9 sports car, with a personalised number plate, that is sometimes spotted in the Bet365 car park. The car appears in almost every written profile of Coates, a totem for a billionaire\u2019s apparent flamboyance. However, according to one person close to Coates, who has asked not to be named, the story is \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. The car does exist, but it is not hers \u2013 it\u2019s a close family member\u2019s. \u201cShe likes being anonymous,\u201d says the source. \u201cThe idea she\u2019d have an Aston Martin with DC365 on the numberplate, driving around Stoke, is so far opposite of what she\u2019s like. She\u2019s a very low-profile sort of person.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Coates is a woman of multiple contradictions. On the one hand, she is a poster child for corporate excess, with her staggering pay packets. On the other, she is one of Britain\u2019s biggest taxpayers \u2013 choosing to put most of her vast income through Bet365\u2019s payroll rather than hiding it away from tax authorities like many other billionaires.</p> <p>To some, she has built her vast fortune creating and marketing blatantly addictive gambling products, shattering the lives of punters and their families. And yet she puts a considerable amount of her company\u2019s profit into charities and her local community, funding school numeracy programmes and generating high-paying jobs in a city that lacks alternative sources of wealth and skills.</p> <p>She is known as a formidable entrepreneur who, in a male-dominated industry, can easily \u201chold a room of grown men\u201d, according to one source. And yet those who have worked for her for decades say she is a considerate manager to her employees, and \u201cgenuinely cares about them and supports them\u201d.</p> <p>Her politics, too, might surprise some observers. Coates is not the type to pontificate on politics, according to one person who knows her. However, records show her father and companies within the Bet365 group have given a combined \u00a3480,000 to Labour over the years, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/nov/10/uk.gambling\">\u00a350,000 in 2004</a>, the year before Labour finalised the details of the Gambling Act. More recently, Peter Coates gave \u00a325,000 to Starmer\u2019s leadership campaign.</p> <p>In the months leading up to the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/28/tory-betting-scandal-labour-gambling-industry-regulation\">Bet365 gave \u00a3512,500 to the campaign for Britain to remain</a> in the EU. Neither the Coates family nor the company has spoken publicly about this donation. </p> <p>Bet365 has made friends in the Conservative party, too. In 2022, the then Stoke-on-Trent North MP, Jonathan Gullis, was forced to apologise to the chair of a Westminster Hall debate on gambling harms after admitting not only that he was reading directly from a Bet365 briefing paper in parliament, but also that he had failed to declare \u00a3540 worth of tickets he had received from the company that year to see Stoke City play Fulham in the Championship, a competition sponsored by another betting company, SkyBet.</p> <p>Aaron Bell, formerly the Conservative MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, had an even closer relationship with the company. He worked for Bet365 from 2006 until he won a parliamentary seat in 2019 \u2013 and called for caution over proposed reform of the gambling industry in parliament, until he stood down in 2024.</p> <p>During the same Westminster Hall debate on gambling-related harm, Bell insisted that he was \u201cnot a spokesperson for the gambling industry\u201d but went on to list Bet365\u2019s virtues, including its record of going \u201cabove and beyond\u201d on safer gambling measures, its roots in the Stoke community and Coates\u2019 tax contribution.</p> <p>The family\u2019s tax bill is something of a source of pride \u2013 and potential political leverage. The company\u2019s submission to a select committee inquiry in 2023 read: \u201cOur founders are the second highest taxpayers in the UK.\u201d Not everyone is impressed by this. As Scottish National party MP Ronnie Cowan put it in the Westminster Hall debate: \u201cIf I earned a billion pounds, I would make sure I paid my tax as well.\u201d</p> <p>While Coates and her family had dropped to third place on the most recent <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/tax-list-2024-uk-biggest-taxpayers-ztf9bjqmq\">Sunday Times tax list</a>, they are still estimated to have paid \u00a3376m to the exchequer last year. A sizeable chunk of that contribution comes from Coates\u2019 enormous pay packets, which she puts through Bet365\u2019s payroll, meaning she gets taxed at the 45% additional rate of income tax.</p> <p>\u201cThat is very different from many of Britain\u2019s billionaires,\u201d says Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre. \u201cThat said, that level of wealth remains unsettling. It\u2019s far beyond what any reasonable person might consider a fair or proportionate reward or incentive for business success.\u201d</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Liz Ritchie and her husband, Charles, set up the charity <a href=\"https://www.gamblingwithlives.org/\">Gambling With Lives</a> in 2018 after they lost their son Jack to suicide when he became addicted to gambling, first in bookies and later online. The charity seeks to help other people bereaved through gambling addiction and is a key campaigner pushing for reform to online gambling.</p> <p>\u201cAddiction underpins the industry\u2019s business model,\u201d says Ritchie. \u201cThe most addictive products, such as online slots, are aggressively marketed, and income from these has grown by 8.5% over the past year. Meanwhile, gambling suicides continue every day. How have we ended up in a situation where gambling companies thrive by putting the public in such danger?\u201d</p> <p>Despite being in recovery from gambling addiction, Sammy says he still gets \u201cloads of text messages from gambling companies. I have to delete and report them. It feels like your phone is being tracked or monitored.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, many gambling firms have fallen foul of the Gambling Commission regulator over their apparent failure to use the wealth of information they hold about people like Sammy to prevent harm. In 2022, SkyBet was fined \u00a31.2m for sending promotional messages to gamblers who had signed up for a voluntary self-exclusion scheme to block themselves from betting sites.</p> <p>Bet365 has felt the wrath of the regulator less often than many of its rivals, but it is not blameless. In April, it agreed to pay \u00a3582,120 for failures in its anti-money laundering and social responsibility checks \u2013 which included a failure to deploy its technological prowess to stage \u201cmeaningful\u201d interactions with customers who might be suffering harm.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a loyal customer,\u201d says Sammy. But gambling firms \u201cdon\u2019t give a toss about you. They just want you to keep playing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Coates has established a reputation as a very generous woman. The Denise Coates Foundation was set up in August 2012. According to the charity\u2019s regulatory filings, she has put about \u00a3752m into it. Recipients of the foundation\u2019s cash include Stoke\u2019s Douglas Macmillan hospice (known locally as the Dougie Mac), numerous medical research and treatment projects, disaster relief funds and university bursaries for people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p>There are artistic endeavours, too. The New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, just outside Stoke, is a regular beneficiary, while Coates also funded Tate Britain\u2019s purchase of four watercolours by the women\u2019s rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst, marking the centenary of women\u2019s suffrage in 1918. London\u2019s Courtauld Gallery features a space that bears Denise Coates\u2019 name.</p>    <p>Charities addressing gambling-related harm are not listed among the beneficiaries of the foundation\u2019s largesse, however, although Bet365 does fund such services through other means, including a voluntary industry levy.</p> <p>Some recipients of the foundation\u2019s charity are close to home. At least \u00a3700,000 has gone to the Hassall Green Nature Reserve in Cheshire. Keele University and the Sandbach Gymnastics Foundation both boast a Denise Coates Foundation Building, the name of their benefactor writ large on the external walls. Coates may abhor the spotlight but where her philanthropy is concerned, she is less shy about leaving her mark.</p> <p>Coates\u2019 foundation has donated several times to the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (Cafod), the official aid agency of the Catholic church. One person who has spent time with Coates says they have never seen her display any outward sign of religious sentiment, but her grandfather Leonard, a veteran of the first world war, was a Catholic. The Catholic Herald lists Peter and Denise Coates among the faith\u2019s \u201cleaders of the day\u201d.<em> </em></p> <p>The Denise Coates Foundation has actually donated a relatively small proportion of its reserves \u2013 about \u00a378m \u2013 since 2013, while amassing an endowment fund of \u00a3730m through cash injections from companies in the Bet365 group. In its accounts, the charity puts this down to a policy of ensuring that it earns enough through investments to make sure the charity is self-sustaining and not \u201cdependent on donations from any one source\u201d. That point of self-sufficiency might have been reached sooner, were it not for the fund losing \u00a326.8m in the last financial year as a result of the poor performance of its investments.</p> <p>The foundation\u2019s strategy is unlikely to be called into question, though. Every one of its trustees is a member of the Coates family, or one of their employees.</p> <p>The charity may come with more benefits to Coates than the warm glow of altruism. Guardian analysis suggests that her philanthropy may have helped save the Bet365 group \u00a3140m in tax, far more than the foundation has yet donated to good causes.</p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <p>Where next for Coates? The Bet365 juggernaut certainly shows no signs of slowing down. From that portable cabin in a car park, Coates has pieced together an empire that stretches from Stanley Matthews Way in Stoke to Sydney, with offices in Frankfurt, Bogot\u00e1 and Sofia. Now, she has her sights set on perhaps her biggest conquest yet: the US.</p> <p>The growth of US sports betting has been meteoric since 2018, when the Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that had essentially banned the practice. Predictably, Coates moved fast \u2013 Bet365 is now available in 10 states with a combined population of more than 85 million people. Some analysts have predicted that California, one of 12 states where sports betting remains illegal, would be a bigger market than the whole of the UK. The Coates territory has plenty of room to grow.</p> <p>Bet365 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/nov/21/are-chinese-punters-big-users-of-bet365\">refuses to disclose</a> the geographical breakdown of its earnings, claiming it would be \u201cprejudicial\u201d to its interests. But as one person familiar with the company\u2019s operations put it: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to declare the geographic breakdown of your business, why would you?\u201d</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/03/bet365-profit-china-online-gambling\">Guardian revealed in 2014</a>, Bet365 appears to make significant income from China, categorised as a \u201cgrey\u201d market in the gambling industry, because betting is a criminal offence there. Indeed, the Guardian also reported that some Bet365 customers had been arrested after apparently placing bets on the Bet365 website, while bloggers who promoted the company were jailed.</p> <p>The company faced no repercussions, perhaps because, as Bet365 pointed out at the time, it does not have any physical assets or staff in China. And, as a digital business with cross-border reach, it is able to stay well out of the range of any effort at enforcement action by Beijing, which has cracked down hard on domestic betting businesses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bet365 continues to recruit Chinese speakers for its call centres in Stoke, according to job adverts posted online. It appears to look after them well, too. Land Registry records show that the company owns a vast property empire in Stoke, comprising more than 71 separate land titles, some of which are residential addresses where, according to locals, some of its imported personnel are housed.

      "bodyText": "Any motorist or dog-walker traversing the narrow lanes around Denise Coates\u2019 home in Cheshire would most likely stray within range of one of the many CCTV cameras that jut out from the surrounding foliage. These towering hedgerows, interrupted by sturdy security fences, hide not a military base or a top secret research facility but a family home, albeit one of immense proportions. The 21-hectare (52-acre) estate is large enough to accommodate landing space for the helicopters that neighbours have seen ferrying people in and out. Inside the gates, there is a lake, boathouse, tennis courts, horse stables and a treehouse with a zip wire, according to local planning applications and architectural plans. The owner of this complex is Britain\u2019s richest woman and the multi-billionaire mastermind behind the Bet365 online gambling empire. Coates\u2019 renown is such that one expert says people in the gambling industry rarely even refer to Bet365, but simply \u201cDenise\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an indicator of her almost mythical status,\u201d says Alun Bowden, a gambling consultant at Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, which provides research for the industry. \u201cNobody tries to copy her, because there is no point. You can\u2019t. She\u2019s unique.\u201d Coates\u2019 status has not deterred unkind comments from some neighbours. One says her home looks like a Tesco Extra superstore. No, says another, it\u2019s \u201cmore like an Aldi depot\u201d. All in all, the house and grounds in which Coates, her husband and their five children live are estimated to have cost close to \u00a390m. Building began in 2019 and did not stop until this year. The project was overseen by the practice of renowned architect Norman Foster, the man behind London\u2019s Gherkin, Wembley Stadium and Berlin\u2019s Reichstag. It hasn\u2019t won Coates too many friends in the area. Months of road closures have infuriated drivers and horse-riding enthusiasts. One local, who described the work as a \u201cpain in the arse\u201d, says: \u201cAt least she retarmacked the road \u2013 but she could have brought round a bottle of wine.\u201d Still, there were millions on the table for neighbours who were willing to sell up. Coates spent more than \u00a38.5m buying surrounding land so she couldn\u2019t be overlooked \u2013 and many local farmers took the money. However, Coates is shrewd. One neighbour says they ended up in a stalemate with her after refusing a bid for their land. \u201cShe\u2019s a clever woman,\u201d they said. \u201cShe\u2019ll offer more than it\u2019s worth but not 10 times more.\u201d However, other than those directly affected by Coates\u2019 building work, there aren\u2019t many people in and around Stoke-on-Trent with a bad word to say about her. Stoke is an agglomeration of six towns that once sat at the heart of the global pottery industry, home to Wedgwood, Portmeirion and Spode. Ceramics delivered prosperity to the region in the 18th century, while coal and steel brought more growth as the Industrial Revolution progressed. But the slow decline of British industry saw the boom times vanish and Stoke declined with it. The emergence of Bet365 has been one of the city\u2019s rare recent success stories. Bet365 \u201cdirectly and indirectly\u201d supports about 12,000 jobs in the city, says Mark Gregory, a former chief economist at global accounting giant EY, who was born and raised in Stoke. His estimate includes jobs at Stoke City football club, which is owned by Coates\u2019 brother John. That\u2019s about \u201c10% of employment\u201d, he says. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s a higher-wage company, even more than that in terms of value.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a huge generator of wealth locally,\u201d says Jeff Nash, who owns the local office and hospitality complex Potbank, on the site of the former Spode pottery factory. \u201cIf you\u2019re a graduate, you can look at Bet365 and want to stay in Stoke. That\u2019s the future.\u201d Andy Jackson, who runs creative agency i-Creation from an office in Potbank, praises the work Coates has put in to improve maths skills in the city, including funding for a scheme to attract maths teachers in partnership with the council. \u201cShe was really clear about 10 years ago that for Bet365 to have a talent pool to work for them, numeracy was important. They put their money where their mouth was.\u201d But perhaps the most reputation-enhancing investment the Coates family made was when they bought Stoke City FC for \u00a31.7m in 2006. It has always been very much a family affair: Peter was joint chairman with Denise\u2019s brother John, until a restructuring that saw John take full control of the club this year. Denise\u2019s husband, Richard, is responsible for the stadium and training ground. The family\u2019s smart stewardship and financial muscle helped elevate Stoke up a division to the Premier League in 2008, where they stayed for a decade before relegation in 2018. The Coates family does not just bankroll the team \u2013 it even pays for free travel for fans who want to attend away games. Few of those fans will have followed Stoke for longer than 81-year-old Nigel Johnson, a former schoolteacher turned football commentator who covered Stoke for the BBC over more than five decades until his retirement last year. Johnson says he is grateful for the \u201cfantastic amount of money\u201d that the Coates family has pumped into the club he loves. But it is more than that. \u201cWhen I watch cricket from Cape Town or Sydney, I see the Bet365 logo flashing round the stadium and it\u2019s like it\u2019s Stoke\u2019s name up in lights,\u201d he says. * * * Denise Coates was born and bred in the Stoke area, and the seat of her family power remains here, in the shape of a sparkling, 2,400-seat headquarters proudly displaying the Bet365 name to passing traffic, as it rises from the centre of a sprawling complex that also includes a training centre. Coates was 33 when she began building her online betting empire in 2000 from a portable building in a car park in the city. Within a few years she transformed the British gambling landscape, recognising that the future lay not in high street bookies but online \u2013 allowing users around the world to place bets at any hour of day or night, every day of the year. Perhaps her biggest coup was Bet365\u2019s development and perfection of in-play betting, a product that invites punters to wager in real time on minute-by-minute action, such as who will win the next corner in a football match, or the next point in a game of tennis. It is now the most ubiquitous form of online gambling. It has certainly made Coates rich. Together with her family, the 57-year-old is estimated to be worth \u00a37.5bn, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. She is almost as famous for her record-breaking pay packets as her entrepreneurial talent. In 2021, she took home \u00a3469m. This year, it was \u00a3271m. In total, she has extracted about \u00a32.5bn in pay and dividends from the company. Denise was, from a young age, very good with numbers. David Owen, who taught Coates maths in the 1980s at Sandbach High School, told the BBC that she was a \u201ctop-of-the-range\u201d student. \u201cIf we were talking Mensa, she\u2019d be in the top 1% \u2026 She was going somewhere.\u201d Her father, Peter, the son of a miner, was a moderately successful local businessman who made his money in the catering industry, serving up burgers and pies to hungry fans at football stadiums (Coates\u2019 mother, Deirdre, is a director of the family catering business now). Peter also owned a string of betting shops \u2013 Provincial Racing \u2013 where Coates worked during her holidays. It was here that she honed her business acumen, working as a cashier and gaining an intuitive understanding of how bets were priced and what kept punters coming back. She graduated from the University of Sheffield with a first-class econometrics degree and returned to Stoke, where she sought to move her dad\u2019s gambling business online. She bought the domain name Bet365.com from eBay for $25,000, borrowed \u00a315m against the Coates family\u2019s bricks-and-mortar stores, and invested it all in sports betting technology. By 2005, Bet365 had sold off its high street shops \u2013 for \u00a340m \u2013 to focus entirely on its web offering, which would expand beyond sports betting to casino games such as roulette and digital slot machines. The timing could not have been better. First, Labour introduced a broadly permissive overhaul of Britain\u2019s gambling laws in 2005, triggering a surge in marketing and advertising that dragged betting out of the realm of smoke-filled bookmakers and firmly into the mainstream. The arrival of the smartphone \u2013 the iPhone hit the market in 2007 \u2013 would soon put a casino in every pocket. Before long, Bet365.com was bringing in punters in their droves, leaving established but slower-moving rivals such as Ladbrokes and William Hill struggling to catch up. In the 2006-07 financial year, the last before Labour\u2019s reform of gambling laws took effect, Bet365 booked revenues of \u00a391m. By 2012, the year Coates was awarded a CBE for services to the community and business, they had reached \u00a3648m. Last year, it soared past the \u00a33bn mark. Savvy marketing helped it along its way, especially the ubiquitous slots during football broadcasts, featuring the actor Ray Winstone, who began urging fans to \u201cBet in play, now\u201d in 2009. The company no longer discloses how many wagers are placed on its products, but the last time it did, in 2018-19, \u00a364bn worth of bets were made worldwide in just one year. The Gambling Commission estimated the total volume of all online wagers placed in Britain that year at \u00a3118bn. * * * Head just one mile north of the Bet365 headquarters on the A53 and you will come to the West Midlands Gambling Harms Clinic. Here, wedged into a few low-ceilinged rooms of a community health centre, experts sift through the human wreckage left behind by companies such as Bet365. There may be more than a million people with a gambling problem in Britain, including 55,000 children, according to estimates. Punters\u2019 losses, worth \u00a311bn a year to the gambling industry, are disproportionately skewed towards more economically deprived areas, such as Stoke. The clinic in Stoke opened in October 2022, part of a nationwide rollout of new NHS clinics for people suffering from addiction and other gambling-related harm. Demand for their services has risen dramatically in recent years. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the NHS warned that it was being left to \u201cpick up the pieces\u201d of the gambling industry. Experts have been particularly vocal about the boom of online gambling, in particular in-play betting and products such as digital slot machines, which are designed to deploy an arsenal of psychological tricks to boost profits. \u201cThese features have been called \u2018addiction by design\u2019,\u201d says Prof Heather Wardle of the University of Glasgow, one of the UK\u2019s leading experts on gambling-related harm. \u201cThe features which make these games so immersive are the same features which make them harmful.\u201d According to Citizens Advice, some 18% \u2013 or 3.3 million \u2013 of online gamblers in Britain are in debt, owing \u00a310,000 on average. In 2021, Public Health England estimated that there are 400 gambling-related suicides each year in England alone: more than one every day. I meet Mark on a Zoom call at the Stoke gambling harms clinic, where he is a client. He is in his late 30s, and came into some money after he and his ex-wife divorced and sold their home. He had always gambled in bookmakers but during the pandemic, when shops were shut, he started gambling online, something he\u2019d never done before. He soon found that the online experience was far more intense. \u201cIt\u2019s the casino in your pocket that never goes away. You can do it on the toilet, at work, on your lunch break, at home while watching TV, in bed when you wake up. So Covid didn\u2019t help because I needed the escape.\u201d For a gambling problem to start to become an addiction, \u201cyou need time, you need money and you need opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I had all three, it was a recipe for disaster.\u201d The exact amount Mark lost over the course of 18 months, is irrelevant, he says. \u201cIt was tens of thousands, but if I\u2019d had a million I\u2019d have gambled that. I would lose a month\u2019s salary in a few minutes.\u201d At the time, he and his new partner were each saving for a deposit on a house together. Mark lost the lot. Telling her that the money was gone was \u201cthe hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, including watching my dad die. Her initial reaction was shock because she didn\u2019t understand. Not one single other person knew \u2026 Gambling wants you on your own. It was the dirty little secret.\u201d Clinics such as the West Midlands one where Mark is being treated have a colossal task on their hands to mop up the industry\u2019s collateral damage. The annual budget for all 15 new NHS clinics is just \u00a36.75m. Or, to put it another way, less than a day\u2019s worth of revenue at Bet365. Sammy, also in his late 30s, is another client here, and a former customer of Bet365, among other operators. Sammy grew up surrounded by gambling, whether it was horse racing, 2p pushers at the funfair or fruit machines in the pub. But it was online casino games that tipped him over the edge. \u201cI opened accounts in my mum\u2019s name, my dad\u2019s, my brother\u2019s. I had credit cards with different limits,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a gambler, you\u2019ll find a way.\u201d Sammy\u2019s particular favourite was online games of blackjack \u2013 he loved the thrill of winning or losing within a matter of seconds. \u201c I remember the excitement of having \u00a35,000 at the tip of my fingers. I used to kid myself that I could turn it into \u00a350,000.\u201d Like many gamblers, Sammy tried to quit. But gambling companies know what works to retain customers. One of the most controversial tactics online businesses offer is \u201cfree\u201d spins and bonuses. \u201cThey\u2019d do everything and anything they can to keep you gambling. And you think it\u2019s fine because you\u2019re not using your own money, but then you do start using your own money. \u201cI joined about 20 to 25 companies because they\u2019d match your deposit. My thought process was that if I join 10 companies and deposit \u00a350 into each, I\u2019ve doubled my money straight away. And that\u2019s how they entice you in.\u201d One month, Sammy used his month\u2019s salary to build up winnings of about \u00a32,000. Inevitably, he lost it. \u201cI used both mine and my wife\u2019s wages to get it back. And then I lost that. I remember thinking: I\u2019ve got no funds, I\u2019m going to have to tell my wife. There was nothing left for the month \u2026 I\u2019d have to take out another loan.\u201d It was a Sunday night and his wife was giving their two young children a bath. \u201cMy heart was pounding out of my chest. I thought: \u2018It\u2019s now or never.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t find another way out. I just said: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gambling addiction.\u2019\u201d Sammy is benefiting from treatment at the West Midlands clinic but still finds it hard to escape the relentless bombardment of gambling adverts. A massive Liverpool FC fan, he is surrounded by club memorabilia when we speak online. He believes he sees more gambling advertising because of his online activities. \u201cI see it on Twitter all the time \u2013 famous footballers doing ads for bookmakers. You think you can get away from it, but it\u2019s everywhere. Join now and get a bonus boost, or whatever.\u201d The gambling industry, and Bet365 in particular, has targeted football relentlessly. Gambling adverts saturate TV, radio and podcasts and scroll relentlessly across pitchside hoardings in stadiums. Most clubs now have an official betting partner and some have even taken a cut of fans\u2019 losses under commercial arrangements with sponsors. The demographic, young and male, also happens to be the cohort most likely to suffer from a gambling addiction \u2013 not just the fans but the players, too. Some players have no choice but to wear betting companies\u2019 logos on the front of their shirts, despite several high-profile cases of star footballers \u2013 from Michael Owen to Wayne Rooney \u2013 speaking publicly about their struggles with gambling addiction. Nowhere is the symbiotic relationship more evident than at Stoke City FC, which is owned by the Bet365 group and plays at the Bet365 stadium, where the players run out with Bet365 emblazoned across their chests. * * * Bet365 may be hard to escape in Britain, particularly for football fans, but Denise Coates keeps a much lower profile. The last time Britain\u2019s most successful businesswoman gave an interview was to the Guardian, 12 years ago. She does not often make public appearances or speak at business conferences. Bet365 is a private business, so there are no annual shareholder meetings. The rare times she is seen are in publicity images announcing donations made by her charity, the Denise Coates Foundation. And so this vacuum of information has been filled by myth-making. One oft-repeated line features an Aston Martin DB9 sports car, with a personalised number plate, that is sometimes spotted in the Bet365 car park. The car appears in almost every written profile of Coates, a totem for a billionaire\u2019s apparent flamboyance. However, according to one person close to Coates, who has asked not to be named, the story is \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. The car does exist, but it is not hers \u2013 it\u2019s a close family member\u2019s. \u201cShe likes being anonymous,\u201d says the source. \u201cThe idea she\u2019d have an Aston Martin with DC365 on the numberplate, driving around Stoke, is so far opposite of what she\u2019s like. She\u2019s a very low-profile sort of person.\u201d In many ways, Coates is a woman of multiple contradictions. On the one hand, she is a poster child for corporate excess, with her staggering pay packets. On the other, she is one of Britain\u2019s biggest taxpayers \u2013 choosing to put most of her vast income through Bet365\u2019s payroll rather than hiding it away from tax authorities like many other billionaires. To some, she has built her vast fortune creating and marketing blatantly addictive gambling products, shattering the lives of punters and their families. And yet she puts a considerable amount of her company\u2019s profit into charities and her local community, funding school numeracy programmes and generating high-paying jobs in a city that lacks alternative sources of wealth and skills. She is known as a formidable entrepreneur who, in a male-dominated industry, can easily \u201chold a room of grown men\u201d, according to one source. And yet those who have worked for her for decades say she is a considerate manager to her employees, and \u201cgenuinely cares about them and supports them\u201d. Her politics, too, might surprise some observers. Coates is not the type to pontificate on politics, according to one person who knows her. However, records show her father and companies within the Bet365 group have given a combined \u00a3480,000 to Labour over the years, starting with \u00a350,000 in 2004, the year before Labour finalised the details of the Gambling Act. More recently, Peter Coates gave \u00a325,000 to Starmer\u2019s leadership campaign. In the months leading up to the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum in 2016, Bet365 gave \u00a3512,500 to the campaign for Britain to remain in the EU. Neither the Coates family nor the company has spoken publicly about this donation. Bet365 has made friends in the Conservative party, too. In 2022, the then Stoke-on-Trent North MP, Jonathan Gullis, was forced to apologise to the chair of a Westminster Hall debate on gambling harms after admitting not only that he was reading directly from a Bet365 briefing paper in parliament, but also that he had failed to declare \u00a3540 worth of tickets he had received from the company that year to see Stoke City play Fulham in the Championship, a competition sponsored by another betting company, SkyBet. Aaron Bell, formerly the Conservative MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, had an even closer relationship with the company. He worked for Bet365 from 2006 until he won a parliamentary seat in 2019 \u2013 and called for caution over proposed reform of the gambling industry in parliament, until he stood down in 2024. During the same Westminster Hall debate on gambling-related harm, Bell insisted that he was \u201cnot a spokesperson for the gambling industry\u201d but went on to list Bet365\u2019s virtues, including its record of going \u201cabove and beyond\u201d on safer gambling measures, its roots in the Stoke community and Coates\u2019 tax contribution. The family\u2019s tax bill is something of a source of pride \u2013 and potential political leverage. The company\u2019s submission to a select committee inquiry in 2023 read: \u201cOur founders are the second highest taxpayers in the UK.\u201d Not everyone is impressed by this. As Scottish National party MP Ronnie Cowan put it in the Westminster Hall debate: \u201cIf I earned a billion pounds, I would make sure I paid my tax as well.\u201d While Coates and her family had dropped to third place on the most recent Sunday Times tax list, they are still estimated to have paid \u00a3376m to the exchequer last year. A sizeable chunk of that contribution comes from Coates\u2019 enormous pay packets, which she puts through Bet365\u2019s payroll, meaning she gets taxed at the 45% additional rate of income tax. \u201cThat is very different from many of Britain\u2019s billionaires,\u201d says Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre. \u201cThat said, that level of wealth remains unsettling. It\u2019s far beyond what any reasonable person might consider a fair or proportionate reward or incentive for business success.\u201d * * * Liz Ritchie and her husband, Charles, set up the charity Gambling With Lives in 2018 after they lost their son Jack to suicide when he became addicted to gambling, first in bookies and later online. The charity seeks to help other people bereaved through gambling addiction and is a key campaigner pushing for reform to online gambling. \u201cAddiction underpins the industry\u2019s business model,\u201d says Ritchie. \u201cThe most addictive products, such as online slots, are aggressively marketed, and income from these has grown by 8.5% over the past year. Meanwhile, gambling suicides continue every day. How have we ended up in a situation where gambling companies thrive by putting the public in such danger?\u201d Despite being in recovery from gambling addiction, Sammy says he still gets \u201cloads of text messages from gambling companies. I have to delete and report them. It feels like your phone is being tracked or monitored.\u201d Indeed, many gambling firms have fallen foul of the Gambling Commission regulator over their apparent failure to use the wealth of information they hold about people like Sammy to prevent harm. In 2022, SkyBet was fined \u00a31.2m for sending promotional messages to gamblers who had signed up for a voluntary self-exclusion scheme to block themselves from betting sites. Bet365 has felt the wrath of the regulator less often than many of its rivals, but it is not blameless. In April, it agreed to pay \u00a3582,120 for failures in its anti-money laundering and social responsibility checks \u2013 which included a failure to deploy its technological prowess to stage \u201cmeaningful\u201d interactions with customers who might be suffering harm. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be a loyal customer,\u201d says Sammy. But gambling firms \u201cdon\u2019t give a toss about you. They just want you to keep playing.\u201d * * * Coates has established a reputation as a very generous woman. The Denise Coates Foundation was set up in August 2012. According to the charity\u2019s regulatory filings, she has put about \u00a3752m into it. Recipients of the foundation\u2019s cash include Stoke\u2019s Douglas Macmillan hospice (known locally as the Dougie Mac), numerous medical research and treatment projects, disaster relief funds and university bursaries for people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. There are artistic endeavours, too. The New Vic theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, just outside Stoke, is a regular beneficiary, while Coates also funded Tate Britain\u2019s purchase of four watercolours by the women\u2019s rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst, marking the centenary of women\u2019s suffrage in 1918. London\u2019s Courtauld Gallery features a space that bears Denise Coates\u2019 name. Charities addressing gambling-related harm are not listed among the beneficiaries of the foundation\u2019s largesse, however, although Bet365 does fund such services through other means, including a voluntary industry levy. Some recipients of the foundation\u2019s charity are close to home. At least \u00a3700,000 has gone to the Hassall Green Nature Reserve in Cheshire. Keele University and the Sandbach Gymnastics Foundation both boast a Denise Coates Foundation Building, the name of their benefactor writ large on the external walls. Coates may abhor the spotlight but where her philanthropy is concerned, she is less shy about leaving her mark. Coates\u2019 foundation has donated several times to the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (Cafod), the official aid agency of the Catholic church. One person who has spent time with Coates says they have never seen her display any outward sign of religious sentiment, but her grandfather Leonard, a veteran of the first world war, was a Catholic. The Catholic Herald lists Peter and Denise Coates among the faith\u2019s \u201cleaders of the day\u201d. The Denise Coates Foundation has actually donated a relatively small proportion of its reserves \u2013 about \u00a378m \u2013 since 2013, while amassing an endowment fund of \u00a3730m through cash injections from companies in the Bet365 group. In its accounts, the charity puts this down to a policy of ensuring that it earns enough through investments to make sure the charity is self-sustaining and not \u201cdependent on donations from any one source\u201d. That point of self-sufficiency might have been reached sooner, were it not for the fund losing \u00a326.8m in the last financial year as a result of the poor performance of its investments. The foundation\u2019s strategy is unlikely to be called into question, though. Every one of its trustees is a member of the Coates family, or one of their employees. The charity may come with more benefits to Coates than the warm glow of altruism. Guardian analysis suggests that her philanthropy may have helped save the Bet365 group \u00a3140m in tax, far more than the foundation has yet donated to good causes. * * * Where next for Coates? The Bet365 juggernaut certainly shows no signs of slowing down. From that portable cabin in a car park, Coates has pieced together an empire that stretches from Stanley Matthews Way in Stoke to Sydney, with offices in Frankfurt, Bogot\u00e1 and Sofia. Now, she has her sights set on perhaps her biggest conquest yet: the US. The growth of US sports betting has been meteoric since 2018, when the Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that had essentially banned the practice. Predictably, Coates moved fast \u2013 Bet365 is now available in 10 states with a combined population of more than 85 million people. Some analysts have predicted that California, one of 12 states where sports betting remains illegal, would be a bigger market than the whole of the UK. The Coates territory has plenty of room to grow. Bet365 refuses to disclose the geographical breakdown of its earnings, claiming it would be \u201cprejudicial\u201d to its interests. But as one person familiar with the company\u2019s operations put it: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to declare the geographic breakdown of your business, why would you?\u201d As the Guardian revealed in 2014, Bet365 appears to make significant income from China, categorised as a \u201cgrey\u201d market in the gambling industry, because betting is a criminal offence there. Indeed, the Guardian also reported that some Bet365 customers had been arrested after apparently placing bets on the Bet365 website, while bloggers who promoted the company were jailed. The company faced no repercussions, perhaps because, as Bet365 pointed out at the time, it does not have any physical assets or staff in China. And, as a digital business with cross-border reach, it is able to stay well out of the range of any effort at enforcement action by Beijing, which has cracked down hard on domestic betting businesses. Meanwhile, Bet365 continues to recruit Chinese speakers for its call centres in Stoke, according to job adverts posted online. It appears to look after them well, too. Land Registry records show that the company owns a vast property empire in Stoke, comprising more than 71 separate land titles, some of which are residential addresses where, according to locals, some of its imported personnel are housed. With China offering more than 1 billion potential customers, housing for a few call centre staff may be a small price to pay. This approach \u2013 identifying a lucrative goal and then going hell for leather in pursuit of success \u2013 epitomises the ethos that has underpinned the Denise Coates story. \u201cIt\u2019s what Bet365 do: they are like a patient, aggressive poker player,\u201d says Bowden. \u201cThey think long and hard, and when they make their minds up that this is a good value bet, they go all in.\u201d Coates herself put it more succinctly in her 2012 interview with the Guardian: \u201cWe were the ultimate gamblers, if you like.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, support for problem gambling can be found via the NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic on 020 7381 7722, or GamCare on 0808 8020 133.

      "bodyText": "The Swedish government has been accused of trying to \u201coutlaw poverty\u201d after it presented plans for a national begging ban. The centre-right coalition, backed by the far-right Sweden Democrats, has announced a nine-month inquiry into the implementation of a national begging ban, saying that if it is deemed feasible such a prohibition could become law. At a press conference on Monday, the Sweden Democrats group leader, Linda Lindberg, took aim at people she claimed were coming from other EU countries \u201cto beg outside our shops\u201d. Sweden could not, she said, act as \u201cEurope\u2019s conscience\u201d. But Stockholms Stadsmission, a Christian social organisation working with vulnerable people in the capital, condemned the move. Fanny Siltberg, a spokesperson, said: \u201cTo ban begging, or to require permission to beg, is just shifting the problem in a futile attempt to outlaw poverty.\u201d She added: \u201cInstead, we believe that this group\u2019s vulnerability can be reduced through structural poverty reduction and work against discrimination \u2013 both in home countries and within the EU. It is long-term work. In the meantime, society needs to take responsibility, for example offering paths into the workplace and housing market and in that way reduce the social vulnerability of these people.\u201d Aida Samani, the deputy legal director of the human rights organisation Civil Rights Defenders, said the government could face legal action if it goes ahead with the proposal. \u201cIt is remarkable that the government is prioritising this in a situation that they themselves describe as a crisis of organised and violent crime,\u201d she said. \u201cThen there is the question of the lawfulness of a ban. As far as I can see a national ban on begging would most likely not be lawful.\u201d Banning begging, she added, would contravene the right to a private life and freedom of expression as expressed in the European convention on human rights, enshrined in the Swedish constitution. The government said that begging has risen in Sweden since the early 2010s. Samani, however, questioned the extent to which begging is a problem for the country.. Civil Rights Defenders said it would be monitoring the situation and could mount a legal challenge if it becomes law. The proposed begging ban is part of an overall shift towards \u201cmore oppressive policies\u201d in criminal and migration policy, Samani said, and of \u201cdisregarding human rights and freedoms\u201d. The proposal, which has been in the works since the formation of the government two years ago, has already caused disagreement within the coalition of the Moderates, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats. Anna Starbrink, a Liberal MP, wrote on Facebook: \u201cI will not contribute to the introduction of such a ban. Of course, measures are needed to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable people. But people in need cannot be forbidden from asking for help.\u201d The Sweden Democrats provide outside support to the government.",

She had a role in the Biden administration to look into addressing the root causes of migration to the US, including safety and economic turmoil in Central American countries.</p> <p>Second, she did not \u201cundo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> executive actions\u201d. Presidents sign executive orders, and she was not president. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> did reverse some Trump executive orders on the border. He initially kept in place Trump-era restrictions known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/11/what-is-title-42-explainer-immigration\">Title 42</a>, which allowed the US to turn away immigrants at the border on the grounds of preventing the spread of Covid-19, before eventually lifting them.</p> <h2><strong>Vance on Trump\u2019s role on January 6</strong></h2> <p>Vance defended Trump\u2019s role on the day of the insurrection at the US Capitol. The Ohio senator picked out one line of his running mate\u2019s speech on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach\">6 January 2021 </a>\u2013 prior to the insurrection.</p> <p>According to Vance, Trump \u201csaid on January 6 the protesters ought to protest peacefully\u201d.</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly encouraged supporters to \u201cfight\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe fight like hell. And if you don\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/02/trump-capitol-riot-powder-keg-impeachment-prosecutors\">fight like hell</a>, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore,\u201d Trump said in 2021.</p> <h2><strong>Vance on Trump and the Affordable Care Act</strong></h2> <p>Vance claimed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> bolstered or salvaged the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>That\u2019s not true.</p> <p>The former president cut millions in funding for helping people enroll in healthcare, repeatedly supported efforts in Congress to repeal the law and asked the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court\">supreme court</a> to overturn the law.</p> <h2><strong>Vance on immigrants and housing prices</strong></h2> <p>Vance twice implicated immigrants in driving up housing prices, though when pressed, agreed that immigration was not the \u201conly\u201d contributor.</p> <p>A nonpartisan analysis found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/03/trump-mass-deportations-detention-camps-military-migrants\">Trump\u2019s vow of mass deportation</a> would drive up prices in several sectors and affect the availability of labor. The Peterson Institute for International Economics projects that the policy would be \u201ca major shock to the US economy, with substantial disruption across all sectors, especially agriculture, mining, and manufacturing\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Vance on Trump\u2019s position on abortion</strong></h2> <p>Vance said that Donald Trump has supported states making their own abortion laws.</p> <p>Vance claimed that Trump has said that \u201cthe proper way to handle this \u2026 is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy\u201d. </p> <p>That\u2019s not quite right.

      "bodyText": "Tim Walz and JD Vance faced each other for the first and only vice-presidential debate of this election cycle \u2013 and clashed on issues including abortion, childcare, the cost of living and Trump\u2019s 2020 election claims. Here are the facts on some of the false or misleading claims offered during Tuesday\u2019s vice-presidential debate. Vance on Harris\u2019s record as \u2018border tsar\u2019 Vance attacked Harris\u2019s record on the border. \u201cThe only thing that she did when she became the vice-president, when she became the appointed border tsar, was to undo Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border,\u201d he said. This contains inaccuracies. First, Harris was never a \u201cborder tsar\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s a term invented by her critics. She had a role in the Biden administration to look into addressing the root causes of migration to the US, including safety and economic turmoil in Central American countries. Second, she did not \u201cundo Donald Trump executive actions\u201d. Presidents sign executive orders, and she was not president. Joe Biden did reverse some Trump executive orders on the border. He initially kept in place Trump-era restrictions known as Title 42, which allowed the US to turn away immigrants at the border on the grounds of preventing the spread of Covid-19, before eventually lifting them. Vance on Trump\u2019s role on January 6 Vance defended Trump\u2019s role on the day of the insurrection at the US Capitol. The Ohio senator picked out one line of his running mate\u2019s speech on 6 January 2021 \u2013 prior to the insurrection. According to Vance, Trump \u201csaid on January 6 the protesters ought to protest peacefully\u201d. But Trump also repeatedly encouraged supporters to \u201cfight\u201d. \u201cWe fight like hell. And if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore,\u201d Trump said in 2021. Vance on Trump and the Affordable Care Act Vance claimed that Donald Trump bolstered or salvaged the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s not true. The former president cut millions in funding for helping people enroll in healthcare, repeatedly supported efforts in Congress to repeal the law and asked the supreme court to overturn the law. Vance on immigrants and housing prices Vance twice implicated immigrants in driving up housing prices, though when pressed, agreed that immigration was not the \u201conly\u201d contributor. A nonpartisan analysis found that Trump\u2019s vow of mass deportation would drive up prices in several sectors and affect the availability of labor. The Peterson Institute for International Economics projects that the policy would be \u201ca major shock to the US economy, with substantial disruption across all sectors, especially agriculture, mining, and manufacturing\u201d. Vance on Trump\u2019s position on abortion Vance said that Donald Trump has supported states making their own abortion laws. Vance claimed that Trump has said that \u201cthe proper way to handle this \u2026 is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy\u201d. That\u2019s not quite right. Donald Trump declined to say whether he would sign a national abortion ban during the last debate. Walz on Project 2025\u2019s ambitions The Minnesota governor claimed that Project 2025, the ambitious blueprint from the Heritage Foundation to remake the federal government under a second Trump term, would require people to register their pregnancies. \u201cTheir Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies,\u201d Walz said. That claim is false. Project 2025 calls for a number of restrictive policies on abortion, including reversing FDA approval of abortion pills, rolling back privacy protections for abortion patients and increasing surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over abortion, but it does not call for all pregnant people to register. The CDC already collects information about abortion from most of the country, but its reports are incomplete, as some states do not supply the data. Project 2025 suggests that the CDC should go so far as to cut funds from a state if it does not tell the CDC \u201cexactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother\u2019s state of residence, and by what method\u201d. Vance on immigrants in Springfield, Ohio Referring to Springfield, Ohio \u2013 where a number of Haitian immigrants have recently settled \u2013 Vance referred to immigrants with legal status as \u201cillegal\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ve got schools that are overwhelmed, you\u2019ve got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you\u2019ve got housing that\u2019s totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,\u201d he said. The Haitian immigrants in Springfield, as CBS moderator Margaret Brennan noted, have legal status. Their arrival, local residents and leaders have said, has helped revive the town, which has lost a quarter of its population since the 1960s. Vance on the climate crisis and manufacturing The Ohio senator has repeatedly expressed skepticism about the reality that carbon emissions have caused global heating. Tonight, he was a bit subtle: \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions, this idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change \u2026 let\u2019s just say that\u2019s true, just for the sake of argument.\u201d Despite Vance\u2019s skepticism, it is indeed true. One hundred percent of global heating since 1950 is due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Vance also took viewers on a circuitous journey to suggest that if Harris really cared about the climate crisis, she would bring back manufacturing jobs to the US. Carbon emissions, whether they are manufactured in the US or overseas, contribute to global heating. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \u2013 the Biden administration\u2019s landmark climate legislation \u2013 is greatly aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacturing.
